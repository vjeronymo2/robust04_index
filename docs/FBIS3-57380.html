Shkil pointed out that "if some people lack  action, words are brought to the fore, and affairs like this one  arise." The UNA regional commander underlined: "When Mykhaylo  Boychyshyn was still Shevchenkivskyy Rayon Council chairman in  Lvov he had certain connections that could be the motives behind  his disappearance" and added that "we cannot rule out that in a  day or two Boychyshyn will emerge safe and sound, and will tell  tales about his kidnapping." Boychyshyn's wife's televised  appeal gave this idea to Shkil because "one had the impression  that she had recently seen her husband." UNA Chairman Yuriy  Shukhevych said: "Mykhaylo Boychyshyn is not an outstanding Rukh  activist. Why has there been no similar actions against  Vyacheslav Chornovil?" The UNA leadership believes that  Boychyshyn's mysterious disappearance might be linked to Rukh's  financial activities.    Meanwhile, according to a report by Maryana Chorna published  in Lvov's RATUSHA on 22 January, the newspaper had received  "unsubstantiated information from law enforcement circles" that  Mykhaylo Boychyshyn's dead body had been discovered.</p>

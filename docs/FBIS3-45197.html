Take a look at the just-published Elite magazine, one of the  handful of cultural products churned out since mid-1989 by some  of the nation's best -- and most open-minded -- brains.    Founders of, and contributors to the journal include such  big  names as former People's Daily [RENMIN RIBAO] editor Qin Chuan;  former culture minister Wang Meng; avant-garde economists Yu  Guangyuan and Wu Jinglian; liberal elders Li Rui and Xia Yan;  and taboo-smashing writers Shao Yanxiang and Zhang Kangkang.    The founders waged a fruitless battle for nearly a year to  secure for Elite, which is intended as an unofficial, general  interest journal, a publication licence and a shuhao (book or  periodical number). The problem was partly solved when the  magazine became a semi- dependent entity under the China  Strategic and Management Research Society, a quasi-official unit  in which Mr Qin's son is a senior staffer. Elite was granted a  temporary shuhao. The censors indicated proper registration  would only be considered after a few trial issues. The 3,000  copies of the inaugural issue, however, could not be circulated  nationwide through the regular distribution network. Most ended  up being handed out by the editors as gifts to fellow  intellectuals. This is despite the inordinate precautions taken  not to run foul of the remnant Maoists running the Propaganda  Department and assorted units. The first page of Elite carries  a giant photograph of Deng Xiaoping.    In an inaugural message, Mr Qin cites the patriarch's name  four times saying Elite "is willing to make propaganda for Deng  Thought." And while a few of the articles in the first issue  touched on hot issues such as privatisation and the assessment  of Chairman Mao, none was deemed controversial or provocative.    While, on the economic arena, the Chinese Communist Party  seems to be liberalising on all fronts, in the cultural field it  is very much a case of making a hundred flowers wilt.    For fear of rocking the boat in the uncertain period before  patriarch Deng Xiaoping's final departure from the scene, the  Propaganda Department and its ideological police are taking no  chances. Since mid-1993, the department has practically stopped  giving permits for new newspapers, periodicals and publishing  houses. Worst hit are bourgeois-liberal intellectuals who often  are unable to have their works published--despite there having  been no regulation barring them from appearing in print.    For some strange reason, the Beijing Yanshan Publishing  House  recently held up the distribution of its series of books  entitled Life after 60. What apparently went awry was that two  volumes of the autobiographical pieces contain retrospectives  penned by liberal authors Wang Ruoshui and Hu Jiwei, both former  journalists with the People's Daily.    The editor of the series, Zhou Airuo, the son of Marxist  scholar Zhou Yang, has reportedly parted ways with the  publisher. Late last year, the authorities also put pressure on  an American foundation to withdraw financial support from a team  led by Beijing University legal scholar Gong Xiangrui.  Professor Gong has been trying to put out a series of  monographs on the constitutional history of Asian countries,  including China.    For a brief period last summer intellectuals in Beijing were  pinning their hopes on the "new blood" from Shanghai that  President Jiang Zemin had transferred to Beijing. These  Shanghai faction affiliates include the vice-chief editor of  People's Daily, Zhou Ruijin, the vice-chief of propaganda, Gong  Xinhan, and the vice- chief of the Theoretical Bureau of the  Propaganda Department, Li Junru.    Mr Zhou, a former editor with Shanghai's Liberation Daily,  helped draft the series of articles of radical reform that  appeared in early 1991 under the pen-name of Huang Puping, a  shorthand for "Deng Xiaoping speaking out at Huangpu River (in  Shanghai)".    Since his migration to Beijing however, Mr Zhou's more  liberal colleagues have complained about his timidity. One  story doing the rounds of the party mouthpiece said Mr Zhou  consulted the Propaganda Department on whether to include the  name of the editor of a volume that was featured in the Daily's  book news column.    The tome in question, Changing Our Brains -- which is based  on a 1992 slogan attributed to Mr Deng is edited by liberal  elder Yu Guangyuan. The transfer of Mr Gong and Mr Li to the  Propaganda Department was at first interpreted as an attempt to  neutralise the influence of veteran Maoists such as the  executive vicechief of Propaganda, Xu Weicheng.    Both Shanghai faction stalwarts however, have adopted the  lowest of profiles. Mr Li has reportedly not even begun a  regular work shift at the department.    Mr Xu, who is supposed to have retired last year, is very  much in charge. He, together with the relatively conservative  head of the department, Ding Guangen, is expected to call a  national conference on propaganda later this month to impose an  even harsher straitjacket on media and cultural units.    Since late 1993, Mr Ding, who used to play bridge with  patriarch Deng, has ordered the People's Daily to fax him the  proofs of its major editorial pages every night. And Mr Xu and  his like-minded commissars have lately begun a virtual purge of  the Hong Kong contents of the electronic media.    In a talk to staff of the Ministry of Radio, Film and  Television, Mr Xu, once a protege of Madame Jiang Qing,  indicated state television and radio stations should largely  weed out songs and videos by or featuring Hong Kong and Taiwan  artists.    When asked what they should play instead, the ideologue  said:  "The 100 patriotic movies or their theme songs," which are being  featured on television and broadcasts. Mr Xu was referring to  the 100 mostly old films the Propaganda Department had selected  for their "patriotic and socialist" orientation.    While disparaging Hong Kong cultural products for their  "bourgeois-liberal propensities", the propaganda machinery has  also run a campaign of innuendo on how Hong Kong and Taiwan  singers and movie stars have allegedly evaded taxes.    Under the guise of reviving patriotic education and  remembering Chairman Mao, the Propaganda Department has  reinstated a large number of products of the Cultural  Revolution, including "model revolutionary" operas and songs  favoured by the Gang of Four.</p>

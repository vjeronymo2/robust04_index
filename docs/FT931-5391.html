			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / International Company News: Row may hit Greencore restructure A GROWING row in the Republic of Ireland over the sale of the government's remaining 30.4 per cent stake in Greencore, the sugar and foods company, now looks increasingly likely to have a significant bearing on whether GPA, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, succeeds in a debt restructuring package with its banks to whom it owes Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.87bn). With encouragement from the Greencore board, the US food conglomerate ADM, last month made a IPounds 66m offer, equivalent to IPounds 2.60 per share, for the government's Greencore stake. But under political pressure, the government this week decided to open up the sale to other offers with the express intention of trying to find an Irish buyer. Mr Gerry Murphy, the Greencore chief executive, says that he does not believe such a move is in the best interests of the company and that the board 'will do everything in its power to ensure that our ability to pursue our stated strategy is at least safeguarded and hopefully enhanced, by the ultimate ownership of the government's stake'. Without naming ADM, Mr Murphy said that the board had found a 'long-term partner with similar and complementary long-term . . . (which) apart from supporting the group with capital for development, would bring unparalleled access to world class technology in our core business, global market intelligence and distribution capability'. He said the move had 'the full support of the board following months of preparatory work' and added that 'the board does not believe that any potential Irish investor could bring the same benefits to the group in our drive to become a more significant and more successful Irish-based international food company'. Mr Joe Walsh, the agriculture minister, confirmed this week that the offer had come from ADM. It is likely that the Greencore board will now seek institutional shareholder support to block any government sale of which it does not approve, under the company's articles of association. Any shareholder taking more than a 15 per cent stake in the company requires shareholder approval. The problem for the government is that the sale of IPounds 150m of government assets is a key factor in this year's Budget arithmetic, and upon it hinges the government's ability to rescue Aer Lingus, the state-run airline which is in the process of sorting out its own major financial difficulties. Aer Lingus is a major shareholder in GPA and along with GPA's other shareholders is being called upon to subscribe to a new USDollars 200m preference share issue by the aircraft leasing group. The issue is seen as the company's last chance to avoid the banks taking over effective control. Aer Lingus, however, is unlikely to be in a position to subscribe to the issue without government finance.</p>

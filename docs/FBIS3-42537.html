			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lev Kamanin, candidate of technical sciences, </F> docent, and instructor at the Military Air Academy imeni N. Ye.  Zhukovskiy, under the rubric "Documents": "Theft in Orbit, Or  How Our `Space Achievements' Are Being Put Onto the World  Market"; figure of possible configuration of international  station not reproduced here]    [Text] The crisis situation in our aerospace industry,  which has been cast to the whims of fate by the Russian  government, is approaching a point beyond which its resurrection  will, in the near future, be impossible. We're reassured by the  fact that the Russian Space Agency, in attempting to avert an  impending catastrophe, has managed some big successes in the  commercialization of that most important sector of the  military-industrial complex.    According to the American-Russian agreement that has been  adopted, Russia, until the end of the century, can conclude no  more than one contract a year for the launch of geostationary  satellites, whereas contracts for the launch of low-orbit  satellites must be examined on a case-by-case basis. U.S.  businessmen are taking care of Russia's revenues: the payout for  each commercial launch of the Proton vehicle cannot be lower  than 92.5 percent of the price asked for similar launches by  U.S. or Western European companies.    U.S. congressmen and representatives are playing the role of  "good patrons," supposedly defending Russian interests against  the encroachments of the "bad Western European merchants." The  latter guys, of course, are not ecstatic about the attempts of  the "Russian agency" to enter the "trade ranks" on the world  space market. But the Americans, in turn, are concerned about  the considerable share held by Western Europe in the revenues  from commercial launches of satellites, while, in their view,  their own share is small (at 35 percent). That is why the United  States is striving to dictate its own strict requirements for  the conclusion of trade deals to its new competitors, as well as  to its old competitors. Assistant U.S. Commissioner for Trade  Peter Olzier [Olzhiyer] declared this: "Representatives of  Western Europe are trying to coordinate an agreement that  determines such rules (essentially, fettering for Russia and  other potential competitors -- L. Kaminin), with simplification  of the procedure for producing with them sanctions of the  American government against launches."    What kinds of revenues are stipulated for us in that  agreement? Russian Space Agency director Yuriy Koptev says that  participation in commercial launches of launch vehicles and the  sale of aerospace hardware will being Russia no less than  $200-220 million a year. Is that a lot? We know that in 1992,  the worldwide total for revenues from the commercial use of  space hardware reached $13.2 billion. With that, the revenues  from the use of launchers did not exceed $1.2 billion, that is,  10 percent of the total revenues. That means that the country  that was the first to open the path to space will be allowed to  receive for offering its launchers no more than one-sixtieth of  the worldwide total of "space revenues." And that until the end  of the century.    Against the backdrop of that "space theft" announced  beforehand, the ultimatum presented by the United States to  Russia in connection with the contract concluded in 1991 for the  delivery to India of cryogenic motors for a measly $2 million  simply pales. And yet it is in force. True, that was only after,  in exchange for refusing the little blue bird in the hand -- the  agreement to "freeze" the contract with India -- they promised  us the crane in the sky: they promised to better the chances of  Russia to participate in the building of the Freedom orbital  station.    President Clinton approved a limit of $10.5 billion for the  spending associated with the creation of the Freedom station up  to the end of the 20th century. Russian Prime Minister V.  Chernomyrdin, as he was departing recently for talks in the  United States, announced that the participation of Russia in the  realization of the Freedom project will enable the Americans to  "earn" more than $2 billion. The prime minister was modestly  quiet about how much we would earn. Either he was hiding that  intentionally, or he didn't know what we would earn.    But in the words of Yu. Koptev, we will be paid $600-700  million for the help Russia will give the United States in  building the station. We should note that if a joint three-way  project is adopted, a good half of the station modules will be  units being developed for our future Mir-2 station, whereas the  American laboratory will take up no more than one-fourth of the  total space of the structure.    Why, we ask, do we place such a low price on our labor and  our scientific and technical achievements? After all, the  minimum cost of the American "quarter" of the future station is  estimated by U.S. specialists to be $10.5 billion, whereas the  Russian "half," if we are to believe our prime minister, is only  $2 billion, which is saved by the Americans as a result of the  use of Mir-2 units. And why, if we are to believe Mr. Koptev,  will we be able to get only a third of that clearly understated  amount?    You arrive at some uncomfortable conclusions. Neither the  Western European wholesale space merchants, nor our transoceanic  patrons are really burning with the desire to have another  competitor on the "free and uncontrolled" market for space  technologies and services. And that's why, in the discussion of  joint plans and programs of cooperation in space, they're  addressing us not as equal partners, but as poor relatives  patiently awaiting the next pittance from a bar stool.</p>

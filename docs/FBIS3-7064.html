The accord was reached during a meeting between Japanese  International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai and  his South Korean counterpart Kim Chol-su, who is accompanying  President Kim Yong-sam on his three-day visit to Japan from  Thursday.    The joint program will feature acceptance by Japanese  companies of South Korean trainees and dispatch of technological  experts from Japan to South Korea. This is regarded as an  effort to nurture small-sized South Korean companies,  particularly "supporting" industries such as components makers,  an official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI) told a news conference.    Under the accord, to be endorsed at Saturday's meeting  between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Kim, Seoul will  provide business incentives to South Korean parts makers through  tax reforms and financial systems, the MITI briefer said. He  said the program will be formulated so that it can be officially  announced on May 26 when Kumagai and his South Korean  counterpart meet again.    During Thursday's meeting between Kumagai and Kim, Tokyo and  Seoul also agreed to cooperate on standards and certificates of  industrial products and in insurance fields, the MITI official  said.</p>

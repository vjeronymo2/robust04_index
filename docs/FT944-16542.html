			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Opposition arrest in Nigeria Military authorities have arrested a senior leader of Nigeria's main opposition group Nadeco after the police raided his Lagos hideout, the group said yesterday, Reuter reports from Lagos. 'Mr Ayo Opadokun, patriotic and energetic general secretary of Nadeco, has been arrested and taken to (an) unspecified location after his house and temporary refuge had been broken into and sacked,' Nadeco said. Nadeco is an alliance of politicians, retired senior military officers and pro-democracy activists backing the detained politician Moshood Abiola, undeclared winner of last year's annulled presidential election. Chief Abiola is on trial for alleged treason for declaring himself president in defiance of Nigeria's military rulers.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building &amp; Construction (2): Shift to the east - Cross-border links THE DECISION to remove barriers to free trade between European Community countries at the end of this year has prompted a spate of cross-border mergers and stakes among European contractors. French and German companies have been some of the biggest spenders. But recently, German and French sights have been more focused on making acquisitions and stake-building in former communist countries of eastern and central Europe. British contractors, faced with a big upsurge in work in the UK in the 1980s, were slow off the mark to make cross-border purchases. They also faced difficulties in finding opportunities in the more closed German and French markets. But latterly, British construction companies have stepped up their attempts to gain a foothold in continental European markets. Spanish companies have also been making cross-border purchases. Two of Spain's biggest civil engineering groups, Cubiertas and Entrecanales, last summer paid Pounds 24m for a 21.5 per cent stake in Lilley, the Glasgow-based construction group. The stake was acquired by Tibest Tres, a company jointly owned by the two Spanish contractors. Lilley, in return, paid Pounds 8.35m to acquire 2 per cent of Cubiertas, a public works specialist. Lilley and its Spanish partners are currently bidding jointly to build part of the Pounds 1.7bn Jubilee underground line extension in London. The desire to make cross-border acquisitions has been driven as much the advent of the EC single market as by the need for contractors to find new work opportunities and to protect themselves from cyclical downturns in domestic markets. In the latest recession construction markets in continental Europe held up for longer and much better than in the UK and US where output has fallen steeply since the late 1980s. But not every acquisition has been a success. Some German and French companies have had a lean time of it since buying into British groups. Their investments have fallen sharply in value while there is little evidence that these strategic alliances have led to contract opportunities. Thus Hochtief, the west German contractor, acquired a 25 per cent stake in Rush &amp; Tompkins only to see the British construction and property company go into receivership. Parts of its contracting business were then acquired by Hochtief and Ballast Needham, a Dutch contractor bought by British Aerospace in 1987. Philipp Holzmann, of Germany, is typical of European contractors which have acquired stakes in other EC companies in the hope that this would open the door for more work. It owns outright or holds strategic stakes in Austrian, British, Dutch, French and Spanish companies, including a 20 per cent stake in Tilbury Douglas, the UK contractor and developer, which owns the former Chrysler car factory at Linwood in Scotland. Tilbury, Holzmann and Girozentrale, an Austrian bank, have formed a joint venture to redevelop the Chrysler site. Tilbury separately has formed a joint venture with Holzmann and Jotsa, a Spanish contractor of which Holzmann owns 50 per cent to build a 370,000 sq ft industrial and office development south of Madrid. Mr Alan Cockshaw, chairman of Amec, the British construction and engineering group, says companies which want to work in overseas markets need to have a strong local base to stand any chance of winning profitable contracts. Companies operating in overseas markets without local knowledge and experience run the risk of being 'ripped off', he says. Amec recently bought a 50 per cent stake in Kittelberger, a German building and civil engineering group. It also holds a 20 per cent stake in Serete, France's leading independent design engineering and construction management group. Companies wishing to gain a local presence in European markets have three routes to choose from: Forming individual joint ventures with local companies on a project-by-project basis. This involves no long-term financial commitment but does not generate any extra business other than the job in hand. Acquiring an existing business outright. This can be costly and difficult. Contractors rely on the local knowledge and skills of their staff. These may leave if their company is subject to a contested bid from a foreign predator. Acquiring strategic stakes. This has been the favoured route of German and French companies, with cross-holdings in each other to cement trading relationships and as a defence against takeover bids. British and Italian companies which dislike minority investments in companies where they have no control have been mistrustful of this route. And the complex share structures of German and French contractors have made it hard for foreign companies to buy into these markets. Shares of the big five German contractors - Holzmann, Hochtief, Bilfinger, Strabag and Dywidag - are tightly held by each other or by banks. There are large crossholdings among French contractors. The British market, by comparison, is much more open. There are many medium-sized contractors whose shares can be bought readily on the stock market. British companies, because of their vulnerability to takeover moves, have to consider the impact on their share price of any acquisition which could dilute profits in the short term. This makes it difficult for them to justify overseas purchases where these appear to dilute rather than enhance earnings. Continental companies, because of their ownership structure, can take a longer-term view of acquisitions. Attitudes, however, are changing. British contractors such as Amec and John Brown, part of Trafalgar House, the construction, property and shipping group, have bought stakes in continental European companies. Attention is shifting eastwards as companies try to break into the construction-hungry markets of Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Watch this space.</p>

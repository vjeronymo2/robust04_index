			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELICOPTER CRASH FOILS DRUG SMUGGLER'S PRISON ESCAPE  </P> <P> A helicopter swooped inside a prison yard near here on Monday and a marijuana  smuggler with a life sentence leaped aboard, but the breakout was foiled when  the chopper hit a fence and crashed.  </P> <P> Instead of a flight to freedom, Ben Kramer -- once a world champion powerboat  racer -- received a fractured ankle. His novice pilot, identified as Charles  Clayton Stevens, broke both of his legs.  </P> <P> "They gave it a try, but they sure made a mess of it," said John Clark, warden  at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center, southwest of Miami.  </P> <P> This is what happened during the dreary, overcast morning, prison officials  said. Kramer, 34, was out for a walk in the recreation yard. Only about half a  dozen other inmates were nearby, playing cards or shooting baskets.  </P> <P> The helicopter appeared from the south, hugging the tree line. It lowered  inside the perimeter. It was a tight squeeze. The yard is but 50 feet across.  </P> <P> The small two-seater hovered inches from the ground. Kramer made his run, then  grasped one of the skids. But when the aircraft tried to lift away, it suddenly  listed to the right.  </P> <P> One of the rotors tangled in the concertina wire that curls above the 14-foot  fence. The rotor split, and chunks of blade flew hundreds of feet.  </P> <P> For a time, the helicopter teetered in the mesh, like a fly caught in a spider  web. Then it finally fell, face down.  </P> <P> Two inmates got to the crash first. Some witnesses, according to Clark, say  these other prisoners were actually trying to join the escape.  </P> <P> "But the main version -- and I believe this one -- is that they were trying to  help," Clark said. "Obviously, too many people weren't going to get away in a  two-seater."  </P> <P> In minutes, armed guards circled the area. Fuel leaked from the aircraft. A few  prison officials ran toward the wreckage.  </P> <P> Larry Bullard was among them. "Ooh, that pilot was moaning," he said. "He was  yelling about the pain: 'Oh, my side' and 'Oh, my legs.' "  </P> <P> The prison has nearly 1,000 inmates. About 100 are classified as low-security  and are used as a work force. Most of the rest are awaiting trial or placement  in another facility.  </P> <P> Kramer was being kept in a special high-security area. He was soon to stand  trial on a marijuana-smuggling charge in Ft. Lauderdale. He was already locked  up for life with no chance of parole.  </P> <P> Last October, he and auto racer Randy Lanier were convicted of masterminding a  drug ring that distributed more than half a million pounds of marijuana  nationwide from 1980 to 1987.  </P> <P> During those same years, the brash, hot-tempered Kramer also was becoming a  champion powerboat driver, steering in ocean races at speeds of 120 m.p.h. "He  was an aggressive, very competitive guy," said another racer, Bob Kaiser.  </P> <P> Kramer won the U.S. Open Class Offshore Powerboat Championship in 1986 and the  world title in 1984. He also owned a Miami marina and boat works.  </P> <P> "I'm sorry to say he has really put bad light on the sport, just like when  those pro football players get caught dealing drugs," racer John D'Elia said.  </P> <P> Kramer was brought to the correctional center from a federal prison at Ray  Brook, N.Y., in December to face another marijuana-smuggling indictment in Ft.  Lauderdale and a Miami gun charge on which he already has been convicted.  </P> <P> U.S. Marshal John Horgan said Kramer will also be charged with attempted  escape, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and the pilot  will face charges of aiding an escape.  </P> <P> Late Monday, U.S. Marshals were still trying to find out how Kramer made a  connection with Stevens, the pilot -- and if anyone else was involved. Stevens  took his lessons at a small private airport outside Miami. He told his  instructors he wanted to be a crop-duster.  </P> <P> He "had taken flying lessons just over the past five-six months, and he really  wasn't an experienced enough pilot yet to attempt this kind of thing," said  Darrell Williams, of the marshal's office.  </P> <P> Stevens is believed to be from Oregon, Williams said. In fact, the Bell 47D-1  helicopter, built in 1952, was reported sold in January to C. Stevens of  Oregon, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.  </P> <P> Using a helicopter as an escape vehicle has now been tried with varying success  more than a dozen times.  </P> <P> One effort, involving a love story, was made into a recent TV movie, "Outside  Woman." Another incident, in Mexico, inspired the 1975 movie "Breakout."  </P> <P> Most prisons have contingency plans to deal with helicopter escapes.  </P> <P> "I won't tell you everything, but if we have a clear shot at an inmate  boarding, we'll take the shot," Clark said.  </P> <P> "But there are all sorts of other problems where discretion is advised. What  can you do if the helicopter pilot is a civilian hostage who has been hijacked?  It gets tricky.  </P> <P> "Fortunately, in this case, it all sort of worked itself out on its own."  </P></p>

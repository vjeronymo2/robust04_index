			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : PLAN STUDIED FOR CLEANUP AFTER MAGNESIUM  FIRE  </P> <P> Health and environmental officials were working Wednesday on a plan to clean up  residue from the magnesium fire that gutted a metal-processing plant Tuesday in  the City of Industry.  </P> <P> The magnesium, used in the manufacture of automobile and airplane parts, poses  no immediate danger to people in the area because it is pasted on the rubble  and not blowing, said Anthony L. Payne of the county Department Health  Services.  </P> <P> Magnesium can irritate the throat and lungs if it is inhaled, he said.  </P> <P> Fire officials were still investigating the cause of the fire, which caused  $1.3 million in damage to Mark Metals Inc.  </P> <P> Owner Mark Valle said employees were cleaning up after cutting some magnesium  when an electrical short started the blaze in the back of the building. On  Wednesday, six employees were working outdoor telephones in front of the  charred building.  </P></p>

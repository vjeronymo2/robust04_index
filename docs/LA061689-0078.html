			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN ENVIRONMENTALIST FOR ALL SEASONS  </P> <P> Felicia Marcus lives only a block from the Santa Monica Bay, yet she rarely  gets over to see it. That's because she has been so busy trying to save it.  </P> <P> Marcus is an environmental activist and lawyer -- neither especially remarkable  on the issue-oriented Westside. But in addition to belonging to a myriad of  environmental groups, she is a founder of Heal the Bay, the burgeoning  volunteer organization that has successfully pressured the City of Los Angeles  to stop dumping sewage sludge into the ocean.  </P> <P> As a key strategist in Heal the Bay's ongoing campaign, Marcus has spearheaded  what is arguably one of the most effective grass-roots environmental campaigns  of the last two decades.  </P> <P> "Felicia is extraordinarily committed," says Jan Chatten-Brown, environmental  affairs assistant for Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, who has known Marcus for eight  years.  </P> <P> "I think she's had a significant role in Heal the Bay's success because of the  way she has chosen to pursue issues, combing through the existing laws that are  already on the books, persuading public officials to listen. She has given Heal  the Bay credibility by taking careful, analytical positions on the various  legal issues."  </P> <P> What Marcus emphasizes is an overview of systems. "Everything is connected --  if you throw something away, it goes somewhere," she comments. "Who we are as a  society depends on how we take care of things."  </P> <P> She is a particularly good example, say friends and associates, of the kind of  person who got involved in environmental issues long before it was trendy, and  who has done it the old-fashioned way: by learning what the Clean Water Act  really says, the structure and vulnerabilities of storm drain and sewer  systems, the real potentialities of recycling.  </P> <P> Board memberships give some indication of her depth of commitment: Coalition  for Clean Air, Environmental Quality Board, League of Conservation Voters and  National Estuary Program are only a few.  </P> <P> "I have breakfast meetings every day and evening meetings almost every night,  and I read when I get home, mostly environmental studies and engineering  reports," she said, adding ruefully, "I don't know when I last read a novel."  </P> <P> And all that is in her spare time -- outside her work. Marcus, who lives in  Venice, is director of litigation for Public Counsel, the Los Angeles County  and Beverly Hills bar associations' public-interest law firm -- the nation's  largest -- which provides legal services to the poor in areas ranging from  children's advocacy, immigration, civil rights and consumer issues, to housing  discrimination and homelessness. "It makes a nice balance," says Marcus, of her  ambitious two-part career. "I do get tired, running from one thing to another.  . . . But I know hundreds of interesting people. It gives me a lot in return."  </P> <P> And although neglect of the environment may have been the rule up to now,  Marcus thinks the tide is turning. "This is a great time to be an  environmentalist," she proclaims with characteristic optimism. "We can fix this  stuff!"  </P> <P> Sitting in her mid-Wilshire office -- a sea of paper, posters, files, cardboard  boxes and books -- Marcus, 33, apologized for serving coffee in a  non-biodegradable plastic foam cup ("I've been meaning to bring in some paper  cups") and talked about the particular challenges of being an environmentalist.  Her conversational style is disarming, spilling over with facts, figures, case  studies and philosophic reflections.  </P> <P> "It's not a clear issue, like race discrimination, where there are rights and  wrongs," she said. "It's a huge number of facts, and to be an effective  advocate, you have to know what you're talking about."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tedious Work  </P> <P> And despite a certain glamour to the idea of saving the air and water, the  reality is tedious plugging. (One of Marcus' working memberships is the Sewer  Limitation Ordinance Citizens Advisory Committee).  </P> <P> "You have to know how a recycling plant works and how a sewage treatment plants  works," she said. "It can bury you in paper work and meetings."  </P> <P> Furthermore, until recently, environmentalism didn't seem a very urgent or  especially compelling issue. While civil rights or the plight of the homeless  might provide passionate conversation at a dinner party, the primary screening  of sludge was hardly a topic to be introduced along with the coffee and  dessert.  </P> <P> In fact, it wasn't a topic that Marcus herself focused on when she began  thinking about a career. She grew up in the San Fernando Valley and graduated  from Birmingham High School. "It was the end of the '60s activism," she  recalls. "The students just behind us were more interested in sock hops. I was  a current-affairs person. I read all the newspapers and Time and Newsweek."  </P> <P> She went to Harvard, where, intrigued by China, she majored in East Asian  studies and learned to speak Chinese -- with the notion of being an influential  academic. "I was going to enlighten foreign-policy makers. I planned to write  important articles for Foreign Affairs journal, concentrating on Sino-Soviet  competition in the Third World, pulling all these things together. It was a  grand scheme."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Change of Plans  </P> <P> But after a year on a fellowship in Hong Kong, she decided it might not be  foreign policy that intrigued her, but just the intricacies of policy per se.  Maybe the domestic front offered more opportunity than foreign affairs.  </P> <P> That notion was confirmed when she went to work in the Washington office of  Rep. Tony Beilenson (D-Los Angeles).  </P> <P> When Beilenson needed a legislative aide to work on environmental affairs, she  "snapped it up," and was on her way. It was the late 1970s and the oil crises  of '74 and '79 had sparked a national interest in energy programs. Beilenson  was spending a lot of time on the Santa Monica Mountains, offshore oil drilling  and the Channel Islands National Park -- all issues Marcus found challenging  from a policy perspective.  </P> <P> "It's undeniably important and the trade-offs are fascinating in terms of how  to sensibly run our affairs. Look at the oil drilling battle that has gone on  and on, and the battle to figure out a sensible energy policy. It just gets to  the core of things."  </P> <P> She was fascinated by the intricacies of environmental problem-solving and the  discovery that solutions exist. "We have great environmental statutes on the  books -- the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. (But) I could see that law  school would be a necessary tool."  </P> <P> She went to New York University and specialized in environmental law, thus  joining a rather select community. "There just aren't that many people who like  to read EIRs (Environmental Impact Reports). I do -- it's fun, like a puzzle,  because it involves large-scale governmental decisions."  </P> <P> </P> <P> She Came West  </P> <P> She liked the East Coast life style, but in 1983 she came home because "the  things I care the most about are here." And she believed that, more than in an  Eastern city, "Los Angeles is a place where things can change. The government  is more open, we are moving from our first stage to our second stage."  </P> <P> She joined a small group on the Westside that was protesting a request by the  City of Los Angeles to continue dumping partially treated sewage into the Santa  Monica Bay (which sweeps from Palos Verdes to Malibu).  </P> <P> In 1985 they formed Heal the Bay. "There were six of us in Dorothy Green's  living room in Westwood," says Marcus. "It was a remarkable, caring group of  people with a common approach -- a willingness to dive into details and a  willingness to pound tables." Their timing was right -- the group has enjoyed  spectacular growth and recently passed the 6,000-member mark.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'She Jumped In'  </P> <P> Recalls Green, president of Heal the Bay: "Felicia was there at the very  inception and she jumped into it with both feet."  </P> <P> Heal the Bay joined in an EPA lawsuit against Los Angeles because the city was  in gross violation of the Clean Water Act. The pressure on the city and its  neglected sewage treatment plant took many other forms -- letter-writing, press  conferences, demonstrations at the beach after sewage spills and buckets of  sludge carried in protest to the Water Board meetings. Eventually Heal the Bay  was invited by the courts to monitor the city's 12-year cleanup plan.  </P> <P> Says Green: "Felicia wrote briefs, letters to the judge and helped to negotiate  with the city how best to fulfill their obligation. She has a remarkable legal  mind and an ability to synthesize technical and legal issues."  </P> <P> Marcus also gets high marks for diplomacy from L.A. Deputy Mayor Mike Gage. "I  first met Felicia in City Hall when she was representing Heal the Bay in a  meeting with our city engineers and sanitation folks. They were a bit on pins  and needles -- here was somebody who'd filed a suit against them. But even  though she was an advocate for her position, I felt she worked very well with  people theoretically on the other side. She was clear, cogent, insightful and  easy to work with. She defined the issues well and set the parameters for  resolution."  </P> <P> Marcus emphasizes the conciliatory approach. "You don't just go in shouting,  'Raw sewage is bad and you've got to stop pouring it into the bay!' You have to  understand the basic characteristics of the storm system and the sewage system.  You have to realize that everything that gets flushed down the toilet ends up  in the bay. You have to suggest solutions."  </P> <P> And, she added, you realize that your adversaries are not terrible people.  "Sanitation engineers don't go to school so they can preside over the  deterioration of waste systems. People can work together on these things."  </P> <P> Heal the Bay's brochures can now boast that no new sludge is going into the  ocean, that sewage is being fully treated, and that, while many more cleanup  measures are needed, a healthy start has been made.  </P> <P> And Marcus, who can vigorously rattle off the number of outlets in the city's  storm drain system and explain the need for pumping stations throughout the  sewage system (it's not an all-gravity flow system), says: "I can look at the  Santa Monica Bay and know we have made a difference."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unsung Dedication  </P> <P> Observers note that Marcus is one of a number of dedicated, unsung watchdogs  who are seeing a phenomenon many thought they never would -- popular opinion  coming around to their way of thinking.  </P> <P> "We wanted to create a political climate where it is appropriate to be an  environmentalist, and I think this is happening."  </P> <P> The old conventional wisdom -- that in Southern California you don't mess with  peoples' cars or their trash -- is no longer applicable, she maintains, ticking  off the evidence:  </P> <P>  -- "The City of Los Angeles is committed to the most ambitious recycling plan  in the country. That's astonishing!  </P> <P>  -- "The City of Los Angeles has enacted a sewer limitation ordinance, limiting  building permits. This would have seemed impossible just a few years ago, when  they were even denying the problem.  </P> <P>  -- "The City of Los Angeles voted to support air quality management."  </P> <P> So while others may bewail the deterioration of air and water in Southern  California, Marcus looks around and sees a "lot of newborn environmentalists  appearing all over the place.  </P> <P> "This is an interesting time for those of us who've been environmental  infrastructure nuts," she says. "It's like the time has come. With any kind of  social activism, you have to keep beating the drums for years and years, you  have to be there and not get disheartened. Now it's very exciting because the  public's consciousness is raised. They are starting to demand accountability.  </P> <P> "It's a good time to be an activist."  </P></p>

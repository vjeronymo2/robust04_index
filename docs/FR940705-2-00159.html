			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-g-(7). A double barrier shall be provided to separate male and female animals. Animal isolation barriers shall be sturdy and accessible for cleaning. Reproductive incapacitation may be used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-g-(8). The containment area shall be in accordance with state and Federal laws and animal care requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-g-(9). The life support system for the ventilated suit or head hood is equipped with alarms and emergency back-up air tanks. The exhaust air from the suit area shall be filtered by two sets of high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters installed in series or incinerated. A duplicate filtration unit, exhaust fan, and an automatically starting emergency power source shall be provided. The air pressure within the suit shall be greater than that of any adjacent area. Emergency lighting and communication systems shall be provided. A double-door autoclave shall be provided for decontamination of waste materials to be removed from the suit area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-g-(10). Needles and syringes shall be used only for parenteral injection and aspiration of fluids from laboratory animals and diaphragm bottles. Only needle-locking syringes or disposable syringe-needle units (i.e., needle is integral to the syringe) shall be used for the injection or aspiration of fluids containing organisms that contain recombinant DNA. Extreme caution shall be used when handling needles and syringes to avoid autoinoculation and the generation of aerosols during use and disposal. Following use, needles shall not be bent, sheared, replaced in the needle sheath or guard, or removed from the syringe. The needles and syringes shall be promptly placed in a puncture-resistant container and decontaminated, preferably by autoclaving, before discard or reuse. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-g-(11). An essential adjunct to the reporting-surveillance system is the availability of a facility for quarantine, isolation, and medical care of personnel with potential or known laboratory-associated illnesses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-g-(12). A biosafety manual shall be prepared or adopted. Personnel shall be advised of special hazards and required to read and follow instructions on practices and procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-g-(13). Vacuum lines shall be protected with high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters and liquid disinfectant traps. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;2. Animal Facilities (BL4&hyph;N)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;2-a. Animals shall be contained within an enclosed structure (animal room or equivalent) to minimize the possibility of theft or unintentional release and avoid arthropod access. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;2-b. The interior walls, floors, and ceilings shall be impervious to water and resistant to acids, alkalis, organic solvents, and moderate heat, to facilitate cleaning. Penetrations in these structures and surfaces (e.g., plumbing and utilities) shall be sealed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;2-c. Windows in the animal facility shall be closed, sealed, and breakage resistant (e.g., double-pane tempered glass or equivalent). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;2-d. An autoclave, incinerator, or other effective means to decontaminate animals and wastes shall be available, preferably within the containment area. If feasible, a double-door autoclave is preferred and should be positioned to allow removal of material from the containment area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;2-e. Access doors to the containment area shall be self-closing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;2-f. All perimeter joints and openings shall be sealed to form an arthropod-proof structure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;2-g. The BL4&hyph;N laboratory provides a double barrier to prevent the release of recombinant DNA containing microorganisms into the environment. Design of the animal facility shall be such that if the barrier of the inner facility is breached, the outer barrier will prevent release into the environment. The animal area shall be separated from all other areas. Passage through two sets of doors shall be the basic requirement for entry into the animal area from access corridors or other contiguous areas. Physical separation of the animal containment area from access corridors or other laboratories or activities shall be provided by a double-door clothes change room equipped with integral showers and airlock. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;2-h. A necropsy room shall be provided within the BL4&hyph;N containment area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;2-i. Liquid effluent from containment equipment, sinks, biological safety cabinets, animal rooms, primary barriers, floor drains, and sterilizers shall be decontaminated by heat treatment before being released into the sanitary system. Liquid wastes from shower rooms and toilets shall be decontaminated with chemical disinfectants or heat by methods demonstrated to be effective. The procedure used for heat decontamination of liquid wastes shall be monitored with a recording thermometer. The effectiveness of the heat decontamination process system shall be revalidated every 30 days with an indicator organism. Liquid wastes from the shower shall be chemically decontaminated using an Environmental Protection Agency-approved germicide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

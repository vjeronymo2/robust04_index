			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOHNSON'S OK PUTS ALL RAMS IN FOLD;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: TIGHT END AGREES TO A TWO-YEAR CONTRACT. HE COULD BE ACTIVATED  FOR SUNDAY'S GAME AT TAMPA BAY.  </P> <P> As was evident during Sunday's 36-24 loss to the Green Bay Packers, the Rams  need all the help they can get if they hope to revive their preseason  expectations and challenge for a Super Bowl appearance in January.  </P> <P> The season started too soon for this team, which has been hampered by holdouts  and injuries, but at least the Rams will travel on Friday to Tampa, Fla., with  a full contingent. Wednesday, tight end Damone Johnson, the team's final  holdout who had been out of camp 50 days, agreed to a two-year contract.  </P> <P> Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it's safe to say Johnson settled for  considerably less than the $1.1 million, two-year deal he had sought. The Rams  were offering $575,000 for two years.  </P> <P> "It was a compromise on both parts," Johnson said. "You know, they're happy  and, well, I'm playing again."  </P> <P> Johnson, a six-year veteran who attended Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, has been the  starting tight end the past two seasons, with 67 receptions for 498 yards and  11 touchdowns during that span.  </P> <P> The Rams will get a roster exemption for Johnson, and Coach John Robinson said  he will make a decision on Friday about activating Johnson for Sunday's game.  </P> <P> "Damone's a good receiver who understands the subtleties of getting open at the  tight end position," Robinson said after Wednesday's practice. "He was here  when this pass offense was put in.  </P> <P> "He looks big and fast and healthy. He caught two passes (in practice) and fell  down on both, but I think he's in pretty good shape."  </P> <P> Johnson, who last year held out until the day before the final exhibition game  and then played the entire regular-season opener at Atlanta, said he has been  working out by running in the park with his pit bull, Rock.  </P> <P> "It's been very frustrating since about the second week of camp on, but that's  part of the business," Johnson said. "If you want to be a football player, you  have to deal with the negotiation process."  </P> <P> Negotiating with the Rams' front office can often be a one-sided game of give  and take, but Johnson said a couple of recent phone conversations he had with  Jay Zygmunt, the Rams' senior vice president, were "pretty productive" and  provided the foundation for an agreement.  </P> <P> "Nobody wins when you start missing games," Johnson said. "I'm in the business  of playing football and it's bad business if I'm missing games.  </P> <P> "You never want to lose this much time, but some things you have to do for  yourself. At least I got a raise."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> One person in the Southland who isn't complaining about the heat these days is  Coach John Robinson. He hopes the weather will help prepare the Rams prepare  for the 90-degree, high-humidity conditions they are expected to face on Sunday  in Tampa Stadium. "I'm grateful we've had some heat here," Robinson said. "I  think we'll all get off the airplane not quite as much in shock. But (the  weather) is certainly an issue." Robinson said he plans to keep a close eye on  his players and rotate personnel. "Once you get overheated, when you get all  flushed like that, it's not a 'Give me five minutes and I'll be all right  thing,' " Robinson said. "It's more like 'Give me two hours in a cold shower.'  " . . . Robinson says running back Cleveland Gary, who missed the entire  exhibition schedule with a lower-back injury, will be a part of the game plan  against Tampa Bay. How, exactly, will he be used? "Interspersed in an organized  fashion with (Curt Warner and Gaston Green), catering to the one who's running  the best," Robinson said.  </P> <P> Tampa Bay Coach Ray Perkins says he doesn't think the Rams' loss to Green Bay  was indicative of anything beyond a shaky start. "They've had a lot of people  (holding) out of camp and a lot of injuries, but I think the Rams are one of  the top three or four teams in the league," Perkins said. "They probably have  the most weapons of any team in this league. Talk about the speed of their wide  receivers, tight ends and running backs, and put (Jim) Everett in there  surrounded by that big, good offensive line, (and) their offense is unlimited."  . . . Injury update: Tackle Jackie Slater (dislocated toe) and linebacker Mike  Wilcher (knee) are listed as questionable for Sunday. Cornerback Alfred Jackson  (hand), tackle Robert Cox (ribs), guard Joe Milinichik (thumb) and fullback  Buford McGee (hip) are probable.  </P></p>

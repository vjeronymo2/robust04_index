			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Technology: Skeletons come out of the closet - Aluminium makers are moving into the fast lane in the race to build car bodies An avalanche of new business for aluminium producers could be on the horizon. Hydro Aluminium of Norway's decision to start producing spaceframes  -skeleton-like car bodies - in Michigan, traditional heartland of the US automotive industry, is a hopeful sign for aluminium makers. Hydro's initiative follows that of Alcoa (Aluminium Company of America), the world's biggest aluminium group, which is setting up a Dollars 70m (Pounds 36m) plant to make aluminium car spaceframes at Soest, near Dusseldorf, in Germany. These will go into the new top-of-the-range Audi V8 car expected to be launched next year. Ivar Hafsett, president of Hydro Aluminium, says his company is converting an existing facility in Michigan and it will have one specific customer, but he will not identify the customer yet. However, the timing of the project fits in with the expected launch of the Impact electric vehicle which General Motors, the world's biggest automotive company, is to build at an annual rate of 10,000, starting next year. The Impact has been developed to meet California's requirements for some totally pollution-free cars. Hydro is part of Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest industrial group which is 51 per cent-owned by the state but is also quoted on several stock exchanges. It has a relatively long history of aluminium spaceframe development. Five years ago the Treser convertible sports car, with a Hydro spaceframe, almost went into production. Several pre-production prototypes had been built and Treser's Berlin factory was ready to start up when expected finance failed to materialise and the venture failed. Hydro expects better luck with the Ethos, a two-seater sports car using an aluminium spaceframe, a body of fully recyclable thermoset plastic panels and a three-cylinder, two-stroke Orbital engine. This was the result when Pininfarina of Italy set out to design a car that was fun to drive, environmentally friendly, safe and not too expensive for the younger motorist. It is scheduled to go into production in Turin in 1995. With Porsche of Germany, Hydro is also developing another small-volume sports car which is expected to be on the market in the mid-1990s. Work so far indicates that, by starting from scratch with an aluminium spaceframe, a manufacturer can cut the weight of a car's 'body-in-white' (the unpainted structure before any components are fitted) by 40 per cent compared with a conventional steel sheet structure but achieve the same performance. As the car's suspension, brakes, wheels, engine and gearbox can also be scaled down because of this initial weight saving, most engineers agree that the total weight of a car can be reduced by 20 per cent. The Pininfarina Ethos, for example, is 3.63 metres long but weighs only 700 kg. The full advantage of aluminium spaceframe technology can only be realised by starting with a blank sheet. Aluminium can be made competitive with steel, a much cheaper material, because the number of components required can be cut by half. This reduces capital, tooling, labour, stock and other costs. On top of this the car has corrosion protection, recyclability, a shorter development time, greater styling flexibility and can be built in a smaller assembly plant. No wonder, then, that there are several spaceframe concepts being evaluated by supplier-manufacture teams, apart from those involving Hydro and Alcoa. Alcan of Canada has chosen to build its spaceframe of sheet aluminium. This technology is being used by Jaguar in its XJ220, for the Ferrari 512GT America coupe and in some Bertone sports cars. Alcan also provided some of its technology when Honda was developing the NSX sports car. Like GM with its Impact, BMW's M-Technik offshoot is using an alu-minium spaceframe in its prototype electric vehicle for California; and Toyota's AXV-1V concept car has a structural frame of aluminium. Nevertheless, according to Hafsett, the aluminium industry still has a great deal of work ahead before it can achieve the final breakthrough - the use of the technology in mass-produced cars. At present aluminium spaceframes are suitable only for relatively small-volume models, produced at a rate of no more that 100,000 a year. Much will depend on another project in which Hydro is involved - the FFr360m (Pounds 37m) Mosaic venture with Renault. This is part of the Eureka programme in which European car producers and their suppliers have joined together to do some basic research. 'Our decade will see a lot of spaceframe-based experimental cars and cars made in small volumes. The ultimate breakthrough to mass-produced cars will have to wait until the next century,' says Hafsett.</p>

			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (2): Radical changes needed to achieve export growth - The Economy THE OUTLOOK for the Indian economy contains one unex- pectedly bright feature and some disquieting ones. The most positive feature is that a year after the country came close to defaulting on its foreign debt repayments, the foreign exchange reserves had climbed by end-April to an unexpectedly high Dollars 5.4bn  - equivalent to just over three months' imports. The leeway that this provides has principally come from once-and-for-all emergency cuts in imports and exceptional external financing from the IMF, the World Bank and the donor nations. The disquieting features are that inflation has remained insistently high. As against a target agreed with the IMF that inflation would fall to 9 per cent at the end of fiscal 1991-92 year in March and to 6 per cent by March 1993, the inflation rate has hovered around the 12-13 per cent mark over the last nine months. If the drought in parts of the north is exacerbated by a bad monsoon over the coming months - current forecasts suggest well below normal rainfall - this could add seriously to the upward pressure on prices. Real growth in GDP is for the second year running likely to be at a low for the decade of 2-3 per cent. Growth in industrial output picked up in February - rising by 3.4 per cent as compared with 12 months before  - but was zero or negative for 1991-92 as a whole. This was due to both government-imposed curbs on imports and to the squeeze on domestic demand caused by the tight credit policy of the Reserve Bank of India (the central bank) and thus higher interest rates. The third disquieting feature is that there is little sign of export growth picking up at a pace necessary to meet India's import and debt repayment requirements. Exports in dollar terms actually declined a little in 1991-92 to Dollars 18bn - mainly as a result of the collapse of the Soviet market. This year - with hard currency markets still sluggish as a result of the recession - exports are unlike- ly to grow in dollar terms by more than 6-8 per cent as compared to the 15-17 per cent achieved in the late 1980s. The overriding question for the economy is whether these elements reflect the temporary difficulties of readjustment, or whether they carry the risk of the economy running aground in the quagmire of stagnant growth, unacceptably high inflation and persistent balance of payments difficulties. The prospect of a bad monsoon adds to the difficulties. Mr Deepak Nayaar, the former chief economic adviser who believes that India runs the risk of South American- style stagflation, draws the conclusion that policy should give first priority to reducing deficits and inflation. He fears that if stabilisation is combined with an ambitious restructuring programme - particularly if the economy is opened up to higher levels of imports - India faces the risk of continuing depreciation of the currency, higher inflation and low economic growth. The World Bank and the IMF share some of these doubts about the economy's short- term performance. But they are pushing for more radical change - increased labour flexibility, privatisation and major reforms in the financial sector to achieve more efficient credit allocation - as necessary to improve international competitiveness and exports. It is disputes about the pace of these reforms - with the government agreeing over the direction but hesitant over the timing - that is holding up World Bank sectoral loans to India and further IMF low interest funds. That India came close to default a year ago was a result of the govern- ment's failure in the 1980s to bring the budget and balance of payments deficits under control. Real GDP in the late 1980s rose by an annual aver- age of 6 per cent. But the budget deficit rose to 8-9 per cent of GDP and the current account deficit in 1990-91 to 3.5 per cent of GDP. The two budgets presented by Dr Manmohan Singh, the minister of finance, have brought the budget deficit down in line with IMF targets - to 6.5 per cent of GDP in 1991-92 and to a projected 5 per cent in the 1992-93 budget put before parliament in February. But in practice the stabilis- ation programme has been less tough than these figures suggest. The 1991-1992 target was achieved with the help of accounting devices such as the postponement of fertiliser subsidy payments. More worrying for the future, the projected reduction in the deficit this year is being achieved more by cutting cap- ital spending (infrastructure, health, rural development) than current spending (sub- sidies, wages and public sector employment). Thus as a prop- ortion of GDP, capital spending will fall by 2.1 per cent over the two years to March 1993 while current spending will fall by only 1.2 per cent. The insufficiently tight rein on fiscal policy has helped fuel a faster rate of monetary expansion than anticipated and hence higher inflation. The broad measure of money supply (M3) rose last year by 19 per cent as against a central bank target of 13 per cent. Most of this came from the build-up in the foreign exchange reserves. But government borrowing from the banking system rose by 25 per cent. Since April, it has become harder and costlier for the government to finance its deficit from the banking system. The statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) by which the banks are required to lodge a proportion of their deposits with the Reserve Bank was cut from 38.5 to 30 per cent and the government has also begun to auction treasury bills - meaning it must pay a market price for its own borrowings. But until these shifts in monetary policy, the impact of high interest rates had fallen on the private sector. Prime corporate borrowers now pay 19.7 per cent. The high cost of money together with the import curbs were the two most important factors behind the slump in industrial growth last year. After rising by an annual average of 8-9 per cent over the last few years, the growth in industrial output was flat or negative in 1991-92 as a whole. The emergency curbs on imports - including a 200 per cent cash margin on opening a credit line - were primarily responsible for the slashing of the current account deficit in 1991-92 to Dollars 3bn from Dollars 8.5bn the previous year. Imports, which accounted for 9 per cent of GDP in the late 1980s and which through foreign tie-ups and technology transfers were responsible for much of the increased productivity in the economy, fell by 30 per cent to Dollars 20.7bn (balance of payments figures). With the major improvement in the foreign exchange reserves, the import restrictions were lifted earlier this year. The World Bank expects that even if imports rise in dollar terms this year by 20 per cent, they will still be below the 1990-91 level and thus lower in real terms and as a proportion of GDP. What is clear, however, is that the limiting factor on restructuring and growth in the coming years will be India's capacity to finance the higher imports needed to achieve faster technological change and higher rates of productivity. In the 1980s India was able to finance imports with the help of commercial borrowings abroad. But since last year this avenue has been largely closed because of the nervousness of foreign banks about India's creditworthiness. India also faces a larger burden of debt repayments than it did in the 1980s. With outstanding foreign debt of Dollars 74bn - or 27 per cent higher than five years ago - repayments of interest and principal will this year account for 30 per cent of export earnings. Amortisation payments will almost double over the next few years from Dollars 3.8bn this year to Dollars 6bn in 1996-97. Though foreign investment approvals have climbed sharply since the change in policies, their contribution in balance of payments terms is relatively small. By the mid-1990s direct foreign investment inflow could, on present trends, reach at most Dollars 1bn a year. Last year the World Bank, the IMF and the donor nations contributed Dollars 3.7bn in exceptional external financing. India is this year seeking exceptional financing of about Dollars 3bn. But some donor nations including Japan are increasingly reluctant to contribute. All this underlies the necessity of more structural radical changes needed to achieve much higher export growth. Without this, India could find itself heading for another balance of payments crisis.</p>

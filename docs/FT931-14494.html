			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / International Company News: A phoenix rises from the ashes of Olympia &amp; York - The efforts being taken by the Reichmann family to build a new empire A reborn Olympia &amp; York, centred on property management rather than development, is starting to take shape amid the crumbling Reichmann family empire. Even as the Canadian property group struggles to win approval from creditors for an CDollars 8.5bn (Dollars 6.6bn) debt-restructuring plan, the Reichmanns are working hard to retain management contracts for buildings which they developed and owned before O&amp;Y sought bankruptcy protection last May. Assuming the debt-restructuring goes through, the property management business will be hived off to a new company called Olympia &amp; York Properties. Most of O&amp;Y's other interests will remain under the existing holding company, Olympia &amp; York Developments. Four of 33 creditor groups have so far rejected the company's reorganisation proposals, but they are unlikely to jeopardise the plan as a whole. The most crucial vote on O&amp;Y's future, by its unsecured lenders, will take place on January 25. Under the restructuring plan, the Reichmann family will directly own 10 per cent of OYP and have at least one director on its board. (The remaining 90 per cent will be held by O&amp;Y Developments which will be controlled for the foreseeable future by a court-appointed administrator.) The family will also retain a 20 per cent stake in whatever remains of O&amp;Y's US buildings. Most visible in the effort to rebuild the family business is Mr Philip Reichmann, nephew of Mr Paul Reichmann, who masterminded O&amp;Y's growth during the 70s and 80s into the world's biggest property developer. Despite bids from other property management firms, Mr Philip Reichmann recently persuaded a group of creditors to re-engage O&amp;Y as manager of First Canadian Place, the group's 72-storey flagship building in Toronto's financial district. OYP is expected to be awarded management contracts for several other O&amp;Y properties in Canada, even though it is on the point of having to relinquish ownership of some of the buildings. First Canadian Place creditors are among those who have rejected the debt-restructuring plan; they are now free to seize the 2.7m sq ft building, which was pledged as collateral on their loans. According to a circular to creditors, OYP will be a 'solvent, self-sustaining company'. The cornerstone of its sales pitch will be the Reichmanns' experience as property managers over the past 30 years. As a management rather than a development company, it will require relatively little capital, and will be starting off just as the North American commercial property cycle appears to be inching upward. Mr Chris Ridebock, a principal at Canadian real estate brokers J. J. Barnicke, predicts there will be plenty of opportunity for the new company to diversify into areas such as health-care facilities and suburban industrial property, where growth is expected to be faster than commercial property over the next few years. OYP's parentage also has distinct drawbacks. For instance, lenders taking over ownership of the world's biggest office building, at 55 Water Street in Lower Manhattan, are unlikely to retain O&amp;Y to operate the building. 'We're just not satisfied with them,' says an official of the Alabama State Retirement System, the biggest bondholder. Prudential Assurance has already installed Enterprise Property Group, a fast-growing Canadian company, to take care of the 45-storey Aetna Centre in Toronto, which O&amp;Y handed over to Prudential last month. While the Reichmanns used to own the buildings they managed, they will face the challenge of dealing with a large number of outside owners, each with its own leasing strategy and reporting requirements. Mr Stuart Lazire, president of Enterprise Property, says that 'their organisation had a pretty good reputation, but they were a developer, not a service company. It's a whole different business that they're looking to get into.'</p>

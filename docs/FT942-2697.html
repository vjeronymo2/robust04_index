			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (11): Group B - Sweden Sweden are the overachievers of World Cup football. This is their ninth appearance in the finals. They were fourth in 1938, third in 1950, runners up as hosts in 1958. But after 1974 (quarter-finals) their record tails off. They missed 1982 and 1986 and suffered a nasty first-round prang in Italy - losing to Brazil, Scotland and, worst of all, Costa Rica. Sweden are in a tough group but the team is equipped to make solid progress. They have an experienced goalkeeper, Thomas Ravelli (Gothenburg), a hard-working midfield anchored by Jonas Thern (Naples) and Stefan Schwarz (Arsenal) and a strong centre-forward, Martin Dahlin (Borussia Moenchengladbach). All the players offer the typical mix of characteristics found in professionals across western continental Europe: easy ball skills, physical fitness, stamina and a willingness to submerge themselves in a team plan. However, perhaps for those reasons, the team is short of flair and relies overheavily on the subtle talents of chubby Thomas Brolin (Parma) who emerged from the wreckage of the 1990 competition as a 20-year-old star. The more unpredictable Anders Limpar (Everton) may add some spice to their play, but the Swedes will bring an earnestness to their attempts to emulate past performances.</p>

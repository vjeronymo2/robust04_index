			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov  has disagreed with Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin on  matters of carrying out privatisation in Moscow. Luzhkov  expressed his disgreement in an offficial message addressed to  the Russian prime minister.    The document, which came to ITAR-TASS today, says that  Luzhkov cannot put up with the fact that the Russian prime  minister did not support proposals nade by the city  administration about special ways of holding privatisation in  Moscow.    In Luzhkov's opinion, "special conditions" suggest that the  mayor's office can manage facilities of federal property located  on the territory of the capital, reserve the right to control a  package of shares of privatised enterprises and independently  determine the size of the authorized stock of auctioned  enterprises. Luzhkov believes that all this runs contrary to  the law on privatisation, including in part that a considerable  part of colossal property concentrated in the capital will not  be exchnaged into privatisation vouchers.    Earlier, it was reported that Russian President Boris  Yeltsin  familiarised himself with a draft law worked out by the Moscow  city authorities in 1993 " on the introduction of a special  order of privatisation in Moscow" and instructed the Russian  government and the Russian Committee for State Property to  jointly work out "compromise proposals."    However, officials of the Moscow government reported that  the  Moscow authorities had not yet sat down at the negotiating table  with experts of the Russian Committee for State Property.    Recent developments show that a conflict between the Moscow  mayor's office and the Committee for State Property over the  pravatisation of the city property might turn into a conflict  between the Moscow authorities and the federal government.</p>

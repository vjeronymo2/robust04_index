			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT: NO VOLCANIC ACTIVITY AT PARTY  </P> <P> The Scene: The West Coast premiere of Warner Bros. "Joe vs. the Volcano" at the  Mann Regent in Westwood, followed by a party next door at Stratton's Grill,  hosted by the William Morris Agency.  </P> <P> Who Was There: The film's star, Tom Hanks, writer-director John Patrick  Shanley, and co-stars Abe Vigoda and Robert Stack; plus guests Dennis Hopper,  John Goodman and Molly Ringwald. Also on hand were two current all-stars of the  Hollywood ex-wives league -- Bruce Springsteen's ex Julianne Phillips and Mimi  Rogers, former Mrs. Tom Cruise.  </P> <P> The Buzz: Since when do talent agencies host premiere parties? William Morris  seemed to be going all out to show its sincere, undying, selfless love for  clients Hanks and Stanley. Either that, or they're preparing to branch out into  catering.  </P> <P> The Chow: Salmon with Dijon dill Hollandaise; saffron linguine with rock  shrimp; grilled breast of chicken with lemon caper butter sauce; hot fudge  sundaes for the caloric fearless.  </P> <P> Dress Mode: The usual acres of Italian wool from Armani and Versace. One woman  was wearing a black see-through blouse over a multicolored brassiere. When she  noticed another guest was fixated on her chest, she pulled her jacket shut. The  gentleman apologized, saying he stared only because "I was once a fashion  student at Otis Parsons."  </P> <P> Quoted: "Saturday Night Live's" Victoria Jackson: "When Meg Ryan graduates to  playing heroin addicts, I want to take over all her together-but-slightly  askew, offbeat leading lady roles."  </P> <P> Missed Opportunity: With a film that includes a volcano and a South Seas island  whose inhabitants are descendants of Jewish, Italian and Irish sailors, this  could have been the theme party of the century.  </P> <P> Glitches: It looked like a casting call for bit players in "The Famous Teddy  Z." Few stars went to the party, leaving Stratton's packed with agents.  </P></p>

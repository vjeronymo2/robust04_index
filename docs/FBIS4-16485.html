			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz April 15 TASS--The two-day second round  of North Ossetian-Ingush summit negotiations ended in Nalchik  today after discussing a draft agreement on principles, measures  and time to implement the Russian president's decree "On  Procedure of Return of Refugees and Forced Migrants to Places of  Their Permanent Residence in Northern Ossetia and Ingushetia".    The sides have discussed the document's preamble and the  first article. The Ossetian side suggested to have the  following wording of the first article "The parties to the  agreement confirm the status of the Prigorodny region as a  territory of the North Ossetian Republic in accordance with a  decree of the Russian president of December 13, 1993, and voice  their refusal from any territorial claims on each other and a  third party".    In the opinion of the Ingush side, the Prigorodny region  belongs to Ingushetia as ethnic Ingushes populated the area  before deportation.    A break in negotiations has been announced. The date of the  next meeting in Nalchik will be announced later. The North  Ossetian and Ingush working groups and experts in Vladikavkaz  and Nazran will continue to elaborate articles of the draft  agreement.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 1 (YONHAP) -- Vice Foreign Minister  Aleksandr Panov, declaring that Russia's position on the North  Korean nuclear dispute remains unchanged, has said that North  Korea must fulfill its obligations as a member of the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty.    In an interview published in the daily IZVESTIYA Friday,  Panov said Moscow would support the U.N. Security Council in  adopting a resolution demanding outside inspection of North  Korea's nuclear facilities.    Commenting on his earlier statement that Russia would have  to  intervene automatically to militarily assist North Korea under a  bilateral treaty if North Korea was attacked, Panov said his  remark had been distorted by the press.    The Russian position on the military assistance treaty  between the former Soviet Union and North Korea has not changed  from what it was a year ago, he said.    Panov said Russia would decide whether to fulfill its  obligations under the 1961 treaty with North Korea after  considering the differences between then and now and analyzing  the situation on the basis of Russia's national interest, while  bearing in mind its international obligations including the  non-proliferation treaty.    Panov stressed there is no threat of any unprovoked attack  on  North Korea at present, thus hinting that Moscow has no ground  for providing military support to Pyongyang, the newspaper said.    Russia tries to make use of the Korean situation to  strengthen its position in Asia, the paper said. But Russia  does not want a conflict with Seoul and Washington over this  issue, it said, noting that Russia, unlike China, is ready to  support a U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea.</p>

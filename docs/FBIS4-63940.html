			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From 26 May EESTI SENUMID, PAEVALEHT, p 1; "News Bulletin" </F> No. 101/94]    [Text] Thursday, May 26 -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev defended the memorandum submitted by Russia and declared  that Russia's attempts to develop "friendly and goodneighbourly  relations with Estonia include the use of harsh terms". He also  predicted that even harsher language would be used at his  meeting with the Russian speakers in Tallinn.    The foreign minister told the listeners in the Slavic  Culture  Centre that Russia is developing a government programme for the  aid and protection of the compatriots living abroad. A special  commission will be formed, which could operate more efficiently  than the Foreign Ministry with its diplomatic protocol. Kozyrev  added that Russia is particularly interested in the pensioners'  issue and problems of privatisation and enterprise.    He declared that the border issues will not be discussed and  demanded that all retired military, including former KGB and GRU  intelligence officers, must receive social guarantees as well as  automatic citizenship. Describing the situation in Estonia,  Kozyrev commented that, speaking as a private individual rather  than a diplomat, he would have to ask for the ladies to leave  the hall.</p>

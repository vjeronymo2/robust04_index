			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: The escape from bad debt mountain - John Gapper examines new operations set up by TSB and Royal Bank to remove a menace from their balance sheets and promote a rescue culture AS BRITISH banks show signs of emerging into a fresh era of profitability, they are still weighed down by their past. A mass of corporate debt from the 1980s held by companies that have stopped paying interest, or defaulted on the capital, loiters menacingly on their balance sheets. Little wonder that most prefer to avoid the subject of bad debt, instead emphasising steps they are taking to re-shape, and develop new fee-earning operations. Yet as they do so, they face the danger that they will fail to devote enough attention to managing the problems of the past. In the US, some banks have opted for two radical solutions to such difficulties. The first is to split in two, creating a 'bad bank' to carry old bad debt, and a 'good bank' which can trade unburdened. The second solution is to sell the old poor loans at a heavy discount on secondary loan markets. But in Britain, no bank has yet chosen to split itself, and the secondary debt market is less developed. This means many banks are simply struggling along with increasingly divided businesses. Two banks ' TSB Group and Royal Bank of Scotland - have set up new operations in response. TSB Group's problems with poor corporate loans largely stem from its misguided purchase of Hill Samuel, the merchant bank. Hill Samuel built up a portfolio of bad loans in the late 1980s, and has now been put up for sale. But TSB must still deal with the Pounds 1.6bn net debt burden. To manage down this debt, it established a separate 'loan administration unit' at the end of last year. Mr Mike Fairey, director of credit, says the unit has two purposes. One is to 'relieve Hill Samuel of its debt mountain' and allow its management to concentrate on re-shaping the business. The second purpose is to allow 50 full-time managers in the unit ' supported by specialists in areas such as property who advise under contract ' to concentrate on the task. Mr Fairey argues that such concentration is required because there is 'no generic approach' to getting rid of the debt. Mr Fairey does not rule out selling debt, or securitising assets to remove them from the balance sheet. But he believes it will only be possible in a few cases. So the task in many cases comes down to selling the underlying assets on which the loans were secured. This largely means property. Signs of a revival of investor interest in the UK property market are unlikely to have an immediate impact, because much of the old book is what he terms 'secondary' property - not the sort of fully-let commercial property on prime sites which attracts blue chip companies as tenants. As a result, his properties need work to sell. 'You cannot manage property from behind a desk. You have to get out there and have a look,' he says. The bank has raised Pounds 60m from property sales since October, reducing net written down debt - after making provisions of 54 per cent - to Pounds 747m. On one hand, the bank has an incentive to rid itself of the property book fast. Carrying the unit's loans cost Pounds 42m in interest last year. Yet there is a risk that it could imitate the banks' mistake in selling less developed country debt cheaply in the 1980s before it started performing again. 'We want to get rid of it, but I believe we are adequately provided, and there could be some potential in the future,' says Mr Fairey. This means the bank is not trying to reclaim the underlying security in many cases, but instead allowing managements to remain in place to make the best of it. Royal Bank of Scotland is also trying to keep as many of its troubled corporate debtors trading as possible, although it is sometimes less keen to keep current managers in place. The bank established a 'specialised lending services' unit last year to deal with many of the poor loans that led to it making Pounds 400m of bad debt provisions in 1992. It is headed by Mr Derek Sach, who was formerly UK managing director of 3i, the venture capital company owned by the big banks. Rather than concentrating on liquidating the asset on which property is secured, the unit's efforts are mostly aimed at restructuring debt and making businesses more viable. It has deliberately intervened to make it more difficult for branch managers to place small businesses in receivership. The number of receivers appointed by the bank in the first four months of this year was 90, compared with 190 in the same period the previous year. Mr Sach argues that branches have appointed receivers too fast because managers want to spend their time on 'new, positive business' rather than old. He is also trying to avoid 'the classic clearing banker approach' of refusing further loans to companies that have eroded their capital during recession. Yet this requires the bank to take some brave decisions based on confidence that managements are capable of staying in business. It attempts to do this by assigning teams of specialists, including accountants and lawyers, to restructure both the terms of financing and often management. Mr Sach summarises his task within the bank as 'trying to promote a rescue culture'. He says this will remain useful even when it has rid itself of its current debt burden. It could then apply the equity finance and accountancy skills among the 300 people in the unit for new lending. Yet the development of such skills also poses the question of whether Royal Bank might exercise them on other portfolios, by buying distressed debt from others. It has not done so yet, but fellow bankers expect it to be among bidders if a secondary loan market starts to develop in the UK.</p>

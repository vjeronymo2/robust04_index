			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Outdoors: The day we found El Dourado - Fishing To be able, on a marrow-chilling February day, to tell your chums 'I'm fishing in Brazil next week' is a pleasure of rare deliciousness. To be ignobly honest, the pleasure is enhanced significantly by the expressions of envy writ large on their faces. So there I was, in a rather natty straw hat and daft shorts, white legs and arms and neck shiny with sun cream. I was feeling pretty pleased with myself as I poured cold beer down my throat and surveyed the surging half-mile breadth of the Parana river, down near the Paraguayan border. I had a companion on this adventure. In his field, he has something of a reputation as a fierce and combative interrogator and mangler of public figures. But I found him a jovial soul and have decided to forgive him for exposing me to ridicule in his account of our expedition. For one thing, it would be beneath my dignity; for another, he has a nice bit of trout fishing in Gloucestershire. Before we started I did my best to demolish notions of my angling proficiency. But neither Edward, our host on the Parana, nor Jorge, our dark-skinned, gleaming-toothed boatman, would take any notice. And my companion - who, for the sake of convenience, I shall call 'P' - persisted in harping on about it. The only way to rid myself of the slur was to display thorough and constant uselessness - which I did. We had come in pursuit of the great fish of the Parana - the dourado. I knew something about it, having read old books by Englishmen who had paid visits 70 years and more ago to do battle with it. They called it the Golden Salmon, although it does not look like a salmon at all. It is, however, a most magnificent fish: its fins, tummy and head deep gold; its broad flanks spotted with black; its wide, predator's mouth bristling with teeth. Those Englishmen of olden days went after it with spinners, and many were the epic encounters they had in the surging currents of the colossal Parana. I had thought, vaguely, that we would spin, too - or even fish with fly - and had brought with me rods and reels lent by Hardy Brothers which would, I hoped, suffice. But the river was 15ft above normal and mud-brown. Perforce, we had to follow local practice. This involved impaling a slippery, eel-like creature called a morenita on the hook, with a large weight above. This was then hurled upstream from the boat and zoomed downstream with the current. The theory (sound when practised efficiently) is that the bait bounces along over the rocks until seized by a rapacious dourado. Ah, the rocks. What a multitude of those we hooked and failed to land. 'P' would stand at one end of the boat, red-faced under his green baseball cap. I would be at the other, smirking at his discomfort, then cursing as I became hooked up. Between us were Jorge and Edward, grinning at our antics. Our performance was, on the whole, pathetic. But we did catch some fish. 'P' caught a piranha, which was appropriate, and some small dourado. I hooked one decent one, which took the bait with such violence that my multiplier reel over-ran and jammed. The fish got off and everyone, apart from me, laughed. Edward, taking time off from schadenfreude, caught a tremendous 28-pounder which, roasted whole, made a memorable feast. It was maddening, but it was also the greatest fun. The beer, the heat, the river, and its forest, the comforts and hospitality afforded us, the companionship - all were ample consolation for the failures. But, always, the thought nagged at me: we should not be fishing this way, we should be spinning. By the last day, the river had dropped and cleared. We trailed our baits around without joy, then headed for base. As we did so, Jorge spotted dourado slashing at the surface near the shore. I rigged up a spinning rod while he edged in towards them. Using a large copper spoon, I hooked four - and lost them all. The last, announcing itself in a great golden boil, bent my Hardy rod like a horse-shoe and broke a 20-pound line like cotton. It was the most exciting half-hour of my fishing career, a glimpse, both tantalising and agonising, of what might have been. But if I try again, I shall know what to do. I shall go in November or December when the water should be right. I shall take a rod capable of quelling a shark, with line to match, and copper spoons with single, extra-strength, extra-sharp hooks. I shall, politely but firmly, wave away Jorge and his horrible, slimy morenitas. I shall, most assuredly, catch the fish of a lifetime. And I shall be very modest about it.

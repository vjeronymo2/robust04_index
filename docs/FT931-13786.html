			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Robusta COFFEE futures yesterday resumed the downtrend that had been interrupted on Tuesday, with the March position at the London Futures and Options Exchange ending the day Dollars 58 down at Dollars 910 a tonne. The trend was again set in the New York market, where investment fund selling pushed prices through successively lower support levels. 'There's a lot of extra fund money out there. . . which is why we're getting the violent movements we haven't seen since the 1980s,' one trader said. COCOA prices were also weaker, on trade profit-taking and light producer selling, and the May position closed at Dollars 732 a tonne, down Dollars 4. Trading remained quiet at the London Metal Exchange, where the strongest performance was the cash TIN price's Dollars 49 rise to Dollars 5,940 a tonne. That was the fifth successive daily gain and took the rise over the past week to more than Dollars 110 a tonne. Dealers attributed the continued rise chiefly to technical considerations. ALUMINIUM prices weakened further under speculative selling pressure. Compiled from Reuters</p>

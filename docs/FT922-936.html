			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Courts suffers 11% downturn to Pounds 8.09m Courts (Furnishers) suffered a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 9.05m to Pounds 8.09m for the year ended March 31, with the trading environment remaining exceptionally difficult throughout the period. The 11 per cent downturn in profits was after taking account of interest charges of Pounds 5.37m (Pounds 5.52m), a transfer to deferred profit of Pounds 5.31m (Pounds 5.55m) and property disposal losses of Pounds 560,000 (profit Pounds 1.64m). On the plus side there was a Pounds 1.28m share of profit from the new Trinidad associate. Earnings worked through at 19.7p (23.8p). A final dividend of 3.17p holds the total at 5p. Group turnover increased by 5 per cent to Pounds 184m. The figure excluded any contribution from the Trinidad associate but included the depreciatory effects of the 66 per cent devaluation of the Jamaican dollar.</p>

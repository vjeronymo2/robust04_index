			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 18 Apr (NA) -- A regular-intensity  bomb exploded at a private mail service in this capital's  Chacabuco Park area early this morning. No injuries were  reported.    The explosion took place at the headquarters of the firm  Transclair SRL at 1222 Cobo Avenue, near the corner of Centenera  Street, at around 0100 local time. It damaged the establishment  and adjoining buildings.    According to reports by neighbors, the attack is said to be  the result of a "trade war" between companies engaged in the  same trade.    One of the company managers, Antonio Gomez Dolzer, said: "We  have received telephone threats for a long time. Some shots  were even fired at the front of the building four months ago."    For reasons of jurisdiction, police Precinct No. 12 is  conducting an inquest into this case. Federal Police bomb squad  personnel were called when the explosion occurred.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Lecturers slam threat to cut holidays Lecturers in further education yesterday reacted furiously to 'interference' in contract negotiations by Mr John Patten, the education secretary, after a Budget that could mean they must accept halved holidays next year to gain a pay rise. Mr Patten said Pounds 50m was to be withheld from the Further Education Funding Council, 'to be released when there has been satisfactory progress within colleges towards more flexible contracts of employment'. The council has funded colleges since they were removed from council control in April. It now seems certain that the government's public-sector pay policy will be rigorously enforced, with lecturers receiving a pay rise next year only if they sign a new 'flexible' contract drawn up by the Colleges' Employers' Forum. The National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (Natfhe) is in a dispute with the forum over the contracts, which would cut annual holiday entitlement from 14 weeks to seven and add an hour to the working day. Lecturers in seven colleges have voted to take action, while ballots are pending in 14 others. Mr Derek Betts, head of policy for Natfhe, said Mr Patten should not have interfered in 'delicate' negotiations which are due to continue until the end of this month. He added that the 3 per cent growth in further education spending to fund a projected 8 per cent growth in student numbers was 'derisory'. The Association for Colleges, representing principals, also reacted with alarm. Ms Ruth Gee, chairman, said: 'Colleges were promised autonomy. The increased degree of centralisation through the retention of Pounds 50m by the funding council is not a move we welcome. Colleges are accountable for their spending, and a degree of help from the government is essential.' But Mr Roger Ward, chief executive of the Colleges' Employers' Forum, welcomed Mr Patten's move. He said: 'Natfhe have brought this policy upon themselves. Their recent round of strikes in defiance of the current negotiations with the employers has delivered a clear message to the government. They have let down their members and they have let down the sector, and they will live to regret their strike action.'</p>

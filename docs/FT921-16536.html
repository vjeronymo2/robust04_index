			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Plea to aid Haiti businesses THE international trade embargo against Haiti has cost the Caribbean state about Dollars 150m in lost earnings so far, according to representatives of US companies with investments in Haiti. Factories which depend on export trade will have to close and thousands of jobs will be lost, the US companies, supported by Haitian business leaders, say. The embargo was imposed on the French-speaking republic of 6m people after a military coup at the end of September. President Jean- Bertrand Aristide was sent into exile. The Organisation of American States, along with several European countries and Japan, imposed the embargo, saying he should be restored to the presidency. The US and other members of the OAS say the embargo will continue until the Haitian constitution is restored. Over 6,000 Haitians have tried to flee for the US since the coup, amid reports of reprisals by the army against Mr Aristide's supporters. All but a few have been allowed into the US. Haiti's economy depends mainly on the export of assembled garments, toys and baseballs, mostly for the US market, and on coffee and fruit. 'We employed 500 workers in our operations in Haiti, and they are now unemployed,' said Mr Andrew Postal, president of Judy Bond, a New York garment company. 'We are closing our plants in the country.' Speaking at a conference in Miami on US trade with the Caribbean, Mr Jean Edouard Baker, president of the Haitian Business Association, said the work week in Port-au-Prince, the capital, had been reduced to three mornings, and electricity supplies were 15 per cent of demand. 'The industrial sector in Haiti has been crippled,' he said. Mr Donald Zimmerman, who heads a family business which assembles women's undergarments in Haiti, said people there were starving and dying as politicians discussed their fate. 'The US government has put Haiti back into the stone age and I am urging a reconsideration of policy.' The US is unlikely to yield, according to officials at the conference. The administration was aware of the problems being created for business by the trade embargo, but the embargo would stay until the political situation was resolved, said Ms Donna Hrinak of the State Department. She said: 'We know we are asking the Haitian people to do a lot, but how much a price can one ask for democracy?'</p>

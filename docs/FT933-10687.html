			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / 'Filthiest fuel' is left to market forces: Orimulsion's go-ahead will anger 'greens' and the coal industry THE POLLUTION inspectorate's decision to give PowerGen the go-ahead to burn orimulsion at two of its power stations - albeit with environmental restrictions - will cause a storm of protest from several quarters. The coal industry will see it as another blow in its struggle for survival. Environmentalists, who have condemned orimulsion as the world's 'filthiest fuel', will use it as further evidence of government duplicity on green issues. The public may wonder why Whitehall is prepared to authorise the use of a controversial imported fuel when the country has so much gas, oil and coal on its own doorstep. Primarily the government wants the market to decide which fuels to use, and the inspectorate has decided that orimulsion is not especially dirty. Orimulsion is made in Venezuela from a mixture of bitumen and water, and can be burnt in power stations designed to take heavy oil. The two power stations authorised to use it - Ince on Merseyside and Richborough near Sandwich, Kent - have been burning it on an experimental basis for several years. Pollution inspectors have built up records of emissions and studied the experience of other countries, notably Canada, where orimulsion is also burnt. The tests show that it emits more sulphur than oil or coal, but less of some other harmful substances, such as nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. It also produces less dust, so there was no clear environmental case for banning it. The authorisation requires PowerGen to install equipment by April 1998 to remove most of the harmful emissions. Officials stress that these conditions were attached not because orimulsion is especially dirty but as part of a more tightly targeted approach for Britain's power stations. The authorisations were made under the 1990 Environmental Protection Act which requires the pollution inspectorate to set emission limits based on the best available pollution control techniques that do not entail excessive cost. The inspectors also have to take into account Britain's ability to meet international commitments to reduce emissions which cause acid rain - which they believe can be done even with orimulsion. The wider question of whether Britain needs yet another fuel is one the government says must be left to the market. In its review of the coal industry during last winter's pits crisis, the Department of Trade and Industry said it could not interfere with contracts to import orimulsion, which are handled mainly by a joint Venezuelan-British Petroleum company. The DTI added that it expected imports to fall by 500,000 tonnes from last year's level of 1.4m tonnes, but gave no reason. The forecast has been widely questioned. What is far from clear is how big the orimulsion market may become. National Power, the UK's largest power generator, deferred two applications to burn the fuel last year because the pollution inspectorate was insisting on expensive clean-up equipment, and the generator's plans are now on ice. The Treasury must also decide at what level to tax orimulsion, which is not specifically provided for in the European Community's schedule of tariffs. This will have a big bearing on its ability to compete with other fuels. The new authorisations amount to less than 2 per cent of UK generation capacity, so the impact will be relatively small. Even so, orimulsion has crossed a big hurdle, and other potential users will now begin looking at it more seriously.</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Warning on mines compensation Farmers and landowners who suffer from the effects of mining may not be properly compensated after privatisation of the coal industry, the Country Landowners Association said yesterday. Its statement follows a similar warning from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The Department of Trade and Industry said the association had misunderstood the privatisation bill. The association said the obligation on private-sector mining companies would be limited to expected costs over the next 12 months. It said it was not clear what would happen to claims at a later date if the operator ran into difficulty. The DTI said there would be an annual review but in some cases the liabilities could go up each year.</p>

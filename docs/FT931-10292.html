			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Punitive damages GENERAL MOTORS has been ordered by an American jury to pay punitive damages of Dollars 101m, on top of Dollars 4.2m compensation for pain and suffering, to the parents of a 17-year-old boy who died when his GM pick-up truck crashed and burst into flames. His parents claimed that faulty design and placement of the fuel tank caused their son's death. The case, broadcast live on television, has highlighted in a dramatic way the long-running battle between business and consumer groups over the future of America's civil liability system. Industry has long argued that the US product-liability system has itself become a liability to the economy. Businesses claim it discourages innovation and dampens competitiveness. Consumer groups counter that the threat of lawsuits and huge damages forces companies to make safer products. Industry has powerful arguments on its side. A recent Brookings Institute study of the impact of lawsuits on safety and innovation in five industries concluded litigation was not 'an overwhelming driving force for safety' and that uncertainty over damages awards had 'probably reduced innovation'. The key to reform lies in replacing the patchwork of state laws with a uniform federal liability code which would create standards for awarding punitive damages. The latest attempt to introduce reform along these lines failed to pass Congress in 1991. This was a pity, because a uniform approach is clearly desirable. It would eliminate the uncertainty in the present system, help to lower litigation costs by promoting settlements, and foster innovation. The business lobby claimed the bill was pro-consumer because it would encourage speedier pay-outs and unclog the courts. Consumer groups said it would deter people from suing. Now business fears that, with the Clinton administration likely to be more pro-plaintiff, the chance for reform may have gone. One window of opportunity remains. The US Supreme Court has recently accepted a punitive damages case for review, in which it will be asked to rule whether excessive punitive awards are unconstitutional. This is the fifth time the Court has considered the issue, and it has yet to uphold a single challenge. But on the last occasion in 1991, the Court said a punitive award four times bigger than the compensatory damages awarded was 'close to the line of constitutional impropriety'. In the case to be reviewed, the punitive damages were 526 times the compensatory award. All businesses selling products in the US market must hope the Court will now recognise that punitive damages in America have gone too far.</p>

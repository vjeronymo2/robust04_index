			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by 'Umar Idris] </F>   [Text] Saudi sources disclosed to AL-HAYAH that SAMA, the  Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, issued during the first quarter  of the current year development and treasury bonds valued at 22  billion riyals [SR] ($5.8 billion).    The same sources stated that a few days ago the sixth and  last issuance of the development bonds for the first quarter was  made; the cost was SR1.5 billion ($400 million). This makes the  total value of development bonds so far issued at SR9 billion  ($2.4 billion). During the same period SR13 billion ($3.4  billion) of short-term treasury bonds were issued three times.    The banking sources indicated that the Saudi development  bonds are one-to-five-year bonds. Interest on these bonds is  paid every three months. The interest rate is 4.3 percent. Each  bond is SR5 million ($1.3 million).    Interest on short-term treasury bonds is paid at the  maturity  date of the bond; these are 30-90-day bonds. Each bond is SR1  million ($266,000)    The banking sources described the return on these bonds as  acceptable, that it changes according to the changes in the  world market, and that it is linked to the changes in the  interest rate on the dollar. Due to the difference between the  values of the riyal and the dollar, the interest rates on these  bonds are 0.3 percent higher than those on American treasury  bonds.    The same sources stated that local banks buy these bonds  because they find it a convenient means to make use of the great  liquidity they have. If the local bank needs liquidity, it can  reverse the bonds to SAMA as a temporary mortgage for a fixed  period after which the local bank gets back the bonds and  liquidity returns to SAMA. Such a procedure is an important  banking method to control the monetary bloc. The sources also  reported that big Saudi investors prefer to own these bonds as  soon as SAMA puts them on the market.    The sources indicated that sales from bonds issued during  the  first quarter of the current year were used to pay back the  value of previous bonds owed to banks and companies.    There are indications that SAMA first issued development and  treasury bonds in 1989 when the government decided to enter as a  major borrower from the banking market. The government started  by getting a domestic loan of SR25 billion ($6.6 billion). In  the ensuing five years, the value of treasury bonds doubled as  bonds valuing SR120 billion ($32 billion) were issued in the  Saudi banking market.    The same sources expect that during the current year new  development and treasury bonds worth SR30 billion ($8 billion)  will be issued.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Loss deepens at Eng &amp; Overseas Prop More than doubled exceptional provisions against the fall in property values led to a sharp increase in losses at English &amp; Overseas Properties in 1991. Pre-tax losses leapt to Pounds 2.32m (Pounds 134,000) after exceptional costs of Pounds 2.48m (Pounds 1.1m). Turnover declined to Pounds 1.03m (Pounds 1.72m). Operating losses were, however, reduced to Pounds 92,000 (Pounds 417,000). Some Pounds 31,000 of losses came from associated companies (profits Pounds 879,000) and interest receivable fell to Pounds 289,000 (Pounds 499,000). The company is proposing to maintain the final dividend at 0.5p for a total of 1p (2.5p). Losses per share worked through at 14.24p (5.51p). The summer rights issue raised Pounds 4.95m on a 3-for-1 basis and ensured the company had enough cash 'to meet its obligations'. Cash balances rose during the year to Pounds 5.3m and borrowings amounted to Pounds 5.4m.</p>

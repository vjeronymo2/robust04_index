			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 2 Jun (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has  explained that the UN Security Council resolution pertaining to  a cease-fire in Yemen is a "resolution that deals with the  tragic situation of a nation whose northern and southern parts  are fighting each other, namely an unacceptable situation."    Commenting further on the Security Council resolution, he  explained that Egypt was one of the countries that sought this  resolution because it is totally unacceptable to talk of unity  by force. He added that it is very doubtful that a unity  brought about by force can continue even if one of the warring  factions defeats the other. He explained: "It is a very  serious matter and would constitute an unacceptable precedent."    Asked what he thinks will happen if the Security Council  resolution is not implemented, Musa said: "If the resolution is  not implemented, we will handle things as they come."</p>

			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / People: John Toulmin elected president of CCBE John Toulmin QC has been elected president of the Council of the Bars and Law Societies of Europe (CCBE) at its autumn meeting in Lisbon. He is the first English lawyer to hold the office and only the second from the UK. The first was Judge David Edward, the British judge at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. Toulmin has been active in the CCBE since 1984 when he represented the English Bar on the UK delegation. Between 1987 and 1990 he was leader of the UK delegation and was elected CCBE vice-president last year. He has been at the forefront of efforts by the CCBE to adopt a draft directive on lawyers' rights of establishment within the European Community. The directive was finally passed at the Lisbon meeting this weekend bringing to an end 17 years of negotiation between the members of the Council. The draft directive will now be sent to the European Commission in Brussels which has indicated that it will view it favourably. Toulmin, 51, was educated at Winchester and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and called to the Bar in 1965. He is also a member of the Irish Bar and the Bar of Northern Ireland. He is a former chairman of the Young Barristers and member of the Bar Council and a former governor of the Maudsley Hospital in London. He is currently a member of the Consultative Committee to the European Court, member of the Committee of Management of the Institute of Psychiatry and a trustee of Pro Corda, the national association for young string players.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N. A. Aybulatov, doctor of geographical </F> sciences, RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] Institute of  Oceanology, under rubric "Ecology": "Radioactive Burial Grounds  in the Kara Sea"]    [Text] During recent decades the radioactivity of the seas  has increased noticeably. The major reasons are nuclear weapons  tests, the dumping of radioactive waste by nuclear plants  (including the accidents at the Three Mile Island nuclear power  plant in the United States and the Chernobyl nuclear power plant  in Ukraine) and plants that process nuclear fuel, as well as  accidents on ships and aircraft with nuclear power units or  nuclear weapons, and the burial of radioactive waste in the  marine environment. A situation that currently is especially  alarming is the radioactive pollution of the Barents and Kara  seas, which wash the northern shores of our country. What is the  scope of this pollution and what caused it?  <H5>  International Dumping </H5>   The substantial radioactive pollution in the ocean is  created  by the dumping of radioactive waste directly into the water  itself or on the bottom. Radioactive waste has been dumped in 50  places in the North Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean (dumping at  sea began in 1946 and was not stopped by an international  moratorium until 1983). According to estimates made by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the total  radioactivity of the seas is 46 PBq, or 1.24 MCi -- one PBq  (pentabecquerel) = 1 x 10[.sup]15[/] Bq = 27,000 Ci (curies).    The total list of radioactive dumpings includes certain  unpackaged dumps and liquid runoffs, which were widespread at  sea as early as the 1950's-1960's. Of this list, 98 percent  represent _g_- and _b_-radiating isotopes.    We might note that the IAEA estimates do not take into  consideration the dumping at sea that was carried out by the  former USSR.    Radioactive materials (not considering the USSR dumpings)  were widespread in four oceans of the earth: 0.55 PBq are  produced by waste products that were concentrated in 16 places  in the northeastern part of the Pacific Ocean and near the  western shore of North America; 2.94 PBq, in 11 places in the  northwest Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico; 42.31 PBq, in 15  places in the northeast Atlantic; and 0.002 PBq, in five places  in the western part of the Pacific Ocean, near Japan and New  Zealand.    The largest share of the dumping of radioactive waste at sea  belongs to Great Britain. In the North Atlantic that share  constitutes 77.5 percent of the total amount of dumped waste.  The radioactive "contribution" made by that country to the  marine environment is 35 PBq. Dumping by Switzerland constitutes  10 percent of the total dumping; United States, 7.6 percent;  Belgium, 4.6 percent; France, 0.8 percent;Netherlands, 0.7  percent; Japan, 0.03 percent; Sweden, 0.01 percent; New Zealand,  0.002 percent; and Germany, 0.0004 percent.  <H5>  Dumping of Radioactive Waste in the Kara Sea </H5>   The leadership of the former USSR used to assert that our  country's enterprises did not dump radioactive waste at sea,  and, if such dumping of radioactive waste did occur, it was  without the knowledge of the authorities and was a violation of  the law. But in response to demands to release information about  dumping operations, they never gave any official answers, or, in  any case, no reports ever appeared in the press.    However, thanks to the efforts of the public, as well as  materials that were collected by nuclear physicist A. A.  Zolotkov, a worker in the Murmansk Maritime Steamship Agency and  former deputy to the USSR Supreme Soviet, it became known that  in the USSR the dumping of radioactive waste in the Kara Sea had  been carried out for more than 20 years (1964-1986). In the  1980's A. A. Zolotkov prepared a map showing the location of  radioactive graveyards in the Kara Sea, while stating that that  map was by no means complete.    In late 1991 V. Ya. Stadnyuk, chairman of the USSR Supreme  Soviet's Council of the Union Committee on Questions of  Security, made two inquiries concerning the burial of  radioactive waste --at the USSR Ministry of the Maritime Fleet  and personally to the commander in chief of the USSR Navy. The  answers to the inquiries were stupefying -- A. A. Zolotkov's  unofficial research was completely confirmed. In response to the  first inquiry, it was reported from Minmorflot [Ministry of the  Maritime Fleet] that the burials of radioactive waste at sea  (during the operation, repair, and modernization of  nuclear-powered ships in the Murmansk Steamship Agency) were  carried out from 1963 through 1986 in accordance with a decision  made by the USSR Government. Special authorizations for this  purpose were also given by the 3rd Main Administration of USSR  Minzdrav [Ministry of Health), and, starting in 1971, the  Medical Service of the Red Banner Northern Fleet (the government  entrusted it with the task of monitoring the burial of  radioactive waste in the arctic seas.    The burials occurred in the following regions: liquid  radioactive waste, in the area of the Barents Sea with  coordinates from 74 to 78 north latitude and from  48 to 52 east longitude; solid radioactive waste, in  areas of the Kara Sea (Zaliv Techeniya, Tsivolki, Abrosimova,  Stepovogo, Oga, Blagopoluchiya, Sedova, as well as the  deep-water area of the Novaya Zemlya Depression). For each area  and each burial, the Medical Service of the KSF [Red Banner  Northern Fleet established the maximum quantity of radioactive  waste with regard to volume and total activity. The bulk of the  waste that was buried during that period, according to USSR  Minmorflot information, was in the category of weakly active  radioactive waste. An exception was the burial of the first  nuclear unit of the "Lenin" icebreaker, which was carried out in  accordance with a special decree of the USSR Council of  Ministers.   <FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-006L-14A>      Key: Areas where solid radioactive waste was submerged in the Kara Sea. </FIG>     1 - Novaya Zemlya Depression -- 1450 containers  with radioactive waste, barge with malfunctioning nuclear  reactor (170,000 Ci), transport barge for carrying liquid  radioactive waste;    2 - Zaliv Neupokoyeva -- radioactive waste with a  total activity of 3400 Ci;    3 - Zaliv Tsivolki -- 4750 containers, "Nikolay  Bauman" transport barge, central compartment of "Lenin"  icebreaker with three malfunctioning reactors and screen  assembly;    4 - Zaliv Olga -- 850 containers;    5 - Zaliv Stepovogo -- 1850 containers and  malfunctioning nuclear submarine (two reactors with fuel that  had not been unloaded);    6 - Zaliv Abrosimova -- 550 containers and  compartments of four malfunctioning submarines;    7 - Zaliv Blagopoluchiya -- 650 containers;    8 - Zaliv Techeniy -- malfunctioning reactor  (without nuclear fuel), total activity 1856 Ci;    9 - 400 containers;    10 - 250 containers;    11 -proposed location of regional radioactive waste  graveyard;    12 - area where it is proposed to carry out an extensive  long-term nuclear testing program.&lt;/graphic&gt;     The following were buried in Zaliv Tsivolki (near Novaya  Zemlya) in 1967:    -- an assembly of the first nuclear unit of the "Lenin"  icebreaker, consisting of three reactors without nuclear fuel,  with hermetically sealed standard equipment and biological  protection that was mothballed in the assembly (steel with a  thickness of 300 mm, concrete). The reliability and safety of  the storage are estimated to be a period of no less than 500  years;    -- cutout screen of one of the reactors with remnants of  used  fuel, which had been previously joined with a hardening mixture  and mothballed in a reinforced-concrete container in a metal  sheathing. Reliability and safety of the storage are estimated  to be a period of no less than 500 years.    In conformity with instructions from USSR Goskomgidromet  [State Committee for Hydrometeorology], the burial of  radioactive waste in the Barents and Kara seas was subsequently  discontinued (burial of liquid waste in 1984, and solid in  1986). Detailed reports concerning all radioactive waste burials  that were executed by the Murmansk Maritime Steamship Agency,  with an indication of the quantity of waste products, their  total activity, and the coordinates of the burial areas, are  sent annually to the Medical Service of the Red Banner Northern  Fleet.    In response to V. Ya. Stadnyuk's second inquiry concerning  the burial of radioactive waste, it was reported from the Navy  that A. A. Zolotkov's information was not complete, and it  should be augmented by the burials of radioactive waste in the  Pacific Ocean.    The preparation of a complete register of radioactive  materials that had been buried by the former USSR Navy was  completed in December 1991. However, the new Russian leaders at  least until November 1992 failed to submit, despite their  obligation, that register to the London Convention on Dumping.  The international London Convention had been signed by the  government of the former Union in January 1976, and it  stipulates the taking into consideration of the IAEA  recommendations when making decisions about the possibility of  dumping radioactive waste. USSR Council of Ministers decree  (March 1979), entitled "Measures to Guarantee the Execution of  the Pledges Taken By the Soviet Side, Which Evolve From the 1972  Convention on Preventing the Pollution of the Sea By Dumping of  Waste and Other Materials" made USSR Goskomgidromet responsible  for issuing special and general authorizations for dumping. (The  statutes in the Convention do not apply to Navy ships, according  to an explanation from MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs].)    In June 1983 rules were coordinated for dumping radioactive  waste into the sea, with limitations concerning their activity,  packaging, and disposal areas (it was not until 1985 that a  Consultative Conference of the countries participating in the  Convention adopted a resolution concerning a temporary  moratorium on the burial of radioactive waste in the seas and  oceans). Within the framework of the Russo-Norwegian commission  for cooperation in the area of protecting the environment, in  1992 a group of experts on the radioactive pollution of the  Barents and Kara seas was created. In the summer of that year  the first joint Russo-Norwegian expedition to the Kara and  Barents seas occurred, with the direct participation of  Roskomgidromet [RF Service on Hydrometeorlogy and Environmental  Control].    By providing false information to the London Convention, the  Russian leaders violated international agreements on the  disposal of nuclear waste at sea. Every opportunity to carry out  an independent evaluation of the present-day situation with  regard to radioactive burials was blocked. For example, all  expeditions by the RAN Institute of Oceanology to the Barents  and Kara seas in 1980-1990 that stipulated research in the  disposal areas of nuclear waste were meticulously banned by the  directive agencies. This is also attested to by the cruise on  the "Solo" diesel ship, that belongs to the Greenpeace  international organization, which had been given authorization  to enter those areas after it had been towed to Murmansk...  Total Activity of Radioactive Waste in the Kara Sea    As was already mentioned, detailed reports on all the buried  radioactive waste from objects in the Murmansk Maritime  Steamship Agency were sent to the KSF Medical Service. Evidently  one can also find there data concerning burials of radioactive  waste that were carried out by the USSR Navy. By using that data  it should be possible to make a fairly accurate estimate of the  radioactivity (in PBq) in the Kara Sea. However, independent  experts are not even allowed to obtain that data. Realizing  this, certain researchers make their own estimates of the  radioactive pollution, and forecast the behavior of the  radioactive waste in the marine environment of the Kara Sea.    A similar attempt, on assignment from Greenpeace, was made  by  the English nuclear physicist G. Large, who worked for 20 years  at industrial nuclear sites. That researcher is well known as an  excellent specialist in the dumping of radioactive waste in the  seas and on nuclear technology. Usually it is no simple matter  to estimate the total radioactive "inventory" of the reactors in  submarines (radioactive equipment and fuel). The fact of the  matter is that the radioactivity of the fuel is defined by the  degree of irradiation and the enrichment of the fuel with  uranium (U-235). By comparing American navy reactors with Soviet  ones, G. Large provided an approximate estimate of the reactor  fuel fillers and radioactive waste that are located in the Kara  Sea.    Under the pressure of public opinion, Russian President B.  N.  Yeltsin in October 1992 issued an edict concerning the creation  of a special commission (under the leadership of A. V.  Yablokov), which was given the responsibility of establishing  precisely and officially providing the London Convention on  Dumping with materials concerning the burials of radioactive  waste in the seas of Russia, including the Kara Sea. The  commission included representatives of organizations that had  taken part in the burials. Unfortunately, the list of  organizations that had participated in the work did not include  the Russian Academy of Sciences, so that, once again, there  arise doubts relative to the objectivity and completeness of the  information that was submitted. Now, when the commission has  completed its work, A. V. Yablokov, adviser to the RF president  on questions of ecology and the protection of health, and  corresponding member of the RAN, has submitted the latest White  Book, entitled "Facts and Problems Linked With the Burial of  Radioactive Waste in the Seas That Wash the Territory of the  Russian Federation." In that document it is stated that, in the  North and the Far East, burials of liquid radioactive waste were  carried out in five areas of the Barents Sea and nine areas of  the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea of Japan, and the open part of the  Pacific Ocean; and solid radioactive waste in eight areas near  the coast of Novaya Zemlya and in the Kara Sea, and four areas  in the Far East.    In 1959-1992 the total amount of liquid radioactive waste  that was dumped into the northern seas, according to the  commission's data, had a total activity of approximate 315 TBq  (one TBq --tetrabecquerel = 1 x 10[.sup]12[/] Bq); and solid,  a total activity (according to expert estimates as of the moment  of burial) of approximately 590 TBq. In the Far East seas these  values were, respectively, 12,300 and 6200 Ci. The items that  represent potential danger first of all are the reactors of  nuclear submarines and the nuclear "Lenin" icebreaker (total  buried, 12 reactors and their parts without nuclear fuel,  including three in the Far East) and seven in the malfunctioning  state with nuclear fuel not unloaded (all in the north). The  materials cited in the White Book will, of course, be submitted  to the Secretariat of the London Convention and IAEA.  <H5>  Sources of Radioactive Pollution </H5>   There arises the question of the further fate of the  radioactive waste in the Kara Sea. Judging by the official  answers from Minmorflot, the packaging of the radioactive waste  is designed for a sufficiently long period of time, estimated at  500 years. But what will happen then? There is another  disturbing fact: a large number of burials lie on the bottom of  bays, at a shallow depth (up to 20 meters). In those places,  according to data available to the author of this article, there  is a rather intensive movement of fragmental material, as a  result of which the packaging of the waste products corrodes and  its thickness is reduced. This circumstance obliges  oceanologists to insist on the carrying out within the near  future of a careful study of the Kara graveyards with manned  underwater apparatuses. According to our information, in 1993 it  is planned to conduct research in radioactive waste disposal  areas, in particular, in Zaliv Abrosimova, Zaliv Stepovogo, and  Zaliv Tsivolki, as well as in the open part of the sea at  location 7248' north latitude, 5818' east longitude.    The total quantity of radioactive substances in the waters  of  the Kara Sea is the result primarily of tests of nuclear bombs  in the atmosphere and under water, which were carried out on  Novaya Zemlya since 1956, and the penetration of radionuclides  through cracks in the rocks during underground tests of nuclear  weapons on Novaya Zemlya after the banning of tests in the  atmosphere an in the sea. Radionuclides were detected during the  first landing on the southern island by a Greenpeace group in  October 1990. On the slope of a mountain close to an old mine  shaft they found at least three "hot spots" with considerable  radioactivity (more than 50 Bq/cm[.sup]2[/] with an overall  background of approximately 12-15 Bq/cm[.sup]2[/]. The "hot  spots" were located 400 meters from the shaft, and two  kilometers from it the instrument readings fell to 1.6-1.8  Bq/cm[.sup]2[/]. The high radiation in the shaft area, and  the existence of "hot spots" there, indicate that products from  underground tests have gotten into the atmosphere.    Another source of radionuclides in the Kara Sea is the  disposals of waste products by the radiochemical plant in  Windscale (England). The maximum concentration of [.sup]90[/]  Sr in the waters entering the Barents Sea exceeds  the global level by approximately a factor of 2. The time for  carrying the radionuclides into the southwestern part of the  Kara Sea, according to data provided by research in the  expedition on the "Otto Shmidt" ship (1982) is 6.2 years.    The outflows of the Ob River serve as another, so far  unevaluated, source of the radioactive pollution of the Kara  Sea. They will have to be ascertained in future expeditions,  including those of the RAN Institute of Oceanology.    As a result it is necessary, unfortunately, to assert that  the former USSR violated the major requirements of the IAEA that  pertain to the dumping of radioactive waste in the seas and that  prescribe the burial of radioactive waste beyond the limits of  the shelf (no closer than 200 miles from the shore) at a depth  of no less than 4000 meters and only in the band of latitudes  from 50 north latitude to 50 south latitude. There  continue to be violations of the Russian Federation Law  "Protection of the Environment" (December 1991).    All the research studies of the radiation situation after  1967 were conducted in the waters located 50-100 km from the  burial areas of solid radioactive waste. In those waste burial  areas themselves, no monitoring of the radiation situation was  carried out throughout a 25-year period, and the system of  monitoring did not begin to be created until 1992. The items  that represent the greatest potential radioecological danger are  the reactors of nuclear submarines that were dumped in the  shallow bays of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago in the Kara Sea,  and the screen assembly of the "Lenin" nuclear icebreaker with  nuclear fuel that had not been unloaded.    What steps, then, should be undertaken to assure that the  radioactive pollution does not intensify in the Kara Sea? In our  opinion, it is necessary first of all to carry out the expensive  and dangerous operation of raising the solid radioactive waste  and burying it in special storage facilities on land.

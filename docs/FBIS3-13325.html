Despite Rabbani's plea, most people expect more fighting.  Countless cease-fire agreements have collapsed and the current  fighting is perhaps the most intense since the ousting of the  communist government in 1992.    The latest cease-fire plan has been negotiated by military  and political leaders from southwestern Afghanistan who recently  arrived in Kabul. Since the fighting started 1 January, at  least 1,000 people have been killed, more than 12,000 have been  wounded, and some 600,000 have been driven from their homes.</p>

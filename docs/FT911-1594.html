			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Survey of Franchising (7): Sales grooming helps business off the ground - Marketing experience is useful KATRINA Moss went into franchising for the simple reason that she failed to see why she had to work so hard for someone else without getting the financial rewards for her efforts. 'My background was in selling but I didn't really know what I could do with it to set up a business on my own,' she recalls. Ms Moss, then in her late 20s, researched the franchise market for about two years. She was looking for a business in which she could take advantage of her background in sales and marketing for such companies as Thomson Directories and the Post Office's on-site video sales operation. 'The trouble was that many franchises on offer were too expensive or in such areas as cleaning, which wasn't what I wanted at all,' she recalls. But then Ms Moss did something against the advice of all the franchise books and magazines. 'I saw an advertisement in a newspaper on a Thursday, visited the company concerned on the Friday and signed up on the Monday. 'I know it was the wrong thing to do but I was so fed up with waiting that when I saw something I really wanted, I grabbed at it.' She does not advise others to follow the same approach, when caution is the watchword for would-be franchisees. The franchise that had captured her attention was called Re-Nu, a somewhat twee name for what is a simple idea. Instead of householders splashing out on a new kitchen, the Re-Nu system uses the frames of existing kitchen units to create a 'new' kitchen for a fraction of the price of a new one. The concept was the brainchild of chairman Mr Mal Weeraratne, who has established a network of 60 franchises in the UK and hopes for 100 by the end of this year. 'We have ex-miners, nurses, housewives and service personnel all running successful businesses,' he says. 'Our strength lies in our business plan which, if adhered to, can produce profits of Pounds 40,000 plus in the first year.' Initial investment is Pounds 20,000, of which Pounds 6,000 is the franchise fee. Ms Moss did not quite reach that target at first. She started her franchise business at the age of 30 in May 1988, working from her Surrey home and covering the Kingston, Epsom and Esher areas. She missed her first year sales target of Pounds 100,000 by Pounds 8,000 because, she says, of problems with her telephones. In her second year, in spite of illness she managed to increase turnover. In her third year, she expected recession to hit sales: 'But it's been our best year ever, probably because the recession has forced people to look for cheaper alternatives to having a completely new kitchen.' Her biggest problem, she recalls, was getting to grips with the mechanics of running a business: 'I was good at sales and marketing but didn't have any experience in administration, VAT returns and so on.' With more than 200 kitchens fitted, she finds that much of her business comes from referrals, although she spends some 15 per cent of turnover on advertising. After three years, she employs a salesperson and two fitters. More important, she can now afford to work part-time (between 20 and 30 hours a week) from home and still earn more than she did when in full-time employment. 'I don't think you can work part-time from the start and I think it helped me enormously to have a sales and marketing background which saved a lot of time in getting sales off the ground,' she recalls. 'But it has certainly changed my life for the better]'</p>

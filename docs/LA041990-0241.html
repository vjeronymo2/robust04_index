			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 2 LIVE CREW RAP GROUP ON STAGE DESPITE THREAT  </P> <P> The rap group 2 Live Crew performed before hundreds of fans early today without  incident despite threats by a prosecutor to have the musicians arrested on  obscenity charges.  </P> <P> The band began its 90-minute concert shortly after midnight, opening with a  song called "Martinez Rap," about Republican Gov. Bob Martinez's campaign  against explicit lyrics.  </P> <P> The nightclub Central City was filled to its 1,500-person capacity at $12.50 a  ticket for the one-night stand.  </P> <P> "Just business as usual. Arrests? Not by this department," said a duty officer  at Gainesville police headquarters who asked not to be named. "This whole  thing, we understand, was being publicized by the state attorney's office."  </P> <P> State Atty. Len Register had called some of 2 Live Crew's sexually explicit  songs "the most filthy thing I've ever encountered." He threatened to have the  band arrested if they played uncensored versions of songs such as "Me So  Horny," and "Move Somethin," which has lyrics referring to sadomasochistic sex  and violence against women.  </P> <P> Register's office said this morning that he was in meetings and would not be  available for comment until later in the day.  </P> <P> Police spokeswoman Sadie Darnell said before the concert that police received  no special orders from the state attorney's office. "I don't feel this issue is  over," though, she said this morning.  </P> <P> No Alachua County sheriff's officers were sent to the nightclub either, clerk  Lashaun Butler said.  </P> <P> Local officials in some Florida counties have banned some 2 Live Crew albums,  especially one called "As Nasty As They Wanna Be." Legislatures in several  states also have begun considering mandatory record labeling acts because of  the group's material.  </P> <P> The Miami-based group is led by Luther (Luke Skywalker) Campbell. Members are  David (Mr. Mixx) Hobbs, Chris (Fresh Ice Kid) Won Wong and Mark (Brother  Marquis) Ross.  </P></p>

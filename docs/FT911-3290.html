			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Volume low ahead of Golden Week holiday THE stronger yen failed to attract investors to equities yesterday, and share prices ended weaker after showing initial gains and trading within a narrow range for most of the day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average, which improved 254 points on Tuesday, lost 161.36 to 26,330.21 after a high for the day of 26,585.66 and a low of 26,329.22. Activity remained slack ahead of the Golden Week holidays, with 350m shares changing hands. Traders said that yesterday was the last trading day for April deliveries, and that this also depressed turnover. Declines led advances by 635 to 329, with 170 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 8.49 to 1,974.03, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was up a slight 0.55 at 1,496.72. The fall on the futures market prompted profit-taking by investors looking to sell before the holidays. But Mr Dominic Henderson at Jardine Fleming said many foreign investors were waiting to buy as soon as the currency market stabilised. Japanese brokerages tried to revive the market by promoting big companies with good earnings prospects. Kobe Steel, the most active issue of the day, rose to a high of Y555 but closed down a net Y7 at Y545. The company expects its aluminium business to boost its results. Other large-capital issues also lost ground, with Nippon Steel down Y3 to Y469. Electricals responded favourably to comments by Mr Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve chairman, that the US economy was recovering. Sharp advanced Y30 to Y1,580. Investors turned to small and medium-sized companies with low liquidity for short-term profits. Tsugami, a medium-sized machine tool maker, climbed Y81 to Y850 on individual buying. The company is expected to increase sales of its machine tools due to demand for labour-saving equipment. Taiyo Sanso, an industrial gas producer, gained Y79 to Y1,070, rising over Y1,000 for the first time since November. Individual investors sought the stock on the company's growth in gas purification systems for semiconductors. Nippon Electric Glass, a cathode ray tube maker, forged ahead Y170 to Y2,150. It has developed technology to mass-produce boro-silicate glass for liquid crystal displays. Rumours that a large speculative group was chasing the issue also buoyed the shares. Mitsumi, a system components manufacturer, put on Y10 to Y1,640 on reports that it has received additional orders for Super Family Computer, Nintendo's new video game. Nippon Oil rose to Y1,130 on news that it expects pre-tax profits for the year to end-March to increase by 120 per cent, but closed unchanged at Y1,090 on profit-taking. Other oil refiners remained firm, with General Sekiyu adding Y90 at Y1,200 and Mitsubishi Oil Y20 at Y1,160. Itoman, the trading company in financial trouble due to its extensive real estate and stock investments, fell Y33 to Y628. The company is now involved in an art scandal, and reports that prosecutors had started investigations by searching the company's offices prompted heavy selling. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 77.07 to 29,346.71 on volume of 32.6m shares. Roundup MOST Pacific Rim markets recovered yesterday after their recent weakness. NEW ZEALAND, after three days of falls, rallied on foreign buying interest and a positive outlook for domestic interest rates. The Barclays index closed 29.49 or 2.0 per cent higher at 1,473.45 after turnover of NZDollars 20.9m (NZDollars 13.9m). Fletcher Challenge put on 8 cents to NZDollars 3.92 on volume of 1.6m shares, while Carter Holt Harvey regained 6 cents to NZDollars 1.73 on 2.8m shares traded. The market is closed today for Anzac Day. JAKARTA was higher in active trading following a tightening in disclosure rules. Volume expanded to 7.42m shares from 5.83m and the index rose 4.03 to 419.58. The Capital Market Supervisory Board, which runs the exchange, tightened disclosure rules for public companies, including a requirement to present detailed financial reports and analysis on prospects. The banking sector led the gains on speculation that the government would soon allow foreigners to buy banking shares. AUSTRALIA gained ground ahead of the Veterans Holiday today, mainly as investors converted expiring options. The All Ordinaries index improved 7.9 to 1,518.5 but turnover fell to ADollars 241m from ADollars 253m. Australian Consolidated Investments sold 7 per cent or 100m shares in Nine Network for 55 cents a share to a wide spread of investors. Nine Network eased 2 cents to 58 cents. HONG KONG rebounded in moderate trading, but steep early gains were pared by late profit-taking. The Hang Seng index climbed 63 points shortly after the opening but ended 35.65 up at 3,605.29 on turnover of HKDollars 1.2bn (HKDollars 1.3bn). MANILA finished higher on short-covering and bargain hunting. The composite index rose 23.48 to 1,046.31 in turnover of 111.4m pesos, against a previous 116.6m. TAIWAN bounced up in narrow trading, driving the market again to the 5,800 chart resistance point. However, there was concern over power rationing which could harm industry's productivity. The weighted index rallied 74.65 or 1.3 per cent to 5,806.74. Turnover slipped to TDollars 53.59bn from TDollars 70.73bn. SINGAPORE closed at the day's high after a soft start. The Straits Times Industrial index gained 10.58 to 1,536.67 in turnover of SDollars 188.5m, up from SDollars 145m. KUALA LUMPUR's composite index firmed 2.46 to 590.84 in volume of 46.7m shares, after Tuesday's 35.9m.</p>

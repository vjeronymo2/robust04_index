			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Willaire shares suspended at 1 1/4 p Shares in Willaire Group, which last October put its electronics arm into liquidation, were suspended at 1 1/4 p on Friday pending clarification of the group's financial state. In December it announced a Pounds 2.04m loss for the year to April 30 and said it was unable to pay a dividend on either the ordinary or the preference shares because of a lack of distributable reserves. The company had launched a Pounds 4.5m rights issue in May with the aim of using part of the funds for the electronics business. In September, however, it put that division into liquidation just a few days after changing the divisional name from Willaire Electronics to Airmead. Before the rights issue, the group's debts amounted to about Pounds 12m.</p>

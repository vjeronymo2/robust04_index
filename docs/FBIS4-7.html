			<p>SUMMARY                                   The Japanese business community and the Japanese media have  sharply criticized the market opening package that the Japanese  Government released on 29 March--and by implication the  government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa--for failing to  include concrete measures to reduce Japan's trade surplus and  ease trade tensions with the United States.  Japanese press  reporting suggests that a number of Japanese Government officials  are concerned that this criticism--along with that of Washington-  -may further weaken Hosokawa's increasingly shaky domestic  political standing.  These officials appear to be trying to limit  the damage by portraying Prime Minister Hosokawa as favoring  bolder steps and trying to shift the blame for the package's  weaknesses onto a recalcitrant bureaucracy.  Public comments on  the package by senior Japanese leaders, meanwhile, have suggested  that the government remains divided over how to flesh the package  out in follow-up measures promised for June.                               END SUMMARY      Japanese business leaders and the Japanese press have for the  most part expressed disappointment in the Japanese Government's  market opening package.  Either directly or in somewhat veiled  terms, they have criticized it for its lack of detail and its  failure to address some of the measures that they believe are  needed to jump-start the floundering Japanese economy and reduce  trade tensions with the United States.  For example:      -- According to a 29 March Kyodo report, Kosaku Inaba, chairman  of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, described the  package as containing "little substance."      -- Tadashi Okuda, president of Japan's largest bank, Dai Ichi  Kangyo and chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations of  Japan, also reportedly complained about the lack of detail in the  package, stating that "almost all the main parts" were left to be  fleshed out in the follow-up package promised for June.  According to a 29 March Kyodo report,  Okuda warned that unless  the package is fleshed out quickly, it will do little to  alleviate bilateral trade tensions.      -- Although Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of  Economic Organizations (Keidanren), Japan's largest business  organization, reportedly praised the intentions behind the  package, he criticized it indirectly by indicating that the  government needed to include concrete proposals for a three-year  tax cut and a significant 100 trillion yen increase in public  works spending in the follow-up program (Kyodo, 29 March).      Press Commentary      Much Japanese press commentary has also criticized the package,  often calling on the government to take measures similar to those  being sought by the United States in its negotiations with Japan.  In an unusually blunt editorial on 30 March, Japan's most  influential economic newspaper, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, criticized  the package for failing to present effective proposals to reduce  bilateral trade tensions, for delaying until June concrete  proposals on deregulating the Japanese economy, and for offering  only vague promises, couched in phrases like "attempts will be  made to further improve" and "plans will be drawn up," about its  plans to reduce Japan's trade surplus.  The paper argued that  Japan was "at a stage where it must pay serious attention to  'results'" and  that achieving good trade results has become a  priority task for Japan itself."  It concluded by calling on the  government to devise concrete measures to reduce the trade  surplus.  Similarly, Asahi Shimbun, Japan's second largest  newspaper, described the package as "not a satisfactory answer to  the United States" and criticized it for failing to spell out  "concrete measures to ease regulations" and for delaying until  June a decision on tax cuts and increased public spending.  The  paper added that it was "imperative" for the government to draw  up "substantial market-opening measures" by the end of June.      Press commentary on the market opening package has not been  entirely supportive of measures sought by Washington, however.  Both the Nihon Keizai Shimbun and Asahi Shimbun editorials  criticized the United States for demanding the setting of  numerical targets to measure Japan's trade performance.  Nihon  Keizai Shimbun described Prime Minister Hosokawa's refusal to  accept such targets at his February summit with President Clinton  as "the right answer to the demand" and characterized the  "results-oriented trade policy" of the United States and the  strategy adopted by Washington to achieve it as "worrisome."  Asahi Shimbun stated that if Japan and the United States "try to  increase dealings forcibly by setting targets in trade talks,  there will be distortions in economic activities."  The paper  added that while Japan needed to increase imports by boosting  domestic demand and reducing market barriers, it "has to reject  unreasonable demands."      Some of the press commentary on the package may help to further  erode public confidence in the Hosokawa cabinet because it either  blamed the government directly for the package's weaknesses or  highlighted Hosokawa's ineffectiveness in the face of  bureaucratic opposition and infighting within his coalition.  The  30 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun editorial, for instance, criticized  the government for failing to move beyond its refusal to accept  U.S. demands for the setting of objective criteria to measure  Japan's trade performance and "prepare an alternative" to present  to Washington.  In a 30 March editorial, Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's  most widely read newspaper, questioned Hosokawa's leadership,  suggesting that he had failed to get many of his "political  decisions and ideas" included in the package.  The paper argued  that in the absence of "political decision-making on key issues,"  the market-opening package was bound to be weak.  Similarly, a 30  March Sankei Shimbun article portrayed the prime minister as  almost completely paralyzed by bureaucratic opposition.  It  quoted a Ministry of Finance official as asserting that, during  negotiations over the market opening package, "the Prime  Minister's Office was isolated."      Concern About Political Repercussions      A number of Japanese officials have reacted to the criticism of  the package in somewhat defensive terms, suggesting that they are  are trying to avoid further exacerbating friction with the United  States and limit the domestic impact of the criticism.  Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who was closely involved in  brokering the package, reportedly responded to U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor's criticism of the package by  stressing that more measures would be forthcoming in June.  According to a 30 March Kyodo report, Takemura stated that it was  "enormously important for the Japanese Government to put all its  energy into compiling such measures in June, because the U.S. is  focusing on our June package."  According to another 30 March  Kyodo report, an unidentified government source countered  Ambassador Kantor's criticism by claiming that the package was in  fact a "significant step" in trade negotiations with the United  States, adding, like Takemura, that fuller measures would come in  June.  Japanese Ambassador to Washington Takakazu Kuriyama told  Nihon Keizai Shimbun on 29 March that Japan had "to make (the  United States) understand that this is not a one-shot effort"  (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 30 March).      The tone of some of the comments some officials made to the press  suggests that officials around the prime minister may be  particularly concerned about the domestic political impact that  criticism will have on Hosokawa's government, and may be moving  to try to minimize it.  For example, an unidentified government  source described the prime minister as having been forced "by  opposition from bureaucrats . . . to give up all of his ideas and  delay formulating a program."   The source went on to describe the  prime minister as having been in favor of many of the measures  called for by Japanese business, the Japanese press, and  Washington, including significantly increased public investment,  a long-term income tax cut, and a commitment to reduce Japan's  trade surplus by a specific target.  The source asserted that  bureaucrats in the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI), and the Economic  Planning Agency (EPA) resisted the prime minister's proposals and  the prime minister was "at the mercy of the bureaucrats in MITI  and MOF."  Similarly, an unidentified senior government official  reportedly told the 30 March Yomiuri Shimbun that some of the  positive features of the market opening package, including the  projection that Japan would reduce the ratio of its current  account surplus to its gross domestic product (GDP) in 1994 to  2.8 percent, was included only at the insistence of Hosokawa's  office.      Continued Government Divisions      Judging from the public comments of senior Japanese Government  officials on the market opening package, the government remains  divided over how far it must go to flesh out the package in the  June measures.  According to a 29 March Kyodo report, Finance  Minister Hirohisa Fujii sought to minimize the scope of the  current package, telling the press that the projection for  reducing Japan's current account surplus to 2.8 percent of GDP  was "not a numerical target."  He added that he remained opposed  to using construction bonds to finance the increased public works  spending that is under consideration for the June package-  -raising doubts that the government will be able to agree on a  significant increase in time to include it in the enhanced  package.  Repeating a standard argument used by the Ministry of  Finance to oppose spending increases, Fujii argued that such  bonds would incur public debt and be a burden for future  generations.   According to another 29 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun  report, EPA Director General Manae Kubota also told a news  conference on the 29th that the 2.8 percent figure was not a  "promise or target,"  and indicated only that the government  would "make efforts" to achieve it.      Outlook      Prime Minister Hosokawa's government is likely to have difficulty  reaching a consensus on how to flesh out the market opening  package because parts of his ruling coalition and the bureaucracy  continue to oppose some of the proposed measures.  In addition,  Hosokawa's continuing political problems--including the  allegations that he was involved in a questionable financial  dealing and the difficulty he is having in getting the fiscal  year 1994 budget through the Diet--may weaken the prime minister  to the extent that he will be unable to exert the authority  necessary to break the deadlock over the package.  Despite the  attempts of those around the prime minister to distance Hosokawa  from the weak points of the market opening package, domestic  criticism of the package may further compound Hosokawa's  political problems, contributing to the growing impression that  he is  ineffective and further eroding public confidence in his  government.

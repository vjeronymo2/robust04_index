			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Table III presents the projected average payments per case under the changes for FY 1995 for urban and rural hospitals and for the different categories of hospitals shown in Table I. It compares the projected payments for FY 1995 with the average estimated per case payments for FY 1994. Thus, this table presents, in terms of the average dollar amounts paid per discharge, the combined effects of the changes presented in Table I. That is, the percentage changes shown in the last column of Table I equal the percentage changes in average payments from October 1, 1993 to October 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Impact of Changes in the Capital Prospective Payment System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. General Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We now have data that were unavailable in previous impact analyses. Specifically, we have cost report data for the first year of the capital prospective payment system (cost reports beginning in FY 1992) available through the December 1993 update of the Hospital Cost Report Information System (HCRIS). We also have information on the aggregate amount of obligated capital approved by the fiscal intermediaries. However, our impact analysis of payment changes for capital-related costs is still limited by the lack of hospital-specific data on several items. These are the hospital's projected new capital costs for each year, its projected old capital costs for each year, and the actual amounts of obligated capital that will be put in use for patient care and recognized as Medicare old capital costs in each year. The lack of such information affects our impact analysis in the following ways:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Major investment in hospital capital assets (for example in building and major fixed equipment) occurs at irregular intervals. As a result, there can be significant variation in the growth rates of Medicare capital-related costs per case among hospitals. We do not have the necessary hospital-specific budget data to project the hospital capital growth rate for an individual hospital. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Moreover, our policy of recognizing certain obligated capital as old capital complicates the problem of projecting future capital-related costs for individual hospitals. Under &sect;412.302(c), a hospital was required to notify its intermediary that it has obligated capital, no later than the later of October 1, 1992 or 90 days after the beginning of the hospital's first cost reporting period under the capital prospective payment system. The intermediary must then notify the hospital of its determination whether the criteria for recognition of obligated capital have been met by the later of the end of the hospital's first cost reporting period subject to the capital prospective payment system or 9 months after the receipt of the hospital's notification. The amount that is recognized as old capital is limited to the lesser of the actual allowable costs when the asset is put in use for patient care or the estimated costs of the capital expenditure at the time it was obligated. We have substantial information regarding intermediary determinations of aggregate projected obligated capital amounts. However, we still do not know when these projects will actually be put into use for patient care, the amount that will be recognized as obligated capital when the project is put into use, or the Medicare share of the recognized costs. Therefore, we do not know actual obligated capital commitments to be used in the FY 1995 capital cost projections. We discuss in Appendix B the assumptions and computations we employ to generate the amount of obligated capital commitments for use in the FY 1995 capital cost projections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Table IV of this appendix, we present the redistributive effects that are expected to occur between ``hold-harmless'' hospitals and ``fully prospective'' hospitals in FY 1995. In addition, we have integrated sufficient hospital-specific information into our actuarial model to project the impact of FY 1995 capital payment policies by the standard prospective payment system hospital groupings. We caution that while we now have actual information on the effects of the transition payment methodology and interim payments under the capital prospective payment system and cost report data for most hospitals, we need to generate randomly numbers for the change in old capital costs, new capital costs for each year, and obligated amounts that will be put in use for patient care services and recognized as old capital each year. This means that we continue to be unable to predict accurately an individual hospital's FY 1995 capital costs; however, with the more recent data on the experience to date under the capital prospective payment system, there is adequate information to estimate the aggregate impact on most hospital groupings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We present the transition payment methodology by hospital grouping in Table V. In Table VI we present the results of the cross-sectional analysis using the results of our actuarial model. This table presents the aggregate impact of the FY 1995 payment policies. In Table VII, we present a simulation of payments based on 100 percent of the Federal rate. This simulation shows the average percentage change in the Federal rate attributable to the updated rate and changes in payment adjustments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: Mitsubishi expansion ends as earnings fall SEVEN years of sales expansion at Mitsubishi Motors ended when the Japanese carmaker saw first-half sales and pre-tax profits slip against a depressed domestic market and pressures from a rising yen. In the first six months, Mitsubishi's sales declined 1.6 per cent to Y1,217bn (Dollars 11.33bn) from Y1,237bn, with every product category except mini vehicles suffering a downturn in volume. Operating profits suffered a sharper fall of 18.8 per cent to Y19.2bn (Y23.6bn) which mirrored both the fall in sales and the impact of the yen's sharp appreciation against other major currencies. Mitsubishi made up for the fall in operating profits partly through cost-cutting efforts and price increases which helped the company to keep the drop in pre-tax profits to 6.2 per cent at Y17.2bn from Y18.3bn. A sharp decline in the sale of trucks led to a 38 per cent fall in the number of vehicles sold. Export sales increased slightly, while sales of car components to overseas subsidiaries in the US and the Asia Pacific region increased by 30 per cent. In the year to March, MMC expects sales to decline 2.5 per cent to Y2,550bn and pre-tax profits to fall 9.8 per cent to Y42bn. 'It is very difficult to expect sales to increase under the current circumstances,' the company said. As part of its cost-cutting efforts, capital expenditure will be lowered to about Y98bn compared with an initially forecast Y150bn.</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Wage gap 'wider than in 1886' THE GAP between the earnings of the highest and lowest-paid employees is wider today than it was in Victorian times, according to an analysis of official figures carried out for the Council of Europe by the Low Pay Unit pressure group. According to the LPU analysis the lowest tenth of male earnings was 68.6 per cent of median male earnings in 1886, when pay figures were first recorded. In 1991 the figure had dropped to 64.2 per cent. At the same time the high-est tenth of male earnings were 143.1 per cent of the median in 1886 and 160.1 per cent in 1991, the figures show. More than 27 per cent of full-time workers earn less than the LPU's low pay threshold - set at two thirds of average male earnings  - even when overtime pay is included, according to the group. New Review No 13. Available from Low Pay Unit, 9 Upper Berkeley St, London W1H 8BY. Price Pounds 3.50.</p>

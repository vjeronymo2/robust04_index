			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Race for the White House: California water allocation bill signed PRESIDENT George Bush has signed controversial legislation reallocating scarce California water supplies from agriculture to the state's cities and drought-threatened wildlife, despite the opposition of the state's farmers and a last-minute appeal for a presidential veto from California's Republican Governor Pete Wilson. The water bill also includes funding for several popular large scale dam and water projects throughout the west, forcing the president to choose between the interests of his California supporters and those in other states who were urging passage of the bill. It addresses a bitter century-long battle between agricultural and urban interests over water rights in California. Farmers now use about 85 per cent of the state's water, while city residents and other industries face severe rationing after six years of drought. The bill signed on Friday will reform allocation of water supplies from the Central Valley Project (CVP), a massive system of 20 dams and miles of canals, built by the federal government in the late 1930s, that transports water from northern California to the Central Valley, where it is used to irrigate about 3m acres of farmland. The changes 'will cripple farmers in the nation's most productive agricultural region, without solving California's basic water problem,' said Mr Bob Vice, president of the California Farm Bureau Federation. Growers will be forced to leave land fallow and lay off workers, he predicted. Environmentalists were, however, pleased by the president's decision. 'This is a big day in California's water history,' said Mr Tom Graff of the Environmental Defence Fund, one of the groups that has fought hard for the legislation. The bill reserves roughly 10 per cent of the amount of water that would be delivered by the CVP in a year of normal rainfall to replenish river flows and reservoir levels, restoring fish and waterfowl habitats destroyed by diversion of water to the Central Valley. It also provides city dwellers with access to CVP water supplies by enabling farmers, for the first time, to sell surplus supplies to cities. Although the president has sided with the urban majority in California, his decision is not seen as a big vote-winner in the state, where he is trailing Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, in opinion polls. Rather, the passage of the water bill is seen as a defeat for the president, governor and other Republican politicians who have long opposed the water reform measures. Mr Bush was put in a 'no win situation' by Democratic lawmakers, Mr Wilson charged.</p>

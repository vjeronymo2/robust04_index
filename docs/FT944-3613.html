			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / FDP closes ranks around Kinkel: Leader calls confidence vote after chorus of criticism from party members Germany's Free Democrats, desperate to reverse a string of election defeats, yesterday closed ranks behind Mr Klaus Kinkel, party leader and foreign minister, after he called a surprise confidence vote at a special party congress. Mr Kinkel, who was assailed for weak leadership at the congress on Sunday, called a snap vote early yesterday morning following an emotional speech in which he appealed for unity. 'It was very bitter. Very bitter. The words I heard from the delegates,' he told the packed congress hall in Gera, in the eastern state of Thuringia. Despite the unprecedented hostility to his keynote speech on Sunday afternoon, Mr Kinkel, instead of resigning, threw down the gauntlet to the delegates. More than 65 per cent of the delegates (390) voted for him, while 185 abstained. 'The vote is acceptable,' a clearly relieved Mr Kinkel said later. Members of the party presidium said Mr Kinkel had seriously considered resigning. But Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister who had personally chosen Mr Kinkel as his successor and backed him as party leader, had persuaded him to remain on, at least until June when the party holds a special congress. The conference has also set up a a commission to examine whether the same person should be party leader and a minister. Senior FDP members said they were concerned that if Mr Kinkel had resigned, a new party leader might try to distance the FDP from the coalition in a way which could potentially undermine the fragile stability of the government, which has a majority of only 10 in the Bundestag, or lower house. But few delegates believe the vote for Mr Kinkel will resolve the fundamental problems facing the FDP, the junior partner in the coalition headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union since 1982. 'We should have voted him out,' said Mr Heinrich Sander from the North Rhine-Westphalia party organisation which faces state elections in May. 'We have lost time. We will never get ourselves ready in time for the February elections in Hesse.' Mr Horst Vetter from Berlin said the party had shown that it did not have the courage for a new beginning. 'The party was afraid. The old party hands rallied behind Kinkel because, at the moment, there is no alternative to him,' he said. Mr Werner Brandler, a delegate from Thuringia, said: 'Regardless of this vote, the crisis is not over. Wait until June. The party will face the same problems. Where can we go? How many more elections can we afford to lose?' In 10 consecutive elections throughout the past 18 months, the FDP has failed to be re-elected to state parliaments, failed to be elected to the European parliament, failed to have its presidential candidate elected, and barely scraped back into the Bundestag in October's parliamentary elections. But the last two days in Gera represent more than the culmination of a series of election defeats. Rather they are the climax of a long crisis in the FDP which started in 1982 when the party, which had been in coalition with the Social Democrats, withdrew and then joined a coalition under Mr Kohl's conservatives. 'That was the beginning of the crisis,' said Mr Michael Goldmann from Lower Saxony. Thousands of party members, particularly the professionals and intellectuals, left the party in disgust. Some completely withdrew from political activity while, over the past decade, others joined or voted for the Greens as they became the liberal alternative to the FDP. The FDP in west Germany has only 50,000 members, the party in east Germany has less than 30,000. 'The problem is that we have lost our identity as a liberal party because we have had to make too many compromises with the CDU,' said Mr Walter Klein from North Rhine-Westphalia. 'We are the lap dogs of the CDU at the expense of defending our liberal political and economic traditions.' Grassroots members believe the parliamentary party has compromised on too much of its liberal programme: cutting bureaucracy, reducing taxes, promoting greater economic liberalisation, and allowing easier access to citizenship. The party managed to paper over the cracks after 1982 largely because it had powerful personalities, such as Mr Genscher and Mr Otto Lambsdorff, party leader until June 1993 when he was succeeded by Mr Kinkel. 'With Genscher the party never bothered to question its direction,' said Ms Cornelia Schmaltz-Jacobsen, head of the federal office for foreigners' issues. 'Time and complacency have caught up with us.' The party yesterday set itself the task of building a new structure, improving the grassroots organisation, establishing more open communication between the central leadership and the local level, and electing Mr Guido Westerwelle, a party functionary, as the new general secretary. But, as these decisions were being debated, there were few delegates who believed that those motions, and the show of support for Mr Kinkel, would be enough to rescue the party from defeat in Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. Viswam] </F>   [Text] On board the Prime Minister's aircraft from  London to Edinburgh, March 16: Britain's stand on Kashmir,  though not identical with that of India, was nonetheless not  very far either, the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao said  on Wednesday.    Talking to newsmen accompanying him on his visit to the  United Kingdom on board his aircraft, the Prime Minister said  that the three-point formula being advocated by Britain needed  to be studied and analysed further.    He said he was aware of the British position and had seen  the  three points advanced by the British government in the recent  past.    "On the whole," he said, "their position is not identical  with ours, but then it is not very far either."    "We will study their position further before making an  assessment," he added.    The three points advocated by Britian are first, a  resumption  of dialogue between India and Pakistan, second the restoration  of the democratic process in Kashmir, and third, the cessation  of external terrorism in the valley.    India, on the other hand, has been insisting that the  Pakistan abetment of subversion and terrorism should cease first  as a pre-condition for the normalisation of the situation in the  valley. India has made it clear that it is very keen on  restoring the political process in Kashmir, and it has also  expressed its readiness to initiate bilateral discussion with  Pakistan on Kashmir, and if Pakistan was not willing to do so,  it was prepared to talk to Pakistan on settling other  outstanding bilateral issues.    However, on the broader question of terrorism, which was a  crucial element in respect of the Kashmir question, the views of  India and Britain converged. Britain appeared to have a better  understanding of what India is going through, what it is  suffering and what the experience has been. Nothing illustrated  better the impact of the "menace of terrorism" than the fact  that a visitor to Britain had to go from airport to airport to  land or take off to ward off danger from the menace.    The Prime Minister was obviously referring to the fact that  following the series of mortar attacks on the Heathrow airport  mounted by the IRA [Irish Republican Army] terrorists, his own  aircraft had to be diverted to Gatwick, some 50 miles away,  similarly, by way of abundant caution, the British arranged for  his flight to Edinburgh from London take off not from Heathrow  or Gatwick but from the royal air force base at Brize Norton,  which is a two-hour drive from the heart of London.    "Just imagine," said the Prime Minister, "all this happening  in their own capital and all because of terrorism. They are  experiencing the same kind of terrorism which we have been  experiencing. Therefore, there is no elaborate need for the two  of us to convince each other about this menace."    Assessing the outcome of his goodwill visit to the United  Kingdom, the Prime Minister said it had "gone off very well."  His overall impression was that the atmosphere during the visit  was great friendliness and greater closeness.    As a result of which both economic and political relations  had firmed up on a constructive footing. The thrust of the  discussions he had had with his counterpart, Mr Major, as well  as with other British Ministers was a combination of both  economic and political.    Apart from bilateral issues, he had the opportunity to  discuss with them a lot of other issues in the international  sphere, such as Bosnia and the crisis in that region. The  British Prime Minister had informed him that there had been some  improvement in the Bosnian situation and he expected the  improvement to continue in the months to come. Asked whether  India was being approached to send more troops to Bosnia, the  Prime Minister said in the kind of situation which prevailed,  there was no point in making new proposals.    The Prime Minister said he had seen newspaper reports in  London about the intended purchase of Hawk trainer aircraft by  India from Britain. Dismissing suggestions that the deal figured  in the discussions, Mr Rao said that decisions in respect of  acquisition of military hardware were not taken during visits  such as his. There were established procedures for such  transactions, and so if there was any impression that the visit  was made as a result of decisions on such transactions it was  erroneous. The Prime Minister left London for Edinburgh on the  final lap of his journey after planting an oak tree at the Magna  Carta Memorial, the first time, he said, that any world leader  had been requested to do so on the spot where the charter was  signed. The rights figuring in the charter were the same as he  had been incorporated in chapter three of the Indian  Constitution.</p>

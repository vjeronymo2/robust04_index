			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 12 KYODO -- Japanese Foreign Minister  Koji Kakizawa suggested Sunday [12 June] China's fresh nuclear  test could influence Tokyo's future loans to Beijing, Japanese  officials said.    Kakizawa was quoted by a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman  as telling his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen that Japan has  always regarded banning nuclear tests as one of the highest  priorities in the field of disarmament and that it strongly  urges China not to repeat nuclear testing in the future.    The Japanese foreign minister said Friday's nuclear test was  also regrettable in light of the Japanese Government's  guidelines, released in June 1992, which state that recipient  countries of Japan's official development assistance (ODA)  should promote disarmament, the spokesman said.    Kakizawa's remarks suggested that China's failure to stop  nuclear tests may have a negative impact on Japan's yen loan  programs from fiscal 1996 and thereafter, the official said.    Qian reiterated that China's nuclear tests are the fewest  among those carried out by world nuclear powers, the spokesman  said.    The Japanese minister was in Beijing mainly to discuss  measures to cope with North Korea's suspected nuclear arms  development.</p>

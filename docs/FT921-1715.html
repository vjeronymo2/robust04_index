			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment: Nordic Countries (3): Trying times - Profile: S-E Banken MR Bo Ramfors has the look of a man who would like to put the recent past well behind him and push on fast. The two years that he has spent at the helm of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest commercial bank, have been particularly trying. He has been thwarted in his plan to create a giant Swedish banking and insurance group by merging with Skandia, the Swedish insurance group. At the same time, he has witnessed a dramatic increase in the bank's credit losses as the Swedish economy has plunged into recession. To cap it all, S-E Banken had its long-term debt rating lowered from AA to AA- by Standard &amp; Poor's in February 1992, reflecting concern over the bank's deteriorating asset quality. The Skandia affair, played out over several months, has been a serious setback for the bank and has cost it dearly. Back in October 1990, S-E Banken paid SKr4.7bn for an option on 28.2 per cent of the shares in Skandia, acquired from three companies: Investor and Providentia (the Wallenberg family investment companies which were in need of funds at the time) and Marieberg, the publishing group. S-E Banken, which is linked with the Wallenbergs, wanted to form a large banking and insurance group. Mr Ramfors, S-E Banken group chief executive, says: 'If S-E Banken and Skandia had merged, together we would have had about 25 per cent of the Swedish savings market' including bank accounts, collective funds and life insurance, and managing assets of SKr500bn-600bn. His aim was to sell life and non-life insurance products to a wider customer base through the bank's large branch network. Skandia - which has already established a series of cross-holdings and co-operation agreements with insurance companies in the Nordic region as part of its plan to establish a pan-Nordic insurance group - said it could see no overall benefits for its shareholders in linking up with S-E Banken. Although Skandia admits there are advantages to selling life insurance products through a bank network, it had reservations about what would happen to its non-life insurance business as a result of the merger. 'We don't have proof that selling non-life (insurance) through a bank is a success', says Mr Johan Bergenstjerna, head of Skandia's corporate office. So S-E Banken was snubbed in its wooing of Skandia, and was forced to sell most of its share option - at a loss of SKr415m - to Hafnia, the Danish insurance company, and Uni Storebrand, the Norwegian insurer, keeping only 4.9 per cent itself. Mr Ramfors says now that despite the cost of SKr415m he has 'no regrets' about the saga. Mr Gerard de Geer, who was chairman of Enskilda Securities in Sweden and Banque Scandinave in Geneva, and who was involved in the Skandia deal as a member of the bank's executive committee, decided to leave S-E Banken. Part of the reason, bank sources indicate, was that he was disappointed because the bank did not push harder to merge with Skandia. He was also understood to be disappointed that plans to fully merge Enskilda and Banque Scandinave were eventually abandoned for tax and legal reasons. S-E Banken is now building up its own insurance operations. While the problems over Skandia are unique to S-E Banken, the other blow it has suffered - its huge credit losses - are familiar to many other Swedish banks, and result from the combination of a deregulated banking environment, the economic downturn, and in some cases, rather lax credit controls. For years, Sweden's banks suffered restrictions on their lending, pricing, foreign exchange and foreign payments. Then, during the 1980s, Sweden's financial markets were deregulated and the commercial banks enjoyed a surge in profits. 'Suddenly, overnight, we could lend as much money as we wanted,' says Mr Ramfors. The economy boomed and property and stock prices surged, helped by easy credit. However, now that property prices have collapsed, many of the Swedish banks are regretting their over-exposure to the real estate sector. 'With the benefit of hindsight, the banks should have been more careful, they should have realised they were too exposed to property,' says one banking analyst. S-E Banken had to make loan-loss provisions of SKr4.76bn in 1991, compared with SKr1.95bn in 1990. These included a SKr352m loan-loss provision for finance company Gamlestaden, and combined loan-loss provisions of SKr1.1bn for Avena and Reinhold, two troubled real estate groups. These three companies account for about 30 per cent of S-E Banken's loan-loss provisions. Small and medium-sized companies account for about 60 per cent. As a result of these credit losses, S-E Banken's operating profit fell by 30 per cent to SKr2.33bn last year, from SKr3.31bn in 1990. Yet the bank's profit before provisions actually increased by 30 per cent from SKr5.46bn to SKr7.09bn in 1991, helped by cost-cutting measures and increasing net interest margins. Operating profit should continue to rise this year but Mr Ramfors expects further fall-out from the property sector. In other words, the outlook for 1992 remains gloomy.</p>

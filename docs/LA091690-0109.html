			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI UPSET BID ISN'T TAYLOR-MADE  </P> <P> Jim Taylor, a hero a week ago, missed 42-yard field-goal attempt with 54  seconds remaining as Southern Mississippi failed in its bid for a second  consecutive upset Saturday.  </P> <P> Taylor's attempt hit the right upright and bounced away, taking with it a  chance at upsetting Georgia.  </P> <P> With the Bulldogs' Larry Ware scoring two second-half touchdowns, Georgia (1-1)  beat the Golden Eagles, 18-17.  </P> <P> The victory ended a four-game Georgia losing streak, dating to last season.  Southern Mississippi dropped to 2-1.  </P> <P> Last week, Southern Mississippi upset Alabama, 27-24, on a 52-yard field goal  by Taylor.  </P> <P> Saturday, the Golden Eagles built a 17-6 lead before Ware, a junior, scored on  a 20-yard run to finish a 68-yard drive in the third quarter. He followed that  with a five-yard run with 6:04 left in the game, giving the Bulldogs the 18-17  lead.  </P> <P> Georgia missed two-point conversion passes, but got two 38-yard field goals  from John Kasay.  </P> <P> Brett Favre gave Southern Mississippi a 10-3 lead midway through the second  quarter when he hit Dwayne Nelson on a nine-yard pass after Terryl Ulmer had  recovered Andre Hastings' fumble on a kickoff at the Georgia 11.  </P> <P> With the score 10-6, Favre and Michael Jackson hooked up on a 68-yard touchdown  pass play to make it 17-10.  </P></p>

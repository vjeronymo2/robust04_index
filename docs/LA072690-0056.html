			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON: ESTROGEN AND CANCER  </P> <P> Question: Everything I read these days seems to indicate that women can take  estrogen without increasing their risk of breast cancer.  </P> <P> Yet I'm positive that, some years ago, estrogen was considered to increase the  risk of breast cancer. Am I wrong about what I think I remember, or has the  thinking changed in the past several years?  </P> <P> Answer: There is some evidence that, at one time, women who were treated with  estrogen did have a higher incidence of breast cancer than is true of women  being treated with estrogen today. The reason seems to be that higher doses of  the hormone were prescribed in the 1940s than is the case today.  </P></p>

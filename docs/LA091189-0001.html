			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: A ROYAL TROUBLEMAKER SAYS SHE'S LEARNED HER LESSON  </P> <P> Fergie says she was a royal pain as a child. The Duchess of York didn't take  issue with an old school report that described her as "slapdash, stubborn and  headstrong." "I always tried to do things and not get caught," the former Sarah  Ferguson said. "I put dye in the lavatory cistern and put glue on the teacher's  chair because it was maths, and I didn't like maths." But the wife of Britain's  Prince Andrew said that "when I finished up at school, I did work quite hard  and I was becoming more responsible by the minute." Childhood troublemaking may  not run in the family. The duchess said her 1-year-old daughter, Princess  Beatrice, is a "placid, happy little girl."  </P> <P>  -- Medical researchers in Britain are angry that Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher has canceled government plans for the country's biggest sex survey  because she believes that it would violate privacy. The $1.2-million survey  would have asked 20,000 adults explicit questions about their sex lives. Kaye  Wellings, a health researcher, complained: "This is not a survey motivated by  prurient curiosity into people's private lives." Researchers believe that the  project would have provided valuable information for the fight against AIDS.  </P> <P>  -- If your name were going down in history, you'd want it to be legible.  Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh has replaced his official signature, affixed  mechanically to thousands of documents he doesn't have time to sign. The  abandoned signature was described as an "E" and two squiggles plus a "B" and  two loops. Bayh said that a penmanship teacher had told him he should sign his  name more carefully, and that a high school student he once gave an autograph  said: "Come on, what's that?" The new official signature contains all eight  letters of the governor's name.  </P> <P>  -- As the New York Democratic primary nears, singer Paul Simon added his voice  to the supporters of City Council President David N. Dinkins, saying: "It's  time for a change" after three terms served by Mayor Edward I. Koch. Dinkins  responded: "With his help -- and the aid of all New Yorkers -- we will build  bridges over the troubled waters of this great but pained city." Meanwhile, a  new Daily News/WABC-TV poll showed Dinkins leading Koch 51% to 44%. DAVE  JOHNSON  </P></p>

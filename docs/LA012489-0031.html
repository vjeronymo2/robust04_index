			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT'S CUSTOMERS CAN DANCE ON  </P> <P> Folk dancing by patrons may continue at the Great Greek restaurant, despite  neighbors' complaints that the revelry attracts too many customers who make  noise late at night and gobble up parking on residential streets.  </P> <P> "The sole request here is to legalize the apparently spontaneous inclination of  patrons to join the dancing done by waiters," said John J. Parker, associate  zoning administrator for the city of Los Angeles, in a ruling released Monday.  </P> <P> Before the ruling, the restaurant's entertainment permit only had allowed the  waiters to dance. But when Greek folk music was played, waiters encouraged  diners to join them in conga-style lines.  </P> <P> Parker said he attached strict conditions to his approval to try to address the  neighbors' concerns.  </P> <P> The ruling requires that the restaurant hire two security guards to monitor  parking, noise and the number of restaurant patrons. It also requires that  outdoor lighting be subdued, that off-site parking be increased from 54 to 60  spaces, that garbage not be picked up after 10 p.m. and that neighbors who live  within 500 feet of the establishment be given its telephone number so they can  complain directly when problems arise.  </P> <P> However, neighborhood residents said they would appeal Parker's ruling to the  Board of Zoning Appeals because they think it rewards past illegal activities.  The Great Greek has been cited twice by the Los Angeles Fire Department for  exceeding its 119-person occupancy limit. And Parker said in the ruling that  the restaurant has not provided enough off-street parking.  </P> <P> "It sounds like Mr. Parker is saying, 'Well, they're breaking the law, so let's  make this legal so they won't be breaking the law anymore,' " said John Allen,  a member of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not Ecstatic'  </P> <P> A private planning consultant hired by restaurant owner Ernie Criezis said that  Criezis was "not ecstatic" about the conditions because of the expense involved  in complying, but that he probably would not appeal. Under zoning regulations,  both sides have until Feb. 2 to appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals.  </P> <P> "I'm advising them to just try to grit their teeth," said consultant Karen  Blackwell. "If this is what it takes, if this really will improve the quality  of life in the neighborhood, they will benefit from that, too. You really don't  want to be at odds with your neighbors."  </P> <P> Councilman Mike Woo had opposed the dancing permit at the restaurant because of  the previous problems. Julie Jaskol, a spokeswoman for the councilman, said Woo  felt that the ruling "more than satisfies our concerns," but she said that he  wanted to talk with area residents about their lingering concerns.  </P> <P> Last week, similar conditions were attached to a dancing permit for the  Moonlight Tango restaurant, which has the same owner and is also on Ventura  Boulevard in Sherman Oaks.  </P></p>

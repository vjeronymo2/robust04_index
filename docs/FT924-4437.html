			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Sedgwick Pounds 19.5m share issue to fund purchases SEDGWICK Group, the second biggest insurance broker in the UK, is raising Pounds 19.5m via a share issue to finance its first overseas acquisitions since the mid-1980s. It has purchased new businesses in France and the US, and is negotiating to buy a regional broker in Germany. It is paying Pounds 6.1m, comprising an initial Pounds 4.9m and two deferred considerations of Pounds 600,000, to buy Cabinet Billet, one of France's largest credit insurance brokers, and Dollars 10.5m (Pounds 7m) to acquire Duncan Peek, a US broking and employee benefits consultancy. The completion of the German acquisition is expected to take place early in 1993. A total of 13.89m shares are being issued, of which 9.92m are being placed through SG Warburg Securities. The expansion is the first by Sedgwick since 1986, when it acquired three regional US brokers - Crump Companies, Armistead and Arthur L Owen. Mr Sax Riley, chief executive, said: 'The market has been in a trough. It could be the right time to buy.' Both purchases also demonstrate that Sedgwick is seeking to expand its product base by building niche businesses. In France, where Sedgwick is already the fifth biggest property/casualty broker, Cabinet Billet specialises in credit insurance. Similarly Atlanta-based Duncan Peek has specialist expertise in sports insurance broking. Sedgwick has some Pounds 6.4m to complete its acquisition of a new German operation.</p>

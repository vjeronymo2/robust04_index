			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Services for Youth in Rural Areas <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of geographic distances, low population density and, in some cases, cultural differences, it is difficult to provide effective services to runaway and homeless youth in rural areas. In many such areas, scarcity of funds and other resources precludes the funding of separate, autonomous Basic Center programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is a need for innovative and effective models for the provision of runaway and homeless youth services in rural areas, including Indian reservations. These models would make services accessible to youth without setting up inordinately expensive service agencies in low populated areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In FY 1993, first-year funding was awarded to eight grantees to develop such models. These grants are expected to produce written descriptions of the proposed service models, identify issues related to model implementation, and generate information on youth and program outcomes. The models will also incorporate formal collaboration with other major youth-serving agencies in the areas served. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is anticipated that continuation funding of these eight grants will be provided in FY 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Analysis, Synthesis, and Interpretation of Information Concerning Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Over the past few years, systems for the accumulation of new knowledge have been developed regarding the delivery of services to runaway and homeless youth and their families through programs administered by FYSB. These systems currently provide, or during FY 1994 will provide, new data of considerable interest. The four main sources of this new information are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Management Information System (MIS) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information now being collected by the MIS includes descriptions of FYSB's grantee agencies and detailed data on the youth and families served, including demographic profiles, presenting problems, services provided, and service outcomes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The Monitoring System <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Data now being collected through the monitoring system will identify program strengths and weaknesses in such areas as outreach and intake; provision of appropriate shelter, food, clothing, and counseling; making of referrals, as needed, for health care, employment, and educational services; family reunification and aftercare; and program administration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Evaluation Studies of FYSB Programs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current studies nearing completion include: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;``Evaluation of Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs_A Follow-Up Study'' (FY 1991&hyph;present);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``Incidence and Prevalence of Drug Abuse Among Runaway and Homeless Youth'' (FY 1990&hyph;present); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``Evaluation of the Transitional Living Program for Homeless Youth'' (FY 1991&hyph;present); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``Study of the Underlying Causes of Youth Homelessness'' (1989&hyph;present); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``National Evaluation of Home-Based Services Programs'' (FY 1992&hyph;present). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Firestorm sweeps through Malibu mansions FIRES swept across more than 35,000 acres of southern California yesterday, driving 7,000 people, including film stars, from their homes. Exclusive neighbourhoods were levelled and at least 350 buildings were razed. The Malibu Colony mansions of actors Charles Bronson, Sean Penn and Bruce Willis were damaged or destroyed during the night, according to news reports. Actor Rod Steiger called a local television station from his Malibu home and was given directions during a live broadcast on how to find his way out of danger. The fires, which spread down from the Santa Monica mountains to the Pacific coast, were blamed on arsonists and it was estimated that the damage would run into hundreds of millions of dollars. One of the most seriously injured in Malibu was British screenwriter and director Duncan Gibbins. He had escaped from his bungalow but was badly burnt when he returned to search for his cat.

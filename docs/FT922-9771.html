			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: Generali improves to L380.6bn GENERALI, Italy's biggest insurance group, raised net profits by 8.4 per cent to L380.6bn (Dollars 308.4m) last year, despite the continuing difficulties in the domestic insurance industry. Premium income went up by 15.5 per cent to L7,222bn in 1991. Premiums from Italy rose by 13.4 per cent to L4,483bn, while those generated abroad rose 19.2 per cent to L2,740bn. Preliminary figures at group level suggested earnings would be 'appreciably' over the L467.8bn made in 1990, according to the company. Group premiums rose by 16.4 per cent to reach L18,000bn. Allowing for inter-group re-insurance business, group premiums rose 17.2 per cent to L16,023bn. Generali disappointed the stock market by announcing it would once again be paying its dividend in a mixture of shares in its Alleanza life insurance subsidiary and cash. This year's pay-out comprises a cash element of L190 a shares, up from L160 the previous year, and one non-convertible savings share in Alleanza for every 75 Generali shares currently held. In 1991, the company gave away one Alleanza share for every 250 Generali shares already held. Generali claimed the dividend marked a substantial improvement on the previous year's pay-out. Based on the value of Alleanza stock on Generali's balance sheet, the dividend is worth L201 a share, against L177 the previous year, it said. Calculated using market prices, and adjusted for last year's big rights issue by Generali, the company claimed the dividend marked an improvement of almost 25 per cent. Generali confirmed the continuing expansion in the Italian life insurance market, while growth on the non-life side had been more contained. Moreover, claims continued to rise alarmingly, although costs had been kept down, it said.</p>

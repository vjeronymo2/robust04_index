			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by unnamed Bratislava correpondent: "Slovak Republic </F> Wants $350 Million From IMF"]    [Text] Bratislava--The Slovak Government will try to obtain  a so-called standby loan from the IMF in the amount of $350  million, even though the restrictive measures in the form of the  loan conditions will hit the public before the parliamentary  elections in the fall and will obviously affect the prospects of  the government parties. This was announced yesterday in  Bratislava by Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik. The prime minister  also confirmed that the condition for obtaining the IMF loan is  to keep the deficit of the state budget under 4 percent of the  GDP.</p>

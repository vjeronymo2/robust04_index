			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Georgiy Bovt, Sergey Tsekhmistrenko report: "Andrey </F> Kozyrev's European Tour. Vitaliy Churkin Retires From Bosnia  Affairs?"]    [Excerpt] In yesterday's talks with Andrey Kozyrev, his  French counterpart Allain Juppe backed the idea for a summit  with Russia, the EC, the United Nations, and the United States  taking part (this idea was approved in a telephone conversation  the day before by Pavel Grachev and Pentagon chief William  Perry). A conference of the heads of interested countries'  Foreign Ministries is to get down to preparing the summit.    The ministers' conference, Kozyrev and Juppe thought, could  discuss the report of the "contact group" which is starting  talks with the Serbs and Muslims. In the meantime, Vitaliy  Churkin, the Russian president's special envoy, indicated  yesterday that he was not going to play the leading role in this  group (although it is made up of his "counterparts in the  settlement" -- for example, U.S. special envoy Charles Redman)  and would only "from time to time" participate in its work.  Churkin's place in the group will be taken by Aleksey  Nikiforov, a diplomat expert in Balkan affairs. Time will tell  whether this is really a quiet removal of Churkin from a  Yugoslav settlement (in a sequel to the two-week-old story where  he first sharply criticized a part of the Bosnian Serbs for  "extremism," and then rumors of his certain "differences with  Kozyrev" began to creep around Moscow). For the time being,  Churkin will be busy preparing Russia's signing of the  "Partnership for Peace" with NATO. Aleksey Nikiforov earlier  worked in the USSR Embassy in Belgrade, then in the East  European department of the Foreign Ministry, and took part in  the early stages of the Geneva talks on ex-Yugoslavia.

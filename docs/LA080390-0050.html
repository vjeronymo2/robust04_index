			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LEGACY OF ART SEIDENBAUM  </P> <P> Art Seidenbaum will be sorely missed by free-lance writers. As former editor of  Book Review, Art encouraged off-the-beaten-path stories about literary Los  Angeles that appeared in the phased-out Westview column.  </P> <P> And he could be kind even when he had to be cruel. Rejected articles, when he  served as Opinion editor, were always accompanied by a comforting word or two  of explanation. The sight of his name on a Times envelope always set my heart  aflutter.  </P> <P> And however brief the note's contents, he invariably closed with a kind of life  motif: "Cheers, Art."  </P> <P> ROSELLE M. LEWIS  </P> <P> Tarzana  </P></p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Gore warns on failure to approve Round US vice-president Al Gore yesterday warned Congress that failure to approve the Uruguay Round legislation this year would mean its demise, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. 'Anybody who says 'delay the Gatt' is really calling for a death sentence on the biggest tax cut in the history of the world,' he said. 'It is a critical vote for US leadership in the world.' He spoke on Capitol Hill where business leaders, administration officials and Republican and Democratic members of key committees gathered to push for passage of the deal. Votes are scheduled in the House on November 29 and the Senate on December 1. Behind the public facade of bipartisan accord, Senator Robert Dole, majority leader-to-be, is the lone hold out among the congressional leadership. He has made several demands, most ludicrous being that Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, go to Kansas to debate Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire. Mr Dole wants establishment of an eminent persons group to review decisions by the new World Trade Organisation and report on them to Congress and a procedure to pull the US out of the WTO if it impinges on US sovereignty. The concerns about sovereignty are widely regarded as spurious since the issue has been repeatedly addressed in the implementing legislation. But as a likely presidential candidate in 1996, he is seeking to placate conservative Republicans, who urge delay. With Mr Kantor's agreement to 'carefully consider' Mr Dole's proposals, approval prospects seem to have improved. Little trouble is expected in the House, where Mr Newt Gingrich, the speaker-to-be, has climbed firmly aboard. The difficulty is the Senate where 60 votes out of 100 are needed for a waiver of budget rules before the legislation can go to the floor. Senator Jesse Helms, expected to be next chairman of the foreign relations committee, has written to President Bill Clinton seeking a delay until next year. If granted, he said, he would consider the administration's foreign policies 'fairly and fully'. Many congressional Democrats are sceptical about the demands. 'It is highly unlikely that the Republicans would risk initiating gridlock as their first action in control of this place,' said one.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, 20 Apr -- High-ranking diplomats at the  Russian Embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] have  denied reports by some of the mass media that Gennadiy Shikin,  the Russian ambassador to the FRY is being recalled to Moscow  for consultations.    In a conversation today with the ITAR-TASS correspondent  they  stated that they know nothing about such plans. What is more,  they say, the present difficult period requires a redoubling and  not a weakening of efforts to achieve a settlement of the  Bosnian crisis. Nor would a reduction of the level of  diplomatic representation in Yugoslavia be appropriate, since  the Belgrade leadership is making great efforts to localize the  conflict around Gorazde and is urging the Bosnian Serb  leadership to take constructive steps directed at halting the  bloodshed in the town.</p>

An IFP special  general conference in Ulundi at the weekend had, however,  mandated IFP negotiators to continue trying to secure Inkatha's  constitutional demands .    In an interview before closure of the conference on Sunday  Mr  Felgate said it was still "technically and politically possible  for the government and the African National Congress to come to  their senses". He was referring to IFP demands for greater  regional autonomy, a double ballot system and other issues  contained in a list of constitutional proposals put to the  government and the anc by the Freedom Alliance last month.    But Mr Felgate cautioned the deadline for constitutional  agreement was on midnight on Monday. He said the IFP would adopt  a "multi-strategy approach", should it be forced to remain  outside South Africa's transitional process, he did not  elaborate, however.    Mr Felgate said the majority of delegates to the special  general conference in Ulundi had strongly supported rejection of  the April poll under the current interim constitution, adding  that those in favour of the poll were likely to rally behind the  decision by the majority of the party.    Official resolutions are expected later on Sunday.</p>

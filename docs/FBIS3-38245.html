The visa will allow him to launch a media blitz on behalf of  the republican cause but not to raise funds.    Officials said Mr Adams will be allowed to stay only 48  hours, be barred from travelling more than 25 miles from New  York and not allowed to engage in "direct or indirect fund  raising."    The ostensible purpose of his trip is to attend a conference  of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, a  non-profit group whose honorary chairman is the former secretary  of state Henry Kissinger.    Some members of Congress opposed the visa as a dangerous  concession that could only result in political comfort for the  IRA. The U.S. decision followed a statement in which Mr Adams  declared himself to be against all forms of violence in Northern  Ireland, "including the violence of the British army and  security forces," and said he looked forward to the disbandment  of the IRA.    Mr Adams has been repeatedly denied admission to the United  States over the past 20 years on grounds of his alleged  involvement in terrorism.    Ulster Unionists and Conservative backbenchers will be  concerned that American-Irish politicians will give him a  publicity platform and effectively condone terrorism.    The British Government said that Sinn Fein would be judged  by  deeds, not words. A spokesman said: "The fact is that Adams  said in a statement that he wants to end violence and is working  towards supporting the Downing Street declaration, and it is on  that basis that he is being admitted, under very strict  conditions for 48 hours. The British Government does not issue  visas for admission to the U.S."    Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, Kevin McNamara, said:  "We are against exclusion orders in principle. It is purely an  internal domestic matter for the United States Government, and I  have no views about it."    Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South  Tyrone, who refused to go to the same conference if Mr Adams was  there, said last night: "My understanding was that two  conditions were being imposed on Mr Adams, firstly that he  accepted the Downing Street declaration and secondly that the  IRA would cease violence. I cannot believe that he has accepted  either of those."    Sammy Wilson, spokesman for the hardline Democratic Unionist  Party, last night deplored the U.S. decision. "It's quite clear  since the declaration was signed on December 15 that the payoff  for the IRA was coming. They've had their secret talks with the  British Government, the broadcasting ban in the Irish Republic  has been lifted and even the Americans are in the payoff too by  giving their terrorist leader a plafform."    The conference will give Mr Adams the opportunity to  reinvigorate the U.S. support for Sinn Fein, and to appear on as  many U.S. TV news and talkshows as he can squeeze in.    The Clinton administration had said last week that its  decision would depend on a statement of Mr Adams's views on  violence and his readiness to support the peace efforts of John  Major and the Irish Government.    British officials in Washington last night were putting the  best face on their defeat, suggesting that if Mr Adams lived up  to his statement, Northern Ireland would benefit. If he did  not, the U.S. Government would learn its lesson, and Sinn Fein  would lose credibility.    President Clinton was under strong pressure from congressmen  with influential Irish-American constituencies. Democratic  senators Teddy Kennedy of Massachusetts, who faces a difficult  re-election battle this year, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New  York, whose chairmanship of the finance commitee gives him a  near-stranglehold on Mr Clinton's domestic agenda, had both  urged that the visa be granted.    Before the announcement from Washington, Mr Adams had denied  he had renounced violence as a condition of getting the visa. He  said in Dublin that he had had "a very interesting exchange of  views" with a senior U.S. official which showed that the Clinton  administration was acquainting itself with the republican  position.    The Irish Government remained aloof from the controversy  sticking to its formal line that it was entirely a matter for  Washington. It is believed to have cautioned the Americans  against allowing Mr Adams too much latitude.</p>

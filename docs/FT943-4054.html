			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: P&amp;O profits from cruising - The Week Ahead MONDAY: Dalgety is expected to produce a modest increase in pre-tax profits for the year to June, from Pounds 112.2m to about Pounds 121m. But the result will be essentially flat, excluding gains a year earlier. Progress in food ingredients and animal feeds will be offset by flat results from consumer businesses such as snacks, sauce and pet foods. Dividend for the year should be up 2 per cent to 21p. TUESDAY: Half-time results from Caradon, the building products and printing group, are expected to produce profits in a range of Pounds 85-100m against a stripped-out Pounds 59.5m last time. Earnings are forecast at 9p, with the dividend inched up to around 3p (2.8p). Integration of the Pillar acquisition and the performance of the UK products division will be high on observers' agendas. TUESDAY: A good half for the cruise industry is expected to have helped P&amp;O, the shipping, construction and property group, lift pre-tax profits to between Pounds 100 and Pounds 130m, against Pounds 80.1m. Analysts reckon that volume growth in ferries will have offset the price war and that profits from house-building and investment property will be flat. They anticipate a dividend of 13.5p, against last time's 24p, which was higher due to the enhanced scrip alternative. TUESDAY: Interim results from pharmaceutical group Fisons are expected to come in at under Pounds 40m, with most analysts clustered around the Pounds 35m mark. The progress of Intal, the anti-asthma treatment, will be of particular interest, especially given the threat of generic alternatives and the performance of the US market. Restructuring at the group's scientific instruments business will also be the focus of some interest. TUESDAY: An increase in first-half pre-tax profits from Pounds 82m to about Pounds 93m at Kingfisher, the retailing group, is not expected to lift the gloom surrounding the stock, which has fallen from a high of 778p last December to 488p yesterday. The results will include a full contribution for the first time from Darty, the French electrical retailer. Stripping out the increase from Darty, the underlying result is forecast to be down on last year. WEDNESDAY: Lasmo, the oil explorer, is expected to announce interim net losses of Pounds 20m, excluding exceptionals, against net profits last year of Pounds 20m. Few surprises are expected after the barrage of information delivered in its defence from the Pounds 1.6bn hostile bid by Enterprise Oil this summer. But investors who backed Lasmo widely in the battle will want clearer indications of when the losses will come to an end. WEDNESDAY: Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurance company, reports its interim results. Analysts' forecasts for pre-tax profits range from Pounds 243m to Pounds 283m. This compares with Pounds 242m last time and is expected to include a significant recovery in the general insurance business. THURSDAY: Legal &amp; General, another of the UK's larger proprietary insurance groups, reports interim results. Like Guardian Royal Exchange, the composite insurance group, L&amp;G accounts for realised and unrealised capital gains and losses in its profit and loss account, and analysts expect this to produce a profit fall from Pounds 75m, to Pounds 48m-Pounds 58m in the first six months of the year. THURSDAY: United Biscuits is likely to report interim pre-tax profits of about Pounds 75m, against Pounds 70.8m a year earlier before a Pounds 62.7m gain on disposals. A dividend increase is unlikely. UB's business might have slowed a little since the AGM with, for example, a price war in crisps. THURSDAY: Booker's interim pre-tax profits are likely to be down by about 5 per cent at Pounds 28.5m, with an unchanged dividend. New management is still retrenching and its cash and carry business remains tough. FRIDAY: Next, the fashion retailer, is expected to provide evidence of its continuing recovery, with interim pre-tax profits up from Pounds 23m to about Pounds 32m. Although sales are thought to have been hit by the very hot weather in July, the company is expected to report a return to strong sales growth since then.</p>

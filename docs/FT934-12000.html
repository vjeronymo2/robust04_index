			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Loss of Dollars 217m for Ford in Europe THE DIVE in continental Europe's new car market sent Ford's European automotive operations tumbling back into a substantial loss in the third quarter of this year. The Dollars 217m loss was better than the Dollars 479m deficit in the same quarter of 1992, but marked a deterioration on the first half of this year. European operations managed a Dollars 19m profit in this year's first quarter. However, a Dollars 75m loss was chalked up in the second quarter as Europe's total new car market continued to slide to its current state - 16 per cent below the comparable 1992 period. Ford's European automotive losses for the first nine months of the year now stand at Dollars 264m, an improvement on the Dollars 371m loss for the same period last year. But Mr Harold Poling, chairman and chief executive of parent Ford Motor Company of the US, declined yesterday to give any clear pointers as to when the European operations might return to profitability. He said the financial results 'should improve when European economies strengthen'. Positive factors were the success of the new Mondeo, previously announced restructuring actions and continuing cost-reduction efforts, which mean Ford is well-positioned to participate in the eventual recovery of the European markets. 'With more than 300,000 Mondeo orders we are obviously encouraged that the car has done so well during such difficult economic times,' said Mr Poling. Jaguar Cars, Ford's UK-based luxury cars subsidiary, lost Dollars 108m during the quarter, including a Dollars 65m charge to restructure its stamping operations. Jaguar is pulling out of Venture Pressings, a joint venture set up with UK components group GKN to supply Jaguar's body pressings. Jaguar's operating loss excludes some Dollars 47m in interest and goodwill amortisation related to Ford's purchase of Jaguar for Pounds 1.56bn. Its third-quarter loss last year was Dollars 135m.</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FUNNYMAN STEVE ALLEN FINDS AMERICA'S 'DUMBTH' ANYTHING BUT FUNNY  </P> <P> What's the world coming to? A lot of Americans don't know where Mexico is. They  think Delaware is a city. Asked to name a tribe that has invaded England, they  answer, "The Aztecs." They ask actor Robert Young for medical advice, just  because he played Dr. Marcus Welby on television, and they write letters to  Kentucky Derby winners.  </P> <P> "Not the jockey, not the trainer, but the horse," said an incredulous Steve  Allen.  </P> <P> With a look of inspired mystification, the veteran comedian-author-songwriter  paused in his description, bolstered by studies and personal experiences, of  creeping dumbness in America to picture somebody actually writing a letter to a  horse. "Something like, 'Dear Seabiscuit. . . . Thanks for winning the Kentucky  Derby. I won 28 bucks on you. Keep up the good work. . . .' "  </P> <P> Allen's audience at Caltech chortled appreciatively.  </P> <P> "The American people are dumber now than they have been in a very long time,"  said Allen, who has written a book called "Dumbth" on the subject.  </P> <P> Allen, 68, has come a long way since he commanded a squad of wacky characters  in the NBC Studios in New York, on the original "The Tonight Show." In those  days, more than 30 years ago, Allen might have traded gibes with some New  Jersey cheerleaders in the audience, hooked himself up to a vibrating  girth-reducing machine or chatted amiably with entertainers Steve Lawrence and  Eydie Gorme, before diving into a nine-foot vat of Jell-O.  </P> <P> But this is the Beckman, Caltech's airy, wedding cake-shaped auditorium. The  antic "Steverino" (as one character on "The Tonight Show" used to call him) of  the 1950s and 1960s seems to have given way in this sedate hall to a pleasant,  thoughtful social critic. He's here to talk about a deterioration of basic  intelligence in America.  </P> <P> "Dumbth" (Allen's own term) is a spreading incompetence, illiteracy and  gullibility across the land. "It's a combination of ignorance and stupidity,  plus some unidentified ingredients," he said.  </P> <P> There aren't any New Jersey cheerleaders here tonight. The sold-out audience of  1,164 is mostly middle-aged -- many of them scientists, teachers and  technicians -- with enough concentrated brainpower to turn out an encyclopedia  in two hours flat.  </P> <P> Murray Gell-Mann, a Nobel laureate in physics, sat in the same row with Paul  MacCready, the visionary inventor of a human-powered airplane and solar-powered  car. Caltech faculty and members of Southern California Skeptics, co-sponsor of  the event and recipient of its proceeds, jammed the center of the auditorium.  </P> <P> Somehow or other, though, the laughs just kept bubbling up from somewhere in  Allen's restless psyche.  </P> <P> He handled some written questions from the audience, talking about the sources  of his inspiration (he doesn't know what they are), his syndicated show "Host  To Host," shown locally on KABC-TV, and the things that make him laugh (Dan  Quayle).  </P> <P> "As a group, you're a little on the flaky side," he said, riffling through a  stack of question cards. He read one of them. " 'What is a semiconductor?' I'll  give you a definition by example. I would say Lawrence Welk."  </P> <P> Another one, purportedly from Jesus Morales of Tijuana, asked: "If Jesus was  Jewish, how come he had a Mexican name?"  </P> <P> Then he did what he always appeared most comfortable doing on stage (or screen)  -- noodling on the Steinway while he gabs into a microphone. "Every few years,  there's a hit song or two in which the singer's heart is breaking because  something reminds him of a lost love," Allen said, playing a few bars of "These  Foolish Things." "But why is it that nobody writes about the bad memories?"  </P> <P> Somebody has, of course. Allen launches into his own version of the 1936  standard. "A greasy meatball that's all cold and moldy . . . A stupid song  that's now a golden oldie. . . . "  </P> <P> The audience responds as delightedly as if it were 1956 and they had all  traveled on a lark to the television studio at Rockefeller Center, taking the  bus through the Lincoln Tunnel or riding the subway in from Brooklyn -- which  some of them, at earlier times in their lives, actually had done.  </P> <P> "I was raised on Steve Allen," said retired physics professor Herb Segall, a  transplanted New Yorker, after the show. "He was spontaneous, he was witty. . .  . " Actually, Allen, an owlish man in a plaid jacket, long ago staked a claim  on the affections of the thinking public. Besides his late-night television  high jinks, he has written books, scores for musicals, hit songs and a play,  "The Wake," which won a Los Angeles drama critics' nomination as the best play  of 1977.  </P> <P> Many of those who snapped up the tickets for the performance at the Beckman  remembered him most fondly for creating and hosting the PBS-TV series "Meeting  of Minds," in which historical figures such as Galileo, Cleopatra, Darwin,  Ulysses S. Grant and Marie Antoinette talked and debated about international  issues.  </P> <P> "I was always serious, but people didn't know about it," Allen said. "If you do  a comic monologue, you may be seen by 27 million people, whereas, if you write  a serious book or a serious song, you may be home alone with a tape recorder or  a piano."  </P></p>

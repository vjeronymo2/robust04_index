			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Selling the silver: English Heritage's planned disposals Fort Cumberland stands on the foreshore at Portsmouth, an awesome monument to 19th-century Britain's determination to keep the French at bay. For years it has been derelict, unloved and unvisited, one of English Heritage's more tiresome responsibilities. It was hardly surprising that, when Mr Jocelyn Stevens, chairman of English Heritage, announced this week his plan to dispose of about 200 of the 360 properties in the care of his organisation, Fort Cumberland was high on the hit list. Mr Stevens was convinced that Hampshire County Council would be keen to acquire the fort; indeed that it might actually pay for the privilege. Here was an example of how the stewardship of minor relics from the past - ruined monasteries, derelict castles, remote pre-historic barrows - could successfully pass from distant London to proud local councils, or special interest groups. Mr Freddie Emery-Wallis, leader of Hampshire County Council, does not quite see it this way. He would be quite happy to take on the fort, and what is left of bomb-damaged Portsmouth Royal Garrison Church, another potential casualty - but only if he gets extra money to do it. Mr Stevens, however, has shown no enthusiasm to finance new custodians on a long-term basis, although some transitional funding seems inevitable. 'These sites are the responsibility of the government and English Heritage. I'm sure we could do a better job looking after them but we expect to receive financial assistance.' The White Horse at Uffington in Oxfordshire, probably an early Iron Age fertility symbol, is also on Mr Stevens' yet-to-be-finalised list of disposals. The National Trust owns the adjacent downland and would be an obvious candidate to take over the horse. But, says Mr Warren Davis of the Trust: 'We will not willingly take on an existing liability.' The Trust administers the surrounding countryside on the understanding that English Heritage pays for the archaeological investigations and maintenance of the site. It would expect English Heritage to hand over money with a change of ownership. There is, however, no mention of money in Mr Stevens' master plan, drawn up within six months of his arrival at English Heritage. Previously he had been rector of the Royal College of Art which he made more commercially minded, though at the cost of losing many of its top professors. He was given the job because the government felt English Heritage was a rather bloated bureaucracy, which cost Pounds 90m a year in subsidies. But it could be that Mr Stevens' overhaul has gone further than his pay-masters had anticipated. In his rush to shake things up Mr Stevens seems to have ignored consultation. Even English Heritage's Ancient Monuments Advisory Committee, headed by Sir David Wilson, former director of the British Museum, was kept in the dark about the changes. He has expressed dismay at the site disposals. As well as upsetting the National Trust, whose chief executive has belatedly arranged a meeting with Mr Stevens next week, other interested parties are angry. Mr Neil Sinden, planning officer at the Council for the Protection of Rural England, sees it 'as a very significant abdication by English Heritage of part of its responsibilities'. The National Heritage Memorial Fund, the other main guardian of the past, feels the reforms could have been handled more diplomatically. 'It makes sense for piles of stones, which are the main sites that English Heritage wants to hand over, to be run at a local level rather than from London, but it has been sprung on the world,' says Ms Georgina Nayler, director of the fund. So does Mr Stevens face an almost impossible task in unloading his surplus sites? He maintains that he would only negotiate with respectable proprietors and is 'not keen on selling to entrepreneurs'. He does not expect that business groups will be interested in taking on what are often obscure and out of the way relics. Indeed, it is hard to imagine many commercial interests willing to take on an Iron Age barrow in Dorset, for example. There are now signs of retrenchment at the appropriately named Fortress House, the London home of English Heritage. 'We have an eight-year programme to dispose of the sites,' says chief executive Ms Jennifer Page. 'We will not hand over any site unless we are certain it can be safely managed and maintained.' English Heritage wants to concentrate its resources on a new agenda, on improving its more spectacular sites, such as Stonehenge, with almost 1m visitors a year. It plans to invest where there are people and tourists, on enhancing towns such as Bath and York, as well as such historic industrial areas as Halifax. It expects to spend more on restoring churches and cathedrals. But the money to invest in these chosen growth areas will not come from savings achieved by disposing of properties. Even more than the planned disposals, Mr Stevens' critics are concerned by his decision to relinquish the powers over Grade II listed buildings in London which English Heritage inherited when the Greater London Council was abolished in 1986. Its responsibility for protecting such buildings has proved valuable. When the Duke of Westminster wanted to demolish St George's Hospital at Hyde Park Corner (now the Lanesborough Hotel) English Heritage stiffened the resolve of Westminster Council. Mr Stevens expects the local boroughs to assume full responsibility for their historic buildings. But none has the resources and few the personnel to undertake the task. Lambeth, for example, rate-capped and in terrible financial straits, cannot afford the luxury of conservation officers. 'We are deeply concerned,' says Janet Crook, chair of the environmental services committee. 'I believe in safeguarding our heritage but the council is not going to cut the social services budget by Pounds 100,000 to find the funding. It's impossible for it to work.' Much of what Mr Stevens proposes is sensible. Who could complain if the Ivanhoe Trust wants to take over the remains of Conisborough Castle near Doncaster, where it already organises events? Some rationalisation of headquarters staff is also inevitable, although the speed with which the appeal for 100 redundancies has been met should worry Mr Stevens. The loss of 180 jobs among the direct labour force by April and its eventual privatisation is more disturbing, because of the dispersal of a team of skilled craftsmen. But the real cause for concern in the drive to get the English Heritage workforce down from 1,600 to 1,000 must lie in the disappearance of the London specialists. It is the speed with which the changes were announced, and the fear that they have been undertaken at the government's order, that most alarms the heritage lobby. English Heritage should quickly demonstrate cultural gains from the overhaul. It should, for example, confirm that it is contributing Pounds 1m to save the deteriorating Royal Crescent in Buxton. At the moment it is in danger of losing the support of its 300,000 members, who are being asked to pay more in annual fees for access to fewer sites, as well as that of the heritage professionals. If these disparate groups were to join forces, they would make a powerful coalition of opponents.</p>

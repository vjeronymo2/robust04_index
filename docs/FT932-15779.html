			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Blood stains the peace of a nation eager to vote: Victor Mallet assesses the factional strife in Cambodia as the UN tries to protect electors looking forward to a poll next month PEACE in Cambodia was supposed to be one of the dividends from the end of the Cold War, but neither the new-found goodwill among the superpowers nor the presence of 22,000 United Nations peace-keepers seems able to end Cambodia's gruesome conflict. More than 100 people were known to have been killed throughout the country last month, many of them immigrant Vietnamese women and children massacred in a fishing village by suspected Khmer Rouge guerrillas. A week ago, three Bulgarian UN peace-keepers were murdered in cold blood by Khmer Rouge gunmen, after having the guerrillas to a friendly supper in their UN tent. On Thursday, a 25-year-old Japanese volunteer working as an electoral officer was killed in an ambush. Tension is rising throughout the country. The US embassy in Bangkok said yesterday it had advised travellers not to go to Siem Reap, the northern Cambodian town which is the site of the ancient Khmer temples of Angkor. Khmer Rouge guerrillas are active in the area. The current violence is a far cry from the scene in Paris on October 23, 1991, when the various Cambodian factions, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and other concerned countries ceremoniously signed a comprehensive peace agreement providing for a ceasefire and a UN-monitored election. The accord was possible because, as the Soviet empire crumbled, the Soviet-backed Vietnamese had announced the withdrawal of their troops from Cambodia in 1989, and the US and China had nudged their guerrilla proteges - who had been fighting the Vietnamese occupation - towards the negotiating table. All four principal Cambodian factions put their names to the agreement: the Phnom Penh administration, installed by the Vietnamese after the invasion of 1978 which had overthrown the Khmer Rouge; the Khmer Rouge itself, the Chinese-backed extreme left organisation blamed for the deaths of 1m Cambodians during its reign of terror between 1975 and 1978; the royalist group Funcinpec; and the US-supported Khmer People's National Liberation Front. Almost from the start, however, the agreement was flouted by the two factions with the only significant military forces in Cambodia - the Khmer Rouge and the Phnom Penh administration. The ceasefire was ignored. Khmer Rouge leaders refused to allow UN forces into the swathes of territory they control along the border with Thailand, and they refused to disarm or demobilise their fighters in accordance with the agreement, thus forcing the other factions to keep their weapons as well. Sensing the likelihood of a humiliating defeat at the polls, the Khmer Rouge has also condemned the election and sought to strengthen its political influence by stoking the fires of Cambodian nationalism and launching a hate campaign against the hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia. Khmer Rouge officials try to justify their intransigence by claiming (with scant evidence) that thousands of Vietnamese troops are still in Cambodia and by saying (with some justification) that the UN, instead of treating the Phnom Penh administration as one of four equal factions, has let it retain too much control over government ministries. The administration, meanwhile, has been intimidating voters in many districts with all the authority and guns at its disposal, and is suspected of murdering more than 20 Funcinpec campaign workers. 'Sometimes,' wrote Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of the UN transitional authority in Cambodia, in a gloomy report to his staff last month, 'the behaviour of the Cambodian parties makes it seem as if only Untac is trying to carry out the Paris agreement, even though all of them signed it.' Untac is often blamed for not moving quickly or forcefully enough to implement the peace accord. In particular, its critics say, it should have established itself in Khmer Rouge zones from the start and taken firm control of government ministries in the capital. In their defence, Untac officers say the success or failure of the peace plan depends not on the UN but on the willingness of the Cambodians to implement the agreement they signed in Paris. The accord clearly states that Untac's job on the military side is to 'supervise, monitor and verify' the ceasefire - no mention of enforcement. However helpful the superpowers may have been - and China's attitude remains ambivalent - neither Thailand, whose armed forces are overtly sympathetic to the Khmer Rouge, nor Cambodia's leading politicians appear to have done enough to ensure the success of the peace plan. Prince Sihanouk, the Cambodian 'god-king' regarded as the one leader who can unite his country behind him, has spent much of the crucial past few months thousands of kilometres away in Beijing and issuing a confusing series of statements alternately praising and condemning Untac. Mr Akashi and the UN, for want of any other plausible option, seem determined to press ahead with the voting from May 23-27, although Mr Akashi has painted himself into an embarrassing corner by saying often that conditions are not yet right for the free and fair election specified by the Paris agreement, when there is every sign that the violence is getting worse. Even if the election proceeds as planned, it is possible that militarily weak parties, such as Funcinpec, will win large numbers of seats in the new assembly, and that the well-armed government or the well-armed Khmer Rouge will therefore refuse to accept the result; indeed, the Khmer Rouge has already declared that it will reject the outcome. The UN would then have to decide whether to change and strengthen Untac's mandate so that UN forces may support a new government, or turn and run and leave Cambodia's inhabitants to continue their civil war. To abandon Cambodia could allow the Khmer Rouge ultimately to return to power in Phnom Penh, risking a return of the killing fields and a new confrontation on the border with Vietnam. It would also throw away such gains as have been won by the peace accord - a fragile start to economic growth, an enthusiasm for peace and democracy shown in the registration of 4.7m voters, and the nearly completed homecoming of some 370,000 refugees.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Man in the News: Protectionist of the old school - Ernest Hollings Senator Ernest 'Fritz' Hollings of South Carolina hopes to make this the week that he changes the world. Mr Hollings intends to try to scupper the legislative package needed to implement the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in the US. As the chairman of both the Senate commerce committee and the appropriations sub-committee, which controls the Commerce Department's budget, Mr Hollings does have considerable influence on trade issues. His resistance has stirred memories of the US congressional veto in the late 1940s that prevented the Gatt from becoming a permanent organisation, like other children of the Bretton Woods conference such as the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank. However, the odds are strongly against Mr Hollings definitively derailing this Gatt bill. But even the delay is a terrible frustration to President Bill Clinton, who has already seen his hopes of reforming healthcare, welfare and campaign finance blocked by a recalcitrant Congress. Under the fast track procedure created to give presidents greater authority to negotiate trade agreements, the Gatt legislation, sent to Congress by Mr Clinton earlier this week, may not be amended. Members do have the right to 45 legislative days to consider the package, and Mr Hollings has promised that he will use that to hold hearings. 'I've got my 45 days and I'm going to use every bit of my 45 days,' he said. That would take Congress beyond next Friday, when it hopes to adjourn, and even beyond November 8, when there will be elections for one third of the seats in the Senate and all of the House of Representatives. Using the calendar in this way is a standard legislative manoeuvre at the end of a congressional session, as tempers wear thin and members grow impatient to return to their districts to campaign. Still in jeopardy are measures such as the reform of the Superfund legislation governing the clean-up of toxic waste dumps, a bill to protect a large acreage of Californian desert from development and the last of the 13 spending bills the Congress must pass each year, covering the District of Columbia's budget. But Mr Clinton has made it clear that completion of the Gatt is his highest remaining legislative priority. While many other bills are allowed to die, or are postponed, if they fall off the end of the legislative calendar, Congress will be brought back to vote on the Gatt legislation. Instead of adjourning, it will go into recess, while the clock continues ticking on Mr Hollings's 45 days. Senate leaders announced yesterday that the Senate will come back into session on November 30 and will probably vote on the Gatt bill the next day. The chances of a defeat for the Clinton administration in that vote are slim. There is a substantial majority in both houses in support of the Gatt legislation. Thus, the delay is only that. It is extremely unlikely that Mr Hollings could muster a simple majority of 51 votes in the Senate against the Gatt bill. There is also an outside chance that manipulation of parliamentary rules could raise the hurdle to 60 votes. This is not Mr Hollings's first battle against a trade bill. An out-and-out protectionist of the old school, he believes that the US regularly gives far more than it gets in trade deals, thus 'tilting the playing field' away from US producers and consumers. In 1985, 1988 and 1990, he persuaded Congress to pass legislation imposing import quotas on textiles, in a bid to protect one of his home state's principal industries. All three times the legislation was subjected to presidential vetoes. His protectionism often veers into xenophobia and he is well known for his anti-Japanese statements and beliefs. A humorist, who often has crowds of lobbyists giggling in the aisles of his committee room, the many people that he has offended regard Mr Hollings's humour as deeply streaked with cruelty and racism. Former Senator John Tower, who became the butt of Mr Hollings's acerbic tongue during his unsuccessful attempt to win Senate confirmation as defence secretary, called him 'the Senate bully'. And black members of Congress were outraged last year when he quipped that African government officials attend international trade conferences so they can 'get a good square meal' rather than 'eating each other'. But one aide said Mr Hollings was the first congressional committee chairman to hire a black staff director and has hired more women and minorities for his committee than any other Senate chairman. Even his supporters say they do not know whether his mouth runs in a higher gear than his discretion, or he simply does not care who he hurts with his barbed remarks. With his opposition to Gatt, Mr Hollings has hurt Mr Clinton and become, in the process, the hero of a peculiar combination of right and left wing opponents who say the Gatt's new World Trade Organisation will take away US sovereignty and leave it unable to enforce its own consumer and environmental laws. 'God Bless Fritz Hollings,' said Mr Patrick Buchanan, the conservative commentator who ran against former President George Bush in the 1992 presidential election. 'We have 45 days to make the case for a new economics of American patriotism.' Some argue that Senator Hollings may even have done President Clinton a favour. With tough elections ahead, there are many House members who would also like to delay their vote until after the election. And some Republicans who generally favour the Gatt agreement would, nevertheless, prefer to deny Mr Clinton a legislative victory ahead of the election. Most members, however, would rather be spared a lame-duck session of Congress, and most US allies would rather do without the frustration of yet another delay to completing the Gatt.</p>

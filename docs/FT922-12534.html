			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Tarmac on the deck Few UK companies have been humbled in this recession quite like Tarmac. While others in the building and building materials sectors have managed to restrict the damage to their balance sheets or their profit and loss accounts, the 1980s wonder stock has been hit hard in the teeth on both. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 21m last year were a mere 5 per cent of their 1988 peak, while the combination of higher net borrowings and a Pounds 230m drop in shareholders' funds pushed end-1991 gearing beyond 50 per cent. Bid speculation will doubtless linger in the market for a while. But it is worth asking why Minorco, reputedly interested in Tarmac's aggregates business, would want to take over the whole shebang; or indeed, why it would be any better at sorting out the sorry mess than existing management. On the basis of a ridiculous prospective earnings multiple and a yield adjacent to Redland's, the shares at 139p are looking somewhat dear. The grim reality is that Tarmac has been slow to spot its problems and is in for a long, hard slog now that corrective action is finally under way. Its plan to ease the financial pressure by selling peripheral assets - involving perhaps Pounds 200m-Pounds 250m of disposals this year - is reminiscent of Wimpey a year ago. Neither group has dared tap investors for more money, but Wimpey at least had a couple of plums to put in the shop window. As for housing, the company may yet be right to remain a volume player. But one feels the decision is at least in part an unavoidable legacy of its more glorious past. As last year's shrunken Pounds 40m of capital expenditure demonstrates,it will be some time before Tarmac moves forward aggressively on any front at all.</p>

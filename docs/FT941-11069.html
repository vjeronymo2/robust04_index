			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Europe braced for nervous week EUROPE'S financial markets are braced for a nervous start to the week after the US Federal Reserve's tightening of monetary policy on Friday. The Fed's quarter-point increase in short-term interest rates, resulting in a stronger dollar, has prompted fears that European rates - on a downward path - may not fall as far and as fast as hoped. However, Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, said yesterday that there was no reason why US rates should not go up while those in Europe continued to decline. 'I don't think it will be catastrophic. Anyone who has been watching the US closely should have known this was coming and it ought to have been discounted in Europe,' he said. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, said the Fed's move would put pressure on the D-Mark and create problems for Germany's policy makers, where further interest rate cuts are widely seen as necessary to stimulate growth. 'On the one hand there is still considerable economic malaise in Germany, and they should be easing monetary policy,' he said. 'On the other, the Bundesbank has always prided itself on currency stability.' Mr Chertkow said it was possible that there would be a fundamental reassessment of the D-Mark in the wake of the Fed's move. Europe's government bond markets are also likely to have an uncertain week. The Bundesbank's decision last Thursday to leave key German interest rates unchanged had already disappointed the fixed-income markets and the US decision prompted further price falls on Friday. However, analysts yesterday pointed out that the reaction could have been overdone. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers in London, said the Fed's decision was better in the long term for UK government bonds since it reduced the risk of inflation picking up in the US.</p>

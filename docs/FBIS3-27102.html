A market system is an organic and interrelated whole  composed  of various markets; it requires not only a commodity market, but  also various kinds of production-factor market needed for  reproduction as well as various kinds of visible and invisible  product market to provide the services needed in the daily life  of citizens. These include commodity markets, financial  markets, labor markets, technology markets, information markets,  real estate markets, and cultural markets. A commodity market  may be further divided into consumption markets and means of  production markets.    In a developed commodity market and a market economy in  which  the exchange of commodities and production factors is conducted  through the market, exchange is carried out according to the  market economy's internal connections and through the law of  market, the law of supply and demand, and the law of  competition, and is not restricted by administrative rules and  regulations. Various markets in the system may be divided into  different types based on different factors. According to  economic factors, they may be divided into consumption product  markets and production-factor markets; according to the type of  product, they may be divided into material products markets and  nonmaterial markets; according to the scope of the market, they  may be divided into regional markets, national markets, and  international markets; according to the sale time lag, they may  be divided into spot markets and futures markets; and according  to the role and function of the product in the course of  production, they may be divided into finished-product markets  and capital markets.    A market system embodies colossal subordinate market  systems.  There are three of them. They are: A market structure system,  a main market system, and a market regulatory and control  system. An omnidirectional, unified, and open market system is  the premise for achieving effective allocation of resources; it  is also a result of a gradual development of an imperfect market  system.    For a large part of the microeconomy in market operations,  the role of the market system is to serve as a link in  establishing a point of contact for the various principal parts  of the economy; it also serves as a stage on which the vitality  of the principal parts of the microeconomy are brought into play  and displayed; and it creates the major conditions for  rationalizing the behavior of the principal parts of the  microeconomy. Seen on a macroeconomic level, the role of the  market system is manifested in its service as a foundation on  which to build and perfect a macroeconomic regulation and  control system; in the creation of important conditions for  realizing the goals of macroeconomic regulation and control; and  in giving play to the effectiveness of macroeconomic regulation  and control. In the course of building a market economic  system, the state must not only remold and foster the principal  parts of the microeconomy and give them corresponding  responsibility, rights, and benefits in the functioning of the  market system, it should also nurture a sound and open market  system in a planned manner.    The functioning of a socialist market economy calls for the  creation of an omnidirectional market system. Only with a sound  market system is it possible for the market to fully bring into  play its effective regulatory role in the economic operation of  the entire society. As a rule, an omnidirectional market system  can be described and explained by the time lag arising from a  change of hands between market objects and exchanged objects in  the market. Therefore, the omnidirectional market system  testifies to and explains the soundness of the market in  socio-economical development from different angles; it  intrinsically constitutes the completeness and perfection of the  market. Therefore, in the course of building a socialist market  economic system, it is necessary to vigorously nurture and help  form an omnidirectional market system.</p>

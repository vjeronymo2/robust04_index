			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Kinnock says NHS in mortal danger MR NEIL KINNOCK, Labour leader, last night painted the Conservatives as 'tired and washed up' without any ambition for the future of Britain. Speaking at a rally in Blackburn, Lancashire, on the penultimate day of campaigning, Mr Kinnock called on the electorate to vote to reject a government which he said had no plan to rescue Britain from recession and which was placing the NHS in 'mortal danger'. The Labour leader said that, after 13 years in power, the government had proved beyond doubt that it had 'no ambition to make Britain better and no conscience about making Britain worse'. With Labour anxious to ensure that supporters turn out in force tomorrow in what promises to be a close contest, Mr Kinnock urged voters to use their hard-earned right to choose between two parties offering starkly different options for the future. Voters, he said, could choose between the Tory approach of letting the future take care of itself, with continuing recession and further privatisation, or Labour's proposals for economic recovery and modernisation. He said that the government, in asking to be re-elected for the third time, was expecting the voters to forget two recessions, millions of unemployed people, thousands of bankruptcies and mounting home repossessions. He added: 'They are asking the people to treat what they have done as a success. After all they have done, they simply do not deserve to be elected. 'These architects of recession, these engineers of run-down, cannot be called upon to build the future.' Mr Kinnock said ministers were 'tired, washed up, like door-to-door salesmen, blue with cold, desperate to find a customer, unable to think of a new angle'. He accused the government of throwing away Pounds 100bn of oil revenues that could have rebuilt the country's schools, the National Health Service, and the transport system. Instead it had been given away in tax cuts. Keeping the NHS at the forefront of the closing stages of the campaign, Mr Kinnock said it represented 'part of the bedrock of Britain' and was the most practical expression of a civilised society. But he said the health service was in danger of being broken up under the Tories and voters had to choose at the polls to prevent it from being 'split from top to bottom'. He added: 'They are breaking it apart and in another five years they will all but have finished the job.' Labour, he claimed, had policies for pulling Britain out of recession and building a recovery that would last.</p>

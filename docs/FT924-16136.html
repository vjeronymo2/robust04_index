			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Bad blood as a relationship hits its floor AS the Bundesbank launched its latest fusillade in the war of words between Britain and Germany, it was difficult to recall the two countries were until recently seen as natural allies in European economic and monetary affairs. Germany was keen to see Britain become a full member of the European Monetary System throughout the 11 years until October 1990 in which the Tory government refused to join the European exchange rate mechanism. Bonn and Frankfurt have long regarded the UK as an ally in spreading free market ideals in the EC and as a supporter of the single market. Britain was often seen by senior German officials as a healthy counterweight to French dirigisme in Europe. Both the UK Treasury and Bundesbank are Eurosceptics on the question of European Monetary Union. So, more in sorrow than anger, officials in both countries have watched the steady rise of bad blood between the two sides since the start of September. The worsening of relations centres on two men, each of whom feels aggrieved at how the other has acted. From the start, Mr Norman Lamont, Britain's chancellor, has been forthright in condemning what he sees as Bundesbank intransigence in refusing to lower interest rates sufficiently and unhelpfulness in making remarks that helped to weaken sterling in the run-up to Black Wednesday. Criticism has also surfaced in Britain of the Bundesbank's supposed failure to support the pound with the same vigour it showed last week in supporting the franc. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, has been less voluble. But, while staying controlled and courteous, he has never hesitated to put his side of a story when he has felt unjustly assailed. Yesterday, he clearly felt he had to set the record straight, although he appears to have been surprised at the way the German embassy in London released his remarks. The row between Mr Schlesinger and the chancellor began with the informal meeting of EC economics and finance ministers in Bath on September 5. Then, tempers rose as Mr Lamont repeatedly demanded the Bundesbank cut its interest rates immediately. As primus inter pares on the central bank council, Mr Schlesinger could make no such pledge. After the chancellor had put the same demand four times, Mr Schlesinger was only held back from walking out when Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, asked Mr Lamont to stop his attacks. Harsh words are often said in international meetings. But Mr Schlesinger's discomfiture was followed by public attacks for which he was clearly unprepared. The Bundesbank president, who in Germany is a revered figure because of his position and the central bank's reputation as the guardian of German price stability, found himself vilified by sections of the UK press. It is understood he was especially upset by articles linking the Bundesbank with Germany's Nazi past. He resented the way certain journalists phoned him at home and harassed his wife. On his recent visit to Washington for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Mr Schlesinger appeared shaken by the treatment he had received. He told friends he had never experienced anything like the attacks on him in the UK tabloids. But yesterday's statement from Mr Schlesinger was more than letting off steam. It was meant to clear the air and put on record the Bundesbank's recollection of events surrounding Black Wednesday. As such, it contains some important claims going beyond Mr Schlesinger's bid to clarify what he said in the disputed September 17 interview with Handelsblatt, the German newspaper, which the UK believes fatally undermined sterling. The statement asserts the Bundesbank 'treated the pound sterling and French franc alike in all respects' and the compulsory D-Mark sales in favour of sterling, which the Bundesbank financed, were 'the largest compulsory interventions ever undertaken vis-a-vis a partner currency'. These comments contradict the impression relayed in the UK media last week that the Bundesbank showed less enthusiasm for the battle to save sterling than in last week's defence of the franc. Also new was the disclosure that the Bundesbank bought sterling between the ERM margins during the operation to keep it in the ERM. Some parts of the Bundesbank statement portrayed Frankfurt's contribution to sterling's defence in an especially favourable light, as, for example, when the German central bank appeared to take credit for the UK Treasury borrowing of Ecu10bn of foreign currency early in September. It also does not make clear that the Bundesbank did not support sterling for free and some of the D-Mark sales appear to have been carried out on behalf of the Bank of England. This means the German central bank expects the UK will pay back the credits effectively granted during the support operations in the ERM. This accumulation of liabilities by the UK seems to have upset some British officials. But Bundesbank officials insisted the rules applying in Britain's case are identical to those that will apply to Italy and France. From its inception, the EMS has exerted a harsh discipline on weak currency members. What they said LAMONT ' ..the markets were thrown into renewed turmoil by remarks about the need for a sterling devaluation attributed to the president of the Bundesbank, Dr Schlesinger. Those remarks were never convincingly denied, and they triggered the final, irresistible assault on sterling.' Hansard, 24 September SCHLESINGER 'In my interview with the German economic journal Handelsblatt, I expressly excluded the UK currency from being endangered.' Official statement, 30 September LAMONT 'History might have been different had we not been subjected to a constant stream of half-leaks and rumours emanating from certain sources.' Hansard, 24 September SCHLESINGER 'The Bundesbank cannot be blamed for anonymous statements, rumours emanating from market participants, inaccurate reproductions of statements by newspapers; I reject all such statements.' Official statement, 30 September LAMONT 'Obviously some harsh things and difficult things have been said - there has been a lot of controversy, and I am sorry if anything has been said that greatly upsets them, but there have been some issues between us.' 'I stand by every single word I have said about the role of the Bundesbank in the events leading up to our suspending of membership of the ERM ..' Statements to the press, 28 September</p>

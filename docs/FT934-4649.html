			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (1): The pun that said it all - First impressions: The city's calm and wealth mask tensions be neath the surface Except to those who pass through it often, such as fervent alpinists and those whom Swiss bankers covetously refer to as high net worth individuals, Zurich probably conjures up little more than images of heartless gnomes in Spartan counting rooms conspiring to manipulate the world's financial markets. Even the city's exact location is something of a mystery - somewhere in the Alps between Germany and Italy and close to - well, we are not quite sure what it is close to. Oddly, a first visit confirms this uncertainty. Whether the visitor arrives by aeroplane, train or car, he or she quickly becomes disoriented. The city is spread over a series of gentle pre-Alpine valleys where the waters flow out of the Lake of Zurich from the river Limmat, which will be joined a few hundred metres later by the river Sihl. Roads meander up and down these valleys unpredictably rather than follow any systematic pattern, making it difficult to maintain one's orientation. And in the centre of the town, the presence of two rivers, plus the remains of a long river-like moat, adds to the confusion. A second impression is more reassuring. The city exudes a sense of calm and confident order. There is a place for everything and everything is in its place, and what is more, you will have to pay a quick SFr60 fine if your car is not in the right place. The first surprise, for many, may be that the city's proportions are so modest. Few buildings exceed five storeys and few roads are wider than four lanes. Zurich is the antithesis of the great monumental cities of Europe - Paris, Berlin, Rome and Vienna. Zurich has never had an empire, but it has always been associated with money. Its early history can be traced to the site of Fort Lindenhof where Roman soldiers established a tax collecting station called Turicum in 15BC. Today, Zurichers play chess on giant boards in the pavement in the small park above the Limmat, surrounded by ruins of the old fort. Other landmarks in the city's history include seeing off the Habsburgs and joining the Swiss confederation in 1351 and the Protestant reformation in the first half of the 16th century, led by the still revered Huldrych Zwingli. The city's key figure in the 19th century was Alfred Escher, sometime president of the cantonal government, founder of Schweizerische Kreditanstalt (Credit Suisse) and financier extraordinaire, notably of the railway tunnel through the Gotthard pass and of massive hydroelectric projects in the Alps. Were it not for Escher's prodigious efforts, Zurich might today be just another relatively nondescript provincial European city - like, say, Toulouse or Stuttgart. But Zurich is still a financial centre to be reckoned with. Along its quiet streets can be found the headquarters of two of the world's largest international banks, Union Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse, and two of its largest insurance companies, Zurich Insurance and Swiss Reinsurance. The wealth that they and several other Zurich-based banks and businesses have brought have made the city the rather special place it is. That wealth is not on display in great buildings or great plazas. Indeed, there is very little distinguished architecture in Zurich, old or new. Rather, reflecting the Protestant values that have long prevailed, wealth is manifested discreetly, and only gradually does it become apparent to the unsuspecting visitor. It is, of course, in the Fraumunster church, with its exquisite stained glass windows by Chagall and Giacometti. And it is in the splendid private art collections, the astonishing variety of small, but excellent, museums and the world-class music schedule, only made possible by the sponsorship of the big banks and others. Above all, it is in the shops. Few agglomerations of Zurich's size can boast such a range of high quality shops. From antiques to fashions, every specialised taste is catered for with skill and polish, usually in the language of your choice. It is also in the excellent public services, especially the public transport system, whose clean and uncrowded buses, trams and trains run unfailingly to schedule. For all its understated bounty, Zurich is not paradise. Even the casual visitor will notice signs of social tension. Many building walls have been decorated with angry, surrealistic graffiti paintings, testimony to youthful frustration with such a well-ordered society. Hard by the main railway station, youths squatting in an abandoned warehouse painted on the wall facing the platforms the word 'Zureich' in the style of the Swiss Federal Railways. 'Too rich]' shouted this cunning pun - but last week the police demolished the buildings and drove out the squatters. Zurich's biggest social headache, however, is its outsize hard drug scene. Originally the outgrowth of student protests in the 1970s, it grew and shifted through the 1980s, becoming firmly entrenched in 1986 when a coalition of Socialists and Greens took control of the city government. They implemented as liberal a policy towards the addicts as Swiss laws would allow, and provided clean needles and counselling services. The scene mushroomed as addicts from all over the country and even from beyond Swiss borders came to take advantage of these friendly conditions. Tension of a different kind is reflected in the absence of a ring road around the city, forcing a huge volume of through traffic to negotiate the downtown area. When proposals for a ring road were first advanced in the 1950s, city merchants objected, fearing they would lose business. Now the project is stymied because of endless legal manoeuvres by environmentalists. The city's main problem, however, is not yet easily visible. Like many American cities, its population is declining as people move to the suburbs. Initially, this movement reflected a shortage of housing in the city, but latterly it has become a form of protest by companies and the middle classes against the ever-higher taxes the city has imposed to deal with its mounting social problems. Zurich's population has sunk from 445,000 in 1962 to about 340,000 today, but the real trend is even more dramatic, as the exodus of the middle classes has been replaced partly by lower earning immigrants. The city runs large deficits chronically and, sooner or later, some political restructuring will be needed, perhaps by incorporating suburban municipalities into the city, perhaps by shifting more of the city's obligations to the cantonal government. If the history of the drug problem is any example, action will only occur when the business community feels its custom is seriously threatened.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA also recognizes that the warning needs to be crafted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect the type of packaging used. Iron-containing products may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be packaged in unit-dose packages, e.g., blister packs, or in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers with closures, e.g., a bottle with a cap. FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tentatively concludes that for iron-containing products packaged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in unit-dose packages, the warning statement should include the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruction ``Keep in original package until each use.'' This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement instructs the user not to misuse the product by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removing more dosage units from their individual packs than will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be ingested at one time. This instruction is important because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such misuse can result in poisoning if children gain access to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the dosage units that have been removed from their original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaging. This instruction was not specifically requested by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any of the petitions. Because some incidents of pediatric iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisoning have occurred after adults removed multiple dosage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units from their original containers and stored them in nonchild-resistant vessels (see section I.C. of this document), however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agency tentatively concludes that this statement is necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ensure that the product is properly used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency concurs with the NDMA petition that the statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Close Tightly'' should be included in the warning statement for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers with closures. Such a statement provides information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on how to maintain the child-resistance of the container. FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finds that this message is a material fact. FDA bases this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finding, in part, on the fact that some incidents of iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisoning have occurred even though the product was in child-resistant packaging. Children were able to gain access to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron products because the child-resistant closure was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly secured (See section I.C. of this document). Thus, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that iron-containing products are used safely, the child-resistance of the packaging must be maintained, and FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tentatively concludes that inclusion of the statement ``Close  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tightly'' is necessary to ensure that condition of use is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA also tentatively concludes that the label must include the information ``Contains iron, which can harm or cause death to a child.'' This statement informs the user or the serious and potentially life-threatening nature of the consequences that can occur when a child ingests an uncontrolled amount of these products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

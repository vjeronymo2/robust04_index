			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: General Motors settles dispute with GE General Motors said yesterday it had reached an agreement with General Electric to avert a threatened boycott by GM of GE automotive products, Reuter reports from Detroit. Earlier, the Detroit Free Press newspaper had reported that GM had threatened to stop buying material if GE insisted on higher resin prices. Ms Linda Cook, a GM spokeswoman, declined to discuss details of the agreement but she said the company would work with GE to help reduce costs. 'We believe we've reached an amenable agreement with GE that benefits their business as well as ours,' Ms Cook said.</p>

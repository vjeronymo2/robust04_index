Rip-up  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of resilient sheet floor material is prohibited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) All scraping of residual adhesive and/or backing shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be performed using wet methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) Dry sweeping is prohibited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (F) Mechanical chipping is prohibited unless performed in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative pressure enclosure which meets the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (g)(5)(iv) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (G) Tiles shall be removed intact, unless the employer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrates that intact removal is not possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (H) When tiles are heated and can be removed intact,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wetting may be omitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (I) Resilient flooring/deck material in buildings/vessels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constructed no later than 1980, including associated mastic and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> backing shall be assumed to be asbestos-containing unless an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industrial hygienist determines that it is asbestos-free using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognized analytical techniques.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For removing roofing material which contains ACM the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer shall ensure that the following work practices are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> followed:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Roofing material shall be removed in an intact state to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the extent feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Wet methods shall be used where feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Cutting machines shall be continuously misted during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use, unless a competent person determines that misting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially decreases worker safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) All loose dust left by the sawing operation must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEPA vacuumed immediately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) Unwrapped or unbagged roofing material shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately lowered to the ground via covered, dust-tight chute,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crane or hoist, or placed in an impermeable waste bag or wrapped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in plastic sheeting and lowered to ground no later than the end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the work shift.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (F) Upon being lowered, unwrapped material shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferred to a closed receptacle in such manner so as to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preclude the dispersion of dust.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (G) Roof level heating and ventilation air intake sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be isolated or the ventilation system shall be shut down.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) When removing cementitious asbestos-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> siding, shingles (CACS), or transite panels containing ACM, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer shall ensure that the following work practices are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> followed:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Cutting, abrading or breaking siding, shingles, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transite panels shall be prohibited unless the employer can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate that methods less likely to result in asbestos fiber  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> release cannot be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Each panel or shingle shall be sprayed with amended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water prior to removal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Unwrapped or unbagged panels or shingles shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately lowered to the ground via covered dust-tight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chute, crane or hoist, or placed in an impervious waste bag or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wrapped in plastic sheeting and lowered to the ground no later  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than the end of the work shift.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Nails shall be cut with flat, sharp instruments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) When removing gaskets containing ACM, the employer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall ensure that the following work practices are followed:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) If a gasket is visibly deteriorated and unlikely to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removed intact, removal shall be undertaken within a glovebag as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The gasket shall be thoroughly wetted with amended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water prior to its removal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The wet gasket shall be immediately placed in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal container.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Any scraping to remove residue must be performed wet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) When performing any other Class II removal of asbestos  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing material for which specific controls have not been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed in paragraph (g)(8)(iv) (A) through (D) of this section,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the employer shall ensure that the following work practices are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complied with.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The material shall be thoroughly wetted with amended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water prior and during its removal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The material shall be removed in an intact state unless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the employer demonstrates that intact removal is not possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!--

			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPANSION OF TOKYO AIRPORT STILL GROUNDED BY MILITANT PROTESTERS;  </P> <P> JAPAN: FARMERS REFUSE TO SELL THEIR LAND FOR NEW RUNWAYS. PASSENGERS USING  CROWDED NARITA CAN EXPECT MORE FRUSTRATION.  </P> <P> Many a visitor to Japan has a horror story, or two, to tell about Narita  Airport.  </P> <P> Minutes after arriving at the gateway to this land of affluence and high  technology, the typical traveler must wade through endless lines at an  immigration inspection, battle ludicrous crowds to board a limousine bus and  grind molars during a frustrating two-hour freeway jam to a downtown hotel.  </P> <P> It gets worse on the trip home. One-way taxi fare to the airport, built on  farmland 40 miles east of Tokyo, easily exceeds $140. Police in full riot gear  examine the bags of even the most unassuming tourist passing through a gate  fortified with steel barricades and barbed wire. Inside the terminal lurk more  nightmarish lines and security checkpoints.  </P> <P> Authorities say they hope to fix the airport's crowding and transportation  problems in a couple of years, once a new rail link, two additional runways and  a second terminal building are completed.  </P> <P> But nobody is betting on it. A handful of farmers are still growing vegetables  on land that the bureaucrats sketched into their plans as new runways. Propped  up by a bickering coalition of student radicals and professional protesters,  these farmers refuse to sell their property, which the government has only  limited powers to seize.  </P> <P> Now, after nearly two decades of political stalemate and occasionally violent  confrontation, tension is rising anew at Narita. The Transport Ministry invoked  a special airport security law this month to deploy a brigade of 1,200 riot  police and engineers with water cannons, cranes and bulldozers to tear down a  "fortress" built by radical protesters on the disputed land.  </P> <P> Defenders wearing helmets and masks threw firebombs from steel towers over  their makeshift shack in a scene reminiscent of the fanatical protest movement  that delayed the opening of the airport, first conceived in the mid-1960s,  until 1978. Already, Phase 2 of the airport construction plan is more than a  decade behind schedule.  </P> <P> Authorities did not report any serious injuries in the latest melee. But four  police officers and two protesters were killed and scores of others were  injured in violence during the initial stage of airport construction.  </P> <P> The fighting is far from over. The Transport Ministry has threatened to  forcibly dismantle several other fortress-like "solidarity huts" built by  radicals over the years on the site. Protesters have vowed to dig in.  </P> <P> No solution is in sight for Narita, dubbed the "one-lung airport" by the Asahi  newspaper for its single runway and its woefully inadequate facilities. And  even if construction went ahead smoothly, some observers doubt that the  $2.9-billion expansion would be sufficient to meet Tokyo's needs very far into  the future.  </P> <P> In a rare sign of conciliation, Transport Minister Takami Eto issued his  agency's first official apology recently for its failure to talk to local  landowners before unveiling plans to build Narita back in 1966. That error in  social consensus-building, Eto conceded, drove farmers into the arms of the  radicals.  </P> <P> It remains uncertain whether the government can correct its legacy of  bureaucratic bungling and persuade the farmers to sell -- or use its powers of  eminent domain to take their land without provoking further bloodshed.  </P> <P> A radical group called Chukakuha, or "Middle Core Faction," terrorized the  citizens panel charged with overseeing eminent domain at the airport until the  panel disbanded itself in November, 1988.  </P> <P> Not all of the eight farmers who cling to their land inside the expansion site  endorse violence. In fact, protesting landowners have splintered into three  major factions, only one of which remains aligned with Chukakuha.  </P> <P> Yet Chukakuha is the dominant group among two dozen different sects from  Japan's "new left" that joined the Narita protest, searching for a symbolic  cause after mass movements against the Vietnam War and the Japan-U.S security  alliance began to fizzle. Many of the student supporters who came here more  than 20 years ago have settled down.  </P> <P> To Naokatsu Ogawa, 45, a farmer who owns three acres on the expansion site,  resisting the airport is as much a part of the life style he inherited from his  father as tilling the land.  </P> <P> Ogawa was 21 when the government shocked the local community with a fait  accompli -- that a new international airport would be constructed in their  midst.  </P> <P> "I didn't like farming all that much -- I would have sold," Ogawa said during a  recent interview in a shack on the construction site, where he and a band of  supporters pack organic vegetables to be trucked to sympathetic consumers in  Tokyo. "But my father was dead-set against the airport, so here I am."  </P> <P> About 325 farm households in Ogawa's Sanrizuka hamlet were told in 1966 that  they would have to move away from the plateau, a former imperial horse pasture  that was opened to homesteading after World War II. About half sold out  immediately.  </P> <P> But the rest were enraged by the attitude of Transport Ministry officials who  decided to take their land without first consulting them. Mostly out of  stubborn pride, they denounced the "arrogance of the state" and refused to  budge.  </P> <P> Many were persuaded to abandon the site during protracted negotiations that  followed. The government ultimately used the special eminent-domain powers to  evict die-hards living on the phase-one site, sparking battles in which both  sides drew blood.  </P> <P> Ogawa and the others living on the expansion site are resisting lucrative cash  offers by authorities.  </P> <P> "I've developed too many ties within the anti-airport league to quit now,"  Ogawa said. "People from the airport authority come around all the time and ask  me to cooperate. I tell them I'm not interested."  </P> <P> Makoto Tsubokawa, an official with the New Tokyo International Airport  Authority, the agency in charge of Narita, said the government is promising to  provide new farmland outside the area in addition to cash.  </P> <P> Still, Tsubokawa said the protest movement has become so politicized that  outside supporters block constructive dialogue with the farmers. About 56  acres, or 4% of the construction site, remains in the hands of opponents.  </P> <P> "I'm ready to talk directly to them any time, anywhere," Eto, the transport  minister, told reporters. "I'm confident they can be convinced."  </P> <P> But Ogawa, a member of the moderate Atsuta faction of the splintered  anti-airport league, said he feels harassed by an atmosphere of intimidation  that prevails in the construction zone.  </P> <P> "How can we talk to them with all this barbed wire around here?" he said,  gesturing toward a 10-foot steel fence topped with coiled barbs that the  airport authority erected a few months ago next to his vegetable packing shed.  </P> <P> On the other side of the fence is a moat and another steel fence. Beyond this  is one of many watchtowers where riot police keep a 24-hour vigil with  floodlights and binoculars. The fortress that police attacked early this month,  belonging to the radical Battle Flag faction, stood just a few yards from  Ogawa's shed.  </P> <P> "The riot police stop and search us at every bend of the road, so we can't go  about our business," Ogawa said. "I'm not a radical student. I'm just a hick  from a farm village, but they're still searching my car."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the existing facilities at Narita face inexorable pressure for  expansion. The airport, conceived before anyone predicted Japan's economic boom  or the advent of nonstop, long-distance jumbo jets, handles two-thirds of the  country's flights and more than 80% of its international cargo. With its single  runway, it already ranks first among the world's airports in cargo volume and  eighth in the number of international passengers.  </P> <P> Use of the existing terminal already exceeds its original design capacity of 13  million passengers a year by nearly 50%. And flights are up 14% this year to  about 330 daily, a considerable strain on resources because of an 11 p.m.-to-6  a.m. curfew aimed at curbing complaints about noise.  </P> <P> Foreign airlines bemoan the shortage of terminal gates -- most airliners must  park on the tarmac and passengers are bused to and from the terminal. Baggage  handling facilities are inadequate. Narita's fuel and operating costs are the  highest in the world, reflecting the airport's burdensome debt service. Still,  airlines from 39 countries are waiting for permission to land at the airport.  </P> <P> The airport authority believes the second-phase construction will sufficiently  expand capacity, but concedes that the second main runway, at 8,250 feet, will  be too short for anything but short-haul flights within Asia.  </P> <P> The most vexing problem with Narita -- its formidable distance from the capital  -- is likely to be improved in early 1991, when the government hopes to  complete a new rail link connecting the terminal to Tokyo Station in 60  minutes.  </P> <P> The original plan for a 30-minute "bullet train" route had to be scrapped,  however. Landowners along the right-of-way would not sell.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Sorokin under the rubric "Chronicles of </F> the Absurd": "Mikhail Poltoranin Likes To Have Journalists  Eating Out Of His Hand"]    [Text] Two days ago the State Duma passed in the  first reading a federal law, the text of which has accidentally  ended up in my hands.    It makes sense to examine the law in more detail because  this  is one of the first laws passed by our new parliament (it seems  that only the law on the status of deputies and the amnesty  decree, which has the force of law, came before it). The law on  deputy status did have a precursor--a similar law of the  previous, now dispersed, Supreme Soviet, and the amnesty decree  was initially submitted by the president altogether, whereas  this draft is, so to say, a product of the Duma's own creativity  and is without parallel in our legislation.    Unfortunately it seems to be without parallel in another  respect--in terms of its absurdity and inferiority.    The law describes "procedures for coverage of organs of  state  power in the state mass media" and was submitted by the relevant  committee (chairman Mikhail Poltoranin). I do not know what  behind-the-scenes struggle preceded the emergence of this draft  and who schemed against whom, but I can confidently maintain  that there was an intrigue. First, the draft law invades, and  invades very substantially, a quite specific professional  sphere--journalism as a whole and TV journalism in particular.  However, as far as I can judge from the silence of the press,  not one major professional journalist was familiarized with the  text in advance. For example, can a person who has never sat  behind a steering wheel in his life single-handedly establish  the rules of the road? Perhaps he can, but it is clear what is  going to happen at intersections.    Either they, naive as babes in the woods, counted on the law  making it through before the press "gets wind of it" (even if it  does make it through, who is going to comply?), or some of the  editors knew but were as silent as guerrillas....    In principle I can even compile a list of the names of these  guerrillas; it is easy to guess. The traces of intrigue remain  in the text of the draft law. Actually, we are looking at two or  even three completely different laws which are crudely fitted  inside one another without even being polished in any way.    The first law, let us call it the original one, corresponds  to the general headline: "On Procedures for Coverage of  Activities of Organs of State Power by STATE Mass Media"  (emphasis mine--Yuriy Sorokin). The very first article (the  subject regulated by the law) explains that at issue are  precisely the state mass media, i.e. those that are founded by  organs of power and, consequently, it does apply to other mass  media (which are independent of the state).    A norm follows thereafter which is new in our legislation  and  which I as a journalist who has not yet lost his taste for  freedom cannot but welcome: It says in black and white that  state organs of all kinds CANNOT BE founders of the mass media  (with the exception of those publishing official communications  only). That is to say, the state retains for itself utterly  official publications such as SBORNIK UKAZOV...and  PRAVITELSTVENNYY VESTNIK, whereas the rest are free....    In the immemorial time of perestroyka, when the current  adviser to the president Yuriy Baturin together with Mikhail  Fedotov and Vladimir Entin wrote their first draft law on the  FREEDOM of the press, which became the base for all subsequent  laws--even they did not proceed to insert such a norm in the  draft law, their entire ceremonious but unyielding democratism  of the time notwithstanding. This quite obviously was not  "passable" material....    At present, this norm is already perceived as commonplace.  Most mass media have long ceased to be owned by the state de  jure. Technically, neither KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, nor TRUD, to  say nothing of the new, recently started newspapers and  magazines have to report to the state concerning anything: Some  have, to the noise of three revolutions in a row, reregistered  as publications founded by collectives of journalists or public  or private organizations independent of the authorities; others  have been established by private individuals or independent  structures from the very beginning.    Until recently there were exceptions--some central and local  publications which fell victim to the last skirmish of the two  branches of power in October, for example, in the case of  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, which the president in essence took away  from the routed parliament. However, under this new law, which I  call the original one, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA will also be set free.    A knowledgeable legislator without a hidden agenda up his  sleeve would perhaps leave off here. It does not make sense to  describe the entire procedure for the publication of official  communications by the state informational organs in detail at  the legal level--first, because very few such publications  remain; second, a law cannot be written to cover absolutely all  occasions anyway. It would be much simpler and more feasible to  appoint obedient and diligent state officials (editors) to state  publications with whom all issues would be resolved "on a  routine footing."    It is just that, taking into account the sad Russian  tradition of self-devouring authorities, it would have made  sense to restrict in the law the very list of official  publications, striking a balance and clearly indicating to which  of the branches of power each publication should belong. There  is even more reason to do so because the official organs should  obviously be financed directly from the budget, and it is the  direct responsibility of the parliament elected by the people to  count the taxpayer's money. This is it. I repeat that this is  where a legislator should leave off if he seeks to ensure  precisely the thing he talks about publicly.    However, our legislator is not like that.    A text from a quite different quarter has been inserted into  the original text of the law devoted solely to STATE mass media.  Specifically, Article 4, which in essence regulates the  relationship between the state and the entire INDEPENDENT press  altogether, and then on the most essential score--financial.  From the point of view of canons, this is like an excerpt from a  manual on steel pouring being printed in a cookbook. First, the  relationship between the state and the independent press is  regulated by a separate law, and if something needs to be  changed, amendments to the already existing law should be passed  or yet another, new law should be passed. In any event, this  issue should be voted on separately rather than attached to a  law devoted to another, unimportant problem. Second, this is  about money and, as we will see, a lot of it; therefore, a  separate consideration is even more necessary because this  substantially increases the expenditure side of the budget.  Third, although this is poetry, actually such legislative  changes in the financial relationship between the state and the  independent press, as we will see, call into question the  independence of the press in general, and this already amounts  to an incursion into the sphere of constitutional liberties....    However, it is clear that those who inserted Article 4 into  the original text did not act out of glaring incompetence; quite  the opposite. It is precisely a separate vote on this issue that  they were trying to avoid, aware that in that case the alignment  of votes would be uncertain, to put it mildly. This is why I  have the right to talk about a scheme. However, just as  paleontologists restore the image of a dinosaur based on the  imprint of its hind leg preserved in hard coal, I can restore  the image of the giant who walked through here from the text of  Article 4....    It reads:    "Printed periodicals shall publish materials or  communications of the state organs of the Russian Federation and  its components under contracts and at a fee out of the funds  allocated from the relevant budget to ensure the operation of  these state organs."    It is precisely the independent press that is meant here by  "printed periodicals" because the dependent press is named the  "state mass media," and this is specifically mentioned in the  text. A numerical calculation, which judging from the signature  was prepared by one I.Ye. Vybornova, chairman of the  subcommittee for economic support of the mass media, is enclosed  with the text. I am not going to give the details of these  numbers. I ask that you trust me as a professional  newspaperman--the numbers are stupid and pulled out of a hat.  However, two circumstances are important to us in this instance:  First, it is suggested that the state will pay the newspapers  for the latter to communicate the fact of the existence of the  state on a daily basis AT ADVERTISING RATES, and that the total  amount will exceed 40 billion rubles [R], apparently in the few  months to come (incidentally, no precise time period is  indicated).    So, if we perceive all that has been written here literally,  it is plain gobbledygook. As is known, the independent press  does not publish the texts of laws, official acts, and so on. At  best it offers information on them and as a rule such  information is prejudiced. It is somehow absurd to pay state  money for this. Besides, it does not make sense--this is money  going the drain because, whether or not the state pays, the  independent press will offer information about all state events  and decrees of any consequence in any event--after all, nobody  would read a large proportion of the newspapers otherwise, and  they would go bankrupt. Paying at advertising rates is  impossible; advertisement is goods by the piece, and the cost of  newspaper space for advertising is measured in centimeters. For  example, how are you going to calculate how many centimeters in  the discourse of a particular commentator may be appraised as  advertising for a state organ? Incidentally, which organ? The  president? But what if the commentator praises the Duma and, as  of today, dislikes the president?    However, it is not worthwhile to sort through all this  delirium because this is not what it was meant for. Actually,  this is about so-called state subsidies for the press, except  that this time the issue is hidden within new and not very  fortunate packaging. It is hidden because in the open it would  run into quite legitimate resistance.    The issue of subsidies for the press arose most acutely  after  the price explosion in January 1992. Since the funds for  subscriptions were collected for one year in advance, still at  old prices, it was clear that newspapers would not survive given  soaring prices for newsprint, transportation, energy, services  of the Ministry of Communications, and so on. The situation was  piquant because by then most central newspapers had either  registered their independence from the state or had claimed  such. However, all of them demanded money from the state in  unison at that point. Ultimately, the state proceeded to do  this, despite Gaydar's categorical objections. Most newspapers  got subsidies (tremendous amounts for the budget), although a  few with the largest circulation, in particular KOMSOMOLSKAYA  PRAVDA and TRUD, got the lion's share of subsidies. This measure  may have been justified at that point in order to prevent a  cataclysmic collapse of the press at the initial stage of  reforms (at the time most of the press supported them).    Besides, having allocated the money, the government could  not  help getting certain things in return. This function of  collecting ideological tribute from the newspapers was assumed  by Mikhail Poltoranin, minister of the press at the time.  Mikhail Nikiforovich liked to have journalists eating out of his  hand. For him this was a huge and interesting area of work: to  compile lists of publications, to weigh thoroughly and for a  long time whom to give or not to give subsidies, to discuss this  with editors, naturally giving advice in the process as to what  tone they should write in and about which branch of power....  However, in the public eye Mikhail Nikiforovich, on the  contrary, appeared as the only savior of the free press: Look, I  have pushed through the subsidies, and I push them through every  day.... The microscopic sum he allocated to the newspapers  PRAVDA and SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA at the time gave him the pretext  to regularly refer to himself on TV screens as the model of a  Genuine Democrat: Look, I have given money to the opposition,  too. (At the time few people pondered the fact that this  particular opposition suited the government.)    In the few years since, the situation in the newspaper  market  has changed qualitatively. The circulation of all newspapers has  dropped substantially, not right away but rather gradually, and  nothing horrible has happened. The sky has not fallen. Quite the  contrary, the combined circulation of publications has not  changed all that much; the readership was redistributed. It came  out that a tremendous number of "central" newspapers (which was  natural in a huge, strictly centralized state) was apparently  just not needed in a much smaller country which, in addition, is  structured on the federal rather than totalitarian principle. It  has been precisely local and regional publications that have  developed. New nonpoliticized publications have come along  which, it transpires, can survive on their own. Banks have  appeared which have already matured enough to finance  newspapers, thus relieving the state of this burden. However,  the payment of subsidies has continued, though understandably  not to all. As a result the situation in the newspaper market  has begun to assume slightly absurd features: Prices for  newsprint and everything else are growing; the still centralized  Rospechat [Main Directorate for Press Distribution of the  Ministry of Communications] is unable to handle the distribution  of newspapers and is also demanding greater funds, likewise the  postal service; the number of subscribers is falling steadily,  but the number of newspapers is increasing anyway! There is a  shortage of journalists already!    The subsidies are one of the principal reasons. Tens of  thousands of tonnes of wasted paper are returned as scrap  because dozens of publications exist in the old, preserved form  due to subsidies. The impossibility of accomplishing oneself  while working in a press that is independent de jure but not de  facto, which is becoming increasingly obvious to journalists, is  another reason. The reluctance of the regions to have a press  dependent solely on an uncle from Moscow is yet another reason,  and so on, and so forth, all the way to the readers' desire to  have a choice....    I am not maintaining that state assistance to the press is  completely unnecessary: The newspaper business is very risky,  and regulatory intervention of the state in one form or another  is necessary. The forms of such intervention which are accepted  in civilized countries have long been known: Primarily tax  relief (newspapers are still fleeced at the rate of commercial  enterprises); second, subsidization of the relevant mail and  communication services (which in essence would amount to moving  the money from one of the state's pockets to another), and  finally, leasing of premises to publications at preferential  rates (meanwhile, in our country, even in the notorious House of  the Press on Pushkin Street in Moscow, "merchants" were  ensconced upon "merchants" who naturally had the resources to  give bribes).    Finally, the state must of course maintain a comparatively  small proportion of publications (in terms of  funding)--specialized children's, medical, scientific, etc.  publications. Incidentally, even they can be financed out of  other relevant items of expenditure, and no political allusions  will arise in this matter.    All of this has been known for a long time and published 100  times. Why does the issue of subsidies surface, as we can see,  yet again and in this sophisticated form?    As the saying goes, look for the one who benefits....    In very simple terms, subsidies are necessary for a few  dozen  small publications, of whose existence, I am convinced, an  overwhelming majority of the population is not even aware; these  publications will immediately die off in the absence of  subsidies. Besides, the two supermonopoly giants of the domestic  press, TRUD and KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, apparently insist on  subsidies. It is precisely subsidies that help them maintain  their circulation at the quite high level of a few million  copies. However, neither newspaper will collapse if it is  deprived of subsidies: It is just that their circulations will  drop (the circulation of the already mentioned KOMSOMOLSKAYA  PRAVDA has dropped in recent years from 22 million to 3 million,  but the people were not left without information  nonetheless--nature abhors a vacuum). Why does KOMSOMOLSKAYA  PRAVDA need a circulation that is still huge by current  standards, even at the price of losing real independence from  state structures and a continuous shortage of funds to pay for  newsprint? Perhaps KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA does not need this, but  the Komsomolskaya Pravda Joint-Stock Company does. The size of  profits from advertisements depends on circulation, and these  profits of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA are not measured in tens of  millions. Naturally they are not returned to any budget but are  rather put to use again through commercial structures of the  Komsomolskaya Pravda Joint-Stock Company. It seems to me that we  know what to call the allocation of sums going into billions  from the state budget to a private commercial company which  extracts profits from them and distributes the profits among its  people. It is just that the legal practice of the world appears  to lack a term for instances in which the parliament is involved  in this.    A companion memorandum enclosed with the draft law is signed  by the chairman of the Committee for Information Policy--indeed,  the same Mikhail Nikiforovich Poltoranin. I do not intend to  suspect the former minister, who still cultivates a warm  relationship with the leaders of a number of publications, of  being commercially interested--this will never be proven!  However, Mikhail Poltoranin's political interest is obvious:  After all, tax relief, which can truly improve the situation of  the entire press, does not call for creating some kind of  structure which would once again carve up the pie and,  therefore, keep the hungry on a leash.    Meanwhile subsidies--even in the form of "payments for  advertising the state," ridiculous as it might be--do call for  creating some kind of commission or committee that will decide  how much to give to whom, and who ran the better or worse  advertisement. Understandably, whoever heads this committee will  have informal influence on the two largest newspapers in the  country, and therefore carry an altogether different political  weight of his own....    However, this does not exhaust the list of incongruences (or  congruences--depending on the angle you take) in the text of the  draft law.    Further on, after this small extraneous insert which will  cost the taxpayer R45 billion, an altogether wild text follows  that is devoted to the problems of our poor television,  virtually all of which, with the exception of Independent  Television, is unfortunately state-owned.    At first the issue is what television is obliged to show in  newscasts. In the opinion of the legislator, newscasts should  consist of a demonstration of what the various organs of power  from the very top to the very bottom, along both the executive  and representative vertical chains of command, are doing.    I quote:    "The state audiovisual mass media of federal significance  shall include, on the day of occurrence of the event in  question, in all informational programs reports on:    "decisions and actions falling within the jurisdiction of  the  Russian Federation president or the Russian Federation  Constitutional Court, or constituting the responsibility of the  chambers of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly in keeping  with Articles 88, 93, Part 2, Article 87, Part 2, Article 92,  Part 2, Article 108, Parts 2 and 3, Article 111, Points a), c),  and e), Article 83, Points a), b), c), and f), Part 1, Article  84, Points a), b), c), d), and e), Part 1, Article 102, Points  a), b), f) and g), Part 1, Article 103 of the Constitution of  the Russian Federation.    "The state audiovisual mass media of federal significance  shall include, on the day of occurrence of the event in  question, in all informational programs reports on:    "decisions and actions falling within the jurisdiction of  the  Russian Federation president or the Russian Federation  Constitutional Court, or constituting the responsibility of the  chambers of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly in keeping  with Parts 1, 4, and 5, Article 102, Points c), d) and e),  Article 103 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation;    "statements of the Russian Federation president, chambers of  the Russian Federation Federal Assembly, and the Russian  Federation Government;    "presentations by the chairman of the Russian Federation  Government, deputy chairmen of the Russian Federation  Government, and federal ministers at the proceedings of the  chambers of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly;    "press conferences of the Russian Federation president, the  chairman of the Russian Federation Government, the chairman of  the Federation Council of the Russian Federation Federal  Assembly, the chairman of the State Duma of the Russian  Federation Federal Assembly, as well as press conferences held  by decisions of the committees, commissions, factions, or deputy  groups of the chambers of the Russian Federation Federal  Assembly;    "other publicly significant facts of activities of the  federal organs of state power.    "The state audiovisual mass media of federal significance  must ensure prompt information for TV viewers and radio  listeners concerning official visits by the heads of foreign  states and governments to the Russian Federation, as well as  about official visits abroad of the Russian Federation president  and delegations of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly or  the Russian Federation Government...."    Alas, this is just the beginning. These are merely  newscasts,  and everything else follows on several pages. Everything is  regimented--the time of broadcasting (prior to 2400), an  opportunity to cut advertisement into the stream of official  reports (impossible), the length and frequency of other  programs, coordination procedures, and so on. Even the  "preferential right" of the speaker on the principal issue to  appear on the air is envisioned, as well as that of a deputy who  has spoken at a meeting if his point of view has won a certain  number of votes. It is envisioned that all these programs should  not overlap in time if they are broadcast on different channels.  The order in which video episodes should be placed is  envisioned: first, about the parliament, then about then  president, then about the governments, and so on, up to  mandatory participation by journalists in "informational and  educational programs" about the operation of the state organs  and criminal liability for violating the present law.    It is instructive that all this legislative gibberish is  subsequently extended from the federal, central level to all  others in descending order. According to the beautifully  consistent bureaucratic thought, the same should be happening to  local radio and television! That is to say, the local  authorities do not have the right to sort things out even with  their own television--here is the federation for you....    In general I am recounting all this with amazement rather  than outrage: Unlike the issue of subsidies, this part of the  "law" is absolutely harmless because it cannot be carried out in  principle. It would be easier to close television down. Besides,  sooner or later the state will be compelled to set television  free just as it did newspapers: It is impossible to maintain  television out of the budget.    However, another point is the most essential in this  instance--that this, if we may say so, draft law has been passed  by the Duma in the first reading. While I have loved the  parliament for a long time and with devotion regardless of who  is in it, just as a symbol of hope that one day we will be all  right, too, I cannot but note that the continuous struggle of  the democrats against parliamentarism has borne fruit. Obviously  the current Duma does not have legal personnel with any degree  of skill (all of them have long been in the presidential  structures, banks, or overseas; besides, who is going to come to  a place where shots are fired, and not blank ones!). Meanwhile,  a parliament is first of all a research establishment, and only  then a voting machine. The parliament should have at its  disposal the best personnel, time, and material potential in  order to not vote on such gibberish. As the first attempt  indicates, our parliament lacks all these. A few more "tries" of  this nature and the Duma will indeed have to be disbanded: After  all, control of a spaceship cannot be entrusted to the intellect  of an ape.</p>

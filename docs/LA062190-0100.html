			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> RISK MANAGEMENT COSTS  </P> <P> Pasadena spends more for risk management than other cities of comparable size,  according to an audit prepared by Newport Beach consultants Warren, McVeigh  &amp; Griffin Inc.  </P> <P> The report, presented at Tuesday's Board of Directors meeting, attributed the  higher costs to the diverse services offered by the city, including its own  police helicopter fleet, electric power company and independent health clinics.  </P> <P> According to the report, Pasadena pays $4.4 million annually for risk  management, including workers' compensation, liability claims and insurance  premiums. The consultants didn't list costs in comparable cities.  </P> <P> Among the suggestions to reduce costs and improve the city's risk management  were more safety training in the administrative services departments and  development of a safety policy and manual for all city departments.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 10 (YONHAP) -- The Czech Republic has  recently withdrawn its embassy in Pyongyang, a Western source  here said on Friday.    "Following their withdrawal from the neutral nations  supervisory commission in Korea a while ago, the Czech Republic  has recently closed down its embassy in Pyongyang for a reason  not formally known," the source said.    He said a Western firm is now negotiating with North Korea  for the lease of the 14-room Czech Embassy building.    It appears, the source said, that Czech had closed down its  embassy in North Korea in the belief that it is not economically  or diplomatically advantageous to keep their embassy there.    Cuba, too, is said to have withdrawn its embassy from  Pyongyang, but this has not been confirmed, the source added.</p>

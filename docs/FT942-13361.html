			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Schneider vanished with Pounds 87m Mr Jurgen Schneider, the German property entrepreneur whose disappearance earlier this month triggered Germany's biggest property crash in decades, took at least DM219m (Pounds 87m) in cash from the group before he left, the chief executive of the Deutsche Bank said yesterday. Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of the bank which is the Schneider group's biggest creditor, explained that Mr Schneider had transferred the money from time-deposit accounts at German institutions to foreign accounts during March. By the time Deutsche and other banks made efforts to retrieve the cash this month, said Mr Kopper, it was untraceable. He was speaking at a news conference specially convened for the bank to put its point of view on the Schneider affair. Germany's biggest bank has DM1.2bn of loans outstanding to the property group and has been at the centre of ferocious criticism in Germany over its failure to prevent the debacle. Mr Kopper, in defiant form, said that the bank was in danger of being portrayed as the perpetrator of the crisis rather than as a victim of fraud. He said the bank's early investigations showed that 'credit fraud was prepared intentionally and systematically' and that Mr Schneider had applied himself to the task of tricking the banks 'with criminal energy'. He claimed that the fraud went beyond Mr Schneider to include professional advisers used by Deutsche to verify details of its lending against specific properties. '(It is) absolutely clear. . . . that Centralboden (the Deutsche mortgage lending subsidiary through which the bulk of Deutsche's lending was channeled) received falsified reports from publicly appointed, official valuers, and that manipulated tenancy agreements were used (in order to obtain money from the bank). 'What is undeniable is that mistakes were made,' Mr Kopper conceded.' The most grave mistake was that we allowed ourselves to be deceived.' He was adamant that the bank employees would not be made a scapegoat 'as a sop to public opinion', but said there was no taboo about sacking bank staff should their mistakes be proven during the course of internal investigations into the affair. Mr Kopper played down the financial consequences of the collapse for the bank, explaining that the amount of money lent to the group was three-thousandths of the bank's total lending volume, and that only part of that was at risk. The bank would probably have to write-off 'several hundred' million D-Marks against its exposure in its 1994 accounts, he said. He acknowledged, however, Deutsche Bank's broader responsibilities and said that craftsmen owed money on the three uncompleted projects financed by the bank would be paid for their services. He said the plan was to complete these developments. The amount owing to craftsmen was about DM50m, a sum he described as 'peanuts'. There had been damage to the bank's image, he conceded. Much of this was unfounded, he claimed, saying that Deutsche remained Europe's leading bank. The DM219m known to have been salted away by Mr Schneider compares to the DM580m Mr Schneider was known to have had on deposit at the beginning of the year. While some of this may have been absorbed by the business during the three months to his disappearance, it may be that Mr Schneider has pocketed more, as yet undetected funds. The group had cash balances of just DM5m when declared bankrupt earlier this month. See Lex</p>

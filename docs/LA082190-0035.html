			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN LOST IN KERN RIVER IS PRESUMED DROWNED  </P> <P> A Canoga Park man disappeared while tubing in the Kern River Saturday night and  is presumed to have drowned, Kern County Sheriff's deputies said Monday.  </P> <P> Marcos Rayes, 23 was last seen crossing a levee in the Kern River in an inner  tube.  </P> <P> "He went over a small levee where the velocity of the water increases and  disappeared after that," said Deputy Richard Dixon.  </P> <P> Three divers and 19 members of the search and rescue team searched for Rayes  Saturday night and Sunday. The search was called off Sunday afternoon.  </P> <P> "At this point, he's reported missing and presumed dead," Dixon said.  </P> <P> Although Rayes was in a non-restricted area near Hart Memorial Park in  northeastern Bakersfield, the swift waters are often difficult to navigate,  Dixon said.  </P> <P> "We highly recommend that people not swim in the Kern River," he said. "It's  dangerous."  </P> <P> This year, six people have drowned in the Kern River, including an 18-year-old  Maywood man who drowned last month while swimming in a restricted area.  </P></p>

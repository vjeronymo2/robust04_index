			<p>Language: <F P=105> Burmese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The final-year students from training course  No.25 of the University for Development of National Races [UDNR]  paid a courtesy call on Senior General Than Shwe, chairman of  the State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] and  commander of the Defense Services, at the Pyithu Hluttaw  Building's Mingala Hall at 0900 this morning and received the  words of advice from him. [passage omitted]    At the ceremony, Sr. Gen. Than Shwe, chairman of the SLORC  and commander of the Defense Services, acted as a chairman while  Lieutenant Colonel Pe Nyein, director general of the Office of  the SLORC, acted as master of ceremonies. [passage omitted]  Continuing, he said the Ministry of Progress of Border Areas and  National Races and Development Affairs was founded, and this  ministry was given the sole responsibility to implement the  development activities. The separate ministry was founded  because the government has a genuine goodwill for the rapid  development of our people. We are carrying out these  development activities because we want the people in the remote  areas to be like us.    These development activities are being implemented with this  objective. We are in a position to implement these activities,  and some people understand about this. That is why the armed  organizations are joining us. At the same time, there are some  armed organizations who have yet to understand our efforts.  That is why we, with genuine goodwill, are inviting these  remaining groups at the present by making the utmost efforts.  However, we have a problem because the fixed political belief  still prevails among our national races and the armed  organizations. That is, the enemy still sticks to the old  political idea that its enemy is weak or there is a withering of  strength within its enemy, and it can exploit politically and  militarily when its enemy makes a proposal for negotiations and  for making peace. We honestly invited them, but they still  continue to hold on to the old political idea by thinking that  we are facing crises and problems, and they can establish  political and military exploitation; they ignored the  development of their own country, and they are trying to exploit  the situation to benefit their own party or organization. They  do not understand.    That is why we are patiently inviting certain organizations.  For instance, we are still inviting the KNU [Karen National  Union] and Mon. We are inviting them with good intentions and  goodwill. We are doing so not because we do not have enough  strength. We are doing it to stop the bloodshed and killing  among the national races. Our country obtained independence  more than 40 years ago. What is going to be the position of our  people in the present situation? Although our country is rich,  we are poor due to the lack of peace and unity.    If our country is peaceful, and all of us work together,  then  our people will become prosperous, and our country will become a  peaceful and modern state because of the wealth of our country.  We have been fighting for about 40 years. We are all national  brothers. Enough is enough. One should see the mistakes by  now. One should see the right things by now. One should  consider the country. We should work for the development of our  country. It is time to repay the historical debt owed the  country because one should understand by now that even though  there were chances for our country to become rich, it was left  undeveloped because of the killings and fighting. By  understanding this, one should say to oneself that we owe the  country and will repay the historical debt by working toward the  establishment of peaceful and modern state. However, some do  not have this kind of goodwill. [passage omitted]    The ceremony ended at 1000.</p>

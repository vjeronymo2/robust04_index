			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Hanson launches Pounds 780m bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, yesterday launched a hostile Pounds 780m cash bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the milling, baking and grocery products group, in a move which could lead to a restructuring of the industry. The bid, the first sizeable hostile takeover in the UK stockmarket for some months, comes at a time when profits in the UK milling and baking industry are under severe pressure. Hanson said its managerial skills and financial strengths could assist its restructuring. Hanson's attack also revives questions about the acquisitive group's strategy, which had appeared to change following criticism when it took a 2.8 per cent stake in Imperial Chemical Industries last year. Lord Hanson, chairman of Hanson, offered to have 'amicable and constructive discussions' with RHM. In a letter to Mr Stanley Metcalfe, chairman of RHM, Lord Hanson said 'RHM seems to have lost its way forward since the time of the bid in 1988 when you turned down 465p a share'. Mr Metcalfe said he was surprised by the bid but was prepared to meet Lord Hanson to discuss it. However, RHM said there was 'no commercial logic' in the offer and that it 'seriously undervalues' the company. After the 220p a share offer was announced, RHM shares rose to 241p, up 66p yesterday. RHM shares had been firm in recent weeks as bid speculation mounted, rising from 140p on September 4. Hanson shares fell 5 1/2 p to 202p. In 1988 RHM survived a takeover bid at 465p and later rebuffed an approach from a consortium led by Sir James Goldsmith, the financier. In January last year Sir James sold a 28.5 per cent stake in RHM at 300p. The group's profits have declined from a peak of Pounds 176.5m pre-tax in 1989 to Pounds 150.2m last year. Forecasts are for a further fall to under Pounds 100m in the financial year which ended in August. Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman of Hanson, said that the group had been watching RHM for a long time, and in the last month had decided to explore it further and bid. He said there was no particular trigger for the offer. He denied that the move represented a reversion to 'old-style' Hanson tactics, adding that the group's aim had always been to enhance value for its own shareholders. Hanson has net debt of about Pounds 1bn, but has substantial sterling cash balances. RHM has net cash in its balance sheet. Hanson is advised by N M Rothschild &amp; Sons, RHM by Morgan Grenfell.

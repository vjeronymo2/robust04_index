			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Letter: ECJ judgment unambiguous Sir, It might be vulgar, as Mr Ivens suggests (Letter, February 8), to play the game of 'our QC is more leading than yours', but everyone's European Court of Justice has unambiguously stated in two leading cases  - Bartol and Watson Rusk -  that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations 1981 and the EC Acquired Rights Directive do apply to compulsory competitive tendering. And if the amendment in the Employment Bill is irrelevant, why did the British Association of Landscape Industries say: 'The implications of having to take staff on at the same pay and conditions are horrendous. It changes the whole concept of CCT.'? Roger M Poole, assistant general secretary (negotiations), National Union of Public Employees, 20 Grand Depot Road, London SE18 6SF</p>

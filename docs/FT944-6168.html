			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): PEP investments range expected to be widened - Personal Equity Plans The chancellor proposes in his Budget to extend the range of eligible investments for general Personal Equity Plans to include certain corporate bonds, convertibles and preference shares. The chancellor's intention is to widen the range of investments which people can put in a PEP, and to help encourage the development of new sources of finance for companies. It is expected that this measure will take effect on - or as soon as possible after - April 6 1995, subject to consultation on the necessary changes to the regulations. Under current rules, direct investment in PEPs is restricted to quoted UK ordinary shares or similar shares in European Union companies. Individuals may also invest in unit and investment trusts in a general PEP, provided the trusts satisfy a number of conditions governing their investments. The chancellor proposes to extend general PEPs to a range of UK corporate bonds and convertibles and UK and EU preference shares. The Budget proposals will mean that individuals will be able to invest up to the full general PEP limit of Pounds 6,000 directly in: 1. UK ordinary shares or similar shares in European Union companies. 2. Specified corporate bonds and convertibles of UK non-financial companies. 3. Preference shares in UK and EU companies. Investments must be in quoted companies. In addition, unit and investment trusts which hold at least half their assets in the instruments listed in 1 and 3 above will be eligible for the full Pounds 6,000 general PEP limit. The trusts' investments may be in quoted or unquoted companies. In order to qualify for inclusion under the new rules, corporate bonds will need to have a minimum term of at least five years to maturity and be issued at a fixed rate of interest. The Inland Revenue will be consulting on the regulations needed to implement the new provisions, including, in particular, other detailed rules for corporate bonds and 'non-qualifying' trusts. Subject to the consultation process, it is intended that these measures will take effect from April 6 1995. Regulations will also be made to allow newly constituted open-ended investment companies to qualify for PEPs on the same terms as authorised units trusts and to extend the range of persons able to market PEPs in the UK to include certain European institutions. In the tax year 1993-94 1.38m new general plans and 190,000 new single company plans were taken out, with Pounds 5.72bn and Pounds 490m invested respectively. These figures are the highest for a single tax year since PEPs began in 1987.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Changes from                               previous plans/projections                               ------------------------------------------                               1994-95    1995-96    1996-97  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Control Total by department Social security*                  1.5          0          0 Health                              0          0          0 DOE - Local government              0       -0.5       -1.5 DOE - Other                      -0.1       -0.6       -0.6 Scotland, Wales and N.

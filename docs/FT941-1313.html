			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: W Hampshire Water rises to Pounds 1.58m West Hampshire Water, owned by Biwater, the water engineering group, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.58m for the year to end-December, against Pounds 1.29m. The outcome was struck on turnover up from Pounds 8.83m to Pounds 9.57m and the advance was achieved, the company said, in spite of the absorption of increased compliance costs. The net interest charge for the year fell from Pounds 780,000 to Pounds 580,000. Tax took Pounds 129,000 (Pounds 79,000) and earnings per share came out at 182p (152p) fully diluted. A final dividend of 60p is proposed, making 76p (36p) for the year. The company said it intended to put a resolution to the AGM for a 1-for-1 scrip issue and would apply to the Stock Exchange to delist the share and loan capital.</p>

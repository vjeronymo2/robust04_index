			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Challenge of focusing R&amp;D spending Sir, Your editorial, 'Costly Research' (June 20), indulges in generalisations that merit scrutiny, lest your conclusion, that R&amp;D spend is unimportant, is accepted too readily. R&amp;D-intensive companies, such as those in the pharmaceutical sector, will agree with your final point that the way in which R&amp;D spend is allocated is of the greatest importance. That is why, in the context of national com-petitiveness, SmithKline Beecham is supporting the current Technology Foresight exercise sponsored by the Office of Science and Technology. The value of R&amp;D spending can only be maximised when we can use the strengths of the national science base (industry and academia) to blend technological feasibility with market appropriateness. The Foresight exercise represents the most comprehensive effort in three decades to inventory strengths and weaknesses of the UK science base, to seek consensus on priorities for science and technology investment in the academic and industrial sectors, and to optimise linkages for technology transfer between them. Quantification of the return on R&amp;D investment is a challenge for private and public sectors. It would be useful to see progress on indices of in-vestment versus return to avoid unjustified assertions about the value of R&amp;D. It is encouraging to learn of Department of Trade and Industry efforts to construct an innovation index to measure both outcomes and expenditure. I acknowledge that the competitiveness of some segments of UK industry may have declined to such an extent that further investment, not just in R&amp;D but also via other forms of government support, may be unwarranted. The challenge of focusing R&amp;D spend appropriately is as important in improving commercial profitability as it is for pursuit of national goals such as wealth and health creation. I am encouraged that the UK government is beginning to appreciate the significance of these issues, not just in the science and technology office, but more generally, as witnessed by the recent competitiveness white paper. These government initiatives to support innovation and sustain excellence in the science base should be encouraged.

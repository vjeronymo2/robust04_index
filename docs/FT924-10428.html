			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Ingham may be asked to advise Brussels SIR Bernard Ingham - former Downing Street spokesman, devoted Thatcherite and virulent Euro-sceptic - may be asked to advise the European Commission on how to bridge the information gap between Brussels and the people of Europe. Bad-mouthed by Europe's politicians and misunderstood by its citizens, Brussels yesterday confirmed that it had a list of 'well-known European communicators' to whom it might turn for advice. It was a sensible idea, Mr Bruno Dethomas, the Commission's chief spokesman, said, with the air of a man announcing that King Herod had been appointed to advise the Mothers' Union on childcare. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, believes that member states, not the Commission, should bear the burden of remedying the EC's deficit d'information. An external working group would assess whether the Commission's hands-off policy could be improved. Mr Dethomas said the Commission had not yet issued formal invitations to join the working group, but judging from the short-list of candidates there could be some interesting confrontations. For example, Sir Bernard, who writes a plain-speaking column for the rightwing Daily Express, would be sure to take issue with Mr Jacques Seguela, the left-leaning maverick French advertising executive, and adviser to Mr Francois Mitterrand on presidential election campaigns and the Oui campaign before the Maastricht referendum. A prominent Spanish newspaper editor - possibly Mr Joaquin Estefania of the daily El Pais - may also be asked to join the group. Sir Bernard was on holiday yesterday. However, when asked by the Financial Times a fortnight ago what he thought of Commission information policy, Sir Bernard was as blunt as ever. 'Do they have one?' he boomed.

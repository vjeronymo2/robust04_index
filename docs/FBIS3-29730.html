NODONG SINMUN today says this, commenting on the persistent  struggle of South Korean people against rice market opening.    Holding that if the Kim Yong-sam group has a shred of  national conscience, it must promptly cancel the rice market  opening as demanded by the South Korean people, the analyst says:    The Kim Yong-sam group, however, schemes to legally finalize  the opening of the rice market, twaddling about "the final plan  for the implementation of the agreement" and "follow-up  measures."    Worse still, it brands the demand of the people for  renegotiation concerning the rice market opening as a call for  "isolation" of South Korea and their struggle as "violence,"  answering it with fascist suppression.    The Kim Yong-sam group keeps all the repressive forces in  full readiness for action to crack down on the people's struggle  any moment. Its criminal intention is to suppress the people's  resistance at the point of the fascist bayonet and hurriedly  take follow-up measures by all means for the liberalization of  rice import.    The South Korean people, incensed against the Kim Yong-sam  traitorous clique, are now resolved to turn out in a mass  struggle to foil its policy of rice market opening and overthrow  the self-styled "civilian government."    It will not be long before the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique  meets its disgraceful doom.</p>

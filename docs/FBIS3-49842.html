			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bogdan Eduard: "Gheorghe Funar Will Change the </F> Inscription on the Statue of the King of Hungary"]    [Text] Gheorghe Funar, mayor of the city of Cluj, chairman  of PUNR [National Romanian Unity Party], has prepared a series  of actions for this year intended to "please" the Hungarian  ethnic minority. Thus, the mayor has decided to finalize work  on the equestrian statue of King Matthias Corvinus in the center  of the city by replacing the [Latin] inscription [on the  pedestal] Mathias Rex with a new [Romanian] one, Matei Corvinul.    According to reliable sources, Funar regards the old  inscription as a compromise solution arrived at by the  communists and Horthysts [Hungarian fascists during World War  II], and, therefore, it has to be eliminated right away so that  it will not overshadow the great festivities to celebrate the  anniversary of the 1859 Union [of Wallachia with Moldavia] that  are to take place in Cluj on 24 January.    It should be noted that, on 6 December 1992, the measure  [taken by Funar] to modify the equestrian statue of King  Matthias [by adding a plaque belittling the personality of the  king and hoisting the national colors all around the statute]  triggered off unprecedented protests on behalf of the ethnic  Hungarians living in the city.</p>

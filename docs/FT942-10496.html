			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Further reform of common agricultural policy 'inevitable' Further reform of the European Union's common agricultural policy is inevitable in the next few years, although it is unlikely to be radical, according to the chief economic adviser to Lloyds Bank, one of Britain's big four high street banks. Writing in the May issue of Lloyds Bank Economic Bulletin, Mr Patrick Foley argues that the farming lobby will grow weaker as more agricultural jobs disappeared. This will encourage politicians to take action beyond the 1992 MacSharry reforms. At the same time, increasing cereal yields are likely to mean that subsidised exports from the European Union remain too high to meet the requirements of the Uruguay Round world trade deal, necessitating further internal CAP reform. He says public pressure for change will also grow because the current reforms have increased the transparency of subsidies to farmers. CAP support in one form or another accounts for half the gross income of a typical 100-hectare cereal farm. Mr Foley points out that the 1992 reforms encourage production to remain high - the opposite of what was intended. 'Because compensation is per hectare, there is an incentive for farmers to keep the maximum possible amount of land in production, subject to set-aside.' Land prices are also likely to remain buoyant for the next few years, because of the set-aside programme and financial incentives for less intensive livestock production. 'It is possible that the 15 per cent set-aside could increase land prices in the short term, as some farmers may choose to buy more land to enable them to maintain past levels of production,' he says. 'Equally, beef farmers wishing to change to a more extensive type of farming would need to buy more land.' Evaluating the routes that further reform could take, Mr Foley says a bond compensation scheme may be politically unacceptable, even if economically justified, because of the likely large-scale job losses and sharp fall in land prices that it would entail. He suggests there will be a mixture of more price support cuts and more set-aside, together with greater limits on inputs such as fertilisers.</p>

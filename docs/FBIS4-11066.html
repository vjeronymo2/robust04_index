			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Economy Minister Ignacio de Posadas by </F> correspondent Oscar Vilas in Guadalajara, Mexico; date not given]    [Text] [Vilas] What are the government projections for this  year's trade balance?    [De Posadas] Last year we forecast a decline in our trade  balance deficit. We assumed imports would level off because our  country cannot continue this rampant buying spree abroad.  Capital goods and durable goods are not imported forever. We  calculated that the trade balance deficit would level off  through a reduction of imports. We are now seeing an increase in  exports, especially to the Brazilian market. We are seeing price  increases in some products like rice, wool, and meat. Rice  prices have increased substantially, wool prices have increased  slightly, and there is a good market for meat. Exports to Brazil  increased about 30 percent last year and it is believed that the  current stabilization program will cause price adjustments in  Brazil and increased trade.    [Vilas] The latest published government management results  show an exponential increase in government spending, which has  gone up by 25 percent. How does the government view this?    [De Posadas] Last year's investments have been carried over  to this year. Current expenditures have not increased;  investments account for most of government's expenditures and we  have already set a ceiling on them. Moreover, tax collections  exceeded original estimates by nearly $11 million.    [Vilas] How can the government fix investment levels?    [De Posadas] We are working on a decree to fix government  investments. We have again spoken with executive board members  from public enterprises urging them to adjust their investments  to what has been budgeted. The total amount that the central  government and public companies will save totals some $150  million. And yet, this year's investment levels will be higher  than last year's, which in turn exceeded benchmark levels. We  have to undertake this to ease the pressure off accrued  expenditures, which have a bearing on the entire economy.    [Vilas] The United States has increased its interest rates  to  stave off inflation. Argentina has followed suit to prevent the  loss of international reserves. Is Uruguay contemplating  increasing interest rates to help its fight against inflation?    [De Posadas] It is unfeasible to set interest rates in a  country the size of Uruguay. Besides, we have a very open market  with a considerable inflow of capital to date. What do we stand  to gain by increasing interest rates? Nothing. What is the use  of increasing interest rates for transactions in pesos? It will  only make investors turn to the peso in droves. They will sell  dollars; thus exerting more pressure on the exchange rate and  triggering an increase in reserves. It is not worth it.    [Vilas] Is there a project to place Uruguayan debt bonds on  other markets, like Japan for example?    [De Posadas] We are studying that possibility. We must  follow  a similar line of reasoning as before. Given Japanese interest  rates, we must assess if it is really worthwhile. We pay very  low interest rates. The degree of acceptance or trust in  Uruguayan securities is very high. It would be attractive,  though, to gain a foothold in another market.    [Vilas] Industry Minister Eduardo Ache proposed a  debt-for-investment swap in order to attract capital. How does  the Economy Ministry view this initiative?    [De Posadas] He had that idea. I have not seen any concrete  project on it. The subject should be carefully considered  because it has a very high cost for our country and we must  analyze if it is cost-effective.</p>

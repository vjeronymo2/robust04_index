			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Appeal could hinge on tribunal report: Defence lawyers say evidence would have made material difference One of the main elements of the Guinness Court of Appeal applications is a little-known December 1988 tribunal report into TWH Management, a licensed share-dealing company. The tribunal, chaired by former circuit judge Lord Grantchester, was held to consider an appeal against a Department of Trade and Industry ruling that the company be stripped of its licence. The tribunal sat in private to consider a series of share transactions carried out by TWH involving indemnities against possible losses given to the purchaser of the shares. It examined seven cases of indemnified share support operations being used at about the same time as Guinness's Pounds 2.6bn takeover for Distillers in January 1986. One of these was TWH's own involvement in the share support scheme used in the Guinness takeover. The tribunal judgment was known to the Serious Fraud Office at the time of the first Guinness trial in 1990, but the SFO failed to make it available to the defendants. Lawyers of the four men who were convicted at that trial, including stockbroker Mr Anthony Parnes and entrepreneur Mr Gerald Ronson, believe that had the tribunal report been made available to them, it would have made a material difference to the conduct of their defence. The tribunal report came to light during the second Guinness trial, which collapsed in 1992, involving Mr Roger Seelig, former director of Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, and Lord Spens, former director of Henry Ansbacher. That trial was abandoned due to the ill-health suffered by Mr Seelig, but Lord Spens, who was subsequently acquitted, believes disclosure of the tribunal report would itself have led to the case being dismissed. 'There is nothing wrong with indemnities,' Lord Spens said. 'But the existence of the report had been well and truly hidden.' In a letter to the Financial Times in June, Lord Spens said: 'The evidence and judgment of this tribunal were kept secret by the government for some three years (for reasons that will become abundantly clear) and not revealed to the defence in the second Guinness trial until forced out of the prosecution on the evening of the 54th day.' Lord Spens wrote: 'I am satisfied that, had this evidence been made available to the first Guinness trial, it too would have collapsed and none of those defendants would have been convicted.' The TWH tribunal considered six other cases involving indemnities given to the purchaser of shares: October 1985 - an indemnity to cover purchases of United Newspapers shares to assist that company in its takeover bid for Fleet Holdings. February 1986 - an indemnity to cover BPCC share purchases. April 1986 - indemnities to cover purchases of Extel shares to assist in the takeover of CFE Publications. June 1986 - indemnities to cover purchase of Next shares during its bid for Grattan. September 1986 - indemnities to cover purchases of Lowe Howard Spink Bell shares to assist in its takeover bid for Good Relations. September 1986 - indemnities to cover purchases of Allied Plant shares to assist in its takeover bid for George Dew. Directors of TWH claimed in interviews with the SFO that they believed such practices were proper and common. In the report, Lord Grantchester said: 'There is nothing intrinsically improper in the purchase and sale of shares in the market under an indemnity arrangement entered into between the dealer and a third party. In principle there is little or no difference between such a transaction and a purchase in the name of a nominee.' The tribunal recommended to the trade and industry secretary that TWH's licence should not be revoked.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Beijing's  manufacturing industries will step up cooperation with  multi-national companies over the next seven years, a municipal  government official said today.    Addressing a news conference today, Gao Zuozhi, director of  the Municipal Economic Commission, invited multi-national  companies to invest in such priority industries as automobiles,  electronics, meters, new chemicals, new building materials,  pharmaceuticals, clothing, food processing, computers,  program-controlled switchboards, and integrated circuits.    Specifically, he said, Beijing seeks cooperation with  multi-national companies and other overseas firms in  manufacturing goods with a low consumption of energy, raw  materials or water, but with a high added value.    Beijing also wishes to cooperate with overseas investors in  moving factories in downtown areas to suburbs and undertaking  real estate development projects and building service-oriented  companies there, he added.    Gao also revealed that Beijing has set up a number of major  joint ventures with multi-national companies, including the NEC  Company of Japan, the Chrysler Company of the United States, the  Philips Corporation of the Netherlands and ABB Company of  Switzerland.    By the end of 1993 manufacturers in Beijing had established  40 major joint ventures with overseas firms, each involving at  least 10 million U.S. dollars in foreign investment, he said.    These ventures involve 2.08 billion U.S. dollars in total  foreign investment, he added.</p>

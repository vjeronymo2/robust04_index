			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Masao Yokomizo, deputy director, Nikko Research </F> Center: "Japanese Productivity: Correct Distortion Among  Industries"]    [Text] 1) There is a view that the productivity of  the Japanese manufacturing industry is considerably lower than  the United States, but if calculated using purchasing power  parity [PPP] by industrial sector, Japanese productivity is  superior.    2) In the recent economic recession, however, Japanese  productivity superiority has temporarily disappeared because the  mining and manufacturing industries production has fallen on a  large scale. Furthermore, with the rapid rise in the yen, wages  in dollars considerably exceed the United States, and the  environment surrounding the manufacturing industry has become  grim.    3) The relative price structure among the Japanese  export, industrial , and consumption goods and service sectors  has a unique distortion viewed internationally. In order to  solve these problems, it is necessary to correct the high yen  and seriously undertake relaxation of regulations.  <H5>  Conversion of Purchasing Power Parity by Sector Necessary </H5>   In the 11 January issue of this newspaper, there was an  article entitled: Come Back Manufacturing Industry; Common  Sense Lies Seen in Data and Common Sense 3 Equals  High Productivity and Efficiency. Although the productivity  of the Japanese manufacturing industry is high in commonsense  terms, it was no more than 77 percent that of the United States  in 1990 according to an analysis by the Japan Productivity  Center. Basically, however, it is correct to view that Japan is  higher than the United States as "common sense" dictates.    The Productivity Center converts the value added of the  manufacturing industry by the purchasing power parity (PPP) of  the whole nation to calculate productivity. In the international  comparison of physical productivity, calculating by PPP is  certainly closer to the real situation than conversion by the  exchange rate.    However, this differs according to industrial sector. The  purchasing power parity of the manufacturing industry, which is  a ratio of the respective nation's total amount of money in the  identical U.S. and Japanese manufacturing industry product  baskets, should be markedly higher than the agricultural product  basket. Making an international comparison of productivity by  industry ignoring the differences in purchasing power parity  among such sectors becomes a misleading basis.    However, it is difficult to measure directly the purchasing  power parity of the manufacturing industry. Therefore, if the  purchasing power parity of the manufacturing industry for 1991  is calculated using the U.S. and Japanese industrial product  wholesale prices with the second quarter of 1973 as the starting  point for approximation, $1 is equal to 154.5 yen. On the other  hand, the purchasing power parity of the GDP (gross domestic  product) on an OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development) basis was $1 equals 193 yen in 1991.    The most recent point in time when the U.S. and Japanese GDP  were known by industry was 1991. The GDP per employed person in  the manufacturing industry in that year was 8.434 million yen  for Japan and $50,220 for the United States. If this is  converted by GDP purchasing power parity, Japan is 87 percent of  the United States. It certainly is low, but if it were the  manufacturing industry, Japan is higher than the United States  at 109 percent. This is closer to the real situation.    It seems that Japan is slightly higher even adding labor  time  (the labor time of manufacturing industry production workers is  a little over 7 percent lower for the United States). The  figures of the Productivity Center are widely used by Nikkeiren  (Japan Federation of Employers' Associations) and others, but it  is probably necessary to be cautious on that problem point.  <H5>  Cost Increases With High Yen and Manufacturing Industry </H5> Hollowing Out    According to national income statistics, however, employee  income per person in the manufacturing industry in 1991 was  4.635 million yen for Japan and $37,049 for the United States.  The exchange rate for 1991 was $1 equals 134.54 yen. It should  be converted by this from the viewpoint of international  competition, and the Japanese wage level is 93 percent that of  the United States. That means Japan enjoyed high productivity,  low wages, and rather comfortable management.    However, the situation changed completely with the high yen  later. Supposing no change in wages, using the 1993 exchange  rate, 111.18 yen, Japanese wages were 113 percent compared to  the United States. It is higher than the 9-percent difference in  productivity of 1991.    Moreover, Japanese productivity dropped for a short period  due to the later recession (the United States was booming and  productivity rising). Mining and manufacturing industries  production dropped 10.3 percent from 1991 to 1993, manufacturing  industry employees also decreased 1.3 percent, but productivity  dropped about 9 percent.    Premised on the above calculations, Japanese wage costs  exceed the United States by over 10 percent, and international  competition must be viewed as rather severe.    Temporary factors due to business cycles should be taken  into  consideration here, but basically the high yen is the main  cause. The exchange rate in December 1993 was $1 equals 109.7  yen, but the purchasing power parity of industrial product  wholesale prices was $1 equals 146.92 yen. The difference of  both is about 37 yen and has greatly expanded from 20 yen in  1991. The yen rate has become much removed from the basic  conditions of the Japanese manufacturing industry.    No matter how much effort is put into rationalization and  improving productivity, the Japanese manufacturing industry is  not able to catch up with the high wage costs due to the soaring  yen; as a result, it will soon be forced to hollow out.    Hollowing out is a pullback from exports, overseas  procurement of raw materials and products, and reduction and  abandonment of domestic production due to an import offensive.  Even if there is such an impact, big businesses can partially  deal with it and will probably continue to exist, but the  existence of medium, small, and petty businesses will be  threatened under the large-scale decrease in demand and demands  to cut unit prices exceeding ceilings.    The Japanese manufacturing industry has been formed by many  layers of medium, small, and petty businesses through the long  period of accumulation of proficiency with adaptation to  circumstances supporting the production of growth products that  change from time to time. There is the fear that once these  businesses disappear due to cessation of business, reappearance  will be close to impossible and Japan's basis for creativity  will be destroyed.    If there are such structural problems besides the serious  deflation effect brought by the high yen, correction of the high  yen is an important issue involving national interest. $1  equaling 115 to 120 yen probably will be appropriate. If "the  volume of trade on the foreign exchange market in recent years  is 60 times the flow trade (1993 Economic White Paper), it must  be that the high yen effect from the trade surplus is limited  and speculation along with monetary conditions at home and  abroad is strongly influencing the yen rate.    It can be seen from the fact that just one word uttered by  U.S. President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Bentsen has  greatly changed the flow of yen trade. In order to correct the  high yen, in addition to effective economic measures and  complete opening of markets, we should prepare for effective  measures to counteract verbal intervention from key members of  the U.S. Government.  <H5>  Productivity Imbalance Raises Price Level </H5>   The above are considerations about the manufacturing  industry, but let's turn our eyes to industry as a whole.    The GDP per employed person in the 1991 private industry  total was 6.768 million yen for Japan and $42,718 for the United  States. If this is converted by $1 to 193 yen, which is the GDP  purchasing power parity, Japan is 82 percent of the United  States. In other words, the productivity of the manufacturing  industry was higher than the United States, but the productivity  of the whole nation is 20 percent lower. One can see how low the  productivity of nonmanufacturing industries is.    For the manufacturing industry, including the trade goods  sector which is exposed to international competition, price is a  given condition, so to speak, and if wages, which are determined  by the domestic labor market, also are a given condition, there  is no other way than to raise productivity. However, since  international competition is less in the nonmanufacturing  industry and there is a lot of industry protection and entry  regulation, competitive conditions are not severe. For that  reason, price can be decided in terms of a non-given condition  to a certain extent, and consequently, income has become high  and productivity has become low. This is one of the major  factors in the so-called domestic-foreign price difference (in  addition, high land prices are a big aspect).    Although wages are decided by a nationwide labor market,  such  conditions by industry are reflected to a certain extent and  wages in the nonmanufacturing industry have become high.  Consequently, employee income per person for 1991 in the private  industry total where the nonmanufacturing industry has a high  weight was 14 percent higher with Japan at 4.357 million yen and  the United States at 3.820 million yen calculated at the  exchange rate.    Although the productivity of the nation overall is low, the  price level is considerably higher than the United States  because wages are high. If these wages are converted at the 1993  exchange rate, Japan will actually be 38 percent higher than the  United States.    So far, as the yen went higher, the manufactyuring industry  adapted to the new yen level by efforts at rationalization, high  value-added, and improved productivity. Low price stability has  continued for the output price of the manufacturing industry  viewed on a yen basis.    On the other hand, the nonmanufacturing industry has easy  competitive conditions, improved productivity is behind, and the  output price has continued to rise. The spotty price between  these sectors is conspicuous viewed internationally and makes  the structural problems of Japanese industry stand out.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Comparison Between Japan and Germany in Various Kinds of Purchasing Power Pa-|  |rity and Exchange Market (November 1993)                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Yen/Dollar               |Mark/Dollar              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Exchange market (monthly |107.83                   |1.7003                   |  |average)                 |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Purchasing power parity  |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Export price basis       |92.27                    |1.7497                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Industry product wholesa-|146.11                   |1.7109                   |  |le price basis           |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Consumer price basis     |199.69                   |1.6678                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Note: Purchasing power parity = exchange rate at base point of time x Japan (|  |Germany) price index/U.S. price index.

In Japan, however, the export basket is slightly over 92  yen,  and the industrial product basket is on the 146 yen level. In  the consumer spending basket, it is an extremely wide margin at  $1 to about 200 yen. The real exchange rate is on the 103 yen  level and close to the export basket.    The German exchange rate is close to the balanced economic  fundamentals, but the Japanese structure is very distorted in  the form of higher prices the further the sector is from trade  and viewed from the economy overall, the exchange rate can be  called abnormal and high.    The nonmanufacturing industry, in a sense, can be called a  support sector for the manufacturing industry and the fact that  there has become such high cost there probably involves the  existence of the manufacturing industry. Drastic structural  reform such as full-scale relaxation or abolition of regulations  is desired.    In the same table, the purchasing power parity on an export  price basis of slightly over 92 yen is impressive, but comparing  the U.S. and Japan export product composition, a characteristic  is that the United States has many agricultural products and raw  materials for industry, and Japan has many capital goods and  autos; and it cannot be compared in the same export basket. The  fact that the contents are not the same can also be said of  other baskets, but since the discrepancy is believed to be  rather large for exports, no precise meaning is seen in the  level of 92 yen.</p>

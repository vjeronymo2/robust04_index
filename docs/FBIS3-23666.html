			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference held by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk </F> and Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy at Yavor Military  Training Ground, Carpathian Military District, Lvov Oblast on 23  March -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Kravchuk] I will not make an introductory  speech. I know, as do you, that every article or every literary  work has three components: Real life, man's ability to embrace  it spiritually, and a little bit of imagination. These three  components constitute some material -- a book, an article or a  report.    I would like us to center our talk today around the issue  which has been taking place in front of us and also around those  issues which are of interest to you. You are welcome.    [Unidentified conference mediator] Ukrainian television. You  are welcome.    [Ukrainian television correspondent] Mr. Supreme Commander,  President of Ukraine, esteemed Leonid Makarovych. We proceed  from the principle of reasonable sufficiency in building the  Armed Forces of the independent Ukrainian state. Today we saw  quite serious exercises. Could you assess these exercises from  the point of view of today and from the point of view of  building our state in future? Thank you.    [Kravchuk] Of course, the building, creation, the  restructuring of the armed forces of Ukraine.... [pauses] We  have completed the stage of restructuring the armed forces and  now we have to adapt them to realities which exist, to our  internal and external problems. And the main task of the Armed  Forces is to defend the state, to ensure peaceful work of the  people. This is a priority. And, of course, we have satisfied  ourselves that we have gone through those stages, we have gone  through them peacefully, without conflicts and today we have  armed forces which are capable, I emphasize this, of ensuring  the tasks they are facing.    This does not mean in the least that we have no problems.  There are problems of logistical support, military training,  the future of our armed forces, equipping them, their prospects  for the future, and so on. But there is only one conclusion:  The Armed Forces do exist and today the officers, generals, and  soldiers demonstrated their ability to fulfill the most  complicated tasks. And I am satisfied with the fact that  everything was taking place synchronously, according to plan;  there have been no emergencies, as they say, and we are  satisfied that these exercises have taken place. They were  necessary. Strictly speaking, these were the first exercises  since our Ukrainian Armed Forces have been in existence. And  people must undergo training so as to be able to defend their  state and their people.    [Mediator] (?Halychyna Film), please.    [(?Halychyna Film) correspondent] Esteemed Mr. President,  esteemed Commander-in-Chief, this is the question of interest to  us: What was the army you dreamt about and how are these plans  being put into practice?    [Kravchuk] First and foremost, we have been dreaming about  the army which any nation and any state can dream of if it set a  goal and this goal is concentrated not only in the people's  wish, which is quite understandable, but in the conceptual  principles of our enactments. We have a military doctrine, a  concept, we have enactments on the organization and formation of  the Armed Forces, and those Armed Forces which we have today  comply with the principles which were approved by the Supreme  Council and by the president's decree and which meet our  possibilities. We must have armed forces for peaceful work.  Neither in our doctrine nor in our concept are we setting or  have been setting any tasks whatsoever as far as, for example,  any aggressive aspirations or other such tasks before our Armed  Forces. The only tasks are to defend people's peaceful work,  build an independent state and ensure the fulfillment of these  most important priority tasks.    [Mediator] UKRINFORM's Demydenko, please.    [UKRINFORM correspondent Demydenko] Esteemed Leonid  Makarovych, by now the people of Ukraine have grown accustomed  to seeing you in your capacity as the president and to the  actions you take as those of the president. Today, you acted as  commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. How did it  feel? What were you thinking about?    [Kravchuk] (?Since) I only took part in the exercise, I  believe it was primarily the commander who had the greatest  degree of responsibility. It was the commander of the  Subcarpathian military district, Colonel-General (Bobkov), and  our defense minister, Army General Radetskyy, and all those in  the military who supported, planned, drew maps, and marched  every inch of that ground in order for everything to take place  as planned. This was their supreme responsibility.    When I came here, my aim was to see what we had done in  these  years to build our own Armed Forces. I can say without  exaggeration that a lot has been done and not only with regard  to form but also content. Today you heard and saw before your  very eyes how this action took place. You heard the Ukrainian  state language. You saw the Ukrainian insignia. You finally  saw the substance and spiritual structure of our soldiers,  officers, generals, and commanders of all ranks. This is what  is most important. A new state is in the making and its own  Armed Forces are following a parallel course with its  difficulties and complexities. Hoping, however, that maybe the  time will come when this... [pauses] or it was easy for someone,  is unrealistic. [sentence as heard]    [Mediator] Please.    [KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI correspondent Yuriy Kvit] Leonid  Makarovych, please forgive me (?in advance) if the nature of my  question is not quite appropriate in the current atmosphere. I  believe, however, the people of Ukraine will ask and be  concerned about these questions. Do you know that this event of  ours cost (?the Defense Ministry) a great deal. Preliminary  estimates show it was somewhere in the region of over 40 billion  karbovantsi. Do you know that the period (?of preparation),  that as far as I know was protracted, when the training ground,  understandably, was being made quite ready for this event, cost  very much too. Barracks repair and other work was done. In  short, forgive me, an awful lot was spent (?in our time of  poverty). At the same time, the military district's catering  service alone owes around 200 billion karbovantsi for food  (?allocated to) the district, and many of the district's  servicemen have not been paid for March yet. So do you think  this great expenditure was worth what we hoped for and what we  saw today? Is there a ratio, a balance in it?    [Kravchuk] Well, all of you may know this saying and know to  whom it belongs: He who does not want to feed his own army, will  feed someone else's tomorrow. I would like to say this: If  there are armed forces which cost a state a great deal of money  indeed -- be it even not the amounts that you cited; and  although I do not know these figures they can gernerally be  specified with regard to the whole of Ukraine's Armed Forces --  if these armed forces do not train, they are useless altogether.  Following your logic, then, we would have to disarm altogether  and, generally, include a some armed forces in, shall we say,  the formations that would not even cost 40 billion karbovantsi  but a little bit less and generally delete the protection of the  state from our agenda altogether, simply delete it.    The thing is, I know that with regard to this -- and not  only  with regard to this -- no sooner is something more or less  large-scale begun, than someone starts to talk about how much it  costs and whether it would not be better in our difficult  situation, let us say, to pay wages with these funds. It is  logical.    But today you pay wages to the people of an independent  state  and without the Armed Forces, tomorrow other states will come  and have these people, currently working for an independent  state, work for another state. No one will then calculate this  expenditure. It will then be a quite different situation.    I am not saying that people's life today is good. Nor am I  saying they are able to maintain a large army. But should the  question be raised of today's difficulties and should nothing be  done and should everything be reduced to only the minimum, shall  we say, for the people somehow just to survive and, shall we  say, have more on the table today -- to put it conventionally,  150 grams of meat rather than 100 grams -- there may not even be  this tomorrow.    In other words, I would not like to reduce everything in  this  case to a specific exercise. There is strategy and there are  tactics. If we have our Armed Forces and have our army, they  either have to train and be ready to protect us or they should  not be there at all. If you proceed from this, you will think  quite differently. It is exactly the way I think, because the  Armed Forces cost us trillions rather than billions. So why  should we spend those trillions if we know that those armed  forces will be unable to protect the state. And if they are to  protect us, they have to know how to do this.    [Mediator] Oksana Telentsiy, HOLOS UKRAYINY.    [HOLOS UKRAYINY correspondent Telentsiy] Esteemed Mr.  President, I happened to hear today that the excellent machinery  that we can see [words indistinct]. (?What is) the future of our  military industrial complex in Ukraine under conditions of the  acute economic crisis? Thank you.    [Kravchuk] The machinery that was moving in this beautiful  area of our land in most cases is manufactured here in Ukraine,  in most cases. They are tanks, self-propelled and other systems.  Of course, they are assembled from parts that we either buy or  receive from other states of the former Soviet Union. We can,  however, make them ourselves. We have marvellous opportunities  to build cargo aviation. True, we have difficulties, shall we  say, with manufacturing high- speed aviation, fighter and other  aircraft. But to say that this is the remainder of [USSR] luxury  is maybe too early. We have an appropriate program for the  military industrial complex to develop. The development of  weaponry of our own has good prospects. We have appropriate  scientific laboratories, institutes, forces, and key personnel  who are at work and quite seriously at work too. But a  predicament is a predicament. I absolutely agree with you that  we today cannot ensure this is the way we would like it to be  done; true, we cannot do it.    [Mediator] REUTER, please.    [REUTER correspondent] Mr. President, (?you will agree that)  until recently, the parliament of Ukraine could not determine  its position on the START I Treaty. (?As interpreted) in  particular by Russia, Ukraine was blocking the Russo-American  START II treaty. How do you see the situation now? Is Ukraine  still (?obstructing it) or not? And the second question is  this: Do you forecast any problems of the kind you had with  parliament with regard to nuclear weapons for Boris Yeltsin with  his parliament [words indistinct] the START II Treaty which  [words indistinct] provides for a large reduction in nuclear  weapons? Thank you.    [Kravchuk] Well, START II in this case has no direct  bearing on Ukraine. Having signed the trilateral agreement in  Moscow and accords following it, we -- our parliament -- have  determined our attitude towards Ukraine's position expressly and  clearly. The latter now is a problem that goes beyond our  state's boundaries. As a state, however, that had nuclear  weapons, on whose territory there were nuclear weapons, who set  itself the task of their elimination and which determined its  position on this expressly and clearly, of course Ukraine will  accordingly stimulate other states' actions and policies so that  the world's nuclear weapons are destroyed altogether. This is  our position which we shall uphold. As a member of the United  Nations Organization and a member state of appropriate European  structures; we shall do everything to achieve this end and shall  not obstruct it because this is our position of principle.    [Mediator] MOLOD UKRAYINY, please.    [MOLOD UKRAYINY correspondent (?Volodymyr) Brazan] [Words  indistinct] the Ukrainian (?army's high morale). But are you, Mr  President, not (?concerned) about another question? When  settling the Crimean issue, for example, and you having to use  force, will our state be able to rely on the Russian-speaking  Ukrainian Army?    [Kravchuk] To begin with, I do not know what  Russian-speaking  means. We have Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Hungarian, and other  people populating Ukraine. It is multinational. What language a  person communicates in does not determine, shall we say, their  spiritual essence and their position.    That is why, this thesis of the Russian-speaking population  should be withdrawn as groundless philosophically, historically,  or otherwise. It was invented by someone and it seems to me it  was invented by politicians in Russia in order to protect, as it  were, the so-called Russian-speaking population. What this is,  I do not know. There is no such notion. There is nationality  rather than language.    So, firstly, I do not want to make a division thus.  Secondly,  I believe and hope that we shall not have to use our armed  forces in Crimea. At any rate, we shall never take the  initiative. We hope we shall settle this issue peacefully; shall  settle it by way of negotiations, including with those states --  or primarily Russia -- which have certain interests there.    I do not want any thoughts to remain incomplete. One thing  is clear to me: that Russian mentality, the Russian elite,  both political -- and not only political but the literary and  spiritual as well -- will never put up with the fact that Crimea  does not belong to Russia; never. And the policy will be shaped  correspondingly. However, to put up with this, that is to say,  to bear this in one's heart and to have the forms of action are  quite different things. I believe that there will be enough  common sense, in any case, that high-ranking politicians will  have enough common sense, and it is they who determine policy  today, but not those political forces and trends which exist  today here and there and everywhere.    This is the first thing. Secondly. I understand, for  example, the policy immediately related to Crimea and inside  Crimea. Well, Crimea's drifting can be either speedy or  evolutionary, but the drifting... [pauses] in view of the fact  that the Russian population is the majority and that there is  interest in Russia, this... [pauses] No matter what happens to  Crimea, whether it becomes an oblast or a republic -- they  believe if it were an oblast it would be easier to cope with  problems and if it were a republic it would be more difficult.  All these are illusions. The drifting results from the very  composition and the fear -- the fear, I underline this -- that  the Ukrainian state, having embarked on so-called nationalist  course, will, so to say, lead to the elimination of Russian  spirituality, Russian spirit, traditions and culture in Crimea.    But how to do this? For example, to set a course now so that  this would be done from inside Crimea. They say that some  actions will be carried out there so that Crimea will be further  alienating itself from Ukraine and approaching its statehood, as  the first step, so as to conceal the genuine objectives, and  then, when there is a possibility to conclude treaties, the  treaty on accession to Russia will be concluded. This is the  policy of Crimea itself.    What is Ukraine's policy? Ukraine is conducting the  following policy: To vest the broadest, the greatest possible  economic and other socioeconomic plenary powers in Crimea, the  rights to tackle all the socioeconomic problems facing Crimea  using the possibilities of this region, its resources and  specific features. The broadest possible rights. And this is  already a fact of life that we have agreed to this. This refers  both to the budget and other things. But we are saying sincerely  and frankly that we shall never conduct any negotiations with  anyone as regards the political status and territorial integrity  of our Ukraine, for example, and as regards Crimea.    [Kravchuk continues] What is the current situation in the  world? I would like you to understand this, that the situation  in the world now is in Ukraine's favor. That both the European  states and the United States of America officially underlined  that they respect and that they will support everywhere  Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and  inviolability of its borders. Believe me, this is extremely  significant.    Way back when the former parliament of Russia took a  decision  on the status of Sevastopol you probably felt that the Security  Council responded instantly. That is to say, it is impossible  to tackle issues in Crimea today without taking into account  Ukraine's weight, its role and the prestige it gained, both  political and otherwise, and its potentials. One cannot tackle  these issues, I repeat this, without taking this into account.  This exactly is what we proceed from.    In other words, we shall strive for mutual interaction with  all forces. We would like to take into account the interests, I  emphasize this, in this region and the interests of Russia. Our  attitude toward policy is realistic and we do not want, let us  say, to think that this is the matter of concern for one state  only. At present the interests of many are interlaced there.  We would like to take this into account and we shall propose  how to do this. However, to raise questions about any political  changes, about territorial or any other changes, this will never  be allowed to happen -- never. I would like everyone to be  aware of this. Territorial integrity, sovereignty, and  independence are the bounds for policy, the bounds beyond which  no one will make any steps. The one who will make them has no  right to respect himself and he cannot be considered to be a  politician. Everyone must be aware of this. And we shall never  allow anyone to go beyond these bounds. We ourselves do not  pass them and we shall not allow anyone to do this. We shall be  defending these bounds.    [Mediator] Mykhaylo Soroka, URYADOVYY KURYER.    [URYADOVYY KURYER correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, [words  indistinct] prior to your visit this morning to the Lvov region,  U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry had departed from Kiev.  What are the main results of his visit to Ukraine that you  could emphasize, and will the Ukrainian-American dialogue  continue?    [Kravchuk] Well, to begin with, Secretary Perry came on the  instruction of United States of America President Clinton, to  fulfill the accords signed by us in Washington. I can say that  the negotiations held were interesting, constructive, and  fruitful. Not only were all the Washington ideas were realized  in Kiev, but also something in addition to them. We agreed and  signed documents on increasing servicemen's housing construction  funds and social security, which will become a reality in the  very near future and will be done. More money was given to  conversion and other purposes relating to the elimination of our  nuclear weapons. We placed the main emphasis, however, on how  the officers and servicemen who serve in the army, will be  provided for socially at present.    Secondly, the delegation's composition was rather  wide-ranging. There were, you see, rocket technology specialists  there and there were negotiations in connection with possible  civilian use of our rocket technology. There were conversion  specialists and professionals who will immediately deal with the  verification of nuclear weapons elimination. This was a  representative delegation dealing with everything ranging from  the armed forces to space. On each of these issues, we made an  important step forward.    [Mediator] Another question please.    [UNIAN correspondent Volodymyr Ivakhnenko] It has become  known from unofficial information that the Russian side has  refused to form a commission which would begin an inventory of  the Black Sea Fleet jointly with the Ukrainian side. What is  your vision of a settlement to the Black Sea Fleet issue on the  eve of another round of talks with Russia?    [Kravchuk] I can say that to date there is Russian Prime  Minister Chernomyrdin's instruction to form such a commission  for it to start working. There are problems. I have no precise  information about who it was who refused. The only thing that I  do know is that there is no other decision by the head of the  Russian Government. So if there are any problems, I hope they  will be resolved. If this was not done on 15 March it can be  done on 10 April. One cannot, however, say that this issue was  struck out from the agenda altogether.    [Mediator] Your question please.    [UkrKinoKhronika studio correspondent, name indistinct] I  have a question for Mr. Radetskyy. Do you find today's  exercises successful and do you think it worthwhile for the  Ukrainian artillerymen to have shelled a church at the firing  range given that the issue of religion is so complex now in  Ukraine?    [Radetskyy] Firstly, yes, the exercises that were held  today,  indeed, were expedient. This should be done. The president as  the commander-in-chief has already stated this to you today.    Secondly, no artillery, by the way, shelled the church  because, all precautions taken, artillery fires shells from the  flanks rather than over the heads of the forces on the offensive.    Thirdly, we known very well the remarkable history of this  firing range. I know Mala Vishenka and Velyka Vishenka (?which  used to be there). Today, incidentally, we jointly with the  Lviv region administration dealt with this problem. So I think  everything is normal and natural and what had been planned was  fulfilled under the plan. I do not understand your question:  What does this church have to do with it? No one, incidentally,  fired at it, not even soldiers from their automatic rifles.  And, by the way, no one has been shelling it since 1980, no.  No one has been shelling it since 1980; the people's eyes have  opened.    [Kravchuk] The only thing I would like to add is this: Since  1917, not only this church but all the churches on our soil, and  not only the churches but also the people who believed, believe,  and will believe in God, have been so shelled verbally and their  soul so ruined that this church is like a silent witness to what  has been done. The people, you see, have already understood it  themselves, as the minister said. One cannot do this to the  people, the fruit of their labor and their belief. It is  improper.    That it has been understood is good. Of course it has so  happened that it has taken place and there is this firing range.  But what can be done now? We cannot, after all, shut it down,  because colossal means and resources have been invested here and  it is needed. It is needed in order to train and practice the  skillfulness of our armed forces.    [Correspondent] How well are the Ukrainian troops prepared  to  take part in the Partnership for Peace program and joint  military exercises?    [Kravchuk] Partnership for Peace does not foresee the  participation of Ukrainian troops, because it is a partnership  for peace. [sentence as heard] There is another clause there, a  clause saying that during NATO military exercises, our units and  troops could, with our consent, participate, in order to  practice certain models for themselves, not to take part in any  possible military action. That is impossible. We are taking  part in the action in Yugoslavia, with our battalion, which is  involved there in order to ensure normal life, and only that.  This is agreed with the UN Security Council. Therefore, some  unit could, with our consent and the consent of the relevant  NATO structure, take part in joint military exercises, but not  more. This does not imply our interaction with NATO troops,  because we are not a member of NATO.    [Moderator] Mykola Yurchyshyn, SILSKI VISTI, please.    [SILSKI VISTI correspondent Yurchyshyn] Esteemed Mr.  President, is there an alternative military service in Ukraine?  According to the law, there should be one.    [Kravchuk] What alternative service?    [Radetskyy] This is laid down in the law, and the law should  be adhered to. Incidentally, there are very few objectors,  those who refuse to carry arms, in Ukraine today. These include  sick people or those who belong to religious movements. We are  solving these problems and we are working on them. Moreover,  the law speaks not only of alternative service, but also about  contract service which we also plan to practice in future, as  right now there is no money to maintain a professional army,  although, it would in fact pay off and would be cheaper for  Ukraine to maintain than these boys we are drafting for a year  and a half, who are wrecking everything and for whom this time  is too short to embrace the material they are to study.    [SHLYAKH PEREMOHY correspondent] I have two questions, if I  may. The first one is this: The president of Ukraine is at the  same time the commander-in-chief. But we now have another  president, the Crimean one. Are you going to share any powers  of the commander-in-chief with him? [Kravchuk and Radetskyy are  heard laughing] My second question concerns the Defense Council  of Crimea which has been set up there. Is it a state structure,  if yes, what functions has it been charged to perform?    [Kravchuk] This follows from your first question about  Crimea, and I will answer it more broadly. There are a few  aspects that probably need clarification. There is Ukraine's  legislation, its Constitution and laws, and there is the law on  delimiting powers between Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea.  These laws exist and according to these laws, the Crimean  president cannot -- being absolutely governed by the legislation  -- shall we say, command, influence or regulate any forces.  This is the prerogative of the Ukrainian president only. Nor  can he, let us say, under our Constitution have any military  structures. Moreover, our law, our legislation does not allow  military formations that are not provided for in our  legislation. This not only applies to Crimea but to everyone  and everywhere.    Thus, what is being done, even if it is only beginning to be  done, is unconstitutional and unlawful and we shall be bringing  everything in Crimea in line with the legislation.    [Radetskyy] Can I answer?    [Kravchuk] Yes, you're welcome to.    [Radetskyy] As for the question on the Crimean Defense  Council, the only council we have is Ukraine's Defense Council.  I know of no such council as the Crimean Defense Council. This  is an invention. By the way, the Odessa military district  commander and the 32nd Army Corps commander are present here  today, who strictly perform their duties within the framework of  those entrusted to them by the Defense Council of Ukraine.  There is and there will be no other council.    [Kravchuk] So, we shall execute the Constitution and laws of  Ukraine, and any statements that there is no need for the  Ukrainian Army in Crimea and such like, are groundless  legislatively and have no foundation except for ambitions and  wishes. That is why they are not not the basis for practical  moves. I have instructed Ukraine's appropriate services so as  for them to work and bring everything in line with the  legislation.    By the way, you see, no matter how agitated they were and no  matter how insistent they were on a referendum or a poll,  everything boiled down to a poll to be conducted by the  president. Crimea's Central Electoral Commission has refused to  conduct this poll. All it is doing is to provide the premises  and hand out the ballot papers. It will neither calculate nor  count or make conclusions on this poll. The poll in Crimea,  strictly in legal terms, thus amounts to an opinion poll by the  presidential team. You know, there is no such thing anywhere,  either in the laws or the Constitution. Anyone can conduct such  a poll, including the president. In this case, however, it is  not legitimate as it even is conducted without commissions or  any legalization by, shall we say, a legitimate body. This is  being done by certain officials authorized by the president.  This he can do and I am calm about this, because any analysis  [pauses] -- I do not know to what degree it will be legalized,  how its authenticity can be verified and so on. So what  conclusions will be drawn from this? None. There simply will be  expenditure. That is all.    [Mediator] Questions are welcome.    [Unidentified correspondent] The Defense Ministry's TV. I  have a question on armed forces reduction and how it will affect  state security.    [Kravchuk] We have to have sufficiency in our defense  capability and to do so our armed forces have to be sufficient,  as it were. There are materials providing for their numerical  strength, which is 450,000 for the armed forces at this stage.  We shall approach this and then see what the situation is and  what the quality of our armed forces is, because, shall we say,  if they are to be professional armed forces, probably -- we  shall also settle this issue in due time -- a different type of  expenditure, a different type of weaponry and a different number  of men will be involved. Meanwhile, we shall act in accordance  with our military doctrine approved by the Supreme Council.    [Radetskyy] Leonid Makarovych, can I add something?    [Kravchuk] Yes, you are welcome to.    [Radetskyy] The Defense Council, by the way, has held a  sitting and you tasked me with clarifying it. The thing is that  this numerical strength of 450,000 is as of 31 December 1994,  while you assigned the task of examining this issue and reducing  it to 420,000. There is such an instruction from the president  and we are dealing with this.    [Kravchuk] This is not, shall we say, a magic number we have  to hang on to. Firstly, it is the quality of weaponry, the  quality of armed forces training, the situation outside the  country and the international and domestic situation, that will  dictate the numerical strength and quality of our armed forces,  rather than simply, shall we say, recording it in writing and  hanging on to this number.    [Radetskyy] (?Including) materials and machinery provision.    [Kravchuk] That is right.    [Lvov television correspondent] Mr. President, due to  certain  circumstances we have two military districts, the powerful  Precarpathia and Odessa districts. Could you say, please, if  there is an opinion that the eastern part of the country remains  as if unprotected, as if there is no mighty force guarding the  borders there.    [Kravchuk] No, this is not the case. There is the Odessa  military district there. We have appropriate structures. We  also have the National Guard which performs its functions and  which, by the way, actively participated today. The National  Guard commander is present. So, in other words, we have the  appropriate armed forces and appropriate military structures  etcetera, shall we say, of all ranks to ensure the tasks set by  the Ukrainian state are performed.    The only thing I would just like us to proceed from, is  this:  We are not training ourselves to make war. We are training  ourselves to protect ourselves, which is our concept of  principle. We are not and shall not be first to raise our hand  against anyone, God forbid. Ukraine is a peaceful state and,  incidentally, it has always been peaceful. It has not been at  war with anyone. We do not have any territorial claims against  anyone. In our policy and our statements, we have never  expressed even a hint that we have some claims to someone, be it  our neighbors near or far, no. We say [pauses] -- this is what  we state. But we, at the same time, say we do not want anyone  to have any such claims against us. Should there be any,  however -- and there are some let us not pretend there are not  -- we shall show we shall protect our interests.    If anyone tries -- [pauses] not by means of established  international principles which, by the way, have been worked out  in detail both in the Helsinki process and at the United Nations  Organization, worked out in detail, and the world [pauses] --  this is the most sensitive issue: Why is the world so sensitive  when someone violates this? Because here lies that most  dreadful line between peace and war.    Therefore, we say that we shall not make even a single step  to cross this line. But the one who will do this not by means  of those established norms existing in the world but who will  try to do this by means of force, it is clear that it will be  countered by force. There is no other option.    [Radetskyy] Leonid Makarovych, the esteemed gentleman who  put  this question had in mind not only this but also the fact that  the Odessa district is so large while the Precarpathian district  is so small. And this issue was already touched upon [word  indistinct].    [Kravchuk] Well, we are currently working out our structure.    [Radetskyy] Territorially.    [Kravchuk] We are working it out. For example, there were  staff exercises and they have been held for two weeks. Is that  right?    [Radetskyy] They are still in progress.    [Kravchuk] Then I will continue to analyze. There, at the  exercises, we were talking about how to build our territorial  defense so that it would be adequate to the situation. And this  will be changed. And, again, this is not something established  once and forever, but this is a process.    [Radetskyy] I would like to explain as a military expert  that  the question is not how many troops there are in a military  district, but what these troops are, what their mobility is  like, what their combat readiness is like, so that we could, in  any location where our security is being threatened, concentrate  these forces in order to solve the problem by means of a  political dialogue, not by force. We should create formation in  that location so that those threatening us would give up trying  to fight against us but would solve the conflict in a political  way.    [Passage omitted]    [Correspondent from NARODNA ARMIYA] Leonid Makarovych, these  are the first exercises held after the Army General of Ukraine  Vitaliy Hryhorovych Radetskyy was appointed Ukraine's Defense  Minister. Today [word indistinct] not only the combat activity  of the troops but also Vitaliy Hryhorovych were assessed.    [Kravchuk] You know, when Vitaliy Hryhorovych took the post,  he got down to practical deeds. He is an experienced person who  made a career, in different places, as they say, and at  different posts, from a platoon commander to the minister. He  knows all the ticks and hooks which they draw on maps and which  they dig in the earth. He knows where one should stand and what  one should do, and he himself can replace a company, platoon,  regiment, battalion, division, or district commander. He is a  genuine minister. A person who has not gone through all this  will experience difficulties. This is why I appreciate his  experience. This is the first thing.    Secondly, he is a person who wants that the armed forces be  functioning as a clockwork mechanism and who knows what is to be  done toward that end. He is a man of responsibility.    I know that here, especially on the land of Galicia, there  is  much talk about the former minister, Mr. Morozov. He initiated  and applied certain efforts so that we could have our armed  forces. And no one can deny this fact. But it turned out so  that [pauses] -- one can only do what he is able to do. And one  will never do more than that. He did what he could do. Being  aware of the fact that this post is rather serious and has a lot  of trends and philosophical and political interpretations around  it, we were doing everything possible to preserve the status  quo, although it was not easy to do this. And no one should be  blamed. However, the situation, both in the center and in the  regions, and in the troops -- I know this -- was such that this  issue had to be solved. And then the minister knew this from  the conversation he had with me. Despite the fact that I,  nevertheless, submitted his candidacy to parliament, he came and  asked that his candidacy be withdrawn.</p>

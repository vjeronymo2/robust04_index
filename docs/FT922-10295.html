			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Lloyd's Names may win help to ease losses LLOYD'S of London yesterday announced that it is considering measures to help Names hit by recent losses and said that the first moves to introduce reforms recommended earlier this year by the Rowland task force had been taken. Mr Alan Lord, chief executive, said the Council, the insurance market's governing body, had 'discussed in broad outline' the possibility of providing a measure of financial assistance to Names facing severe underwriting losses. Several hundred Names - individuals whose assets support underwriting at Lloyd's - face acute financial problems as a result of losses run up by catastrophe reinsurance syndicates in 1989 and 1990. Mr Lord said: 'Much further work is required on this complex matter before we can establish the feasibility of any scheme in detail. The whole question is being pushed ahead as rapidly as possible.' He added, however, that a 'successful outcome' could not be guaranteed. Names would be consulted 'in the normal way', added Mr Lord, who said a ballot or referendum of the membership of Lloyd's was possible. Mr Lord also said Lloyd's was making 'considerable progress' on implementing recommendations relating to Mapas - the unit-trust-type arrangements which allow Names to spread their participation in syndicates more widely across the market and reduce risk - as suggested by the Rowland task force when it reported in January. Lloyd's is understood to be negotiating with regulatory and tax authorities about the impact of these changes. The council has agreed to implement a change to the agency agreement, which governs the relationship between Names and their agents. The modified agency agreement includes a new 'deficit clause' which allows Names to offset the profit commission paid to agents against losses made in the previous two years, rather than one year as at present. Another aspect of the scheme would eventually allow for compulsory arbitration of all disputes between Names and their agents.</p>

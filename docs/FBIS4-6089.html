			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 17 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister  Michio Watanabe told reporters Sunday he will leave the main  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Earlier last week  Watanabe, leader of the third largest power bloc in the LDP,  disclosed his readiness to run for a Diet premiership election  to pick the successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    Watanabe told reporters Sunday, "I will give up my party  membership as a matter of course."    On Friday LDP President Yohei Kono met Watanabe in a bid to  ask Watanabe not to leave the party. Watanabe, however,  expressed his readiness to form a new alliance with Shinseito  and Komeito, the two key parties in the governing coalition, in  order to "surmount the crises now confronting this country."    The second round of Kono-Watanabe talks was scheduled for  Monday.</p>

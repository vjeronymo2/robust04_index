			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Telecom Italia plea suffers setback Italy's anti-trust authority has increased pressure on the government to reject Telecom Italia's demand for tariff concessions to offset increased competition in mobile telephone services. In one of his first acts as head of the authority, Mr Giuliano Amato, a former prime minister, has warned that the authority would almost certainly have to take action if Telecom Italia won concessions on tariffs and used its new pricing freedom to hinder the development of the new Omnitel-Pronto Italia consortium. That consortium, headed by the Olivetti computer group, won the licence to build the country's second pan-European digital mobile phone network in March, and will have the freedom to set prices at any level on that network. Telecom Italia now wants the same freedom to set prices on the existing national analogue network, over which it has a monopoly, arguing that, otherwise, Omnitel will be able to undercut its service, which has more than 2m subscribers. Subscribers to the analogue network can only use their telephones in Italy whereas digital customers can make and receive calls in many other European countries. Telecom Italia also wants a reduction in its annual fee to the government, to compensate for the advent of competition. In a letter to Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, and other ministers, Mr Amato warned that if Telecom Italia made 'strategic use' of its already dominant position, 'it would be difficult for the (anti-trust) authority not to intervene. . . . to remove the conditions which obstruct competition'. He also pointed out that a long and messy anti-trust inquiry would further delay liberalisation of mobile telephone services, a process which is already running behind that of other European countries. Yesterday, the committee of ministers which has to decide on Telecom Italia's demands postponed a discussion until December 15, 'to allow for further in-depth consideration of the questions raised, and to listen to the positions expressed by the parties involved'. Omnitel, which hopes to have a commercial service operating in Italy by the end of next year, argues that Telecom Italia has a strong lead in the Italian market for mobile services, even if the state company has not been allowed until now to develop its own digital network. Telecom Italia, however, believes it ought to be able to compete directly with Omnitel on digital and analogue services. Mr Amato's informal intervention is unusual, and based on only a preliminary assessment of the situation. But the anti-trust authority wanted to underline the risks involved in granting further concessions to Telecom Italia given that 'the opening of digital mobile phone services to competition represents a fundamental step in the process of liberalising the entire telecoms sector'. Further delay could also provoke action from the European Commission, which has kept a close watch on the gradual liberalisation of the market. Since last week, neither Telecom Italia nor Omnitel has commented publicly on the situation, but behind the scenes there has been fierce lobbying of ministers. Telecom Italia has also deliberately withheld its signature on the joint convention which will govern the new digital 'GSM' services, even though it was signed by Omnitel last week.</p>

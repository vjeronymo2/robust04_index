			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Poles baulk at austerity policies POLAND'S tight monetary policies are coming under threat from the country's most serious waves of industrial unrest since economic changes began three years ago. As strikes by coal and copper ore miners continue, an important western investor, Fiat, is also faced with a stoppage for the first time. Workers at the FSM plant in Tychy, which is being sold to the Italian motor group, went on strike on Wednesday to demand higher wages. The strike followed a stoppage which started on Monday by some 40,000 workers at the copper-producing combine at Lubin in western Poland. The miners are demanding a 30 per cent wage rise, which can only be paid if the government eases tough wage controls. Ms Hanna Suchocka, the new prime minister, told the senate, parliament's second chamber, yesterday that the government would not permit settlements which 'would favour one group of workers at the cost of other groups'. A strike also began at the Zofiowka coal mine, one of the largest pits in the Rybnik mining region in southern Poland.</p>

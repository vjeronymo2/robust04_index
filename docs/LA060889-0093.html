			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONTEREY PARK;  </P> <P> OFFICIAL DISPUTES FIRE STUDY  </P> <P> City Manager Mark Lewis has concluded that "it would not be fiscally prudent"  for Monterey Park to contract with Los Angeles County for fire protection and  rescue services.  </P> <P> Lewis, who reviewed a proposal made by the Los Angeles County Fire Department,  maintains that the city would lose local control and would pay more for  firefighting. An analysis by county fire officials said Monterey Park might  save almost $600,000 each year by consolidating its fire department with the  county. But Lewis said his assessment shows the city might have to spend an  additional $457,757 each year.  </P> <P> Despite Lewis' claim that the proposal would be more costly, officials of the  Monterey Park Firefighters Assn. say the city would benefit by contracting with  the county. Association spokesman Paul M. McCrummen, a Monterey Park Fire  Department captain, said the analysis by Lewis "has somewhat overstated the  figures or in other cases used totally meaningless" numbers.  </P> <P> McCrummen said the 48-member union, currently engaged in contract negotiations  with the city, wants Monterey Park officials to continue working with the  county on the proposed consolidation.  </P> <P> Firefighters, McCrummen said, would benefit by having improved salary and  benefits and increased opportunities, if the firefighters worked for the  county. In addition, he said, the city residents would gain by having the  improved fire protection that the county department can provide.  </P></p>

Where the teaching physician has no relationship with the provider (except for standard physician privileges to admit patients) and generally treats patients on a fee-for-service basis in the private sector, the teaching physician may submit claims under his/her own provider number. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Physicians in training. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Physicians in training in an approved teaching program are considered to be ``students'' and may not be reimbursed directly by CHAMPUS for services rendered to a beneficiary when their services are provided as part of their employment (either salaried or contractual) by a hospital or other institutional provider.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 15 TASS -- The first meeting of the  Russian Federation Council, the upper parliament chamber, ended  here today after a five-day work.    The deputies have elected the council chairman and his two  deputies, decided to form ten parliament committees, approved  their structure and elected chairmen of six committees.  Regulations on maintenance of Federation Council deputies and  other documents were adopted.    The next meeting of the Federation Council will be held on  January 31.    Kalmyk President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov told ITAR-TASS the first  meeting of the Federation Council was calm and businesslike.  "There is no hysteria, confrontation or sharp division between  the center and region, administration heads and other deputies  as some had predicted," he stressed.    The president denounced attempts to oppose the State Duma to  the Federation Council. The more they try to separate the  Federation Council from the State Duma and present it as  pro-presidential, the more negative reaction of the Federal  Council members they will provoke, he noted.    Federation Council member Boris Nemtsov told ITAR-TASS the  newly- elected leaders of the upper chamber "quite correspond to  the level of authority given to the Federation Council by the  Constitution". The Nizhni Novgorod administration head shared  fears the Federation Council may become a pocket  pro-presidential body.    "If the Federation Council chairman is a wise man he will  try  to get rid of this image in the near future," he added. In the  opinion of Nemtsov, the upper chamber should form the 1994  budget, monitor the implementation of the federal treaty and  complete the formation of constitutional, arbitration and  supreme courts in the immediate future.    Opposition-minded member of the upper chamber Aman Tuleyev  told ITAR-TASS "approximately 60 per cent of Federation Council  members vote to a command and some 40 per cent have their own  opinion". But "there will be less differences when the  Federation Council starts to discuss specific economic and  legislative issues, the common sense will win," he added.</p>

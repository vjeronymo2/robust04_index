			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 31 May Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Sector-by-sector negotiations in the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks will resume in Tokyo with negotiations  on the insurance sector starting on 1 June. Likewise,  negotiations on automobiles and auto parts will open in  Washington on 2 June, and those on government procurement of  telecommunications equipment and medical equipment in Tokyo on 3  and 7 June, respectively.    In the automobile negotiations, U.S. Under Secretary of  Commerce Jeffrey Garten will come to Japan in the week of 6  June, and hold vice ministerial-level talks with Sozaburo  Okamatsu, deputy vice minister of international trade and  industry.    Apart from the above three priority sectors, discussions on  intellectual property rights, one of the other five sectors the  United States wants to negotiate, will also begin in Washington  around 10 June.    After the recent informal meetings in Washington which  resulted in the decision to resume the framework talks,  working-level talks are being held to finalize concrete points  of agreement for each sector.    Of the three priority sectors, the issue of liberalizing  insurance covering injury and illness, where U.S. companies have  an advantage, is expected to be the focal issue in insurance  sector negotiations.    Negotiations on government procurement and automobiles and  auto parts will concentrate on the issue of "objective  criteria," on which no conclusion was reached in previous  unofficial discussions.    On intellectual property rights, copyright protection for  computer software, and standardization of the patent systems in  Japan and the United States are expected to be the topics of  discussion.</p>

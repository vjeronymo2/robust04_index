			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index drifts down towards the 3,100 area - Market Report The London stock market had an uncomfortable session, with the FT-SE Index falling to within 7 points of the 3,100 area as a sell-off in German bonds brought a reaction in British government securities. Trading volume in equities was very low, although ready interest was shown in a handful of speculative situations. Shares tried to rally when Wall Street opened higher but turned back again to close at the lowest levels of the day as the early gain on the Dow was trimmed to 11 points at the London close. The final reading of 3,106.1 showed the FT-SE Index with a net fall of 27.6 on the day. The market opened higher in spite of a further waning in hopes for a base rate cut. Gains were soon reversed, however, as bond markets turned down across Europe. The absence of any encouraging communique from the meeting at the weekend of the G7 finance ministers left markets unsettled and UK bonds were not helped by the announcement of 0.7 per cent growth in domestic gross domestic product for the first quarter. There was little response, however, to a slight widening in the UK's non-EU trade deficit in March. Selling pressure was persistent, rather than severe. One trader commented that 'for every decent buyer, there were a couple of sellers', and the loss on the Footsie soon extended to 25.4 to reach 3,108.3. The downward drive came from the stock index futures, which were, in their turn, shying away from losses in UK bonds which ranged to around 1 1/2 points at one time. Losses in bond markets have unsettled UK equities for the past two months. There were signs, however, that investors, having largely abandoned hopes for a base rate cut, were switching attention to recovery stocks. Chemical issues, encouraged by good trading figures from Du Pont in the US, looked for similar signs of progress in the UK sector of the industry. This month's indications of growing UK retail sales were reflected in demand for those leading store groups still to report on progress for the first quarter of the year. Oil shares remained very firm behind the rally in crude oil prices, with Lasmo attracting strong demand as bid speculation continued to flourish. But across the range of the market, there was no escaping the negative influence of the bond and futures markets. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell 21.9 points to 3,767.6. Trading volume proved very slow in the first half of the session and even the attempted rally only lifted the day's Seaq total to 522.3m shares, compared with 816.3m on Friday, when retail business was worth a healthy Pounds 1.67bn. Analysts sounded disappointed that European and US bond markets were still so nervous, and that UK equities could still be so clearly unsettled by pressures from the fixed interest sectors. This week brings a number of significant investment hurdles, with the US GDP numbers for the first quarter and the German money supply data, both due at the end of the week, capable of upsetting the investment mood. The stock market is expected to focus this morning on the quarterly survey of business optimism among members of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). A week ago, CBI members appeared less optimistic on retail sales than was indicated by the official statistics subsequently released.</p>

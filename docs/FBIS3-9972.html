			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "TV Today" newscast] </F>   [Text] The U.S. Marines have advanced their departure from  Juanchaco on the Pacific Coast. Only 40 of the 156 U.S.  soldiers who came to build a school and a health center remain.  The worrisome part is that "TV Today" has learned that their  mission was to bury toxic waste in Malaga Bay and that they may  return in 20 days to complete their work.    After 62 days of uncertainty and of not believing a single  word about the facilities that supposedly would be built by the  U.S. soldiers in Juanchaco, finally the soldiers, Marines,  engineers, or whatever they were packed their incredible tons of  cargo, containers, trucks, and machinery and began their long  journey to Panama. In Juanchaco, however, there is even more  uncertainty today. A worrisome rumor is circulating on the  island that the gringo soldiers did not come to build facilities  but to bury toxic waste in Colombian territory. Those rumors  are cause for concern among residents.    Out of 156 U.S. soldiers, not even the 40 who stayed and who  will leave tomorrow from the naval base in Malaga Bay received  any explanation for this action, which now explains the real  reason for their presence in our country. What worries the  people most is that last Wednesday a U.S.-flagged ship was asked  to leave our territory because it carried a shipment of toxic  waste. The incident has increased the people's fears and they  are afraid to report the case to the media. They merely express  their frustration because the work was not completed.    [Begin unidentified resident recording] Now that the work is  in Colombian hands, we wonder if it will be finished because an  airport has been under construction for a long time, and it is  still incomplete. [end recording]    Meanwhile, the U.S. soldiers said they have no knowledge of  the case and that they have nothing to do with it. They also  expressed their respect and appreciation for Colombia and said  they are leaving with the best impression.    [Begin unidentified U.S. soldier recording, in English with  superimposed translation into Spanish] We must go home because  we have completed our work in Juanchaco. [end recording]    A U.S. soldier told "TV Today" that 20 days after the  elections, a new contingent of U.S. troops will return to Malaga  Bay.    Meanwhile, we visited the school and health center that are  only half finished. Only the roof and walls confirm that U.S.  soldiers were indeed there at least trying to build those  facilities. Colombian troops, not U.S. soldiers, will work on  repairing the airport's runway, which has been practically  destroyed.</p>

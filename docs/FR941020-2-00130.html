Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the Phlx included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Phlx proposes to use the Series 7 as amended, as the appropriate qualification examination for persons seeking registration as general securities representatives. The Series 7 examination is generally required under rules of the self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') for persons who are engaged in the solicitation, purchase and/or sale of securities for the accounts of customers. The purpose of the Series 7 examination is to ensure that registered representatives have the basic knowledge necessary to preform their functions and responsibilities. The Series 7 examination specifications detail the areas covered by the examination and break down the number of examination questions culled from each area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revision of the Series 7 examination, specifications and content outline was initiated in April 1993 by an industry committee of SROs and representatives from broker-dealers in order to update the examination in view of changes in the securities industry, including changes in relevant rules and regulations, the development of new securities products, and changes in the job of registered representatives as firms offer an increasingly wide range of financial services. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  The examination specifications for the Series 7 have not been revised since 1986. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> SROs on the committee include the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange, Chicago Board Options Exchange, Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, National Association of Securities Dealers and Philadelphia Stock Exchange. Broker-dealer representatives include branch office managers, compliance officers, training personnel and registered representatives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The industry committee updated the existing statements of the critical functions of registered representatives to ensure current relevance and appropriateness and drafted statements of tasks expected to be performed by entry-level registered representatives, and conformed the existing content outline to the task statements. Under the proposed rule change, the total number of questions in the Series 7 examination will remain 250, and the revised examination will cover all financial product areas covered on the present Series 7 examination as well as several new products, including collateralized mortgage obligations (``CMOs''), long term equity anticipation securities (``LEAPS'') and CAPS, with reduced emphasis on direct participation programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

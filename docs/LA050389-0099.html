			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAKEOVER ARTIST BILZERIAN CALLED 'PHONY' AT TRIAL  </P> <P> Takeover artist Paul A. Bilzerian was a "phony" who deceived investors,  corporate targets and the government to make millions in hostile raids, a  federal prosecutor charged Tuesday at the opening of Bilzerian's securities  fraud trial.  </P> <P> Bilzerian, who is chairman of Singer Co., borrowed other people's money to make  himself appear formidable to corporate targets, Assistant U.S. Atty. David  Brodsky said in his opening statement. On top of that deception, Bilzerian hid  his ownership of stock under the name of former securities executive Boyd L.  Jefferies to strengthen his hand in raids, Brodsky charged.  </P> <P> "In the past, the lies brought him lots of money," the prosecutor said. "Today,  they bring him to the bar of justice."  </P> <P> The case is the latest to go to trial from the family of Wall Street corruption  cases that grew from the leads provided by imprisoned stock speculator Ivan F.  Boesky. As with the trial of GAF Corp. and one of its executives, it will rely  heavily on the testimony of Jefferies, the founder and longtime head of the Los  Angeles-based Jefferies &amp; Co. securities firm.  </P> <P> Bilzerian is charged with 11 counts of violating securities and tax laws by  failing to disclose his stock holdings. The case centers on failed corporate  raids against four companies: apparel maker Cluett-Peabody &amp; Co., the H. H.  Robertson construction concern, steelmaker Armco and Hammermill Paper Co.  </P> <P> Bilzerian has asserted his innocence since he was indicted in December. One  charge against him has been dropped.  </P> <P> Brodsky said that in 1985 Bilzerian didn't have nearly enough money to make the  public think he should be taken seriously as a corporate raider. So he  "concocted a formula for instant credibility" by borrowing large sums from  investors, including shopping center magnate Edward DeBartolo, according to the  prosecutor. Bilzerian made it appear that the money was his own, Brodsky said.  </P> <P> Bilzerian promised that he would split his profits evenly with investors and  that they would be shielded from any loss, Brodsky said.  </P> <P> Brodsky described Bilzerian as "a man of relatively modest wealth willing to  put other people's wealth on the line -- in a word, a phony."  </P> <P> The prosecutor said Bilzerian deceived the Securities and Exchange Commission  and the Internal Revenue Service about the source of his wealth and his  ownership of stock. He used several means for hiding its ownership, Brodsky  added.  </P> <P> But Arthur Mathews, a Washington lawyer for Bilzerian, said the case should not  have been brought and had come to trial only to justify the plea agreement  prosecutors had reached with Jefferies. "The government strains to justify the  bad bargain they made," he said.  </P> <P> Mathews, apparently referring to Bilzerian, said Jefferies could not turn in  anyone above him but had "implicated a few scapegoats." But Mathews insisted  that "there has been no one hurt -- no one has been deprived of any money or  property."  </P> <P> The government is expected to call about 20 witnesses in the trial, the first  of whom is due to testify today. Prosecutors declined Tuesday to disclose the  identity of that first witness.  </P> <P> The trial will be another important test of the credibility of Jefferies, who  was strongly challenged by defense attorneys in the GAF Corp. stock  manipulation trial. That case ended once in a mistrial and a second time with a  deadlocked jury.  </P></p>

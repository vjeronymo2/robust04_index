			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Stress helpline is launched WORKERS suffer from stress are to be offered instant information on where to find Tai-Chi exercise sessions or even juggling classes to help them relax, following the launch yesterday of a one-stop anti-stress service for companies. The service by Mind, the mental health charity, will tackle more serious emotional problems with a 24-hour-a-day counselling service. Stress management courses will also be provided by the charity. Mind expects more than 1,000 organisations to join the Pounds 600-a-year programme. Companies will get extra peace of mind from the fact that the covenanted fee to Mind will count as a charitable donation and can therefore be offset against tax. Stress and other emotional difficulties are estimated to cost Pounds 7bn a year in the UK - at least half of which is calculated to be a direct cost to industry through reductions in productivity. A total of 80m annual working days are lost, according to Department of Health figures. Particularly stressful occupations were said by Mind to include farming, the emergency services and teaching. The charity stressed that 'executive stress' was not the only problem - production-line workers with little control over their jobs could suffer. Ms Judi Clements, Mind director, said that stress and more severe forms of mental distress, affected one in four people each year.</p>

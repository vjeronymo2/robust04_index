			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(js)": "A Return To Tradition"] </F>   [Text] Banska Bystrica--The Slovak National Party [SNS] is  departing from the civic tendency declared at its Ruzomberok  assembly by removing Article 5 from its articles and returning  to an unequivocal national principle in accordance with its  130-year tradition. This was announced by the SNS Central  Council at its conference held in Banska Bystrica on Saturday  [23 April]. SNS Chairman Jan Slota also said at a meeting with  journalists that the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and the  Christian Social Union [KSU] are being taken into consideration  as possible partners for a preelection coalition. The selection  of the KSU for preelection cooperation will be influenced by the  outcome of the KSU all-Slovak assembly following its session on  1 May. The SNS intends to proceed in the elections as a force  uniting Slovaks in South Slovakia and as the advocate of their  interests. Slota is convinced that the nationally oriented  parties and movements will win by a substantial majority in the  elections.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Malaysian cinema joint venture for Wilton Wilton Group, the cinema and television concern, has formed a joint venture with Mr Robert Kuok, a Malaysian Chinese entrepreneur, to build and operate a chain of multi-screen cinemas in Malaysia. Wilton and United Artists Theatre Circuit, which last year formed a joint venture to develop cinemas in south-east Asia, have joined forces with Cathay Cinemas to exploit the Malaysian market. Cathay, a subsidiary of Mr Kuok's Perlis Plantations vehicle, operates 38 cinemas in Malaysia and Singapore. It will have a 50 per cent stake while Wilton and United Artists will each have 25 per cent. It is thought that Wilton and United Artists are talking to Mr Kuok's group about cinema joint ventures in other south-east Asian countries, including mainland China. Mr Michael Buckley, chairman of Wilton, said that the goal was to develop between 10 and 12 multiplex cinemas in Malaysia at a cost of between Dollars 7m (Pounds 4.6m) and Dollars 12m each. He stressed that the cinemas would be very cash generative once opened. The main shareholders in Wilton, which is shortly to change its name to Pacific Media, are Mr Buckley and Mr Clive Ng, the Malaysian entrepreneur.</p>

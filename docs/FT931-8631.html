			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Leading Article: An overmighty president THE CONSULTATIVE committee set up by President Francois Mitterrand last November, to consider reform of the French constitution, has produced a useful clutch of detailed proposals for up-dating and reforming the French constitution. None of them is dramatic; most of them are rather constructive; cumulatively, they should strengthen the position of the government, enhance the role of the parliament, and in general improve the democratic process. On the most central issue, however, the report is a disappointment; for the committee has balked at two key questions: should the president's policy-making power be more clearly defined (and circumscribed), and should his time in office be more restricted? On paper, the functions granted to the president are those of an ultimate arbiter above the political fray; in practice, every president since General de Gaulle has exercised dominant authority in foreign policy and defence; and as a result of creeping presidentialism, there is now virtually no aspect of public business which is not subject to President Mitterrand's influence. If the constitution has a serious defect, it is that the president's power is not merely untrammelled (because undefined), but also irresponsible (in the literal sense of the term) because it is uncontrolled. The committee walks gingerly round the issue, but leaves it in a fudge. Shorter term The power of the presidency is manifestly due partly to the length of the mandate, which is seven years renewable, and which allows the president to outlast any government. Many political leaders, including President Mitterrand, have argued for various forms of shorter term; but the committee was unable to agree on any alternative. These two shortcomings are regrettable. By most criteria, France has been (and continues to be) well-governed, and there is no serious justification for minority demands for a wholesale change of republic. But creeping presidentialism has contributed to the growing wave of popular discredit, which has affected both the image of the president and the reputation of the political class. If President Mitterrand's popularity is at a low ebb, it is both because he is held responsible for the policy failures of the Socialist government, and because he stands aloof with all the trappings of an absolute republican monarch. If the Socialist party is unpopular, it is partly because of the combined effect of high unemployment and low financial scandals, but partly because parliament's reputation is necessarily depreciated by the tentacular power of the president. Useful reforms Despite having avoided the central issue, the committee has proposed some useful reforms. The legitimacy of new governments will be enhanced if they have to secure a parliamentary vote of confidence. The National Assembly should become more influential, if members are forbidden to double up as mayors of large towns or as regional presidents, and if ex-ministers automatically recover their seats in parliament. The political class may regain some popular respect, if it cannot twist the electoral system except by a two-thirds majority. Governments may pay more attention to public opinion, if MPs or even ordinary voters can mobilise popular referenda. At the end of the day, however, the committee seems content that France should continue to live under a presidential system, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages. So far the system has proved remarkably resilient; but it may be severely tested if the March general elections produce a serious political conflict between an ageing president at the tail-end of his second term of office, and a combative conservative government with a 200-seat majority in parliament. The issue of the presidential mandate is not closed, however. A draft law for reforming the constitution will be laid before the Senate some time next month, and it will obviously follow the recommendations of the committee. But the new conservative majority in the parliament which will be elected in March could well impose an amendment to shorten the presidential term.</p>

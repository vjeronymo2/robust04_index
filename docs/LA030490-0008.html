			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSHROOMS  </P> <P> Regarding your article "Taming Wild Mushrooms," by Russ Parsons (Food, Jan.  14): To my delight more area restaurants are serving wild mushrooms and in  increasingly interesting ways. No longer are we confronted with only the  commercial button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) -- we are seeing oyster  mushrooms, chanterelles, boletes, morels and even the much-prized truffle  appear on restaurant menus.  </P> <P> However, many restaurants are listing these gems of the earth only as "wild  mushrooms" with no thought of a proper identification. While there are a few  restaurants that take time to learn about what mushrooms they are about to  recommend (Michael's in Santa Monica, for one), most do not. Imagine, for  example, being handed a menu that lists "fresh fish," and when you ask what  fish it is, you are offhandedly told, "It's from the ocean," but not whether  it's shark or salmon.  </P> <P> Recently, I went to a Polish restaurant that features wild mushrooms. I was  looking forward to this as Poland is a large consumer of wild mushrooms and I  figured that there I would find an authentic mushroom dining experience. Much  to my surprise, when I asked what mushrooms were being served, I was told that  they were "from the forest." When I persisted, I was told that they were wild  and I probably wouldn't know them. Now, as an avid mycophagist and as a past  president of the Los Angeles Mycological Society, I felt challenged, but not  wanting to disrupt an anniversary dinner I simply ordered an entree that  featured "wild mushrooms." When my dish arrived, I saw no wild mushrooms at all  -- only commercial button mushrooms. I checked the plates of the others in my  party and noted that even though they also had ordered dishes with wild  mushrooms, none existed. I guess you could say that the moral of this is know  thy morel.  </P> <P> DONALD A. FEINSTEIN  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

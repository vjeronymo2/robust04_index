			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Fashion: Comfort and joy, cashmere has it all wrapped up - The world's most luxurious textile is now great value CATCH MANY of the world's foremost designers off (and sometimes on) duty and what are they wearing? Well, take Giorgio Armani, for example. If it is winter, nine times out of ten you will find him in an absolutely plain, classic, navy-blue cashmere sweater. Donna Karan will probably be sporting one of her own cashmere bodies (you know the sort of thing - steel grey or oatmeal, lean and simple and doing away with that bete-noir of the fashionably dressed, the 'vpl' or visible panty line). Jean Muir is often to be found looking frail and elegant in her own cashmere line - navy-blue, of course. Mary Wesley, the novelist, rates cashmere sweaters an essential part of her wardrobe and, for a lesson in how to sling cashmere artlessly round the shoulders, take a look at Miranda Richardson in the film Damage. Never mind the plot; take in Miranda Richardson's wardrobe if you really want to know how the well-heeled and well-born dress - all soft greys and oatmeals, understated and simple but effortlessly classy. Cashmere is one of the all-time desirable fibres - the Rolls-Royce, if you like, of the fashion world - so it is not surprising that those with the wherewithal to buy it are so often to be found clad in it. The good news for the rest of us is that though cashmere will never be cheap, it is now more accessibly-priced than it has been for many years. Those who bought cashmere in the high-spending 1980s will remember only too well how prices spiralled upwards. As the Chinese, who control Mongolia and thus the chief source of the highest-quality goat fibre, decentralised the market and flirted with a little uncontrolled free-enterprise, they got their fingers badly burnt. Mongolian goatherders began selling whatever fibres they could to whomever would pay most. So high-cost knitwear of variable quality began to hit world markets just as the recession began to bite, the Gulf War eroded confidence and tourists stopped being tourists. Retailers who had become accustomed, rather like British house-owners, to thinking that their hoard of butter-soft cashmere was an asset that could only go up and up got a rude awakening when the public seemed to say, as one, 'enough is enough' and the sweaters on the shelves started gathering dust. Today, quality has again become controlled, the flow of imported sweaters of poor quality has lessened and best of all, prices are at least 20 per cent down on even a couple of years ago. The result is that in the chic shops in London's Burlington Arcade women's roll-neck sweaters today sell for about Pounds 142, whereas two years ago they cost Pounds 40 more. Classic Professor Higgins cardigans which used to cost Pounds 292 now sell for Pounds 63 less. And all through the cashmere world the story is repeated. Good quality cashmere, according to Andrew McRobb, marketing director of Pringle of Scotland, is easily recognised. It should have a 'slight lustre and a melt-in-the-hands feel. It should have a softness of touch all over. Too much material in the seams, particularly inside, can spoil the overall appeal. And there should be a smooth, not clumpy, finish on the neck. Desirable, too, is strengthening under the arms.' Few people dispute that Scottish cashmere is tops - the combination of selecting only the finest yarns, the water from the burns (used for washing and treating the yarn) and a design policy based on proper classics meant that for years their products sold in droves. But hard times are famously effective for causing even the most solid of companies to rethink its strategy. These days many of the best Scottish companies have hired top designers to update their ranges. The result is cashmere used for such sassy numbers as long sarong skirts, skinny vests, sweatpants, leggings and all the other essential components of the fashionable woman's wardrobes. Names to look out for are Ballantyne (which hired Alastair Blair and Oscar de la Renta), Jean Muir (who has always loved cashmere and has her own designs made up in the Borders) and Belinda Robertson (if in Edinburgh visit her showroom at 22 Palmerston Place). McGeorge, which is Dawson International's most luxurious label, produces some wonderfully desirable smoking jackets and heavy-ribbed cardigans for men. Another good label is TSE Cashmere, which has made a huge effort to upgrade and stabilise its quality and which manages to deliver cashmere at prices lower than anybody else. This it does by doing everything itself - from owning the goat farms in Northern China to combing and spinning the yarn, as well as manufacturing the finished product. Part of the secret of its good prices is that it is not trying to do everything - it has a limited but fashionable range of designs and has pared colours down to the season's current fashionable shades, not pretending to offer the wide range that a company such as Pringle might stock. Devra King is its resident designer and for spring she is combining cashmere and silk and, for summer, pure silk. Coming up soon is a range based on the currently hot notion of layering - pure silk 'poor-boy' ribs are topped by cardigans and vests in various lengths, some cropped, some waist-length, some extra long. Look out for TSE's six-ply vest with a ribbed front (Pounds 155) and long mid-calf vests (Pounds 299) which can be worn over wide pants (Pounds 275). No longer just for the pearls and twinset brigade, cashmere these days is high fashion. Harvey Nichols, of Knightsbridge, London SW1,has the most complete range of TSE cashmere but it can also be found in Harrods, Browns, Fortnum &amp; Mason, Matches of Wimbledon, Coral of Belfast, Pollyanna of Barnsley and Andy Hanson of Ilkley, Yorkshire. In the meantime, if you are not looking for high fashion but just want simple classics then Brora sells double cashmere jumpers and cardigans by mail order at excellent prices. Simple round neck sweaters for men and women in sizes ranging from 36 in to 50 in are just Pounds 99.50 each. They come in tartan green, navy blue, garnet red, black and burgundy. Cardigans and polo necks for women, sizes 36 in to 44 in, are the same price same colours. For men, sizes range from 42 in to 50 in; the price is again the same. V-necked cardigans for men are Pounds 124, sizes 40 in to 50 in and come in navy, zephyr, burgundy and tartan green. Write or telephone Brora, 25 Parthenia Road, London SW6 (tel: 071-731-7672).</p>

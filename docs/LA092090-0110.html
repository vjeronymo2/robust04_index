			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BONDS JOINS DAD'S CLUB; PIRATES LEAD BY 1 GAME  </P> <P> Barry Bonds joined a club his father made famous, Doug Drabek became the  National League's first 20-game winner and the Pittsburgh Pirates staggered  home in first place Wednesday.  </P> <P> With Bonds hitting two home runs, Drabek went into the eighth inning at Chicago  breezing with a four-hitter with an 8-1 lead.  </P> <P> But nothing comes easily these days for the Pirates, who barely ended their  six-game losing streak, outlasting the Cubs, 8-7.  </P> <P> The Pirates lead the NL East by one game over the New York Mets and by five  over Montreal. The Mets-Expos game at New York was rained out, and they will  play a doubleheader today.  </P> <P> Bonds' two home runs put him in the club for players who have hit 30 home runs  and stolen 30 bases in the same season. Bonds' father, Bobby, did it five  times.  </P> <P> The Pirates, who play nine of their last 13 games at home, emerged from a  hitting slump in the two games at Chicago, but the bullpen problem is not  solved. They had 17 hits in this game.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh, by beating the Mets three consecutive games in early September,  built a 3 1/2-game lead. But when the hitters slumped, so did the relievers.  </P> <P> Lack of confidence in his bullpen prompted Jim Leyland to extend several  starters. He didn't take Drabek (20-6) out until he gave up a walk, a double  and two singles in the eighth inning.  </P> <P> Leyland brought in Ted Power, who gave up a single to Andre Dawson and a  three-run home run to rookie left fielder Derrick May. Bob Patterson came along  to get the last four outs.  </P> <P> "I had butterflies until the last out," Manager Jim Leyland said. "Maybe the  scare is what we need to settle us down.  </P> <P> "But I haven't gotten on the players because they've given me 100%. I feel  confident we're going to win this thing."  </P> <P> The near collapse tempered the enthusiasm for the milestones of Bonds and  Drabek.  </P> <P> "Dad said to go for it," said Bonds, who stole his 49th base. "He said if I  could hit .300 I could hit 30 home runs."  </P> <P> Drabek is the first Pirate to win 20 since John Candelaria in 1977.  </P> <P> "I'm 12-2 since the All-Star break," Drabek said. "I told myself to start  throwing your breaking ball and throw it for strikes. Build your confidence and  take it from there."  </P> <P> Rick Sutcliffe (0-2), making only his fifth start after missing most of the  season because of shoulder surgery, had his poorest outing. He retired only two  batters, giving up five hits and four runs.  </P> <P> Atlanta 5, San Francisco 1 -- The Reds may be sliding, but the Giants can't do  anything about it.  </P> <P> Rookie Dave Justice hit a double and his 26th home run at Atlanta, and the  Braves handed the Giants their fifth loss in the last six games.  </P> <P> Rookie Steve Decker's first major league home run provided the only run off Tom  Glavine (9-11).  </P> <P> The defending NL champions are 7 1/2 games out with 13 left.  </P> <P> The Giant hitters are struggling. Matt Williams is 0 for 23. Kevin Mitchell  also is in a slump. The Giants have 11 runs in six games on the trip and are  batting .182.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 8, St. Louis 4 -- Wes Chamberlain hit his first home run and Dale  Murphy hit a two-run shot at St. Louis to give the Phillies their third victory  in a row.

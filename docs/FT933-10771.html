			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: Northwest restructuring continues to hit profits NORTHWEST Airlines, the fourth-largest US carrier, suffered a Dollars 135.2m after-tax loss for the second quarter, after taking a charge of nearly Dollars 100m linked to its financial restructuring. However, Mr John Dasburg, president, said the restructuring had resulted in new agreements with labour unions and financial accords which 'substantially reduce our operating costs and restructure our debt and other financial commitments to manageable levels'. The company now had one of the most competitive cost-structures of all US airlines, he said. The results were announced after members of the flight attendants' union had ratified the agreement, under which Northwest has stayed out of the bankruptcy courts, clearing the last hurdle to acceptance of the plan. Northwest returned to profit at the operating level in the second three months, with Dollars 19.7m, as turnover climbed 7 per cent to Dollars 2.1bn and operating costs slipped 0.6 per cent. Other expenses of Dollars 101m led to a loss of Dollars 81.3m before the restructuring charge and a tax credit of Dollars 45.4m. The net loss for the period, of Dollars 135.2m, compared with a loss of Dollars 146m a year ago, when the company had reported a Dollars 77.6m tax credit.</p>

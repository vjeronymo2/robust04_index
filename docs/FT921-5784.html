			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Life, the universe and everything: The Earth Summit is preparing a mighty agenda, but some critics doubt it will address the right questions The Earth Summit - the ultimate in global get-togethers  - is still more than three months away. But the next few weeks should determine whether this grandly named event lives up to its billing of saving the planet for future generations. Dozens of delegations from all round the world are in New York for a final, gruelling five-week preparatory meeting. The intention is that they should draw up an agenda for the summit and agree to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on a massive environmental rescue plan. Their achievements will be put before the Earth Summit itself in Rio de Janeiro in June - an occasion to which the heads of state or government of 166 countries have been invited. Will they succeed? The Earth Summit is not a clear winner. Its aims are worthy, not to say timely, and clearly reflect mounting global unease about the environment - possibly the first issue ever to unite most of the planet's inhabitants. (Some 3,000 environmental lobby groups will be attending Rio too.) But the enormous scale of its ambitions has already provoked the sceptics to wonder whether it will turn out to be more than a giant jamboree. There is also doubt about some of the more alarming-sounding ecological premises on which it is built, and some observers wonder whether it is even addressing the right issues. One way to get a sense of the Earth Summit is by visiting a grand but rather faded mansion on the leafy outskirts of Geneva where a group of United Nations officials has been labouring on the preparations for the last two years. Here, in an annexe, stands a pile of reports four feet high, containing 15,000 pages of submissions from 105 countries. This is the raw material for the summit, listing all these countries' green worries, and what want done about them. According to Mr Lars Hyttinen, a Finn who has had the unenviable job of ploughing his way through the reports, they contain the clear message: 'The world is on the wrong track.' Wherever you look, people are worried about the land, the air, the water. They want urgent action to safeguard natural resources and deal with the environmental damage caused by poverty as much as by industrialisation. But while the message may be clear, the evolution of the Earth Summit idea has been far from straightforward. What began as a plan to convene a historic gathering to clean up the world has evolved into an enormous and highly complex exercise in global economics. Political squabbling has also taken its toll: an important initiative to save the rain forests has fallen by the wayside because nobody can agree on who is really to blame for their destruction (all documents now refer only to 'forests'). And while officials in Geneva have costed their plan at a staggering Dollars 125bn a year for the foreseeable future, no one has yet promised to foot more than a small fraction of this bill. The centrepiece of the summit will be an 'Earth Charter' which will commit signatories to restore and protect the world's ecology. This will be backed by detailed plans for action. The main one will be Agenda 21, an 800-page list of tasks extending into the 21st century. There will also be conventions to prevent climate change, and to protect the diversity of the world's living things. Mr Maurice Strong, the Canadian organiser of the summit, has been touring the world trying to drum up support, and urge political leaders to attend. 'For years we have been trying to get the attention of the world leaders,' he says. 'Now we have got them, we mustn't miss the opportunity. If Rio were to break down, picking up the threads would be very time-consuming.' But even now, Mr Strong's guest list has some conspicuous gaps in it. While government heads in many industrialised countries like Britain, Germany and Japan have told him they will come, President Bush has yet to say yes. Without the US, the world's greatest source of greenhouse gases but also of clean-up money, the event could well be a flop. One reason why the Earth Summit has assumed such enormous proportions is that Mr Strong and his colleagues believe that it must tackle not just the symptoms of environmental damage, but the causes. It is not merely a matter of cleaning the world up, they argue, but also of ensuring that the summit agrees on a pattern of economic growth that will avoid causing fresh damage in the future. This has widened the Rio agenda to include a whole set of measures to encourage what has come to be known as 'sustainable growth'. These are aimed principally at the industrialised countries whose wasteful use of resources is blamed not just for damaging the environment, but also for denuding Third World countries of their natural riches. However, the whole thrust of the debate has moved well beyond the role played by advanced countries and into the realm of north-south relations. Virtually all the documents that have been prepared for the New York meeting stress the need for huge transfers of funds and technology from the richer to the poorer countries to enable them to deal with their environmental problems. This is based partly on the view that the industrial countries are responsible for much of the damage that has been done to the Third World and should therefore pay for it. But in economic terms, UN officials argue that many of the world's gravest environmental problems result from poverty. Poor countries, living from hand to mouth, have to chop down trees and hack away the land simply to survive. They cannot afford to invest in new, environmentally friendly technology. Worst of all, the heavy burden of debt, and the protectionist barriers erected by the industrialised world prevent them from breaking out of their predicament. Even though the industrialised countries actually produce most of the pollution, Mr Strong maintains that investment in environmental controls in the Third World is potentially far more productive. He points to the example of China which wants to double its gross national product over the next 12 years, yet it has 750,000 old industrial boilers which belch smoke into the sky. Unless such problems are dealt with soon, 'by the next century the developing countries will be contributing more greenhouse gases than we are,' he warns. However, the emergence of Third World issues at the top of the Rio agenda has led to suggestions that the summit will merely dress up the old arguments for more aid in newly fashionable green-tinged garments. The numbers certainly reinforce this impression. The annual figure of Dollars 125bn produced by the Rio secretariat represents not the global clean-up bill, merely the amount of money needed by the Third World in the form of aid, debt forgiveness or technology transfers to achieve its green goals. At the moment, actual aid that falls into these categories amounts to Dollars 55bn, implying a need for some Dollars 70bn a year in new money. By any measure, the numbers look extravagant, and could jeopardise Rio simply through their size. They include, for example, Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m a year merely to operate an information exchange to channel details of green technology to the Third World - something that probably be done for a fraction of the cost. Mr Strong admits that the sums are large, and that he is asking for the money at a bad time from the recession-hit donors' point of view. But he says 'no one fainted or exploded' when he presented them to aid ministers. He has a lower set of figures for actual negotiating purposes, but he declines to discuss them. The actual amounts of money needed to make Rio a success are less important, he believes, than creating the necessary impact on world opinion, and bringing the issues alive. In particular, he says the industrial world must learn 'to make space' for the Third world. 'The absorptive capacity of the eco-system is being pre-empted by the north,' he warns. Donor countries will also have to be convinced that the ecological premises are as threatening as Mr Strong's team maintain that they are. For example, scientists have recently scaled back some of their more alarming forecasts about global warming. This has weakened the European Community's case for a carbon tax; it now seems unlikely that this will feature as strongly on the Rio agenda as was once thought, though Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC Environment Commissioner, is determined that the EC should be prepared to adopt measures that will set the right example. There is also a question whether the summit is even addressing the right questions. If Third World development has been identified as the most pressing problem, the Rio participants might do better to confront more relevant issues, such as the trade barriers and agricultural subsidies by which rich countries keep out exports from the Third World. If, on the other hand, global warming is the most urgent question, perhaps Rio should aim for a few specific measures to curb emissions, rather than go for the grand but possibly unachievable solutions. With such a mighty agenda before them, few of the participants are willing to speculate about the outcome at this stage. The European Community, one of the few to have come out with a position paper in advance of the New York meeting, accepts that developed countries have 'a special responsibility' to encourage sustainable growth. It also agrees that more money should be given to the Third World, though it opposes the creation of any new agencies to disburse it. Japan is also making supportive noises, and will be chairing an informal meeting of eminent international persons in Tokyo next month to discuss ways of raising new money. But Japan is believed to have asked that marine mammals are not included in the summit because of its controversial whaling activities. The biggest uncertainty remains the US position. In the coming weeks, President Bush will come under intense pressure from the environment lobby to declare support for the summit. But politically, that could ensnare him into commitments to introduce severe emission-curbing measures. The US has already been accused by the Worldwide Fund for Nature and Greenpeace of dragging its feet in negotiations for the convention on climate change. What the New York meeting should show are the limits to what is realistically achievable in Rio. The secretariat has deliberately set a highly ambitious agenda to drive home the scale of the problem. But it also risks overwhelming the participants with issues and costs. The result will almost certainly be consensus on the need for action, though there will be differences on how much and by whom. The chief issue, as always, will be money. But the secretariat has made clear that it will be satisfied with promises rather than signed cheques. Mr Joe Wheeler, the director in charge of financial matters, says: 'We are looking for less than pledges of new money, but for more than generalities. What we want is a credible statement of intentions.'</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Foreign investment seenas key to future of Russia STIMULATING an increase in private foreign investment is the key to restoring prosperity in Russia and other former Soviet republics, senior World Bank officials indicated yesterday. Mr Wilfried Thalwitz, bank vice-president for Europe and central Asia, said public sector agencies such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund could provide a substantial share of the external financing needs of eastern European economies. But they were unlikely to be able to meet more than about 15 per cent of the needs of the former Soviet Union. 'The aim is to create conditions that quickly lead to large and increasing flows of private capital. This must play a predominant role in the medium term,' said Mr Russ Cheetham, the bank's director of operations in former Soviet republics. However, at present, private equity inflows were less than Dollars 500m for all republics combined, a 'miniscule' figure relative to their needs. Hungary, by contrast, had already attracted about Dollars 1.5bn in private inflows. The Russian oil industry was one of the sectors most in need of foreign investment and expertise. The sector's total capital needs were about Dollars 25bn. Mr Thalwitz said the bank planned to lend about Dollars 5bn to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in fiscal 1993, more than twice the total for last year. Some of the planned loans, however, were conditional on countries agreeing IMF programmes. The bank was earmarking Dollars 2bn-Dollars 2.2bn for Russia and other republics in fiscal 1993, which began in July. Loans to former Soviet republics could rise towards Dollars 4bn-Dollars 5bn in future years but no precise targets had been set. Mr Thalwitz said risks for lenders were considerable. 'I see a lot of hesitation and social tension that will slow' reform efforts. However, the bank hoped eventually for a return on its investments. He said none of what were the centrally planned economies was likely to regain pre-reform levels of output before the end of the century. In some cases, the output decline would reach 40 per cent before a recovery began.</p>

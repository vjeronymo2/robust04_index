			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (1): A leap across fallen barriers - The single market is not a panacea for the problems of Europe. But with the right policies, hope will be restored in the east and in the west THE European Community's single market, born at the start of this year, is an old idea, superimposed upon a continent jolted into several new directions at once. Allowing goods, people, services and capital to flow around an area accounting for about one quarter of world economic output marks a giant step forward for the EC. Breaking down Europe's barriers fulfils the concept set out in the 1957 Treaty of Rome of forming a genuine common market. The single market programme is enshrined in the Single European Act, which came into effect in 1987. Launching measures with the effect of increasing competition and building a more homogeneous EC business environment has already produced some harsh effects - not least in contributing to plant closures and layoffs as companies try to concentrate their EC operations in the most efficient or low-cost centres. The programme as a whole, however, is a recipe for growth. European industry as a whole faces a grave problem of deteriorating international competitiveness - particularly in comparison with the newly industrialising countries of the Pacific rim, which have been making large inroads into EC markets. As part of a strategy of overcoming this drawback, European governments and legislators have accomplished a victory of Community-mindedness over national interests - and have put into place a powerful springboard to help cope the EC with the economic challenges of the 1990s. Some important areas are still to be dealt with, for instance in energy, telecommunications and transport. An imperfect solution has been found over the vexed question of creating a unified system for collecting value added tax across the continent. Additionally, partly because of controversy over immigration pressures - touched off by the conflict in former Yugoslavia, as well as upheaval elsewhere in the world - some controls remain in force on people crossing EC borders, particularly at airports. None the less, roughly 95 per cent of the liberalisation measures outlined in 1985 have been established as EC legislation, extending to the main fields of industry, public procurement and financial services. The Community seems unlikely to embark upon a new phase of large-scale legislation to clear up exemptions. But it has set itself a goal during the next few years not only of completing the single market agenda, but also of making it work. The EC now has a market-place. There is a long way to go, however, before we have a single Europe. The ructions during 1992 over the Maastricht treaty underlined that consensus is far from complete on future political and economic integration. The road to economic and monetary union (Emu) - which many top European politicians, though not quite so many leading businessmen  -have always regarded as essential for bringing the single market to maturity - is now strewn with more obstacles than seemed apparent a year ago. After the autumn exchange rate turbulence, a large question mark also hangs over the future of the European monetary system. Yet, the single market process of harmonising regulations and laws on products, trade, traffic and people has placed the EC firmly on the road to supranationalism. Neither the Single European Act nor Maastricht sets down a blueprint for a federal European state. But member countries now recognise that a formal renunciation of sovereignty in important areas once held to be the prerogative of nation-states, and a pooling of resources and powers, can maximise benefits for all. The single market's period of gestation has coincided, in the east of the continent, with the death of communism. But capitalism's triumph is by no means unmitigated. After the excitement and euphoria generated by the breakdown of the east-west divide and the ending of the cold war, Europe is weathering a phase of dourness and doubt. Last year's controversies over Maastricht exposed a disquieting gap between politicians and voters over the speed and direction of European development. The swing to fringe extremist parties in many countries during the past 12 months is a symptom of some deeper pressures - among others, mounting unemployment, now standing at around 16m throughout the EC. Europe's task for 1993 is thus to show it can successfully manage a highly difficult period of transition. There are three immediate challenges. First, businesses and individuals have to show they can maximise the chances offered by the single market, in spite of the most severe economic downturn for 10 years in western Europe, and a deep restructuring crisis in the east. Placing the rules of the single market on to the statute book was difficult, but making them work will be more onerous still. The EC will also have to ensure fair and equitable enforcement. Second, the EC has to progress towards the goal of a wider Europe. The Community's decision at the Edinburgh summit to start EC entry negotiations this month with Austria, Finland and Sweden, reversing the previous agreement to wait for ratification of Maastricht in all 12 states, is an encouraging sign that the momentum of enlargement can be maintained. The rejection last month by Switzerland - the EC's second most important trading partner, after the US - of the plan for a free trade area between the EC and the European Free Trade Association (Efta) was a blow, but not a disaster. The EC's single market encompasses 344m people. The European Economic Area, which will now come into effect in the second half of the year, about six months later than planned, will unite a population of 370m people, including all the other six Efta states apart from Switzerland. The three Efta states starting accession negotiations this month may join by 1995. The third challenge concerns the east of the continent. Even on the most optimistic assumptions, the former communist countries of eastern and central Europe will have to wait beyond the year 2000 until they can join the EC. In partnership with the new administration in Washington, the EC will have to redouble efforts to prevent chaos across the former communist bloc from sparking off more generalised disruption in Europe. In 1992, the EC's inability to stop, or even significantly influence, the war in formerYugoslavia painfully illustrated the limits of the EC's fledgling foreign policy. In 1993, the difficulties caused by economic dislocation and political fragmentation in the east could become still worse if the European economy slides into full-scale recession. The economic clouds over the continent are all the more disquieting because, in theory at least, the approach of the single market should have blown them away. When EC governments negotiated the concept in 1985, the single market programme was viewed as a sizeable boost to trade and investment. An optimistic report published in 1988 under the aegis of Mr Paolo Cecchini, a senior Commission official, forecast that the single market would increase EC gross national product by 4.5 per cent over the medium term. It would also, according to the report's conclusions, dampen inflation, improve countries' budget positions, lower external deficits and create 1.8m new jobs over the longer term. Anticipation of the single market undoubtedly speeded up trade and investment during the second half of the 1980s, illustrated particularly by a spate of cross-border acquisitions and mergers. Growth was also accelerated by the boom in Germany in 1989-91 caused first by the collapse of the Berlin Wall and then by reunification. EC experts now reckon that 30 per cent of the forecast effect of the single market programme may already have worked its way through to the European economy. The fillip to western growth at the end of the 1980s explains why many of the controversial proposals of the Single European Act - in contrast to those in the Maastricht treaty - did not attract undue opposition in parliaments and public opinion. The economic expansion in the late 1980s also helps explain why the EC, shrugging off a decade of drift after the first oil crisis in 1973, suddenly became a burning source of hope and prosperity for the eastern half of the continent. Now, however, high German interest rates and the post-unification difficulties faced by the German economy have thrown a pall over the landscape. With the dissipation of the positive economic effects of the late 1980s, the EC - and those outside who see it as a beacon of light in a dark world - have had to scale down their expectations for the 1990s. The single market is not a panacea for Europe's problems. Yet, if governments adopt the right policies to end the recession, it provides the best route towards stability and prosperity later in the 1990s - for both halves of the continent.</p>

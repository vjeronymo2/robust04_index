			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Other economic news Monday: If the City consensus is any guide, Britain's trade deficit with non-European Union countries in October should be barely changed from September's Pounds 349m shortfall. However, the Pounds 350m average forecast reflects estimated deficits ranging from Pounds 200m to Pounds 500m, leaving room for surprises. In Italy, provisional November figures are expected to show subdued consumer price inflation of 3.7 per cent, increasing prospects that the annual rate will fall below 3.5 per cent early in 1995. Thursday: The Bundesbank council is expected to leave credit policy unchanged when it meets in Frankfurt. During the week: German money supply growth, as measured by annualised and seasonally adjusted M3 based on last year's fourth quarter, is expected to slow in October to 7.3 per cent from September's 7.8 per cent. German federal states will be reporting November cost of living indices. Preliminary returns for western Germany are expected to show a slight weakening of the year-on-year inflation rate to 2.7 per cent this month from 2.8 per cent in October.</p>

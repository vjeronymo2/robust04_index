			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Labour bolsters election strategy Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, yesterday announced the formation of a team of 18 backbench MPs to help build the party's campaigning strategy for the next general election. In a bid to strengthen Labour's membership and activities, Mr Prescott said the team would promote local campaign initiatives and political education. The announcement came as the party's national membership crossed the 300,000 mark. According to Labour officials the membership has risen by more than 56,000 since Mr Tony Blair's election as leader in July and by more than 76,000 in the past 12 months. At a press conference at Westminster yesterday, Mr Prescott said the party was on target to have more than 500,000 members at the next general election. He said: 'Although the Tories go from bad to worse, with crisis heaped on crisis, the Labour party knows that we should not just rely on the Tory party to lose by-elections or the general election. 'We have to keep working to present positive messages about the Labour party and to develop the policies on which we will fight the next election.' The campaigning team is to be led by Ms Bridget Prentice, MP for Lewisham, and will be directly responsible to Mr Blair and Mr Prescott. Mr Alan Milburn, MP for Darlington, will co-ordinate the party's campaigns on Treasury affairs and Mr Mick Clapham, MP for Barnsley, will be responsible for trade and industry. Earlier this year Mr Prescott made clear that one of his main roles as deputy leader would be to boost the party's membership and campaigning. The party is still well behind the Conservatives, who have a national membership of about 750,000.</p>

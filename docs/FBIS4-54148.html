			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh -- Cambodia's Finance Minister Sam  Rangsi says he may be sacked but will never resign from his  cabinet post.    Rangsi confirmed on Tuesday that he would not quit Cabinet,  but was not sure if he would be forced into it.    "I may be dismissed. But that is another problem, anything  can happen. The decision to fire me does no depend on me. So I  cannot forecast," the minister told THE NATION.    Rangsi, known for his outspoken views and hard work, was  responding to a report that he would resign as the finance  minister. It is said he is unable to implement economic  development policies due to lack of support from other officials  who adhere to outdated rules and work methods, and resist  change. Reports suggested that the Cambodian cabinet would be  reshuffled soon after government leaders complete scheduled  peace talks with the Khmer Rouge starting in North Korea  tomorrow.    The ministers likely to be affected by the reshuffle are  Ministers of Defence Gen. Tie Banh and Gen. Tea Chamrat,  Minister of Foreign Affairs Prince Norodom Sirivut and Rangsi,  both from the Funcinpec Party.    Prince Sirivut has been close to Rangsi, who is involved in  a  running dispute with a firm, named as the Thai Bunrung Company,  which is run by a Teng Bunma. The company's owner is said to be  very close to the First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh,  leader of the Funcinpec Party.    Rangsi, however, says he has a growing number of supporters  for his work. He said he kept telling his colleagues and  officials to not only do good when going to a temple, but also  to do good deeds at the office, to serve the people and the poor.    "I am very faithful to my direct boss, Prince Ranariddh. And  I won't change parties. I can be very efficient in my party so  there's no need to find another party or look for another  president of the Funcinpec. I would like to help my boss  strengthen the party," he said.    "I am satisfied with my performance as a whole. I would like  to move faster, but there are many difficulties and constraints,  which force me to move slowly. My economic reform has threatened  the personal interests of many and they are powerful. Such  people do not want to give up their position," he said.    He added that he supports King Norodom Sihanouk's proposal  to  amend the constitution so that the Khmer Rouge can join the  government. The constitution currently stipulates that  government posts must be given to elected members of the  National Assembly.    Rangsi said he would be happy to have the Khmer Rouge as his  colleagues in the Finance Ministry instead of seeing them in the  jungle. "I expect positive signs from the roundtable talks  scheduled for May 27," he said.</p>

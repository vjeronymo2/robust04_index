The poll results, released Friday [11 February], showed that  67.6 percent of those interviewed replied "no" when asked if  they had decided which party they will support, while only 32.4  percent said they had. The highest percentage of undecided was  among women between the ages of 35 and 54, fluctuating between  73 and 75 percent in different municipalities.    "The results show a high level of confusion among Italian  voters and allow us to affirm undeniably that the percentages of  support attributed to various parties or alliances are totally  unreliable because, by referring to only one third of the  electorate, they are scientifically unfounded," Directa stated,  referring to polls that claimed Go Italy [Forza Italia], led by  entrepreneur Paolo Berlusconi, topped the ratings with 24  percent.    The number of undecided voters, Directa said, was the  highest  reported in the last 15 years just six weeks away from elections.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lufthansa Chief Juergen Weber by Stefan </F> Baron and Andreas Werb; place and date not given: "AUA Firmly  Linked With Swissair"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] To  increase revenues, you need partners on the global aviation  market. The most important cooperation project -- that with  United Airlines -- is, however, still uncertain.    [Weber] Since the signing of the partnership agreement,  United and Lufthansa have cooperated well in many fields, but  the joint flights cannot be organized because the Americans are  blocking the aviation agreement.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] When will Washington finally give the  go-ahead?    [Weber] I would love to know that. Unfortunately, over the  past few days, the Americans have placed new obstacles in our  path.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] What kind of obstacles?    [Weber] Basically, the only issue that is stil contentious  is the so-called third country code sharing. The Americans --  above all, American and Delta Airlines -- want to make joint  flights beyond Germany with East European airlines, such as  Poland's LOT, Hungary's Malev, or Aeroflot, and in unlimited  numbers.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Which you cannot accept?    [Weber] No, this would set us back again on the path toward  equal treatment. The fact that American and Delta may conduct  such code sharing is fine with me, but not in greater numbers  than we and United are permitted. Anything else is blackmail.</p>

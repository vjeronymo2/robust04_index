			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Risks of too much hot air THERE IS no such thing as a free breath. This is the point behind the debate on global warming at the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, starting next week. Anything that comes free of charge will be used to excess. So it is not difficult to accept, in principle, that as human activity increases, so will the costs of treating the air as if it were free. The difficulty is knowing how, and how far, to turn that principle into practice. The starting point must be the nature of the risks and the costs of reducing them. The latest World Development Report from the World Bank reports scientific estimates that mean global temperature might rise by between 1.5' and 4.5' Celsius, with a best guess of 2.5', as a result of the doubling of greenhouse gases above their pre-industrial concentrations. But the cost has been estimated at only about 1 per cent of US gross domestic product. This seems to be much ado about nothing. Things are not that simple. As Bill Cline points out in his study of global warming for the Washington-based Institute for International Economics, the doubling of greenhouse gases is expected to occur in the first half of the next century. But global warming is continuous. He offers a central estimate for global warming of 10' Celsius by 2300, with an upper limit of 18'. Six per cent of GDP is his best guess of the economic cost, with 20 per cent at most. More important, such a world would be radically - perhaps horribly - different from today's. Nevertheless, even with a low rate of discount, the case for strong action is not overwhelming. Nor, given the time scale, is it overwhelmingly urgent. But a benevolent and risk-averse global dictator would, undoubtedly, want to slow the build up of greenhouse gases, while mounting further studies of the risks. Carbon tax In a world with a multitude of very different states, reaching even so limited a decision requires much debate. The Rio summit is an excellent place to start. But the European Community's on-and-off-again carbon tax shows what is in store. A carbon tax is the right kind of policy. That said, the proposed tax of Dollars 10 a barrel would make little difference to the consumption of a commodity already taxed, on average, more than five times as heavily in the EC. Nor can much be said in favour of a tax that exempts the most energy-intensive industries. In short, the EC tax was a gesture. Now EC ministers have decided not to make that gesture. As a result, the EC's environment commissioner, Mr Ripa di Meana, has decided to make one himself, by not going to Rio. This may be farcical, but the EC has at least stirred things up. It has also shown how hard it will be to reach international agreements. The lesson applies globally, but more so. Hard issues The issues are hard. First, the setting of uniform targets for emissions cannot make sense in a world of radically different countries. Second, no global compact can be agreed and enforced that does not redress the grossly unequal use of the atmosphere. Last but not least, stabilising carbon dioxide emissions will hurt. The World Bank suggests starting with a modest precautionary policy, focusing on research into global warming, the elimination of subsidies to wasteful energy use and the development of renewable energy resources. Afforestation would be part of such a strategy. So would higher taxes on the use of fossil fuels. Should the dangers become clearer, property rights in carbon dioxide emission would need to be agreed, enforced and traded. But these would entail large redistributions of income. According to the World Development Report, the industrial world would have had to pay the developing countries Dollars 70bn to purchase 1988's level of emission, if the right had been sold at Dollars 25 per ton of carbon. In the long run, air could become expensive. The political reaction to that possibility has been illustrated by this week's EC imbroglio over the carbon tax. But Rio is only a first step. If something like the World Bank's precautionary programme were implemented now, along with intensified debate, leading in the long run to property rights in the atmosphere, Rio would be a breakthrough.</p>

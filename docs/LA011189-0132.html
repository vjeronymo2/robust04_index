			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RILEY SAYS CUTS HURT BIG PROJECTS  </P> <P> Kicking off his 1-year term as chairman of the Board of Supervisors, Thomas F.  Riley said Tuesday that citizen-backed tax-and-spending restrictions have left  county government behind schedule on such construction and repair of projects  as the airport, roads and bridges.  </P> <P> "We learned . . . as a result of Proposition 13 and the Gann initiative that we  would have to do more with less," Riley said. When combined with cutbacks from  the state and federal government, he added, "the unfortunate result is that  many critical public works projects were put on hold."  </P> <P> "The county's major infrastructure systems have met their breaking point, and  Orange County residents have suffered as a result," said Riley, who was named  chairman of the board last week, a position that rotates among the five  supervisors at the beginning of every year.  </P> <P> Riley, beginning his 15th year on the board, is the county's senior supervisor  and is serving his fourth term as board chairman.  </P> <P> "We may be a bit bruised by some of the sobering realities of the '80s," Riley  said. "However, we have developed significant tools for dealing with the  challenges and have cleared sizable hurdles toward gaining the information and  expertise needed to move forward -- in a positive manner -- into the 1990s."  </P> <P> Riley highlighted the county's accomplishments in several areas of service,  such as the creation of new parks, managed development, traffic reduction,  renovation of the airport and planning for new jails.  </P> <P> "I look forward to 1989 as being the year that Orange County turned 100 and the  year that we made our forefathers proud by grappling head on with problems and  reaching timely and workable solutions," he said.  </P></p>

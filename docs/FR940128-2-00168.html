After granting of that approval, a national non-governmental organization is eligible to register with the CITES Secretariat to participate in the COP as an observer. Requests for such approval should include evidence of technical qualification in protection, conservation or management of wild fauna and flora, on the part of both the organization and the individual representative. Organizations previously approved by the Service shall submit a request but do not need to provide as detailed information concerning their qualifications as those seeking approval for the first time. Organizations seeking approval for the first time should detail their experience in the protection, conservation, or management of wild fauna and/or flora, as well as their purposes for wishing to participate in the COP as an observer. Such requests should be sent to the Office of Management Authority (OMA; see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , above). Upon approval by OMA, an organization will receive instructions for registration with the CITES Secretariat in Switzerland. Any organization requesting approval for observer status at COP9 will be added to the Service's CITES Mailing List, and will receive copies of all future  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notices and other information pertaining to COP9. A list of organizations approved for COP9 observer status will be available from OMA just prior to COP9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Meetings and Notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CITES Secretariat has notified the Parties that they must submit by June 10, 1994 any draft resolutions, other documents for consideration, proposals to register the first commercial captive-breeding operation for an Appendix I animal species, and proposed amendments to the Appendices.

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (26): Little-known premier - Profile of Jan Olszewski POLAND'S Prime Minister Jan Olszewski is little known outside his country's borders. The rather crumpled-looking, 61-year-old lawyer, with bushy eyebrows spent most of his life doggedly opposing communism and defending as best he could the civil and human rights of those condemned in the courts of the communist regime. It was thanks to people like him that Poland managed to blunt the impact of Soviet domination after the war. His biography is a very Polish one, even to the extent that until his first visit to Italy shortly after becoming prime minister he had never travelled abroad. He was born in Warsaw, the son of a railwayman in a home whose traditions were strongly linked to the country's socialist movement. During the war he joined the scout-based resistance and went on to study law. In 1956, during the 'October liberalisation' which followed the death of Stalin he wrote for the Po Prostu weekly, the reform movement's mouthpiece. In the 1960s he embarked on a career as a lawyer. He defended a long list of dissidents, many of whom are now his political opponents. In those years he brought his natural eloquence to bear with equal passion on judges in city courts and minor officials in dusty local tribunals in cases where sentences were fixed in advance and the defence spoke more to succour the accused than to affect the verdict. This impressively single-minded pursuit of justice in what seemed hopeless circumstances was the domain of only a handful of the legal profession at the time. In 1968, after the student riots, it led to Mr Olszewski's temporary suspension from the bar. His determination was accompanied by a passion for politics. His secret vehicle was the Polish Independence Agreement, a small think-tank he helped run between 1975 and 1980 with Mr Zdzislaw Najder, now his closest adviser. When the Solidarity alliance of workers, intellectuals and church burst upon the scene in 1980, Mr Olszewski helped to write the movement's statute and became an adviser during martial law. He also worked for the Polish bishops, forging links which mean that the influential Polish church is happy to support him at the head of the government. In 1984, he represented the family of the dissident priest Father Jerzy Popieluszko, murdered by secret police, at the trial of the killers. But in 1989, when Solidarity sat down with the communists to negotiate what later turned out to be a peaceful transfer of power, Mr Olszewski was critical of what he thought were too intimate links with the country's rulers. He argued that communists should be removed from positions of influence wherever possible and came to power with that demand at the top of his programme. But that promise, like the pledge that energetic steps would be taken to counter the economic recession, has been blunted by the realities of government. Once in power Mr Olszewski accepted that economic policies had to be conducted in agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which had at first been critical of his programmes. He also showed a pragmatic streak in dropping demands for widespread purges, arguing instead for a reform of the structures of power to eliminate the last vestiges of the communist system. Mr Olszewski can be tough when he choses to be. He refused to continue efforts to form a government early in 1991 when it became clear that President Walesa wanted to have a final say over every ministerial appointment. Now he faces another tussle with the President over who has authority over the armed forces.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The secretary of the General People's Committee for  Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation has summoned the  ambassadors of the UN Security Council permanent members,  accredited in the Great Jamahiriyah; he told them of the Great  Jamahiriyah's outrage at the wanton massacre carried out by the  Zionist occupiers inside the al-Ibrahimi holy shrine against  worshippers, the sons of the Palestinian Arab people.    The brother secretary of the General People's Committee for  Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation has asserted the  need for the UN Security Council to impose harsh sanctions on  the Zionist entity, not furnish it with any weapons and to  impose a blockade against it.    He stressed, moreover, that if the Council failed to take  any  of the abovementioned measures, such a failure would be seen an  encouragement for the Israelis to perpetrate further massacres  and annihilate the Palestinian Arab people.    The brother secretary has asked the ambassadors to convey  the  abovementioned protest to their respective governments.</p>

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / US economy faltering THE US economy has entered the new year with most indicators pointing to continued weakness. Despite the resurgent stock market, a series of economic statistics this week has pointed to faltering activity in November and December, and to a scarcity of confidence that coming months will show any swift upturn. The Commerce Department yesterday announced a 0.6 per cent increase in US manufacturers' orders in November, but the rise was slower than in October and left new orders lower than the level they reached this summer. The outlook for manufacturing remains clouded with doubt. The National Association of Purchasing Management, whose monthly survey provides a measure of prospects for the sector, said on Thursday that its index had fallen in December to its lowest level since May. Mr Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM business survey committee and director of corporate purchasing at Pitney Bowes, said manufacturers seemed to be waiting for new orders before expanding production, which would suggest a continuation of the economic malaise into the first quarter of 1992. Earlier, the Conference Board, the New York-based business analysis group, said its index of consumer confidence showed a further drop in December to remain at the lowest level for a decade, while the Commerce Department said its index of leading indicators, which combines a number of economic statistics to provide a composite gauge of the health of the economy, fell 0.3 per cent in November. The December leading indicators are likely to show an increase because of the recent sharp rise in share prices, which form part of the index. Economists cautioned, moreover, that these signals did not show any further deterioration in the economy beyond the weakness that prompted the Federal Reserve Board to cut its discount rate by a full percentage point last month to 3.5 per cent, the lowest since 1964. 'I don't have the sense from recent data that things are getting dramatically worse. We're in a long, slow, convalescing period unlike any business cycle of the past,' said Mr Richard Berner, director and economist at investment bank Salomon Brothers.</p>

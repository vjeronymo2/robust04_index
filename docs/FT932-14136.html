			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (11): Clever way to cut lead times - . . . For Just-in-time JUST-IN-TIME (Jit), also known as continuous flow production or kanban, is one of a group of techniques pioneered in Japan which have become associated with that country's reputation for quality manufacture. It implies essentially, that parts and components are only delivered to the production line or to the next stage in the manufacturing process when they are needed. There is no build up of inventory or work in progress. No need for fleets of fork-lift trucks to move materials around the factory. No progress chasers or quality control inspectors. There are obvious advantages; better space utilisation on the factory floor because there is no longer a need to store components; reduced cost of inventory and faster throughput. Organisations that use Jit typically report lead times cut by 75 per cent, inventory turn up 50 per cent and a 30 per cent saving in floor space. There are less obvious advantages as well. Manufacturers in the West frequently hold buffer stocks of components as an insurance against stoppages on the manufacturing line. In these circumstances there is less motivation to get to the root of the breakdown. When Jit methods are used, production stops if there is a breakdown and every engineer available is pressed into service to fix the problem. Product defects can be cut by up to 50 per cent as quality problems are relayed quickly back to operators. COMMUNICATIONS The essence of Jit is communication, but it does not need computer technology to work well. Indeed, in Japan an entirely manual set of procedures, which depend on a close and mutually beneficial relationship between supplier and manufacturer, is often the norm. Only now are some of the leading Japanese manufacturers beginning to use computers to manage throughput. There are good reasons for this; the output from Japanese factories tends to be more predictable than in a Western factory and suppliers to Japanese car manufacturers, for example, are often clustered geographically around the plant. It is easy but wrong to think of Jit as an inventory control system. It represents a whole manufacturing philosophy which makes manufacturing problems visible in a number of ways - by encouraging simpler factory layouts, for example, and by removing the slack in the system. The success that Japanese companies have achieved with Jit, a simple technique which requires little in the way of computer backup, speaks volumes about the difference between Japanese and Western manufacturing methods. The Western approach to date could best be described as big bucks, big bang. Western manufacturers exhibit a kind of machismo which encourages them to build elaborate, expensive computer-integrated manufacturing systems which run high risks of working poorly or not at all. A conventional Western approach is to use Material Resource Planning (MRPII), a generic name for software running on mainframe computers used to control manufacturing processes. It comprises a master production schedule, based on orders and forecasts, a bill of materials, inventory records and process plans. Up to 20 software modules may be involved. MRP II systems are dependent on the quality of input and inaccurate master plans, inventory records and lead times can be the result of poor data. Furthermore as a system, it does nothing to measure, manage or improve quality. The Japanese approach, on the other hand, emphasises total quality control where responsibility for preventing faults lies with the line worker and where defects can be measured in parts per million rather than the percentages typical of Western manufacture. Manufacturing experts, however, are now beginning to understand that Jit and MRP can be complementary. MRP is a complicated, planning system which works less than well when presented with inadequate information. Jit is a simple and effective control mechanisms at its best in repetitive, high volume manufacture, and not well suited to complex planning situations. Combined together it is possible to create systems flexible enough to handle medium or low volume production of a variety of different kinds of products. The overall aim of any manufacturing method like Jit is quality; that means aiming for zero defects in manufactured products. It starts from an understanding that defects are caused by management deficiencies rather than technological problems and therefore requires management commitment to change. Starting from the top, it is possible to instil a company-wide awareness of quality through employee ownership of the manufacturing process. Jit or kanban should not be used without due consideration of other quality processes pioneered or developed in Japan. These include kaisen or continuous improvement and poka-yoke or idiot-proofing - the idea of designing into a product measures which makes it difficult or impossible to use it wrongly. A computer operating system that allows a user to delete most of its important commands in error has not been designed according to poka-yoke principles.</p>

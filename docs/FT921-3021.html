			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / FT Law Report: No tax relief on magical loss ENSIGN TANKERS (LEASING) LTD v STOKES House of Lords (Lord Keith of Kinkel, Lord Brandon of Oakbrook, Lord Templeman, Lord Goff of Chieveley, Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle): March 12 1992 A PARTNERSHIP which enters into a tax avoidance scheme, with the object of obtaining first year allowance for expenditure on plant, is entitled to allowance in respect of that part of the transaction which can plainly be identified as a trading transaction, but not for that part which has the apparently magic result of creating a tax loss where there was no real loss. The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by Ensign Tankers (Leasing) Ltd from a Court of Appeal decision (FT, February 6 1991) to refer the case back to Inland Revenue Commissioners to weigh the fiscal and non-fiscal elements of a transaction and to decide whether, having regard to the parties' paramount motive, it was a device to secure a fiscal advantage or was a genuine trading activity. Section 41(1) of the Finance Act 1971 provides: ' . . . where (a) a person carrying on a trade incurs capital expenditure on . . . plant . . . for the purposes of the trade, and (b) . . . the . . . plant belongs to him at some time during the chargeable period . . . there shall be made to him an allowance . . . (referred to as a first year allowance) . . .' LORD TEMPLEMAN said that in March 1980 Lorimar Productions Incorporated (LPI), a Californian company, embarked on production of a film called Escape to Victory. Guinness Mahon, a merchant bank specialising in tax avoidance schemes, persuaded Ensign and four other British companies to participate in a scheme whereby they would contribute Dollars 3.25m to the cost of the film in return for 25 per cent of the exploitation receipts. The scheme was a single composite transaction embodied in 17 documents, all of which were dated July 14 1980. Under the scheme a partnership agreement was made between Victory Film Productions Ltd as general partner and the five British companies as limited partners. Victory was a wholly owned subsidiary of LPI. The partnership's capital was Dollars 3.25m contributed by the limited partners, including Dollars 2.378m contributed by Ensign. Management was in the hands of Victory. The partnership was granted worldwide exploitation rights by LPI, which was to make the film in Hungary, and transferred them to two distributors who were LPI subsidiaries. It put Pounds 3.25m into the production and borrowed Pounds 10.75m from LPI towards production and completion. LPI was to have no recourse against it for repayment. The distributors were to pay LPI 75 per cent of the exploitation receipts, and to pay the partnership 25 per cent up to Pounds 3.25m; then 100 per cent to LPI up to the cost of its loans; and then 25 per cent to the partnership, 75 per cent to be retained by the distributors. The cost of the film was Dollars 14m, and was borne as to Dollars 3.25m by the partnership and as to Dollars 10.75m by LPI. In the tax year 1980 to 1981 the partnership incurred capital expenditure of Dollars 3.25m in the provision of 'plant', namely the film. The negative belonged to the partnership, subject to the distributors' exclusive exploitation rights. It also owned 25 per cent of the exploitation receipts. The partnership therefore fulfilled the conditions necessary to generate a first year allowance of Dollars 3.25m under section 41 of the Finance Act 1971, provided the expenditure was incurred 'for the purposes of the trade'. By section 155 of the Corporation Taxes Act 1970, the benefit of any first year allowance generated by the partnership accrued to Ensign and the four British partners in the proportions in which they contributed to its capital. Ensign, having contributed Dollars 2.375m, was entitled to first year allowance of Dollars 2.375m. Ensign claimed the partnership had generated a first year allowance of Dollars 14m, being the total cost of the film. That was rejected by the commissioners on the ground that the partnership was not carrying on a trade but was carrying out a device to avoid tax. Mr Justice Millett disagreed and decided that the partnership's activities constituted the trade of making and exploiting films. He decided it had incurred Dollars 14m capital expenditure for the purpose of section 41 of the 1971 Act (FT, July 28 1989). The Court of Appeal reversed his decision, but referred the dispute back to the commissioners to decide whether the partnership was or was not trading. Ensign now appealed and asked for Mr Justice Millett's order to be restored. The parties agreed that the 17 documents of July 14 were interdependent, and constituted one single composite transaction, which was a tax avoidance scheme and must be read as a whole. The non-recourse nature of the borrowing ensured that LPI paid the whole cost of the film exceeding Dollars 3.25m, and that the partnership would not be liable for the cost in excess of Dollars 3.25m. The scheme involved exploitation of British capital allowances for the making of a foreign film. Mr Gardiner submitted that a taxpayer might enter into any transaction in any form he pleased, and the court was confined to that form and could not consider the substance of the transaction. The Revenue appeared to look upon tax avoidance as a corporate cancer which infected and destroyed any fiscal effect advantageous to the taxpayer. In Ramsay v IRC (1979) 1 WLR 973,979,328 where the taxpayer entered into transactions to match an allowable loss against a non-chargeable gain, a claim for capital gains tax was disallowed because 'the true view, regarding the scheme as a whole, was to find that there was neither gain nor loss'. In the present case the true view, reading the scheme as a whole, was that the partnership expended Dollars 3.25m. In Ramsay Lord Fraser referred to the 'apparently magic' result of creating a tax loss that was not a real loss. The present scheme had the apparently magic result of creating for tax purposes an expenditure of Dollars 14m, while incurring a real expenditure of only Dollars 3.25m. The additional Dollars 10.75m was really incurred by LPI. The commissioners felt bound to ignore beneficial fiscal consequences because the paramount object of the scheme was fiscal. In the Court of Appeal Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C said if the 'sole' object was fiscal advantage, it was not a trading transaction. The principles of Ramsay and subsequent cases did not compel or authorise the court to disregard all the fiscal consequences of a single composite transaction read as a whole, on the ground that it appeared the transaction was a tax avoidance scheme. Neither the commissioners nor the courts were competent to decide whether there was a sole object or paramount intention to obtain a fiscal advantage, nor to weigh fiscal intentions against non-fiscal elements. The commissioners' task was to find the facts and to apply the law. The facts were undisputed and the law was clear. The partnership expended Dollars 3.25m capital for the purpose of producing and exploiting a commercial film. That was a trading activity. Expenditure for that purpose was a trading purpose. By section 41 of the 1971 Act, capital expenditure for a trading purpose generated first year allowance. The section was not concerned with the purpose of the transaction, but with the purpose of the expenditure. The principles of Ramsay and subsequent authorities did not apply to the Dollars 3.25m, because that was real and not magical expenditure by the partnership. A trading transaction could plainly be identified and could have resulted in either a profit or a loss. The expenditure was real. The receipts were real. The partnership was entitled to a first year allowance equal to the expenditure. The receipts imposed on the partnership a corporation tax liability. The apeal was allowed. Their Lordships agreed. For Ensign: John Gardiner QC and Jonathan Peacock (Belmont &amp; Lowe, agents for Hugh James Jones &amp; Jenkins, Cardiff). For the Crown: Christopher McCall QC and Launcelot Henderson (Inland Revenue solicitor).</p>

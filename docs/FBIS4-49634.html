			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, may 6 (XINHUA) -- The "one country, two  systems" policy is by no means a transient or an off-hand  policy, nor is it a maneuver, said a senior Chinese official  here today.    "It is truly China's long-term policy," said the official.    Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office  of the State Council, made these remarks while delivering a  speech at a luncheon jointly given by several local  organizations.    In his speech, Lu elaborated on the reasons why China  decided  to adopt the "one country, two systems" principle to settle the  Hong Kong issue.    Firstly, he said that the principle is the best and the only  solution to maintaining the prosperity and stability of Hong  Kong.    "To look for a solution, we took into consideration the  historical factor as well as the current status quo of Hong  Kong," he said.    He said that "the solution will not only have to be  acceptable to China, but also to Hong Kong and to the British  side as well. There should be as little changes and  disturbances as possible in 1997".    Secondly, the top official in charge of the Hong Kong  affairs  said that the principle is good for the country as a whole.    "For the four modernizations to succeed, we need a bridge to  carry us to the Western world, and for the Western world to come  to the China market," Lu said.    He said that Hong Kong hasbeen playing this role all along,  and China wants it to continue to do so by retaining its  capitalistic characteristics.    "We believe that a socialist mainland and a capitalist Hong  Kong can co-exist in harmony in such a way that they can  supplement each other instead of confronting each other," he  said.    He pointed out that cities like Shanghai can never take the  place of Hong Kong because no matter how developed Shanghai  becomes, it will remain socialist.    "Shanghai will serve the country as a socialist metropolis,  while Hong Kong will play a different role in its capacity as a  capitalist special administrative region," he said.    Thirdly, Lu Ping said that the "one country, two systems"  principle is a big move in the course of reunification of China.    "By offering Hong Kong as a blueprint to the settlement of  the questions of Macao and Taiwan, China sets an example to the  world that it can settle disputes in a peaceful way through  mutual accommodation," Lu said.</p>

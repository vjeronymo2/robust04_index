			<p>BFN     [Text] Faustin Twagiramungu, the Rwandan prime  minister-designate, who was due to take up his position after  implementation of the Arusha agreement, is currently in Europe  trying to see if it is possible for him to play a role in this  Rwandan crisis. Faustin Twagiramungu explained to correspondent  Monique Mas that he hopes the opposition forces will meet and  work together:    [Begin recording] [Twagiramungu] We are in contact with  those  who have remained in Rwanda in the liberated areas, as well as  with those who are in Brussels. Therefore, we think that it is  absolutely necessary to set up a coordination committee formed  by all these forces and to try to act and do something so the  Rwandan people know that the opposition still exists and intends  to carry out its activities and assume its responsibility as an  alternative to the regime.    [Mas] Do you believe in a military solution to the Rwandan  problem?    [Twagiramungu] The military solution can be looked at from  one angle. What we say today is that the army and the  gendarmerie commands failed to put an end to the massacres  perpetrated throughout the country. If this situation  continues, it is obvious that all political forces and military  forces that are able to introduce change and improve the  situation will be absolutely welcome. [end recording]</p>

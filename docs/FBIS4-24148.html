			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with COSATU official Neil Coleman by reporter </F> Carol Williams; place and date not given -- from the "Network  Africa" program]    [Text] Now to South Africa where the ANC-led government has  unveiled its first budget. There were few big surprises and as  expected the emphasis was on social spending for education,  housing, and welfare, as well as tax incentives for businesses.  But with its proposals for a [words indistinct] wealth's tax,  some have called it a Robin Hood budget -- taking from the rich  to help the poor. Carol Williams spoke to Neil Coleman from  COSATU, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, and asked  him for the union's reaction to the budget.    [Begin recording] [Coleman] Well, you know, we are still  studying it and looking at the full implications of the budget,  but our initial response would be that it is a budget which lays  the basis for the implementation of the Reconstruction and  Development Program which COSATU and the trade unions were a  very important part of designing. However, we have to recognize  the fact that we are inheriting an apartheid bureaucracy and  monetary amounts don't necessarily mean delivery. So, what we  are already looking at are processes which will result in the  restructuring of the public sector and ensure that the money in  the budget actually results in delivery to the poorest  communities which actually need the services.    [Williams] You mentioned that you quietly welcomed the  budget, but there have been reports in some ANC grass roots  circles that they are disappointed, that this budget (?isn't  enough) to actually [words indistinct] apartheid.    [Coleman] What we are saying [words indistinct] to a tax  system is that you have a 5 percent levy which is going to pay  for the transition costs, but on the other hand there are  certain areas which we believe could have been addressed better.  For example, spending on defense has gone up from 9.3 billion  to 10.6 billion [rand] and we don't believe that in a time of  peace in which we are reconstructing our country that we can  justify spending such a high amount on defense. We are calling  for the government to engage in an urgent defense review. So,  there are weaknesses in the budget, but for us the critical  question is to make this bureaucracy, which is attempting to  implement a reconstruction budget, to make that bureaucracy  much, much more accountable and receptive to the needs of the  public.    [Williams] And just how can the trade unions actually do  that?    [Coleman] Well, I think we can do that in a number of ways.  For a start, the problem that we are facing at the moment is  that we have inherited a public service which is extremely  stratified. At the bottom you have workers who are actually  delivering the services, being paid poverty wages, while the  bureaucrats who are delivering very little at all are getting  paid fairly high wages. We want to look as a trade union  movement at (?flexing) the hierarchies to ensure that the  service delivered are actually remunerated fairly. We also want  to ensure that we are part of the processes of restructuring  those departments and making them more accountable to the public.    [Williams] I know COSATU and your trade unions have been  very  closely aligned to the ANC and also very instrumental in setting  up its reconstruction program. Yet, this budget is a very, very  business, corporate friendly budget. Do you think this is in  any way going to affect your relationship with the present  government?    [Coleman] Well, we are not against a budget which encourages  investment, encourages business, but the question is at the end  of the day for us to ensure that the business activity and the  economic activity benefits everyone in the country and not just  a privileged few. That is why, as I said, we would have liked  to have seen much more emphasis on incentives to companies to  create jobs, to engage in training, and in productive investment  so that there would be some areas where we think too many  concessions have been made. But on a whole it's quite a move  away from the old apartheid South Africa where the only presence  in the budget were the white minority and the business  community. Here, clearly you have got the stamp of the majority  beginning to imprint itself on the programs of government. [end  recording]</p>

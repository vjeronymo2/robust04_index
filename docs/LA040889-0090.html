			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DREAMS COME TRUE FOR POMONA POLICE BRINGING JOY TO AILING BOY  </P> <P> A boy's wildest dreams were obviously coming true when Pomona police gave  Christopher Wilson everything they could think of.  </P> <P> And that may be only the beginning. By the time they're through, Chris may have  visited the Statue of Liberty and Disney World, and dozens of football-playing  policemen will have had dreams of their own fulfilled.  </P> <P> Six-year-old Chris, who was born with cystic fibrosis, has already had a ride  in the Pomona police helicopter and on a police motorcycle.  </P> <P> His benefactors include the Pomona Police Officers Assn., officers of the state  Department of Corrections and the Make A Wish Foundation, which makes dreams  come true for youngsters under 18 who have life-threatening diseases.  </P> <P> It all began when members of the police association, who often play on other  football teams, decided to form their own squad.  </P> <P> "We'd go out and beat our brains out, and the recognition would go to the team  we were playing for," said Pomona Detective Ray Birch. "We wanted some of the  glory that we were helping others to get."  </P> <P> So did officers of the California Institute for Men in Chino, who had the same  idea.  </P> <P> Together, they figured that they could raise a lot of money if they held a  charity football game and sold all the tickets themselves, rather than paying  an agency to solicit ticket sales.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Donating Stadium  </P> <P> The athletic department at Chaffey College in Alta Loma is donating its  football stadium, uniforms and personnel for the game, which will begin at 7  p.m. Friday. Tickets cost $3 for adults and $1 for children 5 to 17. Younger  children will be admitted free.  </P> <P> When plans started falling into place, Birch said, the police association asked  the Make A Wish Foundation to choose a special child to help.  </P> <P> Deborah Wilson said her son had been recommended to the foundation by a teacher  who tutors him in his La Verne home, through the Bonita Unified School  District.  </P> <P> Chris easily qualified for consideration, said Betty Strong of Riverside,  speaking for the Make A Wish Foundation.  </P> <P> Proceeds from the football game will not go directly to Chris but into a  general fund, Strong said. The foundation spends an average of $2,000 for each  wish it fulfills. She said many hotels provide rooms free or at reduced cost,  and the foundation gives each member of the family $50 spending money each day  of the trip.  </P> <P> "The effect on their lives is the excitement they get, the happiness," Strong  said. "It's an upper you can't believe."  </P> <P> Dozens of Pomona officers competed for Chris' attention during a recent  get-acquainted visit. They urged him to accept a special cake, badges, a helmet  and a baton.  </P> <P> "You can't believe how much this is doing for us," Birch said. "The kind of  thing we see every day out on the streets -- we really need this.  </P> <P> "He's the perfect kid," Birch said as he watched Chris easily take over the  entire police facility.  </P> <P> Chris is a blue-eyed, blond charmer with a disease that a spokesman at the  Cystic Fibrosis Foundation of Southern California called "the No. 1 genetic  killer of children and young adults."  </P> <P> His big wish, say his parents, Deborah and Scott Wilson, is to see the Statue  of Liberty. Disney World comes a close second.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Making Plans  </P> <P> All that will probably come true soon after next week's game, Strong said. She  has begun making plans for the whole family -- including 3-year-old Cory -- to  spend a week traveling to New York and Florida.  </P> <P> Chris, who is in good health right now, required surgery for an intestinal  blockage six hours after he was born, his mother said.  </P> <P> Cystic fibrosis clogs the lungs and digestive tract and makes its victims  susceptible to pneumonia and other infections. Gary Green, executive for the  Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, said most of the 35,000 victims in the United  States have a life expectancy into their mid-20s. He said scientists may soon  be able to identify the gene that causes the disease.  </P> <P> Deborah Wilson said Chris receives regular intravenous feedings and sleeps with  a mask and a humidifier to ease his breathing. While he appears robust, he is  not able to attend regular school classes.  </P> <P> After touring the police facility and posing for photographers like a  professional model, Chris and his mother went to Brackett Field in La Verne,  where the Pomona Police Department's helicopter is kept.  </P> <P> "I've been looking forward to this since I first heard about it," said pilot  Dennis McCall.  </P> <P> A somewhat reluctant Chris was persuaded to mount a cycle. He immediately  identified the button that operated the siren.  </P> <P> He lasted as long as the police officers did that afternoon, running, leaping,  grinning and clutching his new possessions.  </P> <P> "He gave out and slept on the way home, but it was wonderful while it lasted,"  said his mother.  </P></p>

Applicants also request an order exempting them from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder to the extent necessary to permit the Funds to assess a CDSC on certain redemptions, and to waive the CDSC in certain instances.

The directors of each of the Funds, including a majority of the independent directors, shall have approved the multi-class arrangement, prior to the implementation thereof by a particular Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the directors of each of the Funds regarding the deliberations of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the multi-class arrangement will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the proposed system is in the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The initial determination of the class-specific expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class of a Fund and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the directors of the affected Fund, including a majority of the independent directors. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet class-specific expenses shall provide to the directors, and the directors shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purpose for which the expenditures were made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. On an ongoing basis, the directors of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of shares. The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and the Distributor at their own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Mental healthcare strategy attacked BRITAIN is relying on an 'inadequate, piecemeal approach' to mental healthcare and ignoring the experience of other countries, the King's Fund Institute said yesterday. The health think-tank made several recommendations in a report published yesterday, including the drawing up of national 'goals' for mental healthcare. Ms Judy Turner-Crowson, a former US health official, said the care of mentally ill people in the community could be transformed if policymakers learned lessons from the US. She added: 'The central problem in both countries has been the patchy, slow and uneven development of community services to take the place of the old mental hospitals.' Services could only be properly developed if a framework of action were agreed by the mentally ill people and their families, health professionals, managers and policymakers, she said. The problems in Britain have been made worse by the large number of different professionals responsible for caring for the mentally ill. Cash shortages coupled with plans to create smaller local authorities pose a threat to Care in the Community policies, Dr Gary Craig, a health policy expert, said in a report yesterday. He said the changes would weaken social services, endangering services such as meals-on-wheels and home-helps in some areas.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Belgrade, 10 Jun (TANJUG) -- Federal Prime  Minister Radoje Kontic said today that an extraordinary  parliamentiary session would be justified only if implementation  of the economic stabilization program was threatened.    Speaking at a regular news conference he said that the  government will closely monitor the implementation of this  year's economic policy and, depending on the situation, would  decide whether or not to convene an extraordinary session.  [passage omitted]    Answering a question about the cease-fire in the former  Bosnia- Herzegovina and the decision of the House of  Representatives of the U.S. Congress on the lifting of the  embargo on arms imports for the Muslims, Kontic said that a  short-term cease-fire, as well as the decision on lifting the  embargo, are encouraging Muslims to persist in the war option.  He added that some of President Clinton's statements that the  arms embargo will not be lifted were encouraging.    Asked about the army and police allegedly stepping up their  activities in Raska, about which the Muslim National Council of  Sandzak has informed foreign journalists, Kontic said that this  was not true and that such claims are spread in order to exert  pressure on Serbia, primarily from abroad. He added that he had  given instructions for an investigation to be carried out.  [passage omitted]</p>

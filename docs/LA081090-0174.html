			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> HONEY TESTS FOR PESTICIDE SET  </P> <P> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will test honey after some in  Massachusetts was found with 22 times the legal amount of pesticide, it was  reported today.  </P> <P> Officials identified two large beekeeping operations which allegedly misused  the chemical, fluvalinate, in hives used to pollinate cranberry bogs in  Massachusetts, the Boston Herald reported.  </P> <P> Inspectors found fluvalinate in honey taken from hives owned by one of the  companies. The company sells honey to the public as well as to the federal  government, which gives it to schools and senior citizen centers.  </P> <P> John A. Hamilton Jr., compliance director for the FDA in Boston, said the  agency is concerned that dozens of beekeepers who travel between Florida and  New England pollinating everything from citrus groves to apple orchards may be  misusing the pesticide.  </P> <P> "We don't know whether this is (in) food for human consumption or not at this  point, so we are actively investigating it and we will begin testing the honey  that is sold for human consumption," he said.  </P> <P> Fluvalinate, which is legal for use in hives which do not produce honey, is  used to kill the varroa mite, which kills bees.  </P></p>

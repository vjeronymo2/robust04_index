			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / BR chiefs angered by signals row British Rail chiefs are furious about what they see as the incompetent handling of the signalling staff's dispute by Railtrack, the state-owned company responsible since April 1 for maintaining the railway network. It emerged yesterday that senior BR managers believe they could have reached an agreement with the RMT rail union over the grievances of the signalling staff last year. They say they were unable to do so because Railtrack insisted on taking over responsibility for negotiating a deal with the signalling staff in April last year rather than on the company's vesting day on April 1 this year. The BR managers said that by spring last year they were at an advanced stage in a study of the restructuring of the pay and conditions of the signalling staff with the support of RMT union - a process that started in August 1991. Railtrack took over the signalling staff issue on April 22 last year. British Rail said it could not understand why there was such a long delay at Railtrack before the package of restructuring proposals for signalling staff was put to the RMT jointly with BR last November. Meanwhile, the independent Public Finance Foundation yesterday released figures suggesting that railway signalling staff have had among the lowest increases in earnings of any public sector group in the past five years. Since 1988 their earnings have risen by an average of 43 per cent, compared with 44 per cent for local government workers, 56 per cent for the police, 51 per cent for the armed forces, 48 per cent for health service employees and 52 per cent for those in education. Only civil servants - at 42 per cent - have had smaller rises over the period. Employees in the private sector had average rises of 53 per cent in the past six years. Mr Chris Trinder, head of the Public Finance Foundation, said: 'The railway signalling staff failed to benefit from the pre-general election pay bonanza of 1991-1992.' But signalling staff are also the last group of workers on the railway network not to have benefited from job restructuring that started in 1990. Their position looks particularly anomalous compared with the signal and telecommunication technicians and supervisors grade immediately above them in the hierarchy. That group acquired a new pay structure in 1992 that improved basic pay rates by 25 per cent with a shorter working week in return for job evaluation and work flexibility. Other groups already covered by restructuring deals include Railfreight distribution staff, retail and customer service staff and civil engineering supervisors.</p>

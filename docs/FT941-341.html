			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Littlewoods climbs by 74% Littlewoods, the retailing and football pools group that is one of the UK's largest private companies, announced a 74 per cent increase in pre-tax profits yesterday, and insisted that it would remain private. Profits before tax for the year to December 31 increased to Pounds 117.2m. The Pounds 67.3m for 1992 has been restated in accordance with FRS 3 to take into account exceptional costs of Pounds 29.7m for the group's withdrawal from the food hall business - which was taken over by Iceland - and from its retail finance businesses. There were net exceptional costs of Pounds 3.4m for 1993, with Pounds 10.9m rationalisation costs offset by a Pounds 7.5m profit on the sale of Littlewoods' Christmas hampers business. Excluding exceptionals, underlying profits grew by 24 per cent from Pounds 97m to Pounds 120.6m. The death of Sir John Moores, the group's founder, last September had led to speculation that the group might be floated, with rumours that some of the 32 shareholder members of the Moores family were keen to sell their stakes. However, Mr Leonard van Geest, chairman, insisted there were no plans for flotation. 'We have no need to go public,' he said. 'The family members are all very committed to the business, and maintain a strong interest in it.' He added that not having access to equity finance was not a problem as the group was able to borrow at good rates. Littlewoods moved from net borrowings of Pounds 6.1m at the beginning of 1993 to net cash of Pounds 58.9m at the year-end. Sales increased by 2.5 per cent from Pounds 2.71bn to Pounds 2.78bn, of which the retail businesses contributed Pounds 1.96bn (Pounds 1.9bn). Sales in Littlewoods chain stores declined from Pounds 696m to Pounds 666m, mainly as a result of disruption during the conversion of food halls to the Iceland format. Operating profits from the continuing business increased from Pounds 33.2m to Pounds 37.8m. In the home shopping division, sales rose from Pounds 978m to Pounds 1.04bn, and profits from Pounds 56.3m to Pounds 68.6m. The Index catalogue shops increased sales to Pounds 251m (Pounds 228m). Losses were reduced to Pounds 7.5m (Pounds 9.1m). Profits from the group's football pools side grew to Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 21.6m). Mr Barry Dale, chief executive, said trading was buoyant over Christmas, but had slackened in recent weeks. Looming tax increases next month had damaged consumer confidence, he said.</p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Observer: Uninteresting Let's hope 1994 proves to be a more memorable year for some US citizens than the one now ending. According to a opinion poll just published, the most memorable event of 1993 was not the Clinton inauguration, nor sadness over the troops lost in Somalia, nor even the third consecutive National Basketball Association championship win by the Chicago Bulls. Instead, what stuck most in the mind of the 1,000 people polled was 'falling interest rates'. But then the nature of the survey's sponsor - MasterCard International - may have had something to do with its outcome.</p>

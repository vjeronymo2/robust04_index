			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / International Company News: TWA files for Chapter 11 revamp TRANS WORLD Airlines, the heavily-indebted US carrier controlled by Mr Carl Icahn, announced yesterday it had reached an agreement with its creditors which could allow it to rapidly restructure its finances under the protection of the US bankruptcy court. However, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, a Government watchdog, last night cast doubt over Mr Icahn's proposal when it estimated that TWA's pension fund was underfunded by Dollars 933m and said: 'If this filing is an attempt to escape the pension responsibility, it will not succeed.' The company's plan, which involves Mr Icahn relinquishing majority ownership of the business, yesterday prompted TWA to file a 'pre-planned' Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganisation. This is a subtle variant on a 'pre-packaged' bankruptcy, which involves a company entering Chapter 11 after first obtaining the agreement of most of its creditors for a debt-restructuring plan. This plan is then imposed on other creditors, allowing a company to emerge rapidly from bankruptcy, rather than spending years under court control TWA hoped to emerge in six months or less. TWA, the seventh largest US carrier, announced a comprehensive restructuring plan last July. It said then it intended to file a pre-packaged Chapter 11, probably early this year. Mr Icahn said yesterday's filing had the support of all secured and unsecured bondholders. TWA had also reached agreement in principle with the machinists' union, representing about half its employees, on a new pay-for-productivity labour contract. TWA's debt problems stem from 1988, when Mr Icahn, who acquired control of the business in the mid-1980s, borrowed heavily to take the business private. It is the sixth of America's 12 largest airlines to file for Chapter 11 protection over the past year or so as a weak economy, high fuel prices, and a battle for market share have forced consolidation on the sector. Three of those six - Eastern, Midway and Pan Am - are now defunct. Yesterday's plan envisages the elimination of Dollars 1bn of TWA's Dollars 1.6-Dollars 1.7bn of debt, with control of its equity passing to creditors. Mr Icahn would end up with between 15 and 40 per cent of the equity against 90 per cent now. TWA said it had about Dollars 500m in cash and was also arranging Dollars 200m of debtor-in-possession financing - loans to bankrupt companies which rank first in the queue for repayment. Mr Icahn said having these funds would be 'more than adequate to enable us to continue to conduct our normal operations and should ensure the successful completion of our reorganisation'. TWA stressed that the filing would not affect its normal business. But the filing still leaves a question mark over the long-term future of TWA, which had an operating deficit of Dollars 257.7m in the first nine months of 1991, and faces stiff competition from the better-capitalised American, United and Delta airlines.</p>

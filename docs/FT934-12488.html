			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading EQUITY derivatives were downbeat yesterday, with the recent inflow of money having abated and no clear way ahead in sight, writes Christine Buckley. The market, which was largely sentiment driven, was also fettered by a general gloom surrounding the likelihood of an early interest rate cut. Similarly, anyone looking towards the gilts market for a lift were disappointed too as it edged easier. The December futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index was thus left floundering and independent traders gave up on it in considerable measure - selling to push it lower. US dealers were said to have joined in by off-loading some of their interest. There was little to combat the concerted selling. The contract saw its highest point at the opening and fell back from then on. December opened at 3,224 and began to drift until it reached its low at 3,203. For most of the afternoon it traded sideways in a narrow band. The contract ended at 3,206, a lead of nearly eight points on its fair value premium to the cash market, which is taken at about 15 points. At 8,537 lots, volume was weak. Traded options were similarly subdued, turnover reaching only 29,529 lots. Index options featured strongly with 9,723 contracts dealt in the FT-SE 100 and 3,022 in the Euro FT-SE. Guinness was the most heavily traded stock option with 2,445 lots.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Overseas boost for Redland PRE-TAX profits of Redland, one of Britain's biggest building materials group jumped by 12 per cent to Pounds 88.5m in the first six months of this year. Mr Robert Napier, managing director, said that the severe downturn in the UK construction market had been offset by strong trading in Germany and improvements in other overseas markets. The results were assisted by a Pounds 15m contribution from Steetley, the UK building materials group acquired by Redland earlier this year. The interim dividend is maintained at 8.25p. Earnings per share fell from 13.1p to 11.6p after taking account of shares issued for Steetley and increased minorities of Pounds 14.9m (Pounds 11m), mostly in Germany. Redland estimated it would achieve savings of Pounds 30m a year by integrating Steetley. Since the purchase the UK aggregate and brick businesses had been merged, Steetley's headquarters closed and two French businesses merged resulting in 800 job losses. Mr Napier said that trading had been excellent in Germany where the group has a 51 per cent stake in Braas the country's biggest roof tile maker. Eastern Germany was benefiting from investment in improved housing. The housing market had also remained buoyant in western Germany. Overall German profits rose by a quarter to Pounds 41.1m. Redland's share price fell 19p to 343p yesterday on fears that growth in German construction may slow next year while the UK market is expected to remain severely depressed. Profits from other continental European countries also rose sharply during the first half from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 20.9m. The group said that it was working hard to bring Steetley's French aggregates businesses under control with volumes and profits lower than during the corresponding period last year. Steetley's Spanish profits were also lower due to a slow down in the Madrid construction market. The UK market is where Redland has been hit hardest with sales and prices of many of its products sharply lower. Without the contribution from Steetley, UK profits would have seen a big fall. As it was the decline was restricted to just Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 19.5m. Mr Napier said: 'In the UK prospects for the rest of the year remain poor although the restructuring of the Redland and Steetley aggregates and brick businesses will provide further opportunities for cost savings. In Germany, trading continues to be strong and the outlook remains good.' See Lex</p>

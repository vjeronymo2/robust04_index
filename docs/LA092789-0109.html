			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> BROTHERS SENTENCED FOR ROLES IN DRUG CARTEL  </P> <P> A judge this week sent two Costa Mesa brothers to prison for helping run what  prosecutors described as one of the biggest marijuana businesses in the  country.  </P> <P> Daniel Mack Fowlie, 30, received a 3 1/2-year sentence from Judge Alicemarie H.  Stotler in U.S. District Court on Monday, while brother Gus got two years. Each  had pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiring to import and distribute  marijuana, while other drug counts against them were dropped.  </P> <P> The sentence was slightly less than had been sought by federal prosecutors, but  Assistant U.S. Atty. Tom Umberg termed it "a just sentence."  </P> <P> "They weren't the organizers of the conspiracy, but they were cogs in the  drug-running business," Umberg said.  </P> <P> The brothers were accused of having helped distribute hundreds of thousands of  pounds of marijuana -- worth millions of dollars -- around the country, using a  sprawling ranch in Rancho del Rio at the borders of Orange and Riverside  counties as a base. The ranch was seized by federal authorities last year and  was used by President Bush as a stage for an anti-drug speech this spring.  </P> <P> Daniel J. Fowlie, father of the defendants and the alleged mastermind of the  family drug business, is in Mexico awaiting extradition to the United States on  separate drug charges, Umberg said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEHIND BARS;  </P> <P> THOSE MYSTERIOUS STRIPES MAY STUMP CONSUMERS, BUT THEY LAY IT ALL OUT IN BLACK  AND WHITE FOR RETAILERS: WHAT'S HOT AND WHAT'S NOT -- AND EVEN WHY.  </P> <P> Safeway Stores figured out a few years ago that shoppers bought more candy bars  when they were stocked at front-end checkstands than when placed only on racks  in the middle of stores. So the Oakland-based chain started stocking the sweets  up front.  </P> <P> Ralphs Grocery recently found in a store-by-store analysis that sales of fresh  pasta had "really exploded" in certain of its locations, according to Al  Marasca, executive vice president of the Compton firm. That enabled the company  to expand the space for that product only in those stores where demand was  greatest.  </P> <P> What led to these changes were bar codes, those ubiquitous black and white  stripes on products from peanut butter to kitty litter. To shoppers, the codes  are best known for being pulled by a cashier across a window-like device in the  checkout stand, which somehow translates them into a price that flashes onto a  screen.  </P> <P> But bar codes also have a secret life -- as speedy providers of facts and  figures about what people buy and why.  </P> <P> In addition to streamlining the checkout process and saving grocers the cost of  tagging many items, bar codes are being used increasingly to help manufacturers  and retailers make smarter decisions about which products to sell and how to  market them.  </P> <P> Manufacturers depend on the data to find out how well their products are moving  and what promotions work best to stimulate sales. At Ralston Purina Co. in St.  Louis, maker of Chex cereal, Wonder Bread, dog food and other products, bar  code data is "relied upon in different degrees in our different divisions, but  all of them do use it," said spokesman Patrick Farrell.  </P> <P> The technology, which uses laser beams to scan bar codes, is worthy of "Star  Wars." Scanning was pioneered in the early 1970s by Kroger, the big  Cincinnati-based grocery company. Now, according to industry figures, nearly  17,000 of the nation's 30,000 supermarkets (not including small mom-and-pop  stores) have laser scanning equipment.  </P> <P> Here's how the process works:  </P> <P> Before any information about a product can be collected, a supermarket company  makes an entry in a host computer at headquarters.  </P> <P> The file usually contains a 10-digit number represented by the bar code plus  the current price. The first five digits stand for the manufacturer, whose  number is assigned by the Uniform Code Council in Dayton, Ohio. The council,  which maintains a database of about 60,000 companies from 77 different  countries, also determines the specifications for each bar code, including the  width of stripes and the contrast between the bars and the background.  </P> <P> The next five digits, assigned by each manufacturer, signify the product, with  variations by flavor, size or weight. A 16-ounce box of Rice Krispies, for  example, would have a slightly different code from a 24-ounce package. And an  8-ounce container of strawberry-flavored Dannon yogurt would have a different  number from an 8-ounce container of blueberry.  </P> <P> Back at the checkout stand, a cashier passes the bar code across a window  embedded in the counter that covers the inner workings of the laser scanner.  The scanner can read the code in the proper order, even if the item is upside  down. If the scanner recognizes the code as one contained in the store's  computer, it sounds a beep and flashes a brief product description and the  price on a screen. It also tallies another sale in that store for that product.  </P> <P> Although stores could analyze the data on a daily basis, "most don't have the  time," noted Jerry Morton, who runs Store Systems Consulting in Lawrence, Kan.,  and advises supermarkets about scanning equipment.  </P> <P> More commonly, the headquarters computer retrieves information on a weekly  basis from each store, and then the chain sells the data to services that  analyze it for manufacturers. Some large chains get as much as $1 million a  year just for selling the data, according to Tony MacNeary, vice president of  retailer client services for one such company, Information Resources Inc.  </P> <P> IRI and A. C. Nielsen Co., both based in Chicago, use the vast stores of data  to track the success or failure of products and promotions. By tracking data  from a representative sample of stores, these companies can analyze how an  individual item (say, Diet Pepsi) or company (PepsiCo) is faring during a  certain period or in a given region. They can also determine whether sales of  bean dip go up if a supermarket puts taco chips on sale.  </P> <P> "For the retailer or manufacturer, we can see whether it's worth more to run a  feature ad in a newspaper or a huge display in a store," MacNeary said.  "Combining them might be even more effective."  </P> <P> As part of its service, Nielsen analyzes a wealth of data from 15,000 U.S.  households. Using special hand-held scanning equipment at home, participating  residents scan the groceries and other products they have bought. They note  such factors as whether the price was marked down or whether they used a  coupon. Nielsen also takes into account what magazines and newspapers these  people read to find out what ads they may have seen. Participants are rewarded  with gifts and trips.  </P> <P> Although manufacturers have started putting such data to good use, retailers  have yet to tap the full potential of scanner information, many observers say.  Instead of using scanner data and computers to develop automated reordering of  products, an estimated 98% of the nation's groceries still use manual methods.  Usually, store personnel must walk the aisles with hand-held scanners that read  bar code tags on the shelves.  </P> <P> "Nobody is getting more than 10% of value out of the data," said W. Frank Dell,  vice president in the New York office of Cresap, a Towers Perrin company that  consults for food and consumer products companies.  </P> <P> Safeway Stores is an exception. In May, 1983, the big chain hired a  developmental psychologist named Louise H. Booth to head an in-house marketing  research organization. Her team collects and analyzes scanner data for other  retailers and for manufacturers, such as Procter &amp; Gamble, Ralston Purina  and PepsiCo.  </P> <P> "We not only earn some money by doing research," said Booth, manager of Safeway  Scanner Marketing Research Services. "We learn the answers to questions (our  clients are) asking." Safeway also analyzes its own data, looking for ways to  boost sales, as it did with candy bars.  </P> <P> Armed with scanner data, manufacturers can get influential retailers such as  Safeway on their side by proving that shelf space for their products can mean  added profit all around.  </P> <P> Take kiwis. In 1984, the New Zealand Kiwifruit Authority went to Safeway to  learn how best to market the exotic fruit to U.S. customers. In a series of  tests, Safeway showed that added display in the produce area plus special  advertising and a reduced price could boost weekly kiwi sales to more than 450  per store from 25.  </P> <P> "It was so useful that we're thinking of updating it in the next year or two,"  said Hillary A. Brick, with the kiwi marketing board in Oakland.  </P> <P> (To be sure, kiwis and other fruits and vegetables don't have bar codes affixed  to them. To ring up produce purchases, cashiers punch in a two-digit code that  prompts the computer to look up the price for that item. The data is then  analyzed in the same way as other bar code information.)  </P> <P> Eventually, as the system becomes even more sophisticated, Booth expects  Safeway's service to help manufacturers target customers more effectively.  "P&amp;G might want to send a coupon to people who buy disposable diapers, in  particular people who buy the other brand, or to anybody who buys baby food,"  she said. "This is a way for P&amp;G to get a mailing list based on the  purchase behavior of a household."  </P></p>

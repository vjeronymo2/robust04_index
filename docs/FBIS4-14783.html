			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>   [Text] Yerevan March 31 TASS -- An Armenian opposition  leader urged the republican parliament to ratify the soonest  possible the treaty on the legal status of Russian troops on  Armenian territory, which was ratified by Russia's former  Supreme Soviet a year ago.    Addressing today's meeting of representatives of Armenian  political forces, focused on relations between the two  countries, leader of the Ramkavar-Azatakan Party Ruben  Mirzakhanyan called upon all political forces to join efforts in  pressing for ratification of the treaty. This is much more  important than to come up with declarations about friendship  with Russia, he stressed. Mirzakhanyan recalled that his party  had recently suggested putting the ratification issue on the  agenda of the Armenian parliament's session, but this proposal  failed to win support from lawmakers.    The opposition leader labelled as "outrageous" the fact that  Armenia does not yet have its embassy in Moscow and is  represented just by a permanent mission. The Armenian Embassy  is to become the most important political institution, which  will immediately engage in promotion and coordination of  bilateral relations between Russia and Armenia, above all in the  sphere of inter-state relations, Mirzakhanyan pointed out.</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Adam's ownership may change FUTURE ownership of Adam &amp; Co, the Edinburgh-based private banking group, is uncertain in the wake of the near disaster in which its banking subsidiary lost more than twice its capital in unauthorised foreign exchange dealing. Mr James Laurenson, managing director, said the bank, which caters for rich individuals, had received many expressions of interest from potential purchasers. It has appointed Lazard Brothers to advise on possible changes to the shareholding structure. In September Adam &amp; Co revealed that it had lost Pounds 21m in irregular operations by two foreign exchange dealers in its London office. Although the Pounds 10m capital was wiped out, it was immediately rescued by Mrs Francoise Schlumberger Primat, a 75-year-old director and principal shareholder who injected Pounds 21m into it. Including Pounds 6.5m of the dealing loss, the bank incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 5m in the year to June 30 1992, compared with a profit of Pounds 900,000. Adam &amp; Co has now accepted recommendations made by Price Waterhouse on improving its internal controls. It is closing the London foreign exchange dealing room. It is changing its auditors from KPMG Peat Marwick to Ernst &amp; Young, and is to strengthen its board by seeking a qualified banker with detailed knowledge of treasury operations. It has already made Mr Robert Cumming, a retired clearing banker, a director. Mr Iain Dalziel, the director who was in charge of the London branch until June 30, is to leave the board because his new job, 'a management role on behalf of one of Adam &amp; Co's principal clients' in Geneva, does not leave him time to remain a director. Sir Charles Fraser, chairman, says in his annual report that the bank had seen a 'substantial reduction in its deposit base' after the loss was revealed but had never lacked liquidity to meet depositors' demands. However, the banking facilities made available by Royal Bank of Scotland had 'greatly helped the confidence of depositors.' He said the deposit base had now stabilised and some depositors had returned. The group had won new custody business and portfolio investment clients. Mr Laurenson said that expressions of interest in the bank had come from 'more than one clearing bank,' from foreign banks and small financial services companies. Those interested included Royal Bank of Scotland, he hinted. 'We are receiving conflicting signals from our shareholders,' he said. Some, including fund managers, wanted a sale, while others would like to see Adam &amp; Co raise new capital and preserve its independence. The bank believed it could preserve its distinctiveness even under the majority control of a major shareholder. 'The future is bright,' Mr Laurenson said.</p>

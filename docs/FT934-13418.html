			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Survey of Luxembourg (7): Life business has doubled in the past year - Elizabeth Wise investigates the multi-lingual insurance sector THE life insurance business has doubled in the past year and insurers are still arriving in force to join firms from Europe, Japan and the United States. If Dublin's new status as an insurance paradise causes Luxembourg any worry, it doesn't show. Business is booming, says Mr Victor Rod, director of Luxembourg's insurance commission, which serves as regulator and supervisor for 70 insurance companies and 185 reinsurers working in the country. While the list of direct insurance companies includes well-known names - from Belgium's AssuBel to Switzerland's Winterthur - almost all the reinsurance operating in Luxembourg are captives - insurance wings of industrial companies, banks or commercial institutions set up to insure themselves. 'All our names are big names', Mr Rod says. 'There are a couple of British names extremely interested,' he adds, but declines to name them - hinting that he is competing with Dublin. Dublin has been a challenge ever since Ireland cut its tax rate to 10 per cent for insurance firms which would set up shop in Dublin's docklands before 1994 and employ at least 10 workers. But the tax break ends in 2004. Mr Rod admits that the Grand Duchy may have lost some key prospective customers to the Irish capital, and Luxembourg applications have waned slightly. But he says that there is no serious threat from Dublin, adding: 'They consider us much more as competition than we do them'. He feels the establishment of Europe's single market has secured Luxembourg's position on the insurance map. As insurers seek to attract customers around the European continent, he predicts that they will opt for a branch in Luxembourg with a multilingual staff able to market products in various countries. 'Try to sell a policy written in English to a Frenchman,' he challenges, arguing that a single, Luxembourgeois sales force can sell to clients in France, Germany and Belgium. He says that some British insurers are considering forming subsidiaries in Luxembourg, because marketing to the rest of Europe might be easier if it's not 'too British'. Insurers from several EC states are forming joint ventures to win business their national regulations will not allow - or simply to win a not-so-domestic image palatable to foreign customers, Mr Rod says. 'They could do it from France or from Germany. But they prefer a neutral base'. Life insurance business in Luxembourg grew by 148 per cent in a single year, Mr Rod claims, as a result of the establishment of new, pan-European companies which use the (EC) free movement of services to serve clients in several countries. Life insurance premium income rose to LFr14.6bn in 1992 from LFr5.9bn francs a year earlier. Mr Rod predicts another doubling in 1993, and 'dramatic increases in the coming years'. Non-life insurers took in LFr19.5bn francs last year. He also says that the new ventures are bringing new products to the market. British-style, high-yield USITS, or investment fund linked policies, are finding their way on to the continent. 'There is a healthy mix which could give some interesting cross ideas,' says Mr Tim Yeates, managing director of the Luxembourg branch of Unisom Management, a company managing some 400 reinsurance companies worldwide. The tradition of discretion in banking also applies to insurance companies, and insurers benefit - just as banks do - from the absence of withholding tax. But entering Luxembourg's insurance market costs more than in other choice spots. The minimum capital is LFr50m, 10 times what it costs to set up in Bermuda. And management must be domiciled in the Grand Duchy in order to avoid what Mr Rod calls 'letter box' business. Insurers come under Luxembourg's 39 per cent tax bracket, but they may put nearly all their profits into tax deductable 'reserves', or savings for eventual payments in case of catastrophe. Taxable income, therefore, is next to nothing. 'It's much more a tax holiday than a tax freedom,' Mr Rod explains. Any reserves remaining when the insurance policy expires, are taxed. Insurance companies held LFr65bn in investments in Luxembourg last year, up from LFr48bn in deposits in 1991. Reinsurance firms had LFr120bn worth of reserves deposted in 1991. The drawback of putting profits into reserves is that firms may not dip into profits to pay dividends. Mr Rod admits that companies wanting quick returns might be better served in Dublin, where firms see their profits each year. But reserves keep companies from closing under the weight of catastrophe payments, he says, adding: 'Those companies which really are confronted with catastrophic exposure in the long run have every interest in coming to Luxembourg.' Luxembourg has an interest in getting those companies, too. Insurance, maritime and stock exchange structures were set up to expand the financial centre. Banks here 'get a big share of these investments' made by insurers, and because nearly two thirds of premium income is ploughed into bonds, the business is also good for Luxembourg's stock exchange. Luxembourg may not win a reputation as an insurance capital, says Mr Rod. 'The insurance community will never be as important as the banking community, but it's growing, and it's growing very fast'. As for the Dublin challenge, Mr Yeates says that insurance services offered by the two cities need not detract from one another - and may be complementary. As for Mr Rod, he feels his country's position in the field is secure.</p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Jackson sued for over Dollars 20m Promoters for Michael Jackson's cancelled 'Dangerous' tour sued the entertainer on Tuesday for more than Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.4m), claiming he was addicted to morphine and Demerol long before he sought treatment, AP reports from Los Angeles. Jackson bowed out of the tour on its Mexico City leg in November when he admitted an addiction to prescription painkillers and sought treatment at an undisclosed location, apparently in Europe. Jackson said at the time he was taking prescription pain-killers after undergoing painful scalp surgery. He said his depression after a 13-year-old boy accused him of sexual abuse helped cause his drug addiction. Mama Concerts, a German corporation, Pebbles Music, a California company, and promoter Marcel Avram of Munich, filed the lawsuit in Superior Court, California's highest state court, said attorney Donald Engel. The lawsuit claims breach of contract, fraud, fraudulent concealment, negligent misrepresentation and conspiracy to defraud.</p>

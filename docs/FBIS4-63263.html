			<p>BFN     [Text] Thursday's evening session of the Ukrainian  parliament failed to take place because around 120 deputies  refused to register.    The deputies, who came from the Rukh, Statehood, Unity and  center fractions, were protesting the offer of the post of  deputy speaker to Aleksandr Tkachenko.    The left wing Ukrainian Peasants' Party nominated Tkachenko,  a former agriculture minister, for the post.    Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil appealed for deputies not  to  register and confer among fractions on their own candidates for  deputy speaker.    The speaker himself, Aleksandr Moroz, said he would give the  media a list of the names of the deputies who had refused to  register for the session. Those deputies, he said, were  obstructing "constructive" work in parliament.    Communist leader Petr Simonenko in an interview with  Interfax  Ukraine criticized the national democrats, saying that "we have  come to parliament to work and they are getting in our way."    The rebel deputies meeting Thursday evening must present  their candidates for the post of deputy speaker by Friday's  morning session of the Supreme Soviet.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Orange County to liquidate rest of portfolio Orange County, the Californian local authority which filed for bankruptcy last week, has decided to liquidate the remains of its battered Dollars 20bn investment holdings, a move it said would cap its losses at Dollars 2.02bn. The figure, which compares with an estimate of Dollars 1.5bn issued less than two weeks ago, represents the biggest single loss suffered in this year's collapse in the US bond markets. It rounds off a year in which a number of hedge funds, financial institutions and companies have taken well-publicised losses from speculating on bond price rises. The move to sell off the remaining securities, which the county valued yesterday at Dollars 8bn, follows a fire-sale of some Dollars 12bn of bonds and other instruments by a number of US and foreign investment banks. These securities had been held as collateral against loans made to the county under so-called reverse repurchase agreements. Mr Thomas Hayes, the former auditor general of California who was brought in by Orange County last Thursday to sort out the investment mess, said the decision to sell the securities was intended to protect the county against further losses. The county had said that a further one percentage point rise in US interest rates, which have risen two and a half percentage points this year, would have cut the value of its original Dollars 20bn portfolio by Dollars 300m. Under the plan agreed yesterday, the county has authorised Salomon Brothers to liquidate its holdings through an 'orderly sale' over the next 90 days. However, with the Federal Reserve Board due to meet next Tuesday to review interest rate policy, Salomon is believed to have moved immediately to hedge the portfolio against any further rate rises. Of the remaining Dollars 8bn of securities, some Dollars 5.4bn belongs to 187 different municipal authorities, school districts, transport authorities and others who invested their money with the county authorities. The rest is held by financial institutions as security against loans. Some 60 per cent of the remaining portfolio is made up of financial instruments which are highly vulnerable to rises in interest rates, the county said.</p>

Dani Nur-al-Din, our  correspondent in al-Nabatiyah, has just told us that Israeli  warplanes are raiding positions in the al-Zahrani River basin  and the periphery of Jabal al-Rayhan.    The raiding planes have made four sorties.    Our correspondent also says that Lebanese Army antiaircraft  guns in al-Nabatiyah are confronting the raiding Israeli planes.  Over the telephone, we can hear the sound of heavy gunfire and  the explosions of shells dropped by the Israeli aircraft.</p>

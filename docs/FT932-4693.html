			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Land Rover deal to sell in Japan under Honda banner THE Land Rover Discovery, the successful UK-built four-wheel drive vehicle, is to be sold under an alias in Japan as the Honda Crossroad in a move to tempt Japan's domestically-biased new car buyers. Rover said last night that the deal was 'unique in modern automotive history, because it is the first time that a Japanese car manufacturer has put its own badge on a foreign car for the Japanese market'. Imports captured only 4 per cent of the Japanese car market last year. Land Rover is to create 300 jobs at its Solihull plant in the UK to increase Discovery production from 700 to 900 a week from September as a result of the deal with Honda and to meet demand in some European markets, in particular the UK. The workforce will rise to 8,400. The plant should receive a further boost next year, when the Discovery is scheduled to be launched in the US through the UK group's own distribution network. The Discovery was launched in Japan in 1991 through the Rover dealer network, but the marketing agreement announced last night will give the UK vehicle maker access to one of Honda's domestic sales channels and promises to double Discovery sales in Japan. Honda is planning sales of more than 1,000 in the first year. The deal marks a further step in the far-reaching alliance between Honda and Rover. The Japanese carmaker already holds a 20 per cent equity stake in the Rover vehicle operations, and a large part of the modern Rover car range is based on Honda technology. The Land Rover Discovery marketing deal for Japan is the first time that the product flow has been reversed. Honda lacks a presence in the fast-growing world market for four-wheel drive leisure/utility vehicles, unlike its domestic rivals Toyota, Nissan, Isuzu and Mitsubishi Motors. For North America it reached agreement late last year with Isuzu to sell the US-built Isuzu Rodeo four-wheel drive leisure/utility vehicle under the Honda name. The deal with Land Rover is aimed at filling the same gap in its product range in its domestic market. Honda also imports the rival Jeep Cherokee from the US, but for sale under the Jeep brand.</p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Singer &amp; Friedlander plunges to Pounds 3.2m after property provision PRE-TAX profits at Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant banking and property group, plunged to Pounds 3.25m in the half year to June 30, against Pounds 8.11m. However, the decline reflected a Pounds 5.29m write down of the value of properties held for long-term investment. Operating profits before the exceptional item were Pounds 8.54m (Pounds 8.1m). The provision was made against the 1987 revaluation of the properties concerned and was said to leave them substantially above their original cost. The group's properties are virtually fully let, with negligible arrears. Mr Anthony Solomons, chairman, said banking profits of Pounds 4.76m (Pounds 4.28m) were continuing to improve, despite difficult market conditions. Cash in hand was Pounds 70.5m at end-June, down from Pounds 123.6m a year earlier. Advances to customers were Pounds 255m (Pounds 265m). Earnings per share declined from 2.59p to 0.5p, though without provisions, they would have increased by 19 per cent, partly reflecting the buying in of 14 per cent of the ordinary capital. The interim dividend is unchanged at 1p.</p>

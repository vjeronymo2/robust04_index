			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House Trafalgar's defence was always going to be hobbled by the close reporting season and a shortage of time. Given these constraints, yesterday's document is not a bad effort. Trafs has provided the most solid evidence to date that it is not in serious financial trouble. Cash flow in the six months to September seems to have been a lot better than the market was expecting, and there are no covenant problems with its banks. Claims for the quality of the businesses - and their international spread - are by now familiar. But the formal acknowledgement of plans to realise value through disposals - and of the need for fresh boardroom blood - can be read as positive signals. Obviously Trafalgar's image remains dogged by accounting controversy and unanswered questions relating to the size of future property write-downs. This makes valuation especially hazardous. On the basis of most outside estimates and the Keswicks' involvement in the first place, though, it is not unreasonable for investors to assume that there is more than 85p a share waiting to get out. The only worry about staying for the ride is that if everyone takes the same view Hongkong Land may end up without a large enough stake to make itself heard. That argument, though, is flawed. Change is already underway at Trafalgar - life in the Ritz canteen will never be the same again - and even with just 15 per cent Land should be able to act as a focus for effective shareholder pressure. The threat of ultimate takeover, moreover, will surely concentrate minds.</p>

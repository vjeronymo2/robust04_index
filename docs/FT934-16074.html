			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Tebbit forecasts fresh divisions over Maastricht THE Conservative party has bridged its disunity over the Maastricht treaty but could face further divisions in the European parliament elections in June, Lord Tebbit said last night. Lord Tebbit, one of the strongest Conservative opponents of the treaty, said the party was 'completely agreed' about the free-market vision for the EC set out by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in a recent article in The Economist. His comments, at a debate on the future of Conservatism with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, reflect a widely held rightwing view that the prime minister has embraced many of the objectives of the party's Euro-sceptics. Lord Tebbit said he would not campaign for Conservative candidates in the European elections who endorsed the party's links with the 'federalist' European People's party grouping in the European Parliament. In a jibe aimed at alleged federalist sympathies among Conservative MEPs, he said many were angry about the prime minister's Economist article because 'they think he has sold out to the British people'. Lord Tebbit said that he believed a widespread boycott of 'federalist' candidates by Euro-sceptic Tory party workers was unlikely. But he warned: 'I can only campaign for some (candidates) and I shall campaign for the guys I like.' He told the meeting, which was organised by The Sunday Telegraph, that Conservative voters wanted 'to be able to vote for real Conservative candidates,' committed to a manifesto based on Mr Major's article. 'The danger is that if the candidates don't say the things and stand for the things which Conservative voters like, you can't go into people's houses and grab them by the scruff of the neck and force them out,' he said. Mr Clarke said he had no sympathy for European federalism, and suggested that European Monetary Union was unlikely to occur until after the present generation of political leaders had left parliament. He said the Conservative party was not committed to the federalist objectives of other members of the EPP, which was a coalition of like-minded but not identical national parties.</p>

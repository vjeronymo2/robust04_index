			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: SALTING AWAY TIPS ON SEAWATER AQUARIUMS.  </P> <P> Almost every kid has had a freshwater aquarium, stocked with the usual goldfish  and guppies.  </P> <P> But for adults who have maintained an interest in fish as pets, the  expectations and rewards from their hobby -- along with their tastes -- may  have grown a bit more elaborate.  </P> <P> Enter the saltwater aquarium, a high-tech version of the ordinary fish tank  whose upkeep requires more skill, more money, a basic knowledge of  sophisticated aquarium-keeping techniques and a little more patience to  maintain.  </P> <P> But the rewards too can be greater: the psychic satisfaction of mastering the  mechanics of seawater aquariums, as well as the visual beauty of the rainbow  variety of marine life they offer, including brightly hued tropical fish, sea  anemones, starfish, crabs, and other aquatic plants and animals that normally  subsist only in the briny deep.  </P> <P> At the Cabrillo Marine Museum on Saturday, 13 amateur aquarists with a passion  for tropical marine life gathered for a class led by Lloyd Ellis, the museum's  chief aquarist, on how to set up, stock and maintain seawater aquariums.  </P> <P> The class included some basic tips on the technical aspects of seawater  aquariums, such as the use of hydrometers to measure salinity and  dechlorinators to transform ordinary tap water into aquarium-ready freshwater.  After the water is dechlorinated, a synthetic sea salt is added to bring the  water to proper salinity.  </P> <P> The six-hour class also included such practical tips as how to tell a sick fish  from a healthy one (avoid fish that are sluggish or appear battered, Ellis  advises).  </P> <P> Art Bernstein, an attorney from West Los Angeles who has maintained a saltwater  aquarium for three years, said he set it up by trial and error after reading  several books on the subject -- and "lost a lot of fish in the process."  </P> <P> Bernstein was at Saturday's class "to pick up some pointers," he said. "I used  to have a freshwater tank but these are much more fun. The fish are brighter  and much more colorful."  </P> <P> Claremont teacher Elaine de Wet, attended the course with her daughter, Kathy,  an underwater photographer. De Wet said that the course had given her ideas to  take back to her sixth-grade classroom to incorporate into her science  curriculum and that the museum will be a destination for a class field trip  next school year.  </P> <P> Steven Maier, a physician, said that he has had a fish tank sitting empty in  his house for three years and that maybe the class would give him the  inspiration to set it up "pretty soon.".  </P> <P> As a medical student in the Philippines, Maier said, he kept a saltwater  aquarium with moray eels and other marine life in it, but the creatures died  when his girlfriend put in a decorative seashell that seeped a poisonous dye  into the water.  </P> <P> "It's a good idea to find out the right way to do it," Maier said. "When you  walk into a pet store there's so much equipment to choose from. . . . I have a  B.A. in biology, but I don't know if it prepared me for this."  </P> <P> Preparing amateur aquarists to confront the often bewildering array of  equipment needed to set up saltwater aquariums is one aim of the class,  instructor Ellis said.  </P> <P> Ellis provided students with a list of the basic equipment needed, from the  tank itself to a synthetic seawater kit, special sand or marine gravel for the  tank bottom, carbon filters, air pumps, tubing and special thermometers.  </P> <P> Ellis discussed the science of seawater aquariums -- including the advantages  of natural material such as sand and ground oyster shells for filtering  bacteria, compared to dyed or synthetic materials. But the class focused mostly  on practical maintenance tips.  </P> <P> "Even a subtle thing like putting your hand in the tank, if you have on hand  lotion, over a long period of time can affect the quality of the water," Ellis  said. "If you're going to spend $10, $15 or $20 on a fish, you don't want them  to die."  </P> <P> Museum aquarist Jeff Landesman, assisted Ellis in teaching the class, setting  up a saltwater aquarium to show the students how it is done.  </P> <P> Students also toured the museum's own seawater tanks, which are now dismantled  while a water refrigeration system for storing the seawater is replaced. The  rest of the museum, including scientific exhibits and slide shows, remains  open, a museum spokesman said.  </P> <P> Many students said they came away with a renewed appreciation for marine life.  </P> <P> Ed Lai, a Torrance engineering manager, said his 10-gallon seawater tank is a  constant source of wonderment to his two children -- even though his youngest  daughter is only 4 months old. Lai, who said he keeps sand crabs, scorpions and  starfish in the aquarium, said he too is constantly amazed by the unending  variety of sea life.  </P> <P> "I'm inclined toward nature," Lai said, "and to be able to observe sea animals  in your home where you can watch their behavior over time, that to me is very  satisfying."

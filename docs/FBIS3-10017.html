			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Oscar Echenique Bustillo] </F>   [Text] News from Washington is that the Pentagon itself has  disclosed that their U.S. military aid to the rest of the world,  especially continental Latin American countries, will soon be  reviewed. At the same time, the Pentagon admitted and confirmed  that it trained military leaders from Latin American countries,  which were later charged with violating human rights in their  respective countries.    Regarding this, sources from President Clinton's own  administration have confirmed that the review the Pentagon  refers to began after it was reported that 45 Army officers from  neighboring El Salvador, who were trained in the United States,  have been implicated in the massacre of unarmed civilians in El  Salvador during the 1980's. This has been confirmed in a report  by a special UN commission, appointed to investigate this, and  recently delivered to the amazement of the peoples the world  over.    The special UN report revealed in detail who and how six  Jesuits were murdered in a San Salvador university, clearly  establishing the Salvadoran Army's responsibility in this crime,  which shook the world at the time.    What is most ironic in all this is that the Salvadoran  military members were trained in the School of Americas at Fort  Benning, Georgia, United States, not to kill priests, but to  defend democracy and human rights in their country and in Latin  America.    The review the Pentagon refers to is to determine which  countries are to receive U.S. military and police training and  equipment.    The situation taking place in the United States is of such a  nature that many of the human rights defense groups in that  country are pressuring President Clinton to change its programs  for International Education and Training and for Foreign  Military Financing, created to encourage stability, democracy,  and respect for human rights in U.S. allied countries and  especially in our Latin American countries.    There is awareness in the United States that money from  "gringo" tax payers has been used in the name of the defense of  democracy and respect for human rights, precisely to violate  those rights in the countries from which these soldiers came,  and were educated, taught, and trained in U.S. military schools.    In the name of human rights and using democracy as a  pretext,  savagery has been committed in Latin America against the  civilian population, and this continues. One can very well say  that in a certain way the United States has much to blame with  what has taken place with regard to human rights, which still  continues to happen in our countries.</p>

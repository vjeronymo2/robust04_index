			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Meyer tumbles 32% and sells lossmaker for Pounds 19m MEYER International, which owns the Jewson builders' merchant chain, is ending an expensive three and a half year long foray into heating and plumbing distribution with the sale of Cadel to BSS Group, writes Jane Fuller. The extraordinary losses made on the sale, associated closures and goodwill adjustments total Pounds 41m. Acquired with the UBM builders' merchants branches in a part-exchange deal with Norcros in 1988, Cadel lost Pounds 5.3m last year. Mr Richard Jewson, Meyer's chairman, said the business had reached the point of 'double or quits' and the group had decided 'to bite the bullet and get out'. With net debt unchanged at Pounds 102m at the end of March, gearing went up from 37 to 40 per cent because of the reduction in net assets caused by the Cadel provisions. The Pounds 19.1m phased proceeds of the sale would at least restore gearing to the lower level. He admitted that the Cadel venture had proved a mistake, but pointed out that it came with UBM which had been incorporated into Jewson. A the same time Meyer announced a 32 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 36.1m) on flat turnover of Pounds 1.13bn in the year to March 31. The pre-interest profit figure of Pounds 39.3m (Pounds 52.8m) included Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 5.3m) of gains on property disposals. Net interest costs fell Pounds 2m to Pounds 14.7m. The 202-strong Jewson chain made an operating profit of Pounds 18.1m (Pounds 26.9m) on sales of Pounds 409m (Pounds 419m). Market share had increased, but prices had come under severe pressure and that had continued into this year. Forest Products made Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 13.3m) profit on Pounds 213m (Pounds 231m) turnover. Timber prices were no higher than in 1985. Both subsidiaries were sensitive to the level of house moves, because of the link with renovation and new building. The number of moves had dropped from 2.1m in 1989 to 1.2m last year. Private housing starts fell from about 220,000 in 1988 to 135,000 in each of the last two years. PontMeyer, the Dutch subsidiary, improved to Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 7.6m) profit on Pounds 234m (Pounds 243m) sales. The growing German business was being incorporated into it. Earnings per share fell to 19.2p (27.9p). An unchanged final dividend of 12.3p maintains the total at 16.5p. COMMENT It was mea culpa day for Meyer as Cadel made its final dents on the figures. Yet no one suggested the business should have been kept. Mr Jewson stressed the group would now 'stick to its knitting', namely the strong market positions of Jewson, Forest Products and PontMeyer - with its promising German dimension. It is a pity that they are saddled with relatively high group interest payments as well as with severe price competition in the yards. Critics rub salt in the wound by saying that if only Pounds 80m had not been wasted on Cadel and the abortive bid for Travis &amp; Arnold, the company would look wonderful. Now that it is down to its core, the question revolves around the housing outlook. Mr Jewson did not help the bulls' cause by saying there were no signs of recovery - and when it did come it would be flattened by the ERM and low house values. Pre-tax profit estimates range from Pounds 24m to Pounds 28m, excluding property, giving a prospective p/e approaching 20 times. The price has fallen from nearly 500p last August/September to 368p. For believers in housing recovery, it is at least a hold.</p>

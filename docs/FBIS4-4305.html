			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- The Rev. Kim Song-pok,  chairman of the Independent Reunification Committee of the  Inchon Federation for Democracy and Reunification of the  Fatherland in South Korea, called for the repeal of the  "National Security Law" (NSL) and the legalization of the  National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminnyon).    In an article contributed to HANGYORE SINMUN on March 16, he  urged the puppet authorities to scrap the NSL, an  anti-reunification evil law, and send back to the North old men  Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, who have been kept in prison in South  Korea for refusing to be converted after they were arrested  during the Korean war (June 25, 1950- July 27, 1953).    He also demanded that the authorities legalize the  Pomminnyon, not branding it as an "organization benefitting the  enemy", and guarantee the activation of the civilian  reunification movement.</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH BEAT: BUDGET TREKS THAT GO A LONG WAY  </P> <P> TrekAmerica will offer budget trips this winter to such warm-weather  destinations as Mexico and Florida, in addition to a variety of Southern  California venues.  </P> <P> A 20-year-old company that specializes in economical camping tours for  travelers between the ages of 18 and 38, TrekAmerica was created to provide an  inexpensive way for British youths to visit North America. It now offers 20  programs stretching from Mexico to Alaska, with groups that often include  Australians, Europeans, Israelis, South Americans and North Americans traveling  together in 13-passenger vehicles.  </P> <P> Expenses are reduced by camping. Two people share a four-person tent.  Equipment, except sleeping bags, is provided. Occasional nights are scheduled  at hotels for an extra $25 per person. Participants also pay about $30 per week  to a food kitty, which covers supplies for three meals most days.  </P> <P> This winter TrekAmerica will operate:  </P> <P>  -- 11-day Florida tours that depart from Miami and include visits to the  Florida Keys, Kennedy Space Center, the Everglades, Disney World and New  Orleans for $650 (air fare is extra on all programs).  </P> <P>  -- 25-day Mexico tours that leave from Mexico City and include visits to  Oaxaca, Puerto Escondido, Tulum, Cancun, Merida and Vera Cruz for $970.  </P> <P>  -- 21-day Los Angeles-to-Mexico City programs for $770 and 46-day Los  Angeles-to-Mexico City tours for $1,650.  </P> <P>  -- 14-day tours of Baja California, departing from Los Angeles and reaching as  far south as Cabo San Lucas, for $510.  </P> <P>  -- 21-day tours between Los Angeles and New York City for $890.  </P> <P>  -- 14-day tours from Los Angeles that include visits to San Diego, the  Colorado River, Tucson, Grand Canyon, Zion Canyon, Las Vegas, Death Valley and  Disneyland for $640.  </P> <P> For details, contact a travel agent or TrekAmerica, P.O. Box 1338, Gardena  90249, (213) 321-0734.  </P> <P> It's now easier for travelers to find low-cost lodging in London. In August,  the London Tourist Board began, for a small fee, to provide an "on-the-spot"  reservation service for accommodations at six of the city's international youth  hostels.  </P> <P> The average fee for a night's accommodation in a dormitory-style room is $18  for travelers 21 or older. Guests under 21 are charged $15 per person. If you  are not a member of a national youth hostel association, you also are required  to purchase a guest pass for $2.60 per night.  </P> <P> Paying for the reservation service will be most attractive to travelers who  don't want to chance hauling their luggage to a hostel, only to find it full.  </P> <P> The fee for the reservation service is $3 per person, to a maximum of $9. The  service is offered by London Tourist Information Centres at the Heathrow  Airport underground station, Victoria station, Liverpool Street station and at  the centers in Harrods and Selfridges department stores.  </P> <P> One problem faced by backpacking travelers to Australia is the large increase  in independent hostel facilities. Some are quite good, but others don't meet  fire and health regulations and it can be a lengthy process for the courts to  close them. So exercise caution when choosing where to stay.  </P> <P> The Queensland Youth Hostel Assn. recently announced that it has ceased its  association with the Brisbane hostel, 390 Upper St., and is opening a new  facility at 53 Quay St.  </P> <P> The new hostel will accommodate up to 80 travelers in double and four-bed  rooms. It's a five-minute walk from the Brisbane Transit Centre and a 10-minute  walk from the city center. Kitchen facilities will be open to guests, and there  will be a cafeteria and tour booking agency.  </P></p>

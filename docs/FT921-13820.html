			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Trustee acts to safeguard contributors' pensions THE TRUSTEE of the Maxwell Communication Corporation pension fund is taking steps to protect the interests of MCC employees who are still making contributions to the fund. The pension fund was looted by Mr Robert Maxwell and faces losses of about Pounds 50m. MCC employees have become concerned that their current contributions would benefit those already drawing a pension, rather than being invested to secure their own future pensions. To prevent this, Law Debenture, the independent trustee is seeking the Inland Revenue's approval to set up a 'limpet trust', which would receive all future contributions of MCC employees and ensure that all such contributions were earmarked for the paying members' benefit. Until the limpet trust is set up, employees' contributions will be paid into a newly opened deposit account, in the joint names of Law Debenture and Price Waterhouse, the administrators of MCC under UK insolvency law. If the limpet trust is approved the money in the deposit account will be transferred to the trust. If not the cash will be returned to the contributing employees. Law Debenture also confirmed that it has issued instructions to the pension plan managers restricting the rights of potential pensioners. It has, for the time being, prohibited transfers into or out of the plan and forbidden the payment of lump sums on retirement. Refunds of members' contributions and early retirement pensions have also been proscribed.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Piano men hit wrong chord FOLLOWING the death of my eldest brother, my surviving brother was appointed executor of the estate and decided to dispose of some furniture, starting with the piano. A professional piano restorer paid cash and took it away. In moving it he and his helper apparently scraped the common stairway wall in several places. The building's management company sent a bill for repairs to the solicitors administering the will and estate, who assigned Pounds 500 to cover repair costs. I suggested to the solicitors that the restorer was to blame and should pay. After some correspondence, including threat of legal action, the restorer agreed to pay half. In law, who should be held responsible for repairing the damage? These events took place in Scotland. It is clear that the executors of your brother's estate have a right of relief against the restorer and his helper. The management company is seeking full payment from the executors, but the executors can in law seek full reimbursement from the perpetrator of the damage if they can prove the removal was negligent. The executors might not wish to incur the legal costs in trying to recover the remaining 50 per cent but, from the facts given, it would appear likely that they have grounds to do so. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

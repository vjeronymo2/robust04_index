			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Slimmer leopard tries to change its spots - Damian Fraser talks to Francisco Rojas, head of Pemex, Mexico's state oil company Mr Francisco Rojas is an unlikely head of the world's fifth largest, and almost certainly most politicised, oil company. A public accountant by training and nature, he had never worked for an oil company, or in the higher levels of the private sector, or held elective office, when he was appointed head of Pemex in February 1987. He had spent practically all his working life supervising government spending in the budget and finance ministries. But it was precisely the qualities of a politically loyal, tight-fisted bureaucrat that endeared him to the then president, Mr Miguel de la Madrid, and subsequently to his successor, Mr Carlos Salinas. Pemex, and its union, had a well-deserved reputation for woeful inefficiency, corruption, and over-manning. Mr Rojas was under orders to cut out the fat. That is just what he has done. The Pemex union has been destroyed, and from being one of the most powerful in Mexico, is now probably the weakest. The collective labour contract has been re-written, giving management carte blanche to do as it likes. Mr Rojas expects to have slashed the workforce to 125,000 this year, from 210,000 workers in 1987. The company, which explores, produces, refines, and sells oil, gas and petrochemicals, reckons it has cut operating costs by some 20 per cent since 1986. At same time, oil production is around 2.67m barrels a day, up from 2.51m b/d in 1987, while refining capacity has increased. With labour reforms under his belt, Mr Rojas is now concentrating on the restructuring of Pemex into a corporate holding company and four subsidiaries - exploration and production, refining, gas and basic petrochemicals and petrochemicals. While formally announced a few months ago, the restructuring is the culmination of a long-term (and arguably unachievable) plan: to turn Pemex into a profitable, international oil company, without admitting competition on to its home turf. 'The fundamental philosophy' says Mr Rojas 'is the management of all operations under commercial and international terms . . . We have developed a system of prices that we are going to apply across all inter-company contracts.' Under the new system, cross-subsidies between subsidiaries will be removed, and thus the performance of each subsidiary can be easily evaluated. While a system of transfer prices has been tried before, Mr Rojas says it will now be easier. 'Before we had to have a system of transfer prices that was unreal, detached, separated from real accounting of transactions between divisions; today we have companies and commercial prices. That is one, that is a huge difference we are dealing with.' Each division will have to publish its results separately, which will be compared with those of international companies. Mr Rojas suggests that eventually investment in a division will depend on its profitability, and thus on the probable return on capital. Pemex will start this strategy with the petrochemicals division (the only one open to the private sector). Petrochemical plants that are not profitable will be closed, or sold off; those that are, may receive capital. In this way the efficient parts (by international standards) of Pemex could grow, and the inefficient parts be left to fold. An incentive to be competitive would have been established. The restructuring is above all intended to force Pemex middle management to change its way of thinking. In the past, says Mr Rojas, 'there was no criteria of the maximisation of profits, there was no business criteria in the activities of Pemex. What they demanded of Pemex was that it supply effectively all the hydrocarbon needs of the nation and there is no doubt it did it. No doubt. 'Now we have changed. We not only want supplies, but we want international supplies at international competitive prices. Thus we need not only to be effective, but efficient. This is the change in which we are emerged . . . not only thinking how to do things in engineering terms but how engineering things are profitable in business terms.' Of course as long as Pemex remains a monopoly, efficient business-like parts of the company would have to continue relying on the inefficient parts of the chain for providing basic services. In part to overcome this weakness, Mr Rojas is at the same time forcing Pemex to contract out more and more work to domestic and foreign drilling and construction firms. A host of foreign firms are drilling for oil or building platforms for cash (not prohibited by the constitution); others are bidding to build refineries. Eventually - although Mr Rojas was even vaguer than usual on this - subsidiaries of Pemex might have to compete against private-sector companies to win the business of another arm of Pemex. If so, the Pemex monopoly in effect would have crumbled. While industry observers of Pemex tend to applaud such declarations of Mr Rojas, many remain sceptical. Mr Rojas fought tooth and nail against Mexico's trade ministry to avoid making oil concessions to the US in the North American Free Trade Agreement. Unlike many members of Mexico's government, he appears to be a true believer in the merits of a national, state oil industry. Mr Rojas thus appointed a member of the old guard at Pemex to run exploration and production, the most important division. Mr Rojas remains head of the board of each of the four divisions of Pemex, belying the decentralisation of power the new regime is supposed to encourage. The Pemex holding company will continue to allocate resources, evaluate results, and set company strategy for its four subsidiaries. But Mr Rojas is like all Mexican government officials above all a loyal servant to his president. His given role is to restructure rather than dismantle Pemex, and cut its costs. And in that job, narrow as it may be, he is usually given high marks.</p>

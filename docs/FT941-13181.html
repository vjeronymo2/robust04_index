			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / State power company to offer 20 per cent of capital to public The company which runs Russia's electricity grid and owns part or all of various power plants said yesterday it would offer 20 per cent of its capital to the public, as part of the country's mass privatisation campaign, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. The decision appears to be an attempt to satisfy the government's need to make shares available to the public free of charge, in exchange for their privatisation vouchers. The sale is unlikely to change the way the company, United Energy System, is run. The government will keep 51 per cent and will continue to control electricity prices. Mr Anatoly Dyakov, the chairman, denied the company was a 'monopolistic monster', although his deputy said the share sale's attractiveness lay in the fact that the state retained control of prices. Mr Dyakov admitted that consumers, particularly industrial users, owed Rbs2,000bn (Dollars 1.3bn) in unpaid bills.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Canada sees sharp rise in budget deficit Canada's budget deficit will be almost 40 per cent higher in the current fiscal year than previous estimates, Mr Paul Martin, the finance minister, said yesterday. Blaming a combination of over-optimistic forecasts by the previous Progressive Conservative government, a burgeoning underground economy and unexpectedly large tax refunds, Mr Martin said that the shortfall for the year to March 31 1994 was now projected at CDollars 44bn-CDollars 46bn (Pounds 22.3bn-Pounds 23.3bn). The Conservatives last spring forecast a deficit of CDollars 32.6bn for this fiscal year. 'We are going to have to restore control over the nation's finances,' Mr Martin said. The new Liberal government last month revised the estimate for the 1992-93 deficit upwards from CDollars 35.5bn to CDollars 40.5bn. The revised forecasts, which were widely leaked last week, had a limited impact on financial markets yesterday. By midday, the Canadian dollar had lost about a third of a cent to 74.90 US cents. The size of Canadian federal and provincial budget deficits has for some time been a source of concern to foreign investors. Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency, last week downgraded Ontario's credit rating. Mr Martin's strategy for containing the deficit will emerge in his first budget, due to be tabled early next year. But he reaffirmed yesterday the Liberal election campaign pledge to bring the budget deficit down to 3 per cent of gross domestic product by 1996-97 from 5.9 per cent last year. He added however, that achieving this target 'will not be easy, to say the least.' One economist said he was encouraged by signals that the Liberals plan to overhaul the budget-making process and seek a more co-operative approach in fiscal policy between Ottawa and the provinces. The Conservatives consistently failed to meet their deficit-reduction targets during their nine years in office. The budget estimates made earlier this year were based on a 1993 growth rate of 2.9 per cent, rising to 4.6 per cent in 1994. These forecasts have now been scaled back to 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent respectively.</p>

It has become known from reliable sources that the decision  was taken "on the basis of the president's recommendation  pending the consideration of an item to this effect at a  Federation Council meeting in accordance with Article 102 of the  Russian Constitution".    The need to appoint an acting prosecutor-general arose in  view of the resignation of Aleksey Kazannik from the post on  Saturday.    Kazannik disagrees with the release, by a State Duma  decision, of those guilty of the October 3-4, 1993, bloodshed in  Moscow, and regards it as unlawful and uncoordinated with law  enforcement agencies.</p>

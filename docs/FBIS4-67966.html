			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by S.H. Venkatramani] </F>   [Text] There has been considerable media cerebration about  the precise diplomatic strategy that India should adopt to  prevent and pre-empt the United States from selling F-16s to  Pakistan. The debate has begun to acquire a certain sense of  urgency because of the impending visit of the Prime Minister,  Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, to the U.S. What has accentuated the  strategic importance of carrying conviction to Capitol Hill on  the F-16s is the attempt by the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State,  Mr. Strobe Talbott, during his just concluded visit to Delhi, to  convince India about the strategic wisdom of the U.S. parting  with 38 F-16s to Pakistan in return for the latter capping its  nuclear programme.    Our sense of judgement is clouded at the moment by the  political and emotional aftermath of the significant recent  visits of Mr. Talbott and his immediate junior, the U.S.  Assistant Secretary of State, Ms. Robin Raphel. On the one  hand, Mr. Rao felt a compelling political need to talk tough  with Mr. Talbott; on the other, Delhi could not help but betray  its sense of lurking fear about the F-16s adversely altering the  balance of power in the subcontinent. I would argue that it is  a deep-rooted sense of culture and conviction, independent of  the immediate provocation, that we have to exhibit in responding  to the question of the U.S. sale of F-16s to Pakistan. Instead  of giving the impression that we are merely opposing the sale of  the F-16s, we should broaden the base of the diplomatic debate  to discuss the nuclear question per se.    We have consistently refused to sign the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] on the ground that it was  discriminatory. We have taken an issue-based position on the  NPT. I think it similarly behooves us as a nation to take a  principled stand on the broader nuclear question itself, instead  of treating the F-16s as an immediate expediency.    What this means is that we have to take a position not only  against the sale of F-16s to Pakistan; we have to fight against  the unwitting dissemination of American nuclear weapons  technology around the globe; more, we have to crusade against  the spread of U.S. nuclear reactor technology itself to the rest  of the world.    India should seize the F-16 opportunity to nail the American  nuclear lie. Delhi can take up the cause of effectively proving  that there is no such thing as a safe nuclear reactor  technology. Every nuclear reactor produces, among several other  radioactive by-products, 400 to 500 pounds of plutonium  annually. You need just 10 to 20 pounds of plutonium to make a  bomb. Therefore, the yearly radioactive waste discharged by an  average nuclear reactor holds enough toxic potential for the  manufacture of anything from 20 to 50 atomic bombs. Through  plutonium, nuclear reactor technology and nuclear weapons  technology have become inseparably interlinked.    The ecological hazardous potential of plutonium should not  be  underestimated at all. Named after Pluto, the Greek God of the  underworld, plutonium is the most long-lived radioactive  by-product of a nuclear reactor; it remains poisonous for at  least 500,000 years. Just think for a moment that this stretch  of time is more than 100 times longer than the entire span of  recorded history. It is more than 50 times longer than the time  that has elapsed from the end of the Ice Age to the present day.    Less than one millionth of a gram of plutonium can cause  cancer. One pound of plutonium, if uniformly distributed  throughout the earth, can afflict every human being with lung  cancer. It is crucially important to realise that plutonium in  the environment does not vanish with the death of an infected  organism. A contaminated dead animal, for instance, may be  eaten by another animal; it may also rot away, and mix with the  soil. In any case, plutonium will remain in the environment,  and will continue to poison one organism after another, one  living being after another, for half a million years.    It has been authoritatively estimated that if the American  nuclear industry expands according to current projections, and  somehow manages to miraculously contain its plutonium with 99.99  percent perfection, it will be responsible for 500,000 fatal  lung cancers every year for 50 years after 2020 AD. This  incidentally will amount to a 25 percent increase in the total  death rate in the U.S. It is to be clearly understood that  there is no putting the clock back on plutonium after it gets  created as a byproduct; there is no unscrambling of the  scrambled egg; there is absolutely no foolproof method of  containing plutonium after it is made. As American nuclear  technology seeps to the rest of the world, tonnes of plutonium  are bound to get routinely transported across highways and  through rail roads.    India should work for adequate universal appreciation of the  fact that at every step in the process of generating nuclear  energy there, is continuous and invisible radioactive poisoning  of both the workers in the nuclear industry and the entire  natural environment. From the mining, milling and enrichment of  uranium to the fabrication of fuel rods, the operation of a  nuclear reactor and the handling of nuclear waste, there is  radioactive contamination of the human and physical environment  at every stage. The radioactive substances that continuously  escape into the atmosphere from the site of a nuclear reactor  emit a range of subatomic particles that can penetrate your skin  and damage your body cells. You also stand the risk of taking  in radioactively polluted food or water that can do you  incalculable internal harm.    All the advancements in American technology have not yet  found a solution to the serious problem of decommissioning a  nuclear reactor at the end of its useful life. The development  and proliferation of the so-called faster breeder reactors only  carries the nuclear risk a step further. These reactors use  plutonium itself as a fuel and are much more dangerous than the  ordinary commercial reactors. India can demonstrate its  deep-rooted ecological sensitivity by driving the point home to  the world at large that there is no such thing as a safe level  of nuclear radiation, contrary to what the American nuclear  industry would have us believe. It is relevant to note that  Ralph Nader had made the point somewhere that nuclear power has  become in many ways America's ``technological Vietnam.''    It would be a little sad if Mr. Narasimha Rao were to cosy  up  to Uncle Sam to stop the sale of F-16s to Pakistan. The  Pressler amendment and the F-16 should be just flea-bites in the  Indian-world-view. If India were to take up the cause of the  development of technology for effectively harnessing solar  energy, like, for instance, the development of commercially  viable photovoltaic cells to covert sunlight into electricity,  well, that would, mesh in with our native culture of concern for  the environment. After recently espousing the cause of ``the  middle path'' in the U.K., it will only be in the fitness of  things if Mr. Rao were to give a call, for a transition from a  poisonous nuclear era to a promising solar age, in the U.S. Mr.  Rao should take the bull of the American nuclear industry by the  horns rather than merely oppose the sale of F-16s.</p>

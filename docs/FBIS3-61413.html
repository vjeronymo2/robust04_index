An amorphous strip of  Fe[.sub]80[/]B[.sub]10[/]Si[.sub]10[/] measuring 20  m in thickness and 10 mm in width was used for the studies.  The alloy was obtained by enriching iron with 2 atomic percent  of the stable isotope [.sup]57[/]Fe to make it possible to  obtain quality Mossbauer conversion electron spectra in a  relatively short amount of time. The alloy strip was studied in  its initial state and after cycles of isochronous annealing in a  vacuum of about 10[.sup]-3[/] Pa for 1 hour at temperatures  of 50 to 800C. The specimens were also studied by x-ray  diffraction, Mossbauer absorption spectroscopy, and sliding-beam  x-ray diffraction. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the  Fe[.sub]80[/]B[.sub]10[/]Si[.sub]10[/] demonstrated  that in its starting state, it is amorphous. The first signs of  its crystallization, manifested in terms of the appearance of a  weak intensity against the background of the ``halo'' that is  characteristic of amorphous materials, were observed after  annealing at temperatures of 295-315C. As the annealing  temperature was increased, the percentage of crystalline phase  increased. The study  Fe[.sub]80[/]B[.sub]10[/]Si[.sub]10[/] was found to  undergo four stages of structural development: No structural  changes were evident at 0-300C. At 300-400C, a  body-centered crystal lattice with the characteristic close  atomic order similar to that in the amorphous matrix developed;  this process was accompanied by an explicit change in  orientation of magnetic moments. At temperatures of  400-500C, the percentage of body-centered crystal lattice  increased until the amorphous matrix completely disappeared  (after the specimen had been held for 1 hour at 455C), and  processes of close demixing began. At 500-800C, a  transition to an equilibrium phase diagram occurred. In its  equilibrium state, the specimen consisted of two phases: a  body-centered crystal lattice and Fe[.sub]2[/]B. The  Mossbauer spectroscopy studies pinpointed the temperature of  onset of crystallization at around 250C and indicated that  the crystal regions lie at a depth of about 15 nm. The first of  the above stages (i.e., 0 to 300C) included three stages of  structural relaxation. They were identified by changes in the  specimen's magnetic characteristics at 75, 175, and 255C.  No structural changes were evident in the first two stages. In  third stage, which is the most favorable from the standpoint of  optimizing the magnetic properties of amorphous strips and  increasing the stability of its properties over time, was  accompanied by the appearance of nanocrystal regions in the  near-surface layer of the amorphous strip's contact side.

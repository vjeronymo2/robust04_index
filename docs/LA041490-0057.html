			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE DOG STOPS SUSPECT IN CAR THEFT  </P> <P> A 27-year-old El Cajon transient was arrested Friday in Lakeside after leading  police on a chase that ended shortly after he rammed a Sheriff's Department  canine unit car, officers said.  </P> <P> The chase started Friday evening in El Cajon when police saw Christopher  Rossmiller in a car that had been reported stolen.  </P> <P> Officers radioed for assistance from the Sheriff's Department, said Sgt. Roy  Stamper of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Police pursued Rossmiller through Lakeside, traveling north on Highway 67 until  they reached a dirt lot by East Pino Road. The car driven by Rossmiller  stalled. When he restarted it, he rammed the car carrying the police dog Sarge  and continued out toward Lake Jennings.  </P> <P> The damaged Sheriff's Department car remained in the chase. When Rossmiller  reached Flynn Springs Road off Interstate 8, he jumped from his car and began  running through a mobile-home park. The German shepherd leaped after Rossmiller  and stopped him by fastening onto his groin, Stamper said.  </P></p>

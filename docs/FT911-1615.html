			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / World Trade News: UK exports to Gulf states down by 14% last year BRITISH exports to the six Arab Gulf states fell 14 per cent last year, largely because of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. But improved UK performance in North Africa and Iran helped limit the decline of UK exports to the Middle East to 5 per cent overall. In its latest analysis of trade figures, the government-sponsored Committee for Middle East Trade (Comet) said Britain still lagged behind Germany, the US, France and Italy in the region, but was ahead of Japan. UK exports to the Middle East fell to Pounds 5.66bn from Pounds 5.95bn in 1989. Of this Pounds 3.24bn came from the six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council. Apart from Iraq and Kuwait, only Algeria, Bahrain, Oman and Saudi Arabia cut their UK imports in 1990, but some markets were registering sharp falls early this year. Comet said: 'Given the loss of Kuwait and Iraq as export markets from August 1990, the drop is not as severe as might have been expected.' A 20.5 per cent fall to Pounds 1.93bn in UK exports to the vital Saudi Arabian market last year, could not all be blamed on the Gulf crisis and could have been affected by fluctuating deliveries of Tornado aircraft. Britain's performance in Morocco and Tunisia was encouraging. Some exporters to Algeria had problems with banks refusing to confirm letters of credit because of payment delays, but windfall hydrocarbon revenues seem to have been used to clear the arrears. France and Italy both performed well in the Maghreb, while Britain was unable to match the generous credit terms offered by its competitors. Improved UK links with Iran seem to be bearing fruit. Iran imported Pounds 393m of British goods last year, a rise of 53 per cent on 1989, and became Britain's fourth biggest Middle East market.  --------------------------------------------------------- UK EXPORTS TO THE MIDDLE EAST, 1990 (POUNDS M)  ---------------------------------------------------------                              1990     1989     % change  --------------------------------------------------------- N Africa                     840.8    786.1       7% Algeria                       70.1     74.4      -5.8% Morocco                      116.2     84.5      37.5% Tunisia                       42.1     31.1      32.4% Libya                        244.0    239.2       2.0% Egypt                        306.1    296.3       3.4% Sudan                         62.3     60.6       2.8% Gulf Cooperation Council    3243.8   3759.8     -13.8% Saudi Arabia                1935.0   2432.9     -20.5% UAE                          647.8    571.4      12.8% Kuwait                       177.8    228.7     -22.3% Qatar                         96.3     89.3       7.9% Bahrain                      125.9    138.6      -9.1% Oman                         261.1    299.0     -12.6% Others Iraq                         278.5    450.5     -38.2% Iran                         392.7    257.1      52.7% Jordan                       112.6    110.7       1.2% Lebanon                       52.5     48.5       8.3% Syria                         38.6     38.5       0.1% Yemen                         67.8     58.9      15.0% Turkey                       620.7    434.6      42.8%  --------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                       5655.3   5950.1      -5.0%  --------------------------------------------------------- Source: UK Overseas Trade Statistics  ---------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW VISA POLICY TO LIFT AIDS CURBS  </P> <P> Bowing to unrelenting international pressure, the Bush Administration on Friday  unveiled a special 10-day visa that does not require foreigners to declare  whether they are infected with the AIDS virus.  </P> <P> The new policy is clearly intended to avoid a widespread boycott of June's  international AIDS conference in San Francisco by AIDS activists and  researchers upset with previous immigration restrictions.  </P> <P> But while conference organizers were optimistic that the announcement will  bolster international participation at the meeting, the policy still left some  unsatisfied, and attendance for the meeting remained uncertain.  </P> <P> Until now, a foreigner infected with the AIDS virus had to disclose that fact  and then seek a waiver -- a procedure that many found offensive.  </P> <P> The new "short-term" visa will be available to visitors scheduled to attend any  professional, scientific or academic conference that has been deemed "in the  public interest" by Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of the Department of Health  and Human Services.  </P> <P> Friday's announcement, by the Justice Department and the Immigration and  Naturalization Service, said Sullivan has "certified" two such conferences: the  four-day, sixth annual International Conference on AIDS and the five-day 19th  International Congress of the World Federation of Hemophilia, to be held in  Washington in August.  </P> <P> "It remains to be seen whether this new policy will relieve the concerns of the  countries and health organizations threatening to boycott all international  health conferences in the United States," said Rep. J. Roy Rowland (D-Ga.) and  a member of the National Commission on AIDS.  </P> <P> "It represents progress, and all progress is welcomed. But, obviously, it is  not a resolution for the problems raised," added Dr. June Osborne, chairwoman  of the commission.  </P> <P> She was referring to the controversy over whether AIDS infection belongs at all  on a list of contagious diseases -- including leprosy, syphilis and  tuberculosis -- for which foreigners can be barred from entering the country.  </P> <P> Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was added to that list --  which is normally compiled by the U.S. Public Health Service -- by Congress in  1987.  </P> <P> Following prolonged and vocal protests from groups that included the  International Societies of the Red Cross and the World Health Organization, the  federal Centers for Disease Control last February recommended that all but  active tuberculosis be expunged from that list.  </P> <P> "Clearly HIV does not belong on that list," said Osborne, dean of the  University of Michigan School of Public Health.  </P> <P> But Bush Administration officials have said that it would take another act of  Congress to remove HIV infection from the list.  </P> <P> Last week, Rowland introduced legislation that would grant Sullivan the  authority to do so.  </P> <P> Rowland on Friday called the new visa policy "a positive step forward," but he  said that "more needs to be done."  </P> <P> Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) agreed, adding: "The Administration needs to  continue to work with Congress in order to realign U.S. immigration policy with  sound public health principles."  </P> <P> Among those who remained unappeased by the new visa was Dr. Mervyn Silverman of  the American Foundation for AIDS Research.  </P> <P> "I'm terribly disappointed because, on a scale of 10, this is probably a minus  2," he said. "It misses the point. The issue isn't the 1990 conference. The  conference only focused attention on what is very poor policy."  </P> <P> Dana Van Gorder, a spokesman for the San Francisco conference, said: "I would  think this change will secure the continuing sponsorship of WHO and the  International AIDS society."  </P> <P> But he added: "I don't think this will impress in the least some of the other  boycotting organizations." Among them are the French and Swiss health  ministries.  </P> <P> To date, more than 6,000 scientists, public health officials and AIDS workers  from around the world have registered for the meeting, with organizers hoping  for as many as 12,000 attendees. Last year, 11,200 persons attended the fifth  annual meeting in Montreal.  </P> <P> Staff writer Victor Zonana in San Francisco contributed to this story.  </P></p>

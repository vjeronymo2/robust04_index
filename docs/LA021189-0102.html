			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RALLY EARNS CAMARILLO SHARE OF TITLE  </P> <P> Now that Camarillo High has won its half of the Marmonte League title, is it  too late to start asking questions about these guys?  </P> <P> Somewhere, an "inquiry" light is still flashing after the Scorpions' 65-57 win  over Newbury Park Friday at Newbury Park.  </P> <P> The Scorpions have actually won their photo finish with co-champion Simi  Valley. Based on a league point system, Camarillo (17-6, 9-3) will be the  league's top-seeded team in the upcoming playoffs.  </P> <P> But what about those questions?  </P> <P> Is David Harbour, who leads the team in scoring and assists and is among the  leaders in rebounding, really a sophomore? How many years did he stay back,  anyhow?  </P> <P> And how about point guard Rick Schnell? Why has nobody heard of his defense,  his ballhandling?  </P> <P> Did forwards Jason Hunt and Scott Foster teethe on barbells as infants? These  two look like they could bench-press the team bus. Heck, slap another Yugo on  each side of the bar.  </P> <P> And forward Frank Dews? The guy is too consistent. Mix in an off-game, Frank.  Only Hunt and Dews are seniors. Is it too late to break up the Scorpions?  </P> <P> Too late, perhaps, for the league, as Camarillo became the first team in four  years other than Simi Valley to earn part of the league title. Against Newbury  Park, the Scorpions did it with Harbour, who scored 23 points, including six of  13 shots from three-point range. And Dews, who added 16, two from 12 feet away  with 1:55 left that gave Camarillo a 58-54 lead.  </P> <P> And Foster, who had 12 rebounds plus a layup with 12 seconds remaining to seal  the win. And Schnell, who scored a sneaky 12 points. And Hunt, who played  rugged defense despite a badly bruised right hamstring.  </P> <P> All so simple? Not really. Newbury Park, led by Wayne Cook's 20 points and 11  rebounds, trailed, 45-35, but rallied to take a 52-51 lead with 5:38 left on  Cook's 16-foot jump shot.  </P> <P> However, free throws by Dews and Foster and Harbour's sixth three-point basket  gave the Scorpions a 56-52 lead they never relinquished. Harbour, who had  struggled for two games, had finally broken out.  </P> <P> Said Coach John Harbour: "He came through and hit some big shots for us. He  (always) thinks he's going to make the next five. And that's a quality you've  got to have."  </P> <P> Certainly so against Newbury Park (13-10, 4-8), which but for some poor  free-throw shooting (the Panthers missed the front end of five one-and-one  opportunities), could have upset the Scorpions.  </P> <P> The inquiry light, by the way, is out. Camarillo is heading to the payoff  window. Or should that be playoff window?  </P></p>

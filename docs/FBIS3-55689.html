			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From ELTA "NEWS BULLETIN" No. 411] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, Jan 10, ELTA -- Lithuania did not suddenly  decide to join NATO, President Algirdas Brazauskas told a news  conference on Monday [10 January].    Consultations upon NATO membership began in mid-1993 and a  letter to NATO secretary-general Manfred Woerner was sent last  October. Brazauskas was induced to formally apply to NATO by "a  resolution concerning NATO membership accepted by various  parliamentary factions on December 23 and NATO summit taking  place on January 10-11 in Brussels". By the way, Lithuania's  application was received and distributed to NATO leaders and a  "preparatory work" had been done, Brazauskas said.    Brazauskas confirmed he consulted with Latvian and Estonian  presidents before sending the entrance application and they had  approved the Lithuanian step. Besides Russian reactions already  announced in the press, Brazauskas said he did not receive any  other statements from the leaders of that country.    Waiting for an answer from Brussels, it is worthless to  expect any concrete date of admitting Lithuania into NATO,  president said.    He noted a lot of money would be needed for integration into  NATO. More than five per cent of national income -- 130 million  Lt [litas] /about 33 million dollars/ -- are allotted to the  needs of National Defence system this year. But it would hardly  be enough to reconstruct Lithuania's military structures  according to NATO standards, so Brazauskas is "expecting support  from other states as well".</p>

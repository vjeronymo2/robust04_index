			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Books: Resistance territory SECRET WAR: THE STORY OF SOE by Nigel West John Curtis/Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 20, 305 pages AS THE Second World War recedes from view, disappearing into the dead ground somewhere between 'contemporary' and 'modern' history, the number of writers who understand the true political nature of the conflict is diminishing. This is, to some extent, inevitable. Participants in what was, in reality, an ideological war of far greater complexity than can be defined by citing 'fascism,' 'democracy' - or 'communism' - by rote are ageing. Relatively few of these participants in an ideological conflict which, by Britain, was fought largely by clandestine means, have now the inclination to tell us what this war was like for them and the resistance movements in enemy-occupied territories. Some accounts of SOE (the Special Operations Executive) are being written by those who do understand the underlying political realities. Histories narrating heroism, tragedy and turpitude are in train concerning the Low Countries, Italy, Greece and Yugoslavia. But some of these histories have been long in the works. Press on, gentlemen, please] A generation is coming to maturity to whom the Second World War in occupied Europe is little more than ''Allo, 'Allo.' In the meantime, one has to do with popular or populist accounts of the shadow war. Although the work under review is not immune from factual errors and does reflect the author's political prejudices, Secret War is important, even necessary, in historical terms. The book raises, if unwittingly, the central issue in an ideological war of unprecedented ferocity. The Second World War brought resistance movements into being which possessed a singular highest common factor, well-defined by a senior member of SOE who in no sense could be called a man of the Left: 'These people (resistants) were not necessarily, or even mainly, the people who had hoped things would go back to being just what they had been when it began. They were risking their lives for war aims of their own, which differed in many important respects from ours.' Precisely: what French resistants called a necessity for a national return to moral, rather than political standards, defined as pure et dure was, in Winston Churchill's eyes, and those of his few close associates, a revolutionary demand. This demand, moreover, was not only inimical to men of the Right, but possibly damaging to British interests. It is just on this central issue that Mr West, devoting most of his text to it, goes so sadly astray. He seems convinced not only that SOE was tasked to 'set Europe ablaze' by supporting resistance movements in sabotage operations and the like, but was riddled with men of the Left - and beyond - who were the conscious or innocent tools of a fiendishly cunning Soviet plan to subvert first an occupied, then a liberated, Europe in the attainment of Stalin's imperial objectives. That the Soviet dictator had such objectives for Europe as a whole is possible, although one should always be mindful of de Gaulle's 1944 appreciation that 'Stalin's ambitions are vast but finite.' But setting that debate aside, it is simply not the case that SOE was either as described by Mr West or was tasked to support revolutionary resistance. Impeccable establishment figures like Fitzroy Maclean, Bill Deakin and Christopher Woodhouse, to say nothing of many lesser but eminently reactionary types, all of whom fought hard in the shadow war, have testified in writing to the fact that SOE's support for resistance movements was entirely governed by one basic criterion: were the movements in question an 'adjunct' to Britain's wartime and post-war strategic and political objectives, or were they, directly or otherwise, hostile to them? If the answer was construed as 'yes,' SOE was tasked to support movements: if 'no,' to lay off, or even oppose them. The evidence for this policy is abundant - indeed, much of it has been published. There is another area in which Mr West goes astray. He seems convinced that SOE, as a body, both formulated and executed policy for the direction of clandestine war. It must be emphasised to any who seek understanding of how Britain, an empire in decline, waged its last global war, that there was only one arbiter: Winston Churchill. He could be overruled - notably by the chiefs-of-staff - but where clandestine operations were concerned, above all in their political context, he spoke and decided with an unambiguous, authoritative voice. That Eastern Europe was sacrificed to Stalin's ambitions - a fact on which Mr West quite rightly dwells - reflected strategic realities, cold-bloodedly appreciated by Churchill from 1940 onwards. SOE simply did not come into this picture because, whatever the politics of its men and women in the field, Eastern Europe was not an area in which it could operate effectively.</p>

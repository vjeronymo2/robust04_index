			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Nissan chief accuses Iacocca of 'outrageous remarks' MR Yutaka Kume, president of Nissan Motor, yesterday made a stinging attack on Mr Lee Iacocca, chairman of Chrysler Motor and a leading US critic of Japanese business practices. Mr Iacocca had accused Japanese business and government leaders of duplicity following the recent visit to Japan by US president George Bush, during which the Japanese pledged to make an effort to increase sharply the imports of US-made cars and car parts. The pledges were part of an effort by the two countries to reduce Japan's Dollars 40bn (Pounds 22bn) trade surplus with the US. Mr Kume said: 'In international business circles, Mr Iacocca's remarks and behaviour are outrageous and insulting to us. 'I just cannot tolerate his remarks that the Japanese government is a liar.' His comments, made during an interview with a group of journalists, including one from the Financial Times, are very unusual for a Japanese business leader. They reflect growing resentment over what are seen in Japan as unjustified and politically motivated attacks on the country. Mr Iacocca accompanied Mr Bush on his visit, and along with the chairmen of General Motors and Ford met the leaders of Japan's automotive industry. Mr Kume said: 'At the meeting we offered the best we could do. But in response the US side's endeavours are not so evident. The reaction of the US side is incomprehensible to me.' While Nissan was able to live up to its pledge to purchase more US components, it could not guarantee the sale of US cars, even though it was making arrangements to market Ford vehicles through its own dealer network. 'We are ready to sell US vehicles in Japan, but there are some conditions attached,' Mr Kume said. The US companies had to conduct market research and modify vehicles to meet Japanese consumers' tastes and requirements. 'It is up to them to make the effort,' he said. The tough attitude of the Nissan chief is unlikely to go down well in Washington, where a range of protectionist legislation has been proposed in the Congress aimed at cutting the US trade deficit with Japan. US-Japanese relations have been buffeted by a series of highly publicised disputes, on issues ranging from automotive trade to remarks by a senior Japanese politician suggesting that US workers are lazy and illiterate. Reuter adds from Brussels: The US-Japanese car trade agreement is 'more cosmetic than real', Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, president of the Association of European Automobile Constructors, the EC lobby group, said yesterday. He said his group did not intend to challenge the accord under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Auto war clash, Page 3</p>

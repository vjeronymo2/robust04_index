			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Polish seat plant to cost Dollars 50m FORD is investing Dollars 50m in a green field operation in Poland to make seat covers for export to its own car plants and other European vehicle producers. The plant at Plonsk, some 60 miles north-west of Warsaw, is planned to come on stream in 1994 and will employ up to 1,000 people. The Plonsk facility is the third manufacturing venture by Ford in central Europe since mid-1992. Until last year, Ford had been among the more cautious of western vehicle producers in establishing a production presence in the region. However, it has identified Poland, Hungary and the former Czechoslovakia as offering the best potential for Ford's strategy to establish a stronger presence in the emerging economies of central and eastern Europe. Earlier this month, it acquired Autopal, a Czech components manufacturer specialising in automotive lighting and heat exchanger equipment including air conditioning. That acquisition provided Ford, for the first time, with an in-house capability to produce lighting in Europe. Initially, it is expected to produce 600,000 sets of covers a year for Ford Escort and Orion models. Starting in 1995, production is planned to rise to 1.1m a year with the addition of supplies for the Ford Fiesta. Ford is to build a Dollars 50m technical centre near Tokyo with the aim of strengthening its ability to supply US-produced components to Japanese vehicle makers. The centre, due to become operational by mid-1995, will employ 80 people.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 8 KYODO -- Some two dozen Chinese  wartime victims will start besieging the Japanese Embassy in  Beijing with telephone calls for five days from Monday to  protest former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's denial of the  1937 Nanjing massacre, Chinese sources said Sunday [8 May].    The sources said the angry Chinese are not satisfied with  Nagano's resignation and are demanding an official apology from  the Japanese Government.    The Chinese are also seeking a specific guarantee from Tokyo  to avoid a repetition of such remarks questioning Japan's  wartime aggression, the sources said.    The sources said the war victims have decided to employ the  telephone tactic because it is difficult for Chinese to stage  demonstrations.    The sources were alluding to the arrests of over 100 Chinese  for trying to demonstrate near the Japanese Embassy at the time  of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to Beijing in  March.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 4 May (NA) -- Reliable official  sources have indicated that, during a meeting with Economy  Minister Domingo Cavallo and Presidential Secretary General  Eduardo Bauza, Tucuman Governor Ramon "Palito" Ortega allegedly  tendered his resignation due to serious disagreements between  him and the ruling-party's bloc in the provincial congress.    Government officials calmed the provincial governor,  confirming their support for his government actions and  promising that they would seek a solution to the crisis as last  night similar reports noted that top-level government circles  were drawing up a decree on the intervention of the Tucuman  congress.    Official sources unofficially reported that Justicialist  Party [PJ] provincial legislators have been urgently summoned to  the federal capital to meet government officials within the next  few hours at Government House to seek a "political solution"  before implementing a federal solution.    Ortega yesterday received the support of President Carlos  Menem and that of his high-ranking government officials over the  "worrisome" opposition to his actions by the Tucuman PJ deputies.    Menem said: "We shall see what can be done, but the people  have elected them to legislate and not to block the actions of  those who are governing, as is happening in Tucuman."    Strongly supporting Ortega, Menem challenged: "It seems the  vice governor Julio Diaz Lozano very strongly opposes the  governor."</p>

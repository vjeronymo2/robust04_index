			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Management: Bouquets and barbed ire - Total Quality / Martin Dickson finds sharply contrasting views of a top US award Apostles such as Robert Galvin, chairman of electronics group Motorola, call it 'the most important catalyst for transforming American business' methods. Dissenters say it is nothing of the sort and may even represent a religious fervour of dangerous, destructive proportions. In its four-year life, the 'Baldrige' prize (more formally known as the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award) has become the subject of controversy among US management experts - a debate which has just intensified in the pages of the Harvard Business Review. The controversy is hardly surprising, since the award - ceremonially handed over by the US president to up to six companies a year - centres on a kind of corporate religion. The creed in question is Total Quality Management - TQM to the faithful - which has been one of the hottest topics in US business theory for the past decade. At its simplest, this means focusing all a company's energies on improving the quality of its work. The Baldrige gives awards to companies which have excelled at TQM, and winners undertake to share their knowledge with other US businesses. 'More than any other initiative, public or private, it has reshaped managers' thinking', says David Garvin of the Harvard Business School. It has set off 'America's rediscovery of co-operation as a national strength', adds Donald Peterson, Ford Motor's former chairman. Critics, however, fault it on a number of counts, complaining variously about its methodology, focus and philosophy. The most cynical point out that it has been won by subsidiaries of several large US companies which at present are hardly examples of financially successful American businesses - IBM, General Motors and Westinghouse Electric. All three are struggling and their shares have performed dismally in recent years. Indeed, some on Wall Street view a Baldrige award as the kiss of the death for a company's shares. The debate may find some echo over the coming months in Europe, which has copied the idea of the Baldrige: next autumn, the Dutch-based European Foundation for Quality Management will hand out its first award for TQM. The origins of the Baldrige lie in a simple American emotion: fear of the efficiency of the Japanese industrial machine and a desire to emulate it. There is great irony in this, since modern theories of quality control originated in the US between the first and second world wars. But US companies largely ignored the ideas and it was left to the Japanese to apply them rigorously, a lesson they learnt from US advisers sent to rebuild the shattered economy in the late 1940s. In the early 1950s, the Japanese instituted their own quality prize and named it after W Edwards Deming, the foremost of those American advisers. The US finally followed suit in 1987 with the Baldrige award, which was named after a US Commerce Secretary who died in a rodeo accident. It is run by an offshoot of the Commerce Department, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and gives up to two awards a year in each of three categories - manufacturing, service and small business. Companies nominate themselves and have to submit a lengthy application form describing their quality practices and performance. Those which score well are visited by a team of examiners for a detailed look at their operations. What are the Baldrige judges looking for? Firstly, adherence to the underlying tenets of the quality movement. These include a belief that the customer is the most important judge of a company's quality. It is also deemed important for the company's top management to create clear quality values, that the workforce be fully involved, and the whole enterprise aim for continuous, long-term improvement. Companies should also be trying to build bridges with outsiders, such as suppliers and the local community, and be responsible corporate citizens. The judges examine a business under seven categories, awarding points in each area. In order of priority, these are: customer satisfaction, quality results, human resource development and management, management of process quality, leadership, information and analysis, and strategic quality planning. The current controversy was set off by the Harvard Business School's Garvin, a former member of the Baldrige's board of overseers. In a lengthy article in the Harvard Business Review, he claimed criticisms of the award represented 'deep misunderstandings', and concluded the Baldrige was positioned just right. That sent many management gurus rushing to their word processors. The issues in the ensuing debate include: Financial performance. Garvin and his supporters say it is meaningless to fault the Baldrige for not rewarding financial success since it is not meant to measure this, but total quality management processes. Financial success can depend on other factors, such as luck. Nevertheless, Garvin reckons the award is a 'strong predictor of long-term survival'. Critics say the award does not honour superior product or service quality, pointing to the example of General Motors' Cadillac division, which won the award at a time when surveys showed American consumers did not rate its cars very highly. Again, Garvin dismisses this as beside the point, saying the Baldrige is not meant to reward product excellence alone, but more a company's management systems and processes. The Baldrige bashers say this approach sends the wrong message to corporate America. Says Phil Pifer, of management consultants McKinsey: 'The Baldrige needs to reinforce that 'just do it' is not enough if you don't do it right'. The philosophy of the award. The critics say that no coherent philosophy underlies the Baldrige, unlike its Japanese equivalent, which is based firmly on the ideas of W Edwards Deming - himself a strong critic of the American prize. Since the world of TQM is so full of clashing academic egos, each with its own approach, the organisers of the award merely lay down a list of broad quality criteria, without prescribing how a company should achieve them. Garvin defends what he calls this 'non-denominational approach, with a strong ecumenical flavour', but says it does not mean that the award lacks a general philosophical direction. The impact on US companies. Defenders of the Baldrige say that it has had a significant effect in waking up American managers to the need for TQM - a prime reason for starting the award in the first place. According to Robert Galvin at Motorola, another past winner: 'Those companies that embrace the Baldrige are beginning to make giant strides. The difference between the alert business leader's attention to quality today versus 10 years ago is like night and day.' However, the critics say there is a grave danger that the Baldrige, with most of its points going to management processes rather than market place results will simply encourage a knee-jerk, 'check the box' approach to quality issues. McKinsey's Pifer warns that his consultancy is 'seeing a disturbingly large number of companies whose total quality management programmes are failing to show signs of meaningful business impact. More and more senior executives privately express reservations or concerns to us about the eventual impact of their quality activities.' An important contributory factor, he says, is a blind pursuit of TQM, when quality or the other benefits of such a programme may not be the most important priority for a company. 'The Baldrige award contributes to this problem, by perpetuating the religious fervour and universal appeal of TQM.' Garvin, however, gives short shrift to such apostasy. And to those who argue that the Baldrige is stuck in the middle ground, neither a reward for all-round corporate excellence, nor narrow, traditional quality control, he says that that is precisely where it should be: any narrower and it would not attract the attention of top management; any broader and it would become impossible to judge. He does acknowledge one flaw - the award is a competition with a limited number of winners, rather than a qualification prize which any number can achieve. The latter approach, he says, would enhance the co-operation among businesses which the Baldrige is meant to promote. Yet Garvin's satisfied tone itself seems at odds with the spirit of the award, with its strong emphasis on the need for companies to strive for continual improvements in their working practices. As Shoji Shiba, a visiting professor at MIT's management school points out: 'When you consider something 'ideal', you lose the opportunity to improve it'.</p>

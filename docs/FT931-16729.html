			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Alfred McAlpine buys civil engineering side of AF Budge ALFRED McALPINE yesterday bought the civil engineering businesses of AF Budge, which went into receivership last month owing its bankers Pounds 20m. Budge's 26 current road and bridge-building contracts - many of them large infrastructural projects - will carry on under McAlpine and up to 250 on-site jobs will be saved. The deal is likely to lift Alfred McAlpine back into the top five of Britain's civil engineering contractors, alongside Tarmac, Balfour Beatty, Amec and Birse. Alfred McAlpine was nearly always in the top five in the first half of the 1980s but had fallen back in the past five years. Budge will also fill in a hole in Alfred McAlpine's national spread, as it is based in East Retford, Nottinghamshire, and is usually automatically asked to bid for public works in the East Midlands and East Anglia, where Alfred McAlpine has been weak. Alfred McAlpine, which has headquarters at Hooton, Wirral, will keep the East Retford offices going. It frequently bids for road-building work with Amec, based nearby in Sandiway, Cheshire. The Leeds office of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which kept Budge trading with 197 job losses after being appointed receiver, last night said it was close to clinching the sale of Budge's building division. The buyer is likely to be one of Kier, Ballast Needam, Try or Miller, all identified in undisputed trade press reports, along with Alfred McAlpine, as bidders for parts of the Budge business. Mr Ken Lever, finance director of Alfred McAlpine, last night refused to disclose the price of the Budge contracting business, claiming commercial confidentiality relating to existing contracts. However, it has to be less than Pounds 8.2m, which is 5 per cent of Alfred McAlpine's net assets of Pounds 164m, the level above which disclosure would have been compulsory under Stock Exchange rules. The acquisition will raise Alfred McAlpine's payroll to about 4,500, of whom 1,100 are employed in the US. Alfred McAlpine will also assume liability for about 80 recently completed Budge contracts, making good any defects. Budge's ongoing contracts include work on the A41 at King's Langley for the Department of Transport and the Black Country spine road.</p>

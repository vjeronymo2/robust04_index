			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Business as usual but City workers are apprehensive SIR Francis McWilliams, Lord Mayor of London, had an indifferent reception from commuters at Liverpool Street station as British Rail officials handed out 20,000 maps of the no-go area. The Lord Mayor's upbeat message was that it was business as usual but some workers were apprehensive about going back to their jobs. Mrs Barbara Hollis, 41, a switchboard operator for NatWest who is based in Broadgate, said: 'For the first time I am questioning working here. It's the NatWest Tower. I've got friends over there. I just think everyone feels the same - frightened.' Ms Michele Mumford, 25, an accounts manager for the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, said: 'It has put me off working in the City. The bombers have made so many hiccups so far, there's no guarantee they might not accidently set one off when there's thousands of people about. Mr Peter Davies, 56, managing director of Priceware, a financial information company in Staple Hall, Stonehouse Court, said his company, a start-up operation, had been due to open for business today. 'We were going live today. It doesn't look very like it now.' Police were allowing some workers into premises at the periphery of the cordonned-off area. Most key holders in the worst-hit areas were arranging passes but some sneaked through unofficially to make quick damage assessments. Businesses away from the heart of the blast were sweeping up glass in an attempt to open as soon as possible. Balls Brothers at the corner of Liverpool Street and Bishopsgate lost much of its wine but the manager, Mr Chris Atkins, said: 'Most of the best stuff seems to have survived.' The Suit Company, part of Moss Brothers, displayed signs offering bomb-damaged stock at up to 75 per cent off. Assistant manager Mr Peter Opie said: 'It's in the best Moss Bros tradition. We have brushed ourselves down and gone for it in the best way we can.' Mr John Emin, 22, an accounts manager at the Royal Bank of Scotland's premises on Threadneedle Street, spent the weekend at home in Braintree, Essex and had heard nothing from his company: 'I think the bomb was disgusting. I don't know if I'm outraged, it's more disbelief.'</p>

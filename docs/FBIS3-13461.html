The commander of the  area said the weapons included grenades and explosive charges.  They also had leaflets saying they had come to avenge the  Hebron massacre. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1600 GMT  on 12 March adds that "the leaflets also specified terms of  negotiations, in which the terrorists had planned to involve the  French ambassador in Israel."]    The commander added that there had been an increase of  terrorist activity in south Lebanon, and the wave of terror had  reached its peak.    The gang was on its way to an attack on one of the northern  border settlements. SLA soldiers noticed the band near Har Dov.  In an initial clash, one terrorist was wounded and captured and  three others escaped. Later, one of them surrendered to UNIFIL  [UN Interim Force in Lebanon]. The other two were killed after  a chase. [passage omitted]</p>

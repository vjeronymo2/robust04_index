			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Merinchyk, chairman of the oblast </F> organization of the Ukrainian Officers' Union (SOU); and Mykola  Kadrashchuk, chairman of the SOU Committee for Military and  Patriotic Indoctrination of Young People, by Bohdan Vivchar;  place and date not given: "For the Defense of Ukraine"--answers  to questions not attributed]    [Text]As has already been reported, the fifth  congress of the Ukrainian Officers' Union was held in Kiev. It  elected the new SOU [Ukrainian Officers Union] chairman -- Major  General Roy, approved the composition of structural bodies, and  introduced changes to the statutes. Our correspondent had a  conversation with delegates of the congress -- Ivan Merinchyk,  chairman of the oblast organization of the Ukrainian Officers'  Union; and Mykola Kadrashchuk, chairman of the SOU Committee for  the Military and Patriotic Indoctrination of Young People.    [Vivchar] Lately, much pressure has been exerted upon the  Ukrainian Officers' Union and patriotically minded servicemen.  This found its expression in the replacement of Defense  Minister Kostyantyn Morozov, who supported the SOU, and in  accusations that the Union was involved in political activity.    [Answer] National chauvinist forces in parliament, headed by  such notorious figures as Marchenko, Moroz, Charodyeyev,  Izmalkov, and others, are doing everything that they can to  discredit the SOU and mainly to eliminate it or, at least, to  isolate officers on active service from it. What is their goal?  To prevent the establishment of an independent Ukrainian state  through the building of strong armed forces. As long as  intentions are announced and declarations are made, our  opponents are still ready to listen to them. However, as soon  as specific steps are made toward their implementation, the  entire communist gang immediately goes into opposition. Over  the time of its activity, the SOU has returned to Ukraine more  than 10,000 Ukrainian officers and has prevented the removal of  military property worth billions of U.S. dollars from the state.  It conducts a relentless struggle against those who do not like  the idea of building strong national armed forces.    [Vivchar] The SOU was also against the signing by President  Kravchuk of the Massandra agreements with Russia....    [Answer] Yes, we supported Defense Minister Morozov's  position regarding those actions. Nobody has any doubt that  this person is a patriot who did everything to enable our young  state to have a strong army, based upon national principles and  the interests of an independent Ukraine. Morozov opposed the  creation of a military alliance, resembling the Warsaw Pact,  among the CIS countries. At that time, the idea failed. By  removing Morozov from his post as defense minister, these  chauvinist forces are planning to draw Ukraine into a new  military alliance.    [Vivchar] How did the congress proceed?    [Answer] Let us point out that the destructive forces did  everything that they could to undermine its work. For example,  it was only at the last moment that delegates representing the  regular army were allowed to attend the congress. The  atmosphere that prevailed at the congress was one of unity  regarding ways of building up the Ukrainian Army and state and  emerging from the economic crisis. The participation of the SOU  in the Supreme Council elections was also discussed. It was  proposed that the Officers' Union consolidate its ties with  parties and movements of the democratic bloc, so that in the  case of a threat to the independence of our state, a single  front could be formed, not ruling out the revival of the UPA  [the Ukrainian Insurrection Army]. These ideas were mainly  expressed by delegates from eastern regions of our state and  were approved by guests of the congress, including  representatives of Russian Cossackdom and Cossacks from other  CIS countries, who stated their support for the struggle of the  Ukrainian people for Ukrainian independence.    [Vivchar] The congress expressed a readiness to participate  in the forthcoming elections?    [Answer] Yes, the SOU will nominate its candidates in all  the regions of Ukraine. It has called upon all citizens to take  part in the elections and to elect to parliament people who will  be able to extricate Ukraine from the crisis and to build up our  state. Representatives from the army are needed there. For  example, a tank that has no equal in the world was designed and  tested in Ukraine. For a whole year, the Cabinet of Ministers  did not find it possible to make a single step toward  manufacturing this machine and equipping the army with it.  Ukraine is destroying and scrapping tanks, and, at the same  time, the government refuses to sell them to other countries.  Instead, Russia is now selling them. This deal would have  earned our state the hard currency that we need so badly: By  selling 100 tanks, we would have obtained that same $175 million  that we are now begging from the United States.    [Vivchar] Such a policy also prevails in aircraft building,  space technology, and missile building. It is high time that  order were established in the state and something were done in  the interests of the people, instead of picturing us before the  world as beggars and turning us into genuine paupers. It  follows from everything that there exist influential forces that  want, at any price, to bring Ukraine to its knees, so that we  will again ask "Big Brother" to be our guardian.    [Answer] This is precisely what the Officers' Union is  trying to prevent. Had the power structures, starting from the  president and the government, fought for their own state and  against anti-Ukrainian forces in the Crimea and in other regions  with the same ardor as they struggle against the SOU, we would  by now have definitely made serious steps toward our statehood  and independence. However, despite everything, nobody will  manage to eliminate the Officers' Union, split it up, or divert  it from its goals. The decisions adopted by the recent congress  confirm this. The SOU is again ready to defend Ukraine.</p>

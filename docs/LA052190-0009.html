			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> HIGH CLERICS OF ART HAVE HAD ENOUGH;  </P> <P> FEDERAL SUBSIDIES HAVEN'T RESULTED IN MASTERPIECES, JUST A DRAIN ON THE  TREASURY.  </P> <P> The National Endowment for the Arts should be abolished. During its 25-year  life, NEA's billions in expenditures to subsidize the arts community would have  yielded a higher return on the taxpayers' investment if they had been dedicated  to the purchase of defaulted junk bonds.  </P> <P> The arts community should be embarrassed by its fortissimo howling and arpeggio  braying for more federal taxpayer dollars. Where are the great artistic  masterpieces that promise to live for the ages because of NEA financial  midwifery? Have there been any NEA-funded artists who would do honor to Van  Gogh, Picasso, Mozart, Rubens, Monet, Beethoven, Voltaire or Shakespeare? Are  there any NEA-supported gems that have proven themselves in the artistic  marketplace by commanding acrophobic prices at Southeby or Christie auctions?  These questions are studiously eschewed by the arts community because the  answers would be unflattering.  </P> <P> The arts community tacitly contends that the American public is too Philistine  to recognize artistic virtuosity and to offer voluntary monetary support. Thus,  it is condescendingly implied, NEA funds are required to overcome the artistic  backwardness of the typical federal taxpayer that warps the working of the arts  marketplace.  </P> <P> That arrogance echoes every special interest lobby in America clamoring for  government protection against free consumer choice and free-market appraisals  of their goods or services. It epitomizes cultural elitism that refuses to  contemplate that what is wanting in America's art life is not an enlightened  citizenry but better art. Are taxpayers to be scolded for failing to perceive  the terpsichorean vulgarities of Annie Sprinkle as a species of the Bolshoi  Ballet, or the photograph of a crucifix immersed in a vat of urine as a sister  of Van Gogh's "Irises"?  </P> <P> Many artists toil in austere ateliers because their lives acquire rich meaning  through artistic expression. They deserve community respect for the sincerity  of their artistic convictions, to which their frugal circumstances testify. But  what should be thought of an artist whose devotion is contingent on feasting  off taxpayer dollars? He is like the high clerics during the Middle Ages who,  after pledging poverty, chastity and obedience, demanded the rights to sell  indulgences and ecclesiastical offices to support mistresses and military  conquests. Genuine artists are made of sterner stuff.  </P> <P> NEA might be justified if its mission were transformed into a first cousin of  education. Suppose all of its funds were earmarked to promote the display and  understanding of acknowledged artistic accomplishment. That mission would  advance the government goal of public tutelage to strengthen community reason  and reflection, twin pillars of enlightened democracies. But, at present, such  NEA expenditures would be extravagant.  </P> <P> Every surplus dollar is urgently needed to underwrite earthbound basic  education. More than 25% of contemporary Americans are unaware that the Earth  orbits the sun. Scholastic Aptitude Test scores are abysmal. Occupants of high  office routinely mistake the Declaration of Independence for the United States  Constitution in official debate. Most college graduates would display  bewilderment if asked to elaborate the differences between the Ottoman Empire  and the Holy Roman Empire, or to recount the contributions to America of  Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, W. E. B. DuBois, Paul Robeson or  Langston Hughes.  </P> <P> In sum, federal taxpayer funding of arts education when the basic sinews of  education are atrophying is like giving chocolate cheesecake to a community  starving for protein nourishment.  </P> <P> Further, the strength, boldness and resiliency of the arts community as a  critic of government and society is endangered by NEA funding. Human nature  inclines most NEA grantees to feel a loyalty obligation to their paymaster --  and their laudable role as independent commentators, observers and appraisers  of American life suffers.  </P> <P> NEA's mad drilling for more than two decades to discover artistic genius has  produced nothing but dry holes. Nothing in the geology of the arts community  offers hope for a more auspicious NEA future. Chairman John Frohnmayer shows no  glitter as a talent scout for fledgling genius. Hasn't the time come to declare  NEA bankrupt and mercifully end the spoliation of the American taxpayer?  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At the national security work meeting held  yesterday, Gao Siren, secretary of the Guangzhou City CPC  Committee, urged party and government leaders of all units to  genuinely discharge their duties to safeguard the city's social  and political stability. In his speech, Gao Siren said: The  current outstanding problem endangering the city's social and  political stability is that the covert struggle is extremely  acute, and the activities of subversion, infiltration, and  division carried out by espionage agencies from outside the  borders against our country have never ceased for a moment. The  joining hands of the hostile forces at home and abroad has posed  a threat to Guangzhou's stability.    He pointed out: It is necessary to further mobilize to set  up a mass national security precaution structure, attach  importance to carrying out education in covert struggle, enhance  the alertness of the broad masses of people to the enemy's  presence as well as their sense of secrecy and of national  security so that everybody will foster the idea that it is  everybody's duty to safeguard national security and so that they  will dare and be good at using the law to struggle against all  actions endangering national security.    Guangzhou Mayor Li Ziliu also spoke at the meeting. He  pointed out: Some people have slackened their vigilance. They  only see prospects for economic prosperity and development and  are not alert to the enemy's presence and the sense of secrecy.  They leak out economic, scientific and technological, and  commercial secrets which should have been safeguarded. Some  people are afraid of strengthening secrecy for fear of scaring  foreign businessmen away. They are quite wrong. Leaders at all  levels should frequently stress the issue of secrecy and should  always keep it in mind.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Motions Filed: Attorneys for British heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne filed a  motion Wednesday for summary judgment in a federal court in Macon, Ga.,  requesting that a multimillion-dollar product liability lawsuit against the  rock star be dismissed. Osbourne is being sued by the parents of Michael  Waller, a 16-year-old who took his life after allegedly hearing pro-suicide  subliminal messages hidden in Osbourne's music. The motion states that expert  witnesses for the plaintiff deposed in Macon last month failed to provide  evidence of any subliminal content. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

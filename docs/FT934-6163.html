			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Japanese consortium wins Shanghai steel deal A consortium of seven Japanese companies has won a contract worth an estimated Dollars 500m to Dollars 600m (Pounds 340m to Pounds 408m) to supply equipment for a new steel production facility at the Baoshan complex, near Shanghai. The Japanese group, headed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Corporation, signed a contract at the weekend, despite a long history of problems at the plant, touted as China's largest industrial project when conceived two decades ago. Members of the consortium say they have been told by the Chinese partner not to release details of the contract, but the companies will supply equipment for a hot-rolled steel sheet facility capable of producing 2.8m tonnes a year. The Baoshan plant was plagued by problems after its conception, and a decade ago Japanese companies suffered when contracts to supply equipment were renegotiated by the Chinese government. Construction schedules had to be revised because the marshy plant site was far softer than estimated in a feasibility study and extra foundation work was necessary to stop the facility from sinking. Equipment exported from Japan was designed to process higher-grade ore than was generally found in China, forcing Baoshan to import more Australian ore than was planned. Meanwhile, the site's port was too shallow for large ore carriers to dock, forcing them to unload down river, increasing the transport costs. 'We think we will have no problems this time,' one of the Japanese companies said. Apart from MHI and Mitsubishi Corporation, the consortium includes Mitsubishi Electric, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, Nippon Steel, Chugai Ro, an industrial furnace maker, and Ube Industries, a chemicals and machinery producer It is understood that Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex corporation, which has traditionally relied on investment funds from the state, will be responsible for raising much of the finance for the expansion, to be completed in late 1996. The Baoshan complex produced 6.3m tonnes of steel last year, and is expected to increase its output to 10m tonnes by 2000, as part of a national plan to lift steel production from 80m tonnes last year to 100m tonnes by the century's end.</p>

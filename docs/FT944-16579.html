			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Ulster loyalists set to call ceasefire today Prospects for a permanent end to sectarian violence in Northern Ireland increased dramatically last night, after sources close to the loyalist paramilitary groups indicated a ceasefire announcement could come today. Representatives of the Combined Loyalist Military Command - the umbrella group for all loyalist paramilitaries - are to hold a press conference today, after reaching agreement in principle to call a halt. The ceasefire is expected to start at the weekend. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said a ceasefire was overdue but would be welcomed. 'We would want to see if it was conditional or unconditional. We would want, of course, to see if it was permanent,' he said in Bournemouth. 'We would look at it in precisely the same way as we look at the republican ceasefire announcement of the 31st of August.' An announcement today would be opportune timing for the government, with the Conservative conference due to debate the situation in the province this afternoon. Proceedings are likely to be heated, with the party's grassroots in the province seeking backing for an amendment urging the government actively to persuade Ulster that its best future lies within the UK. The announcement would also come just before Saturday's Ulster Unionist party conference in Carrickfergus. The peace process speeded up when the government gave loyalist leaders permission to enter the Maze Prison on Monday to hold talks with Ulster Defence Association and Ulster Volunteer Force inmates. Ministers in Bournemouth predicted today's move could pave the way for the UK government to give a conditional acknowledgement next week that the IRA intends its cessation of violence to be permanent. In the absence of an unequivocal IRA statement that it has permanently renounced terrorism, senior ministers have been discussing a formula under which they would state that it was their 'working assumption' that the IRA had renounced violence. That in turn would pave the way for an early lifting of the exclusion orders which prevent prominent members of Sinn Fein travelling to mainland Britain. It would also signal that the London government would be ready to engage soon in 'talks about talks' with Sinn Fein. It was also clear last night that the loyalist paramilitary organisations could not expect a place at the negotiating table to discuss a new constitutional structure for Northern Ireland. Ministers said the groups had 'no democratic mandate'. Rev Roy Magee, a Belfast minister who has had talks with loyalist paramilitary groups and is said to be close to loyalist opinion, indicated that political representatives of the paramilitaries will seek a place at the table in any talks which include Sinn Fein. 'Their views must be taken on board,' he said. High-risk Ulster vote, Page 12</p>

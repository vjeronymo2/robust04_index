			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] JINGJI CANKAO BAO carried a ten-part  series of articles on "Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried  Out by the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation" on 19-22  and 24-29 April 1994. All the articles except part seven, which  is not attributed, are written by JINGJI CANKAO BAO reporter Yu  Huiyin [0151 6540 7299]. Part one of the series is carried  immediately under the masthead and the rest are carried in other  places on page 1. The main contents of these articles are as  follows:    1. "Reform Is Aimed at Development--Enlightenment Gained  From Reforms Carried Out by the Beijing First Light Industry  Corporation (Part One)"    The article begins by saying: "Seizing the opportunity to  deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote  development, and maintain stability is the general task of the  whole party and the whole country. Reform and opening up are  the motive force for development, development and reform are the  foundation for the long-term social stability of the country,  and maintaining social stability is the prerequisite for  developing the economy and deepening reform." The article says  that development and reform are interdependent and that "it is  impossible to speed up development without speeding up reform."  "Reform should center closely round development and should  regard contradictions, difficulties, and hot spots emerging at  deeper levels in economic development as key points."    The article further says: "The most valuable thing of the  experience of the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation in  carrying out comprehensive and coordinated reforms is that it  has firmly grasped some most pressing problems in development  and steadily carried out reforms to gradually solve theses  problems and promote development." In view of its difficulties,  the corporation "put forward the basic train for thought for  carrying out comprehensive and coordinated reforms--`increase  the value of assets, relocate enterprises, change functions,  transform mechanisms, and make arrangements for surplus  workers,'--clearly put forward the target of preserving and  increasing the value of state-owned assets, focused attention on  comprehensively enlivening the state sector of the economy  instead of just individual state-owned enterprises in an  isolated manner, carried out reforms comprehensively instead of  item by item, and seized the opportunity to change structures  and mechanisms." The article then mentions the corporation's  achievements in increasing output value, sales volume, profits  and taxes handed over to the state, and workers' income.    In conclusion, the article says: "It should be pointed out  that damaging the fundamental interests of the state and people  should not be the price for development. The problem of serious  losses of state-owned assets cannot be solved without reform.  How to carry out reform? Can we rely entirely on selling  state-owned assets to foreign businessmen and individuals? Can  we blaze a new path by mainly depending on the strength of the  state sector of the economy, reallocating resources and  production factors, and reforming and changing the operational  mechanism, while guaranteeing the rights and interests of the  proprietors of state-owned assets, preventing loss of  state-owned assets, and guaranteeing the property rights of  enterprise legal persons as pointed out in the decision made at  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee?  These questions are worthy of constant exploration by people  including those of the Beijing First Light Industry system."    2. "Make Advancement as a Whole, Make Breakthroughs at Key  Points--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the  Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part Two)"    The article says: "To continue to deepen reform, we must  resolve contradictions at deeper levels. However, various  contradictions at deeper levels, which are intertwined, mutually  affected, and mutually conditioned, cannot be resolved with  reforms or readjustments carried out item by item."    The article says the Beijing First Light Industry  Corporation  has similar contradictions to resolve and tells how it has  resolved them: "It has organically integrated many items of  reform, including optimizing the production setup, changing  functions of government departments, changing operational  mechanisms of enterprises, training and placing surplus workers,  and establishing a modern enterprise system, and has pushed  forward reforms of state enterprises in a comprehensive and  coordinated manner. It has taken the enlivening of the state  sector of the economy as the center and of stock assets as a  point for making a breakthrough, and has increased the value of  state-owned assets."    In the end, the article tells how the Beijing First Light  Industry Corporation has succeeded in enlivening state-owned  enterprises in only one year: "The Beijing First Light Industry  system has shifted its efforts from enlivening individual  enterprises to enlivening state-owned assets, from carrying out  reforms item by item to carrying out comprehensive and  coordinated reforms, and from maintaining the traditional  enterprise system to establishing a modern enterprise system so  that state enterprises reorganize themselves in market  competition and generate new and greater vitality."    3. "Planning Leads to Economic Results--Enlightenment Gained  From Reforms Carried Out by the Beijing First Light Industry  Corporation (Part Three)"    The article first says: "Comprehensive and coordinated  reforms carried out by the Beijing First Light Industry system  have been based on the `Beijing General City Construction  Plan.'" According to this plan, the article says, "the role  played by tertiary industry in promoting the national economy  will become more and more evident. It is also possible to make  full use of limited land resources and to increase their  input-output rate.... To optimize the layout of the city, it is  necessary to gradually shift the focus of city construction from  urban areas to distant suburban areas and counties and to  develop city construction and to shift from extension expansion  to readjustment and transformation. The Beijing First Light  Industry system has precisely proceeded from this local reality,  endeavored on its own initiative to meet the objective needs of  readjusting the economic structure and developing tertiary  industry as mentioned in the General City Construction Plan, and  put forward the development strategy of relocating secondary  industry enterprises and developing tertiary and secondary  industry at a high level in suburban areas beyond the Fourth  Ring Road."    Then the article gives details of how "the Beijing First  Light Industry Corporation carried out comprehensive and  coordinated reforms, taking the enlivening of state-owned stock  assets including land resources as a point for making a  breakthrough." The article tells how the corporation moved its  enterprises out of urban areas and constructed office buildings  and residential quarters in former factory premises to develop  tertiary industry.  The article calls for learning from the experience of the  Beijing First Light Industry Corporation in attaching importance  to planning. In conclusion, the article says: "In carrying out  experiments at selected points on comprehensive and coordinated  reforms, various localities should do so under the unified  leadership of respective local governments and with unified  planning, and such experiments should be organized in a unified  manner. All the planning for development of various trades and  professions should be included into the general plan for local  city development."    4. "Enlivening Stock Assets Is a Big Issue--Enlightenment  Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the Beijing First Light  Industry Corporation (Part Four)"    The article begins by saying: "The characteristics of the  comprehensive and coordinated reform carried out by the Beijing  First Light Industry system are proceeding from putting property  rights relationships in order, operating and developing  state-owned assets in accordance with the needs of the market  economy, giving play to the role of differential benefits of  land resources, optimizing the allocation of resources, and  ensuring a constant increase in the value of state-owned assets  to strengthen the state sector of the economy. Some people  thought that the experience of the Beijing First Light Industry  system is mainly the development of real estate. They did not  correctly understand its basic experience and basic train of  thought."    The article goes on to give an account of how the  corporation's Hongyun Property Investment Company Limited  developed real estate and used the money obtained to relocate  plants, develop secondary industry at a high level, train  qualified personnel, and develop tertiary industry, which  provided lots of jobs for surplus workers.  The article then says: "Enlivening state-owned stock assets  is a point for making a breakthrough in the comprehensive and  coordinated reform carried out by the Beijing First Light  Industry Corporation. The connotation of stock assets is very  broad. It includes various tangible and intangible assets.  Enlivening state-owned stock assets is not confined to  readjustment of the direction of use of land, but also includes  improving operations, promoting technological progress,  improving enterprise management, improving the quality of  workers and staff members, optimizing the combination of  production factors, and so on. All these can enable existing  resources to produce greater economy results. The Beijing First  Light Industry system has, in light of different situations and  problems of enterprises, explored and adopted various ways to  enliven stock assets." The article then provides concrete  examples showing successes of the corporation in this respect.    5. "Surplus Workers Are Also Wealth of the  Society--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the  Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part Five)"    The article says at the beginning: "Making arrangements for  surplus workers is a prerequisite for the readjustment of the  industrial setup and enterprise structure and is also an  important issue which has a bearing on the success of reform and  social stability."    Then the article mentions difficulties in solving problems  in  making arrangements for surplus workers and writes about  effective methods adopted by the Beijing First Light Industry  Corporation--establishment of an insurance and compensation  mechanism for unemployed workers, the pooling of funds for  training and job assignment of unemployed workers, and the  establishment of a labor service development company. According  to the article, the labor service development company ran 14  kinds of training classes to enable workers to acquire knowledge  and skills needed for future jobs.    6. "Separating Government From Assets Is a Prerequisite for  Separating Government Administration From Enterprise  Management--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the  Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part Six)" The  article begins by saying that government departments in charge  of state enterprises should ensure an increase in the value of  state-owned assets and should also change their functions and  separate government administration from enterprise management so  that enterprises can carry out operations on their own according  to law.    The article then gives an important reason why it has  been so difficult to separate government administration from  enterprise management: "The government's social and economic  administration functions have not been separated from its  function as the proprietor of state-owned assets." The article  goes on to say that "to separate government administration from  enterprise management, the government must first be separated  from assets." According to the article, the Beijing First Light  Industry system has enthusiastically explored rational forms and  means of management and operation of state-owned assets  following the principle of separating government from assets.  "With the approval of the Beijing Municipal Government, the  Beijing First Light Industry Corporation, which originally  exercised the function of government administration, has been  transformed into a company which manages state-owned assets. It  exercises the function of proprietor of state-owned assets,  separates government administration from enterprise management  and investor ownership from the property rights of enterprise  legal persons. It increases the value of state-owned assets  through operating them, and gradually separates itself from the  functions of trade and social management on behalf of the  government. In addition, it has removed restrictions on  production and operation enterprises so that these enterprises  can exercise all rights according to laws of property rights of  legal persons, carry out operations on their own, and assume  sole responsibility for their profits and losses."    The article also says "there are other forms of management  of  state-owned assets, such as establishment of investment  organizations, foundations, and holdings companies," and  stresses that the success of such management is determined by  "whether or not property rights relations are put in order,  property rights responsibilities are clearly defined, and  enlivening the state sector of the economy and ensuring an  increase in the value of state-owned assets are taken as the  starting point and standpoint."    7. "Efforts Concentrated on Bringing Forth New  Systems--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the  Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part Seven)"    The article begins by saying: "An important standard for  assessing whether or not a reform is successful is whether or  not a comprehensive new mechanism is set up." Then the article  gives examples of how "the Beijing First Light Industry  Corporation seized the opportunity of urban transformation and  the readjustment of the production setup to develop potential  assets, and regarding this as a turning point, energetically  readjusted enterprise structures and changed the operational  mechanisms of enterprises. In developing the land resources of  former enterprises, "it established a new land use system" and  "succeeded in increasing the value of state-owned assets." The  article continues: "Regarding the distribution system, payment  of wages according to grades is changed into payment according  to contribution. Regarding the labor employment system, the  practice of an enterprise taking care of everything concerning  workers' employment is changed into labor employment based on  the ability of individual workers." Surplus workers are  "trained to enhance their skills and to improve their quality so  they can depend on their own ability to chose, or to be chosen  for, jobs amid market competition.... The demand on giving play  to the role of market mechanism runs through various links of  comprehensive and coordinated reforms."    The article gives as an example how the newly organized  Beijing Match Plant set up new mechanisms at the very beginning  of operations. "All wages are paid on a piecemeal basis and  production quotas are set. Pensions and insurance are covered  by the society.... Enterprises no longer bears the burden  concerning resignation and retirement of workers.... All workers  are employed on a contract basis and managing cadres are  employed by appointment." The article also says the newly  established Beijing Hongyun Property Investment Company Limited  "has established an entirely new operational mechanism and a  standardized management structure, and adopted operational  practices in accordance with the needs of the market economy....  There is no relationship of administrative subordination between  the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation, which has been  transformed into a company for managing state-owned assets, and  the Hongyun Company. The former does not exercise any  administrative function and as a controlling company, it only  enjoys benefits according to share rights and uses the rights of  shareholders to influence the behavior of the latter."    In conclusion, the article attributes the successes of the  Beijing First Light Industry Corporation to its efforts to  establish new systems.    8. "Rebirth Following a Natural and Unrestrained  Death--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the  Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part Eight)"    The article mainly recounts the fate of the Beijing Match  Plant, a plant selected by the Beijing First Light Industry  Corporation for carrying out experiments on reform.    The plant was an old one set up in the last years of the  Qing  Dynasty. It had 868 workers and 500 retired workers. It  suffered a loss of 2.5 million yuan last year. The plant was  moved to a rural area and became a joint venture with a local  enterprise. "The economic results of the new match plant have  increased as the strong point of having technical personnel of  an urban enterprise and the strong point of having greater  flexibility and running at a low cost as a rural enterprise  supplement each other." A real estate management company was  set up. The original premises of the Beijing Match Plant have  been built into a small residential area, and this has increased  the assets of the company from 10 million yuan to 110 million  yuan. The company has yielded great economic and social  benefits and has provided many job vacancies. "Of the 868  workers of the former match plant, 130 have been transferred to  the tertiary industry enterprise, 60 technical workers have gone  to the new match plant, 120 workers retired, and 558 are being  trained for other posts by the Labor Service Development Company  according to the needs of the market. The Beijing Light  Industry System uses part of the benefits obtained from  optimizing allocation of resources and increasing the value of  resources to set up a job-waiting insurance system, which  ensures the livelihood of workers being trained for new jobs,  supplements funds for training, and guarantees the stability of  the match plant."    The article concludes: "In this way, an enterprise which  suffered heavy losses was eliminated and two new profit-making  enterprises were born. Besides, the capacity for producing  daily necessities was preserved."    9. "It Is Also Necessary to Put In Less and Put Out More in  Reform--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the  Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part Nine)"    The article says "in carrying out reform of the economic  structure, it is necessary and possible to put in less and put  out more. This has been proved by the comprehensive and  coordinated reforms carried out by the Beijing First Light  Industry Corporation."    The article also says: "Practice has proved that enterprises  are carriers for the movement of capital. If enterprises do not  establish a mechanism which enables them to consciously seek an  increase in the value of their assets in accordance with the  intrinsic demands of the law of value and a modern enterprise  system which is in keeping with market competition and changes,  or if they do not carry out comprehensive and coordinated  reforms in the overall setting of enlivening the entire state  sector of the economy, it is impossible to fundamentally solve  the problems of enlivening state enterprises."    The article then writes about how the Beijing First Light  Industry Corporation succeeded in putting in less and putting  out more: "The corporation did not depend on tax reduction,  retaining more profits, or writing off past debts. Instead, it  regarded enlivening stock assets and increasing the value of  assets as a point for making a breakthrough, overcame the  difficulty of the shortage of funds, and created necessary  conditions for the placement of workers and the relocation of  enterprises. The placement of workers and the relocation of  enterprises provided a new opportunity for changes in  mechanisms, while changes in the functions of government  departments made it possible to change the mechanism of  enterprises. Reforms carried out in this way gave expression to  the unity between enlivening state enterprises and enlivening  state-owned assets, the unity between the readjustment of  production relationship and the readjustment of the productive  forces, the unity between economic results on the one hand and  social and environmental benefits on the other, and in  particular, the unity of reform, development, and stability."  In conclusion, the article says such reforms have "realized a  greater increase in the value of state-owned assets and are  conducive to strengthening the state sector of the economy and  to consolidating the leading position and giving play to the  leading role of state enterprises in the national economy."    10. "Support Comprehensive and Coordinated Reforms in a  Comprehensive and Coordinated Manner--Enlightenment Gained From  Reforms Carried Out by the Beijing First Light Industry  Corporation (Part Ten)"    The article begins by saying that "the reforms of state  enterprises is system engineering. Not only are various items  of reforms within enterprises interrelated, such reforms also  involve many aspects of the external environment, including  putting the property rights relations in order, changing  government functions, developing the market system, and  reforming the social insurance system."    The article then urges major leading officials of government  to personally strengthen unified planning for reform and urges  organizations of various sectors to coordinate. The article  says: "All departments concerned should proceed from the overall  situation of promoting the establishment of a modern enterprise  system, cooperate with one another, and enhance the smooth  progress of reform. Supporting comprehensive and coordinated  reforms in a comprehensive and coordinated manner is a demand  explicitly put forward by the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee  and the municipal government while giving direct leadership over  experiments on reforms carried out by the Beijing First Light  Industry Corporation and is also the successful experience of  the corporation in making a smooth progress in carrying the  reforms within such a short time."    The article then mentions how Chen Xitong, secretary of the  Beijing Municipal CPC Committee, Mayor Li Qiyan, and other  high-level officials handled official business at the Beijing  First Light Industry Corporation and how the State Commission  for Restructuring the Economy and committees, departments, and  offices of the Beijing Municipal Government helped solve  problems emerged in the reforms.    In conclusion, the article urges various localities to use  the experience of the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation  as reference and boldly make exploration and carry out reforms.</p>

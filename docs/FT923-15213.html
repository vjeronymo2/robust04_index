			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: The Fed cuts it fine The last US discount rate cut in December sparked off heavy buying of US equities on the basis that rates were so low as to make vigorous recovery a dead certainty. After that proved an illusion, it is tempting to shrug off yesterday's further half point cut as likely to lead to further disappointment. At some stage, however, the medicine will work. The problem is that even the best of forecasters can only guess when. Admittedly, one can exaggerate the degree to which the recovery has sputtered to a halt. The Fed's move probably had some political content. It equips the US to demand similar action from its G7 partners at next week's Munich summit. June's unexpectedly large fall in non-farm payrolls may also have been an aberration. But even if the Fed's response owes as much to the approach of the election as to economic necessity, it could never have contemplated acting so decisively had credit demand been stronger and money supply growth on target. The fall in bond yields over the past couple of months and their continued decline after yesterday's announcement indicates a remarkable absence of inflationary pressure. With a bit of luck, individuals and corporations may now resume debt refinancing at lower rates. Their greater sense of well-being could generate the confidence needed to boost the economy. An early sign of whether this is happening will come from the figures for new car sales in July. The currency markets seem prepared to give the Fed the benefit of the doubt. After an initial sell-off, the dollar reacted to the cut with singular calm. If US rates really have reached their low point, exchange dealers may soon start discounting an eventual narrowing of the interest differential with Germany and the dollar will recover. But that is still a big if. Meanwhile, Wall Street risks losing both ways. The flow of retail cash from the money markets could dry up while the recovery remains far from robust enough to justify present equity prices.</p>

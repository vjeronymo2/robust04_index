			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (10): In Tokyo, do not open the taxi door - Christine Buckley offers advice on what may be your first encounter in a foreign land The chances are that your first encounter in a foreign land will be with a taxi driver. The taxi ride from an airport is an important introduction to a country. Your impressions start here. The buzz of New York can begin with a chatty and helpful ex-boxer from Brooklyn, who wants to know all about London. But then, as he gathers that you're a complete newcomer, he may charge over the odds fourfold for a journey in a car which he has falsely assured you is a bona fide yellow cab in all but colour. Southern Turkey can seem even more laid back than one might expect if your driver just can't be bothered with basic traffic regulations such as red lights and has a similar disregard for sobriety. As one might expect, in standard, service and customs, taxis are as varied as the cities that they operate in. It is always a good idea to stick with the main licensed firm. While all independent companies do not deserve the sweeping suspicion they meet with, a stranger to a city cannot hope quickly to deter- mine the good from the bad. The flagship of the taxi world, if such a thing is technically possible, is generally held to be London. With the requirement that drivers have 'the knowledge' of the capital's streets, its standard of training is unsur- passed. The black cabs are plentiful and convenient, as they can be hailed easily in most central locations. They are also reliable and built for maximum efficiency in a city which has developed around historic streets that would have challenged the old horse power. The adage that London taxis can turn on a sixpence is not misplaced. But standards do not come cheaply. During the day, the meter will clock up a flag fee of Pounds 1 as you get in, which will take you just 504 yards. After that, it is 20p for the next 282 yards or 57 seconds and thereafter it is 20p for each 180 yards. Additional passengers make for a 30p charge. In some cities, taxi fares seem so high they come close to taking flight. Rates in Zurich begin at a start-up charge of SFr6 (Pounds 3) and proceed at SFr2.90 for each kilometre and an additional SFr1 each minute of waiting. Zurich cabs cannot be hailed in the street; they are picked up at ranks or by telephone when they, virtually without fail, will respond within 10 minutes. In Tokyo, one will need both a reasonable amount of cash - although that is not a surprise for a Japanese city - and also a map. Tokyo's taxi drivers are not the world's best navigators and it is advisable for passengers to know how to reach their destinations. The drivers are, however, polite and will always open the door for you via an in-car lever. In fact, it is bad manners for the passenger to open the door. The minimum fare is Y600 (Pounds 3.87); an average 20-minute journey will clock up a Y1,500-2,000 charge. Brussels also claims a place in the expensive stakes, although service is included, with tips incorporated in the meter charging. A passenger parts with BFr95 (Pounds 1.89) for just getting in the cab and then BFr38 for each kilometre after that. Again hailing is not generally practised but ranks are ample. If style is what you seek in a taxi then, true to form, Paris is the place to find it. Mercedes and top-of-the range Citroens are de rigueur. The daytime kilometre charge is FFr3.23 (39p) but in very slow traffic or when the taxi is waiting, the charge is based on FFr120 per hour. Try to have the right change or you are likely to experience Gallic irritability. Almost as symbolic of the taxi as the London's black cab is New York's yellow one. The streets of Manhattan are awash with yellow and the air is full of horn-blowing. New York cabs are fast and frenetic. Not for nothing do they often have handles on the ceiling above the back seat - you may need to cling on. The grid street pattern of New York is easy to navigate but often taxi drivers are new to the city and can need good directions. Yellow cabs are cheap - Dollars 1.50 (Pounds 1) flat rate and 25 cents for each half mile thereafter. You cannot get a cab at Toronto airport - not officially anyway. As the airport is in the neighbouring city of Mississauga, Toronto taxis are not allowed to pick up there. Apart from the airbus, the only transport is provided by very expensive limousines which charge CDollars 36 (Pounds 17) for the trip downtown. But a trick to avoid this is to go to the departures level and catch a cab that is depositing travellers. It is likely to take you, but you have to be quick as the cabs are frightened of the police patrols. Toronto taxis charge a flag fee of CDollars 2.20, then CDollars 1 per kilometre. The average trip around the downtown area is CDollars 4-9. Bonn taxis tend to be efficient and in reasonable supply. It will cost you DM3.40 (Pounds 1.40) to get in the car; the first kilometre is charged at DM4 and then it becomes cheaper. An average 4-6km journey would be charged at an average DM1.80 a kilometre. You can rely on the driver being fit. As public service employees, they are required to have health certificates. Taking a taxi in Sydney is a laid-back affair. Invariably, you will sit next to the driver and the general approach of cab companies is largely uncommercial. The drivers are also prone to do something that would severely raise the blood pressure of most taxi drivers - that is rounding down the fare if the passenger has not got the correct change. The cost is moderate with fares made up of a ADollars 1.85 (87p) hiring charge; mileage of 97 cents per kilometre; and waiting time of ADollars 27.90 per hour. One should not misread the unceremonious outward appearance of Sydney taxis for casualness. Among other things, the New South Wales Taxi Council is very proud of the fact that it sold its training programme to London. With contributions from FT bureaux.</p>

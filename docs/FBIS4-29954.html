			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT]  decided on 16 June to ease regulations on mobile telephone base  stations. So far, base stations have been required to obtain  approval beforehand for frequency use. However, the MPT will  introduce a "license system for designated comprehensive  frequencies." This system will enable each base station to use  all frequencies allocated to companies who own ground stations.  This is one of the pillars of the deregulation measures the  government's administrative reform promotion council  headquarters and working group on information and communications  will prepare by the end of this month. The system will take  effect next January. This will enable mobile telephone  companies save application fees when changing frequencies. In  addition, it seems the system will also become a support measure  for the Japan Mobile Telephone Company (IDO), which plans to  increase its number of base stations to ease the trade frictions  between Japan and the United States.    It is necessary to construct more ground stations because  the  mobile telephone market is expanding rapidly. According to the  MPT, it seems that the number of ground stations will reach  8,700, or 70 percent more than the current number, in two years.  Currently, ordinary mobile telephone companies are using from  10 to 50 channels at their base stations. But, they need to  increase the number of bands [denpa su] they use to ease  telephone congestion.    However, every time a new station is built or one station  wants to increase its number of frequency bands, the current  system requires the station and six to seven of its neighboring  stations, which need to adjust their frequencies, to obtain  approvals before making changes. Under the current system, one  month or so is needed to examine applications before approval,  creating obstacles to attempts to make changes to cope with the  situation.    Because of this, the MPT decided to introduce the new  system,  designed to issue licenses to enable all stations to use all  frequency bands allocated to companies which own ground  stations. Under the new system, the companies will no longer  need to apply for approval before changing the specifications  for each base station. They will only need to notify the MPT  after actually making changes based on their own judgment.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 1 (AFP) -- The Western European Union  [WEU] on Monday [28 February] backed NATO's action in  Bosnia-Herzegovina but regretted that Bosnia's Central European  neighbours had been sidelined in the decision-making which  mainly involved Washington, Moscow and the UN.    The Presidential Committee of the WEU -- the European pillar  of the Atlantic alliance -- meeting in Paris, praised "NATO's  resolve" in enforcing the UN-backed no-fly zone over Bosnia and  the ban on un-policed heavy arms round Sarajevo, according to a  statement issued after the meeting.    However the WEU noted that NATO's 9 February ultimatum to  withdraw heavy arms threatening Sarajevo or put them under UN  control "could be implemented only thanks to a tacit agreement  between Russia and the United States under United Nations  auspices."    But the WEU expressed "regrets" that it was "not possible  for  there to be prior consultation with the Central European  countries whose close cooperation is vital to the conduct of any  UN policy in former Yugoslavia."    The WEU said the "positive development" in Sarajevo should  encourage efforts to "apply the same policy to other threatened  areas in Bosnia: Mostar, Srebrenica and Tuzla" amongst others.    It said the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  should  be provided "with sufficient additional troops to enable it to  carry out its mission of controlling armaments."    WEU members and NATO "should make all necessary preparations  so as to be able to contribute military forces to the  substantial peace-keeping force that will be required to ensure  the implementation of a peace agreement in Bosnia-Herzegovina,"  the statement said.    The WEU groups France, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy,  Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Britain.  Denmark and Ireland have observer status.</p>

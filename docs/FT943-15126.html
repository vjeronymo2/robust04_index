			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: London Gilt markets will have the regular mid-month menu of UK economic data to feast on this week, with figures for retail and producer prices and unemployment all due. However, most attention will probably be focused on Wednesday's average earnings data. April saw an unexpected fall in average earnings growth to 3 3/4 per cent, from 4 per cent in March. Expectations are for the annual rate to be unchanged in May but any acceleration would re-awaken inflationary fears, as would any further signs of a knock-on effect of higher commodity prices on the producer prices or retail prices data. One eye will have to be kept on the international situation, in case dollar weakness prompts either concerted G7 action, or unilateral US Fed action, on interest rates. Also keenly watched will be the announcement of the next gilt auction on Friday: Will the Bank return to a conventional funding programme, or does it still believe medium to long-term gilt yields are too high? Gilts were one of the best performing world bond markets in June, giving some relief to those who despaired of an end to this year's downturn. Ms Katy Peters of Daiwa Europe says the short end of the market is still wrongly priced, since it has discounted an early increase in base rates which she thinks will not occur.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Members of the Conciliatory Commission for the  implementation of the Civic Accord Agreement have different  views on the idea of prolonging the powers of the parliament and  president, proposed by Federation Council Speaker Vladimir  Shumeyko.    Mayor of St. Petersburg Anatoliy Sobchak told the first  plenary session of the Commission on Tuesday that he viewed this  measure as an attempt to solve a social problem by violating the  Civic Accord Agreement. Sobchak was supported by President of  the Russian Union of Manufacturers and Entrepreneurs Arkadiy  Volskiy, who proposed that the Commission condemn Shumeyko's  statement. Volskiy said that Shumeyko's proposal had given rise  to the movement for recalling the deputies.    Vice-Chairman of the Federation Council Ramazan Abdulatipov  opposes all statements of condemnation because, he said, this  means a roll-back to the times when the Communist Party  "condemned all kinds of dissidence." His position was supported  by chief of the president's staff Sergey Filatov.    However, Filatov backed the proposal by representative of  the  Liberal-Democratic Party Vishnyakov, who condemned Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev's phrase about the opponents of Russia's  participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace program. In a TV  interview Kozyrev described them as "red-brown political  bastards". On Filatov's initiative, the Conciliatory Commission  instructed Academician Vladimir Kondratyev to draft a statement  on unparliamentary expressions. "If we are to appease society,  we must choose expressions which do not discredit state  leaders," said Filatov.    The president's aid Georgiy Satarov told Interfax that  formally Shumeyko's proposal did not contradict the Civic Accord  Agreement. This document says that early elections unstipulated  in the Constitution are inadmissible. "In this particular case,  the extension of powers after the expiration of the term is  meant," said Satarov. "Theoretically, such a possibility cannot  be excluded, but one must seriously assess whether or not to  make such a step," he said. Whatever the circumstances, the  final decision is to be taken by the electors, who must state  their opinion in a referendum, said Satarov.</p>

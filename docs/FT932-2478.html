			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Severn Trent The profits of a regulated water utility can go down as well as up. Without a timely reduction in the annual charge taken to cover the upkeep of its sewers, Severn Trent's water business would barely have nosed ahead last year. The impact of recession on industrial demand and higher interest costs took a toll. Since Severn Trent's capital investment has peaked earlier than others in the sector, the impact of gearing on the bottom line is a taste of things to come. If that is an argument in favour of diversification, though, yesterday's figures are a poor example of how to go about it. Biffa lost money again after interest costs. Since the acquisition was funded with fixed-rate money at 11.5 per cent, lower base rates have not improved matters. While margins are under pressure, there is limited scope for a recovery in operating profits this year. Higher prices for landfill disposal would help. But with the government's new licensing arrangements postponed, it is by no means clear that price increases will stick. One can only hope that the Pounds 3.3m spent last year touting for international business will yield a better return. That will matter less if Severn Trent achieves a favourable outcome from next year's regulatory review, but trying to pick winners on that score looks a recipe for an early bath.</p>

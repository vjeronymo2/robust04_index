			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIETS HEAT UP THE SUMMIT;  </P> <P> LEADERS OF 7 NATIONS AT ODDS ON AID  </P> <P> Leaders of the world's seven richest nations opened summit talks today sharply  at odds over aid to the Soviet Union. Trade and environmental disputes also  threatened the harmony.  </P> <P> President Bush challenged his partners "to bring a new stability and prosperity  to the world by tapping the power and energy of free wills and free markets."  </P> <P> In the absence of agreement on Soviet aid, the leaders may agree to send a team  of Western bankers and other experts to Moscow to assess needs in  transportation, marketing and other areas, diplomatic sources said.  </P> <P> A U.S. source predicted that the summit will produce a strong statement of  support for Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika program of economic reforms and  will recognize the need of each country to act on an individual basis in terms  of direct financial assistance.  </P> <P> At an outdoor welcoming ceremony -- shortened because of the unrelenting Texas  heat -- Bush said: "A new world of freedom (lies) before us. Hopeful.  Confident. A world where peace endures, where commerce has a conscience and  where all that seems possible is possible."  </P> <P> "So let us begin, in good faith, to set the stage for the new millennium," the  President said.  </P> <P> Cannon salutes and military pageantry greeted the leaders of West Germany,  Britain, France, Italy, Canada and Japan as they assembled on the campus of  Rice University for three days of talks.  </P> <P> A fife-and-drum corps decked out in white wigs and Revolutionary War costumes  added to the colorful opening.  </P> <P> The 16th annual gathering of the world's largest industrial democracies was the  first economic summit of the post-Cold War era.  </P> <P> With the cooling of East-West tensions, summit countries are grappling with  different strategies to extend a welcoming hand to East Europe and the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> In Moscow, senior Soviet officials rejected Bush's reasons for resisting help  for the Soviet Union. The President has expressed concerns over Soviet military  spending, Soviet subsidies for Cuba and the lack of reforms in Moscow's  government-controlled economy.  </P> <P> "To dictate conditions to such a country as the Soviet Union, a great power, is  embarrassing," said Gorbachev staff member Georgy Shakhnazarov. "We aren't  taking orders."  </P> <P> On a more conciliatory note, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said, "We  understand if no one wants to take a risk. The U.S.A. isn't speaking in favor  of development of economic cooperation if reform doesn't proceed as we plan."  </P> <P> White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu said the Western leaders lined up  "about half on one side, and half on the other" over how to provide financial  assistance to Moscow.  </P> <P> He said Bush recognized that other countries "may have a slightly different  agenda that would drive" their actions. "We understand that others may have a  different sequence of decisions and timing of decisions to be made. . . . "  </P> <P> On other disputes, Europeans are resisting Bush's demand for phasing out farm  subsidies over the next 10 years and, together with Canada, are pushing for  agreement on new steps to halt global warming.  </P></p>

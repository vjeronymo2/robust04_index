			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Riot police deployed in Cairo RIOT POLICE were deployed in force near main government buildings and embassies in Cairo yesterday following a night of disturbances in the city's inner suburbs. The protests, fuelled by frustration among thousands of homeless people over perceived slow official reaction to last week's earthquake, carried ominous overtones for the government, which has been under increasing pressure from Islamic extremists. Police sealed a main thoroughfare through the slum suburb of Boulaq and fired teargas at stone-throwing youths. A bridge across the Nile was partially closed to prevent protesters crossing into the Zamalek area where many senior officials live. Most worrying for the authorities were the angry chants directed against President Hosni Mubarak as well as the conspicuous role of various Islamic groups. Hundreds demonstrated on Saturday, near the Shura Council, the upper house of the parliament. 'Mubarak, you have to collect your shame and get your children off the streets,' people shouted. 'Where have you been Mubarak - you went asking for aid and came back to us with a few bars of soap.' Mr Mubarak, who cut short a visit to China to oversee the relief effort, defended his government at a press conference on Saturday. 'I think the government since this problem started has done its maximum,' he said. But conceded there had been shortcomings in providing assistance. 'The lesson for the Egyptians and the government and all the authorities in this country is just to try to educate the people how to react whenever there is any emergency,' he said. Over 500 people were killed and some 6,000 injured in the earthquake. Government estimates put total losses at about Dollars 300m, with 8,000 structures destroyed or rendered unsafe. The ruling National Democratic party has been unnerved by the speed with which Islamic groups mobilised to help people in distress. Within hours of Monday's disaster, Islamic charitable organisations had established relief centres in poor and crumbling neighbourhoods, hardest hit by the earthquake. They wasted no time in providing funds for the destitute and help for families made homeless, in marked contrast to official efforts. The Islamic mainstream Moslem Brotherhood and more overtly militant religious groups have been mounting a spirited challenge to the government for the hearts and minds of Egypt's 57m people, many of whom live in poverty.</p>

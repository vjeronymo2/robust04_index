			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> NEIL YOUNG RAGES ON, AGELESS AND ANARCHIC  </P> <P> It's hard to believe Neil Young is now well into his 40s. Cruising through the  third decade of a prolific career, he rages on as one of the most aggressive,  anarchic intelligences in pop, and there's a streak of wild boyishness about  him that makes him ageless. Earthy and wise as Georgia O'Keeffe, rowdy as  Johnny Rotten, he's a great American artist whose starkly beautiful songs are  frequently as profound as pop music gets.  </P> <P> At the Greek Theatre on Saturday, Young turned in a solo acoustic set that was  everything a long-time fan could want: great new songs, old favorites, and an  encore featuring backup vocals from his old pals David Crosby and Graham Nash.  Young charmed the audience from the git-go with his winning performing style --  he was so damned casual that were it not for his ferocious intensity, you'd  think you'd stumbled onto an impromptu rehearsal.  </P> <P> He's an extremely funny man, very droll and understated, and his low-key  persona is the perfect counterpoint to his music, which goes after all the big  issues. Love, death, mother nature, history, time and betrayal -- Young  wrestles with them all in songs that never fail to shine a light of kindness  and conscience on the subject at hand.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 7 (BTA) -- "While the Brussels Treaty  provides no security guarantees for Bulgaria and the other  countries granted enhanced status of affiliated Western European  Union (WEU) members, I believe the certainty that any moment  this country could bring up issues related to its national  security before the WEU Council of Ministers is a major step  toward our integration into the European security structures,"  Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov this evening said in an  interview for the Panorama weekly political programme of the  national TV. His commentary came to answer the interviewer's  question whether the enhanced status Bulgaria will be granted on  May 9 will provide greater security.    Commenting on the Council of Europe (CE) Committee of  Ministers presidency this country will take over on May 11,  Foreign Minister Daskalov said it is a great responsibility and  a prestige. "Bulgaria will be the first post-communist country  to take the steering wheel of the Committee for a 6-months  term," he said. During its tenure, Bulgaria will seek to further  all major activities of the CE and particularly those  implementing the decisions of the October 1993 summit in Geneva.    Asked whether Bulgaria's internal instability affects his  international political contacts, the Foreign Minister said this  country remains true to its foreign policy principles in spite  of the domestic instability and that over the recent year it  proved to have a clear orientation and priorities.</p>

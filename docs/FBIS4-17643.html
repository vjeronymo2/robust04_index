			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM-TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev 25 April TASS -- Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk said on Monday that the documents on the Black Sea  Fleet signed by Ukraine and Russia provide ample possibilities  for settling the dispute.    Speaking to journalists in Kiev on Monday, Kravchuk said  that  the Russian and Ukrainian defence ministers sought possible  solutions at their meeting in Sevastopol, but the problem can be  solved fully only by the presidents of the two countries. "I am  against hasty assessments. I would not like the work of the two  ministers to be viewed as a position of either side," he said.    "Our position is clear. We want Russia to agree to divide  the fleet 50-50 as stipulated by the Yalta agreements.  Proceeding from present-day realities, Ukraine should take  15-20 per cent of ships. The rest 30-35 per cent will be either  sold or used to compensate Russia for Ukrainian debts," he said.    Speaking about the location of the fleet, Kravchuk pointed  out that "a Navy base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet is being  set up in Sevastopol in accordance with generally-recognised  international norms. This is not new. This has been done  before in other countries. Balaklava will be the home base of  the Ukrainian Navy. We do not say that everything must be  changed in one day. But the Russian side should take into  account our position -- we cannot take only ships and leave  officers. It must be settled in a civilised manner."    The president believes that the dispute can be solved by  Russia and Ukraine without any outside interference or  assistance. "The Black Sea Fleet is a local issue. It is not as  global as the nuclear problem. We must solve it in a civilised  manner, taking into account long-term interests of the two  countries and counting on equal partnership. That's what should  be used as the foundation for resolving the problem, not  ambitions or wishes of some concrete people. The military think  by military categories. We must think by national categories,  the interests of the two great nations. We must not rush  conclusions, statements and hints. We need to be patient,"  Kravchuk said.    He believes that the present tensions over the Black Sea  Fleet were also caused by the actions of Crimean President Yuriy  Meshkov. "When the defence ministers were meeting, Yuriy Meshkov  made a statement that Ukrainian troops must leave the  peninsular. Such statements border on ignorance. One cannot be  serious demanding that Ukraine must leave the Crimea, its  territory which has been officially and constitutionally  recognised by the world and Russia. The 1990 agreement says that  we have no territorial claims. This is also written down in the  three-party agreement, under which Ukraine, the United States  and Russia support sovereignty, inviolability of borders and  independence."    During the meeting on 15 April President Boris Yeltsin and  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin confirmed their  respect for Ukraine's territorial integrity and its sovereignty.  This was said openly and straightforwardly, Kravchuk noted.    "Relations with the Crimea, which is part of Ukraine, should  be normal and business-like. We want to help the Crimea and we  do help it," he added.    Speaking about Ukraine's next move in settling the Black Sea  Fleet dispute, Kravchuk said "we will get in touch with the  president of Russia and agree our next meeting. I am convinced  that we must solve this problem not to the detriment of Ukraine,  the Crimea, Russia or the world community. We must solve it for  the benefit of security, cooperation and friendly partnership  relations."</p>

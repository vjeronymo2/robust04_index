			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MITCH GREEN COMMENTS AREN'T FIT TO PRINT  </P> <P> I cannot find one good reason that Mitch (Blood) Green continues to attract  media coverage. Mr. Green is not news. Mr. Green is not a heavyweight  contender. He's not even in the top 10. Mr. Green is unintelligible. Mr. Green  is not funny.  </P> <P> Maybe it's just a subconscious effort to rid boxing of all undesirables by  showing how utterly unsavory these kinds of chaps truly are.  </P> <P> RODNEY BOSWELL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DURING 1990, MANY ORANGE COUNTY RESIDENTS WROTE ABOUT THEIR THOUGHTS AND  FEELINGS IN ARTICLES FOR ORANGE COUNTY OPINION PAGES. AS WE LOOK BACK ON THE  YEAR, SOME OF THOSE THOUGHTS ARE RECALLED.;  </P> <P> ROBERT F. GENTRY ON OFFSHORE OIL SPILLS  </P> <P> Feb.7, 1990 , will be a day that Orange Countians will remember for some time  to come. On that day, approximately 400,000 gallons of oil began spewing from  the American Trader, an 800-foot tanker operated by British Petroleum.  </P> <P> The disaster is the worst oil spill in the history of Orange County.  </P> <P> We are fortunate that mother nature looked favorably upon us, playing a very  important role in the clean-up operation.  </P> <P> It is amazing that in 1990, with the kind of technology this country has  utilized in many areas, we still have quite primitive ways of recovering oil  from the water. Technology has not been developed to handle a spill even the  size of this one, and that, to me, is deplorable.  </P> <P> We should not be offering the leasing of tracts off Orange County when we are  unable to effectively clean up from a disaster that oil development and the oil  industry may produce.  </P> <P> The main lesson learned in this disaster is that we need much stricter laws  governing the transport of oil near our shores and we need to take a very hard  look at the expansion of this industry in Orange County.  </P> <P> I believe the area between the Orange County coastline and Catalina Island  should be designated a National Oceanic Park. That plan already has the support  of half of the cities in the county and the Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> The people must realize that the strong oil lobby has produced a situation  where the checks and balances just are not there.  </P></p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Restructuring scheme for TAP-Air Portugal agreed The Portuguese government has approved a restructuring plan for TAP-Air Portugal, the state-owned airline. The strategy involves injecting Es180bn (Dollars 1bn) into the debt-ridden company, reducing the workforce by 2,400 people and seeking a strategic foreign partner. The approval of the plan ends months of speculation over the future of the airline. Mr Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral, minister for public works, transport and communications, said: 'The agreement is bad news for many competitors who predicted TAP would be forced to close down.' The state will absorb part of TAP's debt by injecting Es180bn into the company in four tranches over the next four years. TAP's accumulated debt reached Es124.4bn in 1993 and operating losses rose to Es35bn, the worst result in the company's history. Under the plan, TAP is forecast to return to profits in 1996, with a forecast net profit of Es300m, growing to Es12.7bn in 1997. From 1997, when TAP's debt is forecast to have fallen to Es114.5bn, the company's earnings should be sufficient to cover its own debt liabilities, according to Mr Ferreira do Amaral. The airline's staff level of 9,500 people will be cut to 7,110 by 1997. This implies the loss of 800 jobs in 1994 compared with forecasts that the company would dismiss 2,000 workers this year. Wage costs from 1994 to 1997 are estimated at Es15bn. TAP will abolish all of its flights to North America except to New York and will drop flights on 15 or 16 secondary routes in Europe, according to the plan. But the airline will retain its present structure without spinning off passenger and baggage handling and aircraft maintenance into separate companies as envisaged in earlier proposals. TAP will seek a foreign partner with the main aim of ensuring coverage of the routes to North America that it is abandoning. Contacts have already reported to have been made with the US companies Delta Airlines and United Airlines. 'We have created the conditions by which TAP will be able to enter into an international partnership without being in a subordinate position,' said Mr Ferreira do Amaral. 'TAP will now be able to co-operate and associate with other airlines on equal terms.' Mr Ferreira do Amaral will travel to Brussels on January 27 to discuss the restructuring plan with the European Commission. The key point at issue will be whether the proposals to inject state capital into TAP contravene European competition laws.</p>

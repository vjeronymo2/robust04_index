			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUNDING FOR LIBRARIES  </P> <P> We are currently involved in a very tough knowledge war and our "Education  President" is proposing to substantially hinder our efforts by cutting federal  library funding by 71%. The winners in this war will be those countries who are  strongest between the ears.  </P> <P> Our competitors are very formidable -- Western Europe, Canada, Japan, the  industrialized countries of Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Coming on fast are  Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. We must remember that Sir Francis Bacon  said, "Knowledge is power," and not diminish our power.  </P> <P> President Bush, please look again. If you can find money in the defense budget  to send to Panama and Nicaragua, there surely must be enough money available to  fully fund our libraries.  </P> <P> TERRY L. MALONE  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

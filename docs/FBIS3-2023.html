			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Japan today expressed  its concern over the U.S. decision to revive the Super 301 trade  provision.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said at the news  conference "we have to express concern about the U.S. Government  move to build up the strength of its procedures that would clear  the way for unilateral action in resolving trade disputes with  other countries."    U.S. President Bill Clinton reinstated Thursday [3 March]  the  lapsed trade measure that gives Washington the right to impose  sanctions if Japan fails to meet the U.S. demand on greater  market access to foreign products.    The top government spokesman Takemura told reporters that  Prime Minister Hosokawa received a phone call from Clinton last  night. The prime minister told Clinton that Japan is working on  a package of market-opening measures and hoped that both  countries should show restraint over trade disputes.    Takemura said that Japan "strongly hopes that the government  of the United States will act in a sensible manner."    Meanwhile, Premier Hosokawa ruled out any immediate steps to  counter the U.S. latest move. He noted that he and President  Clinton had "agreed to deal with the matter coolly" in their  telephone conversation last night.    Japanese business executives across the country deplored the  U.S. move. Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of  Economic Organizations, pointed out that Super 301 runs counter  to the spirit of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    Hosaku Inaba, president of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and  Industry, noted that the U.S. apparently wants to use the clause  as a tool to take the upper hand in its trade talks with Japan.</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Contestants line up for Australian Treasury job: The rivals to replace Dawkins The king is dead, God save the king. Barely had John Dawkins, the Australian treasurer, announced his intention to resign last Friday, than speculation over his successor began. By the weekend's close, two names were at the forefront of the running. The first is Ralph Willis, the finance minister. The 55-year-old politician, whose parliamentary career stretches back more than two decades and exceeds even Mr Dawkins', has all the credentials. He has held his present job for three years, and even took the treasurer's position for a brief period in 1991, during the final days of Mr Bob Hawke's administration. No one doubts his technical expertise. Moreover, Mr Willis was a research officer with the powerful Australian Council of Trade Unions before entering parliament, and his appointment would be unlikely to raise problems with the Labor party caucus. This may be an important consideration: Mr Dawkins had been heavily attacked by both the unions and the party's rank and file, who claimed that he cared more about the nation's budget deficit than its double-digit unemployment rate. But in contrast to the individualistic Mr Dawkins, Mr Willis is generally viewed as a 'grey' politician, reliable but lacking in personal firepower. Whether this will appeal to Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, is a moot point. The second favourite contender, Mr Laurie Brereton, presents very different attributes. Unlike Mr Willis, Mr Brereton is viewed as one of Mr Keating's closest personal allies. Both were born into working-class Catholic families in Sydney and climbed the political ladder via the right-wing of the New South Wales Labor party. They have been friends and political associates since their teens. Mr Keating was best man at Mr Brereton's wedding. But for most of his political life, Mr Brereton has played in the sometimes murky world of state politics. He did not move into the federal sphere until 1990, and his Canberra career only began to advance when Mr Keating took over from Mr Hawke. After the last election, in March, Mr Brereton was made industrial relations minister. This was always going to be a tricky assignment. From the outset, Mr Brereton's main task was to negotiate a labour market reform package which was both acceptable to the unions and furthered the government's aim of encouraging enterprise-based bargaining. After months of deadlock, a compromise was duly hammered out - but not without intervention from Mr Keating and, in the eyes of critics, some unfortunate concessions. So, while Mr Brereton is long on connections and has reputation for toughness, his credentials on the financial front are scant. Given that neither of these men presents a perfect solution, there is no shortage of other names being put forward. Already, Mr Kim Beazley, the employment, education and training minister, has been tipped as a compromise candidate, as has Mr Simon Crean, the primary industries minister. Outsiders  -who might benefit if a broader government reshuffle takes place - include Mr Michael Lee, the 36-year-old tourism minister. But whoever takes over from Mr Dawkins will have little time to learn the ropes, a fact which may weigh in the equation. The outgoing treasurer's final act has been to reorganise the budget process so that finance bills are presented in May and then passed by the end of June. This earlier presentation, with its built-in negotiation period, is designed to avert the embarrassing debacle which followed this summer's budget. Then, the legislation was stalled in the senate for two months while minor parties  -who hold the balance of power there - haggled over specific measures. So, since the prime minister's office has made clear that no successor to Mr Dawkins will be announced until early in the new year, this will give the new treasurer just five months to learn his brief. Mr Dawkins, safe in Fremantle, may look on with compassion.</p>

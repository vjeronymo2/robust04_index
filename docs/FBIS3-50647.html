			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Manuel Pereira; from the "Good Afternoon </F> From Mexico" newscast]    [Text] Social Development Secretary Carlos Rojas Gutierrez  traveled to Tuxtla Gutierrez to devise a plan for new economic  and technical support that will contribute in reversing the  serious backwardness in Chiapas State.    Although Chiapas State heads the government's list for  social  investment, new plans to fight poverty, despair, and historical  backwardness in this state will be announced today; for that  purpose, Social Development Secretary Rojas Gutierrez arrived in  Tuxtla Gutierrez today. Accompanied by federal and state  officials, he immediately convened a roundtable, which will  involve new government institutions.    Meeting participants recognized the problems caused by  existing backwardness in Chiapas State that basically affect the  Indians. They noted, however, that for the past five years the  government has considered Chiapas a priority for social  investments, which have been increased by more than 1,000  percent during that period. New economic and technical  assistance to satisfy the needs of this neglected state will be  defined during this meeting.    Chiapas Governor Elmar Zetzer again urged Chiapas residents  this morning not to heed rumors. He reaffirmed that the Mexican  Army will certainly have the situation totally under control  soon.</p>

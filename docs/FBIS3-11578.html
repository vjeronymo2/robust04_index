On the contrary, it seems that upon entering  Nicaragua's polluted air both gentlemen lost their sense of  direction and started speaking erratically that, at least for  this observer, has created more confusion than hope.    We do not know if this is a common situation, but we cannot  help commenting on the fact that Watson referred to the  Sandinists as "a legally constituted political party" in  Nicaragua. In other words, he came to give us old news. In  reality, Sandinism has been legal for a long time, so long that  it is legally registered, it has definite legal representation,  and has lost 2 to 1 in the electoral field since 1984. In other  words, it has lost two elections and won one, and in that one it  did not have a real contender.    Mr. Watson is gone, and we do not know why he came to give  us  that kind of news. When he tried to take the bull by the horns,  it was disastrous. General Humberto Ortega was bold enough to  tell him to his face that he will not tolerate another situation  like 2 September 1993, when the legitimate Nicaraguan President,  Violeta de Chamorro, hinted, not ordered, that she would like  Gen. Ortega to resign in 1994. In other words, Gen. Ortega  discounted the top civilian authority in the country in front of  Mr. Watson. Ortega, who had already insolently rejected  President Chamorro's suggestion, now clearly repeated his  response to the State Department. Those who live on illusions  say that Gen. Ortega already knows he must leave and that he was  just bragging in front of the Yankees. Frankly, it is difficult  to be that optimistic. Ortega is not an actor, and as things  stand now, he could very well resign in 1994 but then again he  may not.    Having given the people's representation to the National  Assembly to the Sandinists, Ortega could even become a  presidential candidate, with his general stars and all. There is  no real obstacle to that if he decided to become Nicaragua's  dictator. Those who sold the people's electoral victory in 1990  would not be able to stop him because they did not stop him in  1990 when they should have.    We thought Camdessus came to sign a document entitled ESAF  [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility], which requires no  translation, but according to experts is the last hope for the  country's economy even though it includes a tremendous increase  in the severe tax system confronting Nicaraguans.    Camdessus, however, came to tell us that the ESAF would not  be signed in March as the government expected, but maybe in  June. What is ESAF? Apparently, large sums of money obtained  through long-term credits at very low interest rates. The  surprising part was that Camdessus, who apparently knows nothing  about Nicaragua either, also came to tell us that we have  already asked for too much and to tell us that "we must save."  Save what? White collar workers are burdened with taxes, can  barely cover their needs, and have nothing left to save. As for  blue collar workers, they not only lack the funds to save; they  have no jobs to survive. Although some economic sectors have  managed to save some money, they did it during better days and  they are firmly protecting those funds so as to avoid falling in  the complete depression that lays ahead should the ESAF not be  signed and Gen. Ortega decides to ignore the calls to submit his  retirement, both valid possibilities.    In other words, Mr. Watson and Mr. Camdessus came here, very  deferentially, to tell us that the Sandinist party is a  legitimate party and that we should save. That is really  impossible. The only way we as a nation could start saving is by  implementing drastic reductions in the country's costly Armed  Forces, which is headed by Gen. Ortega, who does not want to  resign.    As some friends once told Cardinal Miguel Obando, it would  seem there are no solutions for Nicaragua's problems. At that  time, the cardinal said that despite everything, we must all  continue to pray for Nicaragua. That is all we have left.</p>

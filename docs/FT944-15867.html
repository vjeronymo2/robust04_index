			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Fears grow that Brussels will turn into Babel Against the sombre backdrop of high unemployment, there are a few Europeans for whom job offers are overflowing: Finnish Portuguese speakers, Greeks able to translate complex documents into Norwegian, not to mention Spanish natives well versed in Swedish. As Brussels prepares to open its arms to Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria, the language services of the European Commission, parliament and council of ministers, are busily recruiting interpreters for the extra languages the newcomers will bring to European proceedings. The cost of expanding the already elaborate language services has caused consternation in certain quarters. One speculation is that the total number of language combinations necessary at any official meeting will rise from 72 to 132; new booths will have to be built to house the translators, and the mound of printed translations will topple over. Conservative MEP James Elles believes the EU's commitment to translate official documents into all nine, soon 12, languages, and to provide comprehensive translations at official meetings is unrealistic, and a drain on the public purse. 'Can we really assume that all documents and all meetings can be covered in all the necessary languages? Why is it that an international institution such as the EU needs to have every single document in every single language when the United Nations and the Council of Europe seem able to operate with only a few?' he asks. Mr Elles, says the commission, exaggerates. First, the translation service commonly uses a 'pivot' system for simultaneous translations. This means that a central interpreter translates from the less well-known languages, such as Danish, into a commonly-used one such as French or English, from which other interpreters then translate into, for example, Portuguese. 'You don't have to have someone in the Danish booth who can translate into Portuguese or Greek,' said a commission official. 'The system is not perfect, as it slows down the rate of translation, but it does reduce the number of language combinations.' Second, at least as far as the commission is concerned, officials take a pragmatic approach to which language they use for everyday business. 'The parliament, for all the usual democratic reasons, has to work in all the languages of the member states, whereas the commission just gets on with things in the three official languages: French, German and English,' said an official. As for documents, 'we are reinforcing our language teams in order to produce documents in the final language, but that is an obligation to the outside world.' All this, says the commission, creates the need for about 400 extra language posts. A far more pressing problem is finding jobs at all levels of the commission for civil servants from the new member states. Estimates suggest that room needs to be found for about 1,300-1,700 Finns, Swedes, Austrians and Norwegians. In the past, space was created by offering golden handshakes to existing staff, but Mr Karel Van Miert, commissioner responsible for personnel issues, has ruled out this approach as too expensive. Demographic factors could, however, come to his rescue. 'The commission was set up in the 1960s, so people who joined then in their 30s are now retiring,' pointed out an official. 'If you allow for a lengthy transition period, we should be able to absorb the newcomers fairly easily.' But this approach creates a new problem; it will stop virtually all recruitment of existing member states for four to five years, something which certain countries, notably Spain and the UK who are under represented at the commission, may be unwilling to accept. Meanwhile, tension over language in the Commission press room is rising, with non-French speaking journalists increasingly unhappy about the obligatory use of French at the midday briefings, for which no translation is provided. Many non-French-speaking journalists do not understand the proceedings and have to put questions in faltering French to English-speaking spokesmen and women, who are obliged to answer in French. 'Je veux demander une question sur les bent bananes,' is not untypical of the type of mangled questions asked. With the arrival of the three Nordic countries and Austria, the case for providing an English translation in the press room is strengthening. Last week journalists voted in favour of such a move. Their wish, however, may not be granted. Commission officials fear that allowing in English means allowing in German, and Italian and Spanish and so on. This, they say, would be too expensive. Further, Mr Jacques Delors, it is said, does not want to go down in history as the French president of the Community who allowed English into the press room.</p>

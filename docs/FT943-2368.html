			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Fahd promises to turn to UK for 'all Saudi Arabia's needs' The UK will remain a key supplier of defence equipment to Saudi Arabia for the foreseeable future, King Fahd told Mr John Major, the British prime minister, yesterday. In several hours of talks in Jeddah, the king and Mr Major also agreed an outline deal for Britain to provide technical and financial advice on Saudi Arabia's fledgling privatisation programme. British officials and businessmen who joined the week-long trip to the Gulf and South Africa, were buoyed by the warm reception given to Mr Major, and by King Fahd's promise that Saudi Arabia 'will come to the UK for all our needs'. Mr Major is believed to have discussed a number of potential defence contracts with the king, including a possible order for Westland's Merlin anti-submarine warfare helicopter. Saudi Arabia is believed to be deeply concerned about its vulnerability to a potential threat from Iraq, which has acquired a number of conventional submarines in the second-hand market in spite of an international arms embargo. The king is also said to have responded sympathetically to British suggestions that the kingdom should buy Avro International jets for the Royal Flight, and Rolls-Royce engines for the state-owned airline. It is believed a bid by the Davy construction group to build a steel plant at Hadeed was also discussed. The Saudi government is expected to confirm shortly that it has accepted a British offer to provide technical assistance in developing the kingdom's plans to involve private capital in large parts of the state-owned sector. Candidates for privatisation or partial involvement by the private sector include the electricity industry, the state-owned telecommunications company, petrochemicals, aviation and the road system. Saudi Arabia has run a budget deficit for 12 years as a result of declining real prices for oil exports and rising spending. The kingdom is also believed to have spent most of its reserves on financing the Gulf war.</p>

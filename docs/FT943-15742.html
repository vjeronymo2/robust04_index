			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: F&amp;C targets emerging markets Foreign &amp; Colonial believes the time is right to be moving back into the emerging markets, including some - like Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand - which have been hardest hit in the recent downturn. Mr Arnab Banerji, F &amp; C's chief investment officer, told an investment gathering last night that over the last 20 years there were four occasions when emerging markets fell by the magnitude seen in recent months. During the early 1980s the markets were stagnant for two years, but this coincided with the global recession and the Latin American debt crisis. On other occasions, the downturn lasted for no more than eight months. Each downturn had followed a rise in US interest rates, along the lines of that seen in late February. All were terminated by a recovery, driven by strong OECD growth. With the US economy strong, the UK recovering, Germany recording expansion and Japan at or near the bottom of its business cycle, Mr Banerji sees the right conditions to start buying again.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                          Dollar terms                     No. of      July 1   % Change     % Change Market              stocks        1994   over week   on Dec '93  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America        (209)      586.47        +2.7         -9.9 Argentina             (25)      836.08        -1.6        -15.9 Brazil                (57)      250.52        +6.9         +7.6 Chile                 (25)      655.73        -0.4        +18.8 Colombia1             (11)      937.83        +0.4        +45.6 Mexico                (68)      814.44        +2.8        -19.1 Peru2                 (11)      138.18        -1.0        +14.3 Venezuela3            (12)      437.25        -8.2        -26.1 Asia                 (557)      238.89        -2.2        -17.9 China4                (18)       85.65        -4.0        -42.6 South Korea5         (156)      127.72        +0.2         +8.1 Philippines           (18)      275.39        -3.0        -19.1 Taiwan, China6        (90)      132.45        +0.5         -2.0 India7                (76)      133.02        -1.3        +14.2 Indonesia8            (37)       98.47        -2.5        -21.0 Malaysia             (105)      260.05        -3.2        -23.3 Pakistan9             (15)      396.50        +0.4         +2.2 Sri Lanka10            (5)      181.49        +2.7         +2.4 Thailand              (55)      359.90        -0.8        -24.6 Euro/Mid East        (125)      104.74        -1.8        -38.1 Greece                (25)      212.29        -1.8         -6.8 Hungary11              (5)      180.79        -1.0         +8.5 Jordan                (13)      164.17        +1.7         -0.8 Poland12              (12)      506.58        +9.6        -38.1 Portugal              (25)      107.78        -2.8         -5.3 Turkey13              (40)       98.54        -2.8        -53.7 Zimbabwe14             (5)      248.46       -10.1        +22.9 Composite            (891)      299.52        +0.1        -15.8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                             Local currency terms                        July 1   % Change     % Change Market                   1994   over week   on Dec '93  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina          513,040.53        -1.6        -15.9 Brazil          937,410,992.9       +15.4       +822.4 Chile                1,099.45        -0.9        +15.3 Colombia1            1,359.92        -0.6        +46.7 Mexico               1,192.16        +2.9        -11.7 Peru2                  185.05        -1.0        +16.4 Venezuela3           1,980.38        -8.2        +39.3 Asia China4                  93.64        -4.0        -42.9 South Korea5           135.15        +0.1         +7.7 Philippines            352.68        -3.0        -20.6 Taiwan, China6         133.81        -0.0         +0.0 India7                 147.10        -1.3        +14.2 Indonesia8             115.89        -2.5        -18.6 Malaysia               249.93        -2.7        -25.8 Pakistan9              551.18        +0.4         +4.4 Sri Lanka10            194.29        +2.5         +1.7 Thailand               357.69        -1.1        -26.0 Euro/Mid East Greece                 346.20        -1.3        -10.0 Hungary11              222.60        -0.3        +10.3 Jordan                 232.69        +1.1         -2.8 Poland12               720.38        +9.5        -34.8 Portugal               121.78        -2.5        -11.8 Turkey13             1,438.16        -4.8         -1.1 Zimbabwe14             298.97        -8.2        +39.9 Composite  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

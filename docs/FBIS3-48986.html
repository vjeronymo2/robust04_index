			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu by </F> Cristiana Terenche; place and date not given: "The Unted States  Has Opened a Door for Romania and on Its Threshold Stands a  Friend"]    [Text] [Terenche] Mr. Minister, when you left for  Washington, your agenda did not include certain issues that  emerged shortly before your visit -- the pronouncement of the  sentence in Tiraspol, the results of the elections in Russia,  and so forth, which immediately changed the framework of talks...    [Melescanu] Indeed, the meeting in Washington was scheduled  to take place in the month of October and in his letter of  invitation Mr. Warren Christopher said that we were going to see  each other to celebrate, together, the granting of the  most-favored-nation status and to discuss tangible ways and  means for cooperation whereby Romania could benefit; this,  actually, meant returning to normal relations of partnership  with the United States of America. Due to Mr. Christopher's  schedule, this visit was postponed all the time, and thus the  events happened to which you referred; to this we may also add  certain reactions by the American public to domestic actions.  Unfortunately, there were things that modified the framework  initially established for this official visit. I do not want to  conceal the fact that great attention was paid there to the  unveiling of the statue of Marshal Antonescu in Slobozia, which  was viewed as a certain escalation of ultranationalist political  positions...    It was obvious to me that there is concern for developments  in Romania; this is proven by the particular impact this  unveiling had on groups of Jewish people in the United States.  I tried to explain that the government was not involved in this  event. I have said and I want to repeat that Marshal Antonescu  is a very controversial figure; there are still numerous facets  that have not been clarified. He is perceived by Jewish  organizations as Hitler's man, who caused the death of Jews in  Romania. By other segments of society, however, he is perceived  as the man who reclaimed Romanian territories and who recovered  our national integrity. And he is also perceived as a victim of  the communist regime. In the United States, however, this is  viewed as an extremist nationalist event that proves that the  image we enjoy here, at home, is different from our image across  the ocean.    [Terenche] But you still returned very optimistic...    [Melescanu] We discussed two big problems. One is linked to  the question of bilateral relations within the framework of  which we noted signs of entering a new and different stage of  Romanian-U.S. relations. Second, we conducted lengthy  discussions on the consequences of the developments to which you  referred and on the possible orientations of our government.    [Terenche] What does this mean in concrete terms?    [Melescanu] Concretely speaking, it means a firmer  involvement of ours in efforts that are being made, on the one  hand, to stabilize this area and support democratic developments  in all countries, including the countries of the former USSR.  On the other hand, it means achieving, at the domestic level, a  broad political base of a center leaning that will permit the  continuation and speeding up of the economic reform program.  The Americans insist very much on broad support for the  population in the reform process. Consequently, in their view  this process has to take place under such conditions as will  ensure support for the political forces at all levels. It is  clear-cut that the United States of America has opened a door  for Romania and that on its threshold stands a friend. And it  depends solely on us to capitalize on the possibilities we are  offered. Thus, a fund of $50 million was set up in support of  the development of private enterprises in Romania. It is not a  big fund, but rather a symbolic one; its merit, however, is to  encourage investors. For, the moment the American state  participates with 10 percent in an investment, this will surely  attract private investors. Thus, the multiplying effect is  greater. The second part of the visit refers to the support the  United States guarantees for us to preserve Romania's stability  and security, and even territorial integrity. I am not talking  of formal, judicial guarantees. We are now in a different  stage, one in which no treaties of mutual assistance are  concluded as we used to do formerly. I am talking of a very  clear-cut involvement of the U.S. Administration in what we  would term Romania's security and stability, because this is a  question that interests the United States.    [Terenche] Is this where the "Partnership for Peace"  relationship comes in?    [Melescanu] Mr. Warren Christopher told us that their  political concept that is now being applied in the "new  democracies" is incorporated from the point of view of security  into the concept "Partnership for Peace," which they view as a  transition stage in relations with NATO. This means that the  immediate admission to the Alliance, as those working at the  Pentagon said more directly, is not possible from a technical  point of view. Similarly, NATO's expansion should not take  place in a fashion that would give the Russians the impression  that it is directed against them. We were told very clearly  both at the State Department, the Pentagon, and the National  Security Council that we will be included in the program, that  we will even conduct some consultations on concrete ways and  means of applying the concept of "Partnership for Peace," which  also implies tangible obligations. Military obligations of  cooperation, and so forth.    [Terenche] Nevertheless, what is the explanation of the  fact that Romania is constantly eschewed by U.S. officials?    [Melescanu] A position toward Romania is valid. Therefore,  I believe it is necessary to conduct a dialogue at the summit  level and I mentioned the possibility of a meeting in Prague.  Or an official visit, for which purpose I extended an  invitation to President Clinton to visit Romania. The excuse  was a full program and I am convinced that it was not a  circumstantial problem. We have overcome the stage in which  political dialogue at the summit level was a question of  reservations by the other side...    [Terenche] How did the Americans react to the election  results in the Russian Federation?    [Melescanu] I arrived there when things had begun to calm  down. I said that not the result, but the percentage surprised  us. Obviously, in Russia there is very broad support for  tackling the reform other than in a democratic way. The  conclusion I drew was that an alarm signal has been sounded and  this should make the Americans pay greater attention to the  support granted to Russia and the East European countries.    [Terenche] What was the reaction to the death sentence  pronounced in the Ilie Ilascu case?    [Melescanu] The entire Romanian community in the United  States rallied and energetically supported the Ilascu case.  They took steps and put pressure on the U.S. Administration.    [Terenche] And what was the result?    [Melescanu] The result is a very serious involvement of the  Administration. We have already received serious signals in  this respect from Moscow. In the United States it is very  important when an ethnic community rallies and demands something  from the Administration. For ourselves, however, that is for  relations with Russia this has, unfortunately, had a negative  effect. The postponement of the visit by Defense Minister  Grachev is a signal in this respect. And such signals have  become increasingly numerous: For example, the postponement of  the meeting on the treasury or the consultations on the  treaty... I personally do not think that we are guilty of  anything, because what happened in Tiraspol was shocking for the  public, irrespective of political leaning. People were shocked  and said so. But this created a negative moment in  Romanian-Russian relations as far as economic integration is  concerned. It is important for us to relaunch bilateral  relations with our neighbors: With Bulgaria, Ukraine, and, of  course, with the Russian Federation. Such moments affect us.  They have a much more centralized system than we, where every  economic element has a political effect.    [Terenche] You also hold the position of minister state  secretary, that is a sort of deputy prime minister. What are  you doing in this capacity?    [Melescanu] A sort of... is well put. We have the feeling,  somehow, that we could do more to brief and ensure the access of  parliamentarians and politicians to the foreign policy elements  such as the European conventions.    [Terenche] But here we can also mention the way in which one  can violate the freedom of citizens to travel, a right enshrined  in the European conventions, which are so little known by our  authorities... I am referring to the refusal of granting a visa  to His Majesty King Mihai to visit the country on 1 December.    [Melescanu] There are two aspects: First, there is the  formal one, meaning the need to clearly settle procedures.  Irrespective of what will happen, of how we will develop  politically, we have to try to solve the problem of the monarchy  in its entirety. I want you to understand me: It is not the  visa that presents a problem, but the political decision on the  king's participation in some of the events in the country. I  understand that there was an opening at Christmas, but there was  no answer. I am not talking about the fact that we are a  republic; that is clear and stipulated in the constitution.    [Terenche] But nothing is nailed...    [Melescanu] Of course. But I do not understand why we do  not see the good side of things in this respect. A major part  of the Romanians, who left the country after the war, did not do  so because they had it too good. If we start from the idea that  now we need the support of Romanians everywhere, I do not see  why we should not consider the possibility of using the royal  institution. Especially since reference was made to abiding by  the constitution. This is why we are the advocates of solving  this problem in its entirety. We need the support of numerous  capitals through contacts.    [Terenche] Including through royal houses...    [Melescanu] Why not? If they can help us! Our situation is  such that we need any help available. At the domestic political  level, I do not think that we have an overproduction of capable  people, so that we do not know what to do with them. Therefore,  we cannot ask anyone to change his opinions and friendships.  Thus, both at the domestic level and the foreign one, we have  to rally our efforts in order to implement our basic objectives.  For, misery is no political capital.    [Terenche] Were these arguments insufficient when needed?    [Melescanu] You have to know that each one tried to present  his point of view as best as he could. Finally, however, a  conclusion is formed on the basis of all opinions, and thus we  cannot always win. I, however, have the impression that there  are developments on both sides, although there are  irreconcilable positions. There is the basic problem of the  abdication act and that of elections on the basis of which the  constitution was adopted. But even if each one continues to  have the same position, one can seek ways and means to  cooperate, which is the most important thing.    [Terenche] Mr. Minister, how did you react, first as a  private person and then as an official person, to the idea  promoted by Mr. Adrian Nastase that the minister of foreign  affairs should be involved in the political, party activity?    [Melescanu] I think that it is a correct and principled  position, which is being supported by numerous politicians in  Romania. It is a correct solution in the sense of the political  responsibility of ministers when governing. I think that this  is a normal thing in a democratic society. The only question in  our country at this point is to what extent our society is  sufficiently structured for the application of these principles.  In actual fact, I and the other ministers, who are "non-party  members" are involved in the government program in which we  participate. I cannot say that I am a minister who enjoys full  freedom of movement, but I am a minister within a PDSR  [Socialist Democracy Party of Romania] government. Since,  however, I am not fully involved, this situation offers me  certain advantages in the sense of getting broader support. If  I had a certain political color, a dialogue could be refused at  a certain point, although this refusal would not have anything  to do with my activity...</p>

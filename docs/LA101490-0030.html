			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TO CATCH THE WIND;  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN AND WILSON LATCH ONTO POPULAR INITIATIVES IN THE HOPE OF BOOSTING  THEIR APPEAL.  </P> <P> Once upon a time, there were two small boats racing for the California  mainland. After weeks of pitching about in murky waters, they sat totally  becalmed, at the mercy of winds and currents beyond their control.  </P> <P> A storm blew up in the far-off Persian Gulf. And the little attention that  people gave to the race shifted.  </P> <P> Then, a continent away, the U.S. government came to a grinding halt, and  spectators really began to grow distracted. "Who cares about a race where  nothing happens and nobody wins?" they groused. And the two little boats rocked  back and forth and got nowhere.  </P> <P> The boats, of course, are the gubernatorial campaigns of Democrat Dianne  Feinstein and Republican Pete Wilson, as they chart their course from the first  debate to Nov. 6. And this is a fable -- a simplistic one at that. But so are  the campaigns. They turn on expectations, not reality.  </P> <P> The first debate between the two candidates was a reflection of strategies that  have avoided the whirlpools of complex issues, the dismal squalls of tough  problems and the risks of tacking against the prevailing winds.  </P> <P> For a while it looked like the Wilson boat would have an advantage, because it  had more fuel. Even Feinstein's own crew described her craft as "running on  fumes." Then came the court ruling that overturned Proposition 73's limits on  campaign contributions. That allowed Feinstein to fuel up with new money and  remain competitive.  </P> <P> Both campaigns set out, hoping to cruise safely -- and first -- into Sacramento  harbor.  </P> <P> What happened? Where are they? And does anybody care -- have all the spectators  lost interest and just gone home?  </P> <P> After navigating the shoals of the first debate, both campaigns are still  afloat; the race is very much on. The candidates made it through by hugging  familiar coastline. Each charted a course and doggedly stuck to it. There are  lessons to be learned from those tactics and signposts to see us through to the  election.  </P> <P> What the debate proved was that a candidate can answer -- or evade -- any  question as he or she chooses, no matter how it is asked or who asks it. So  much for using this strange hybrid of a dual press conference and high school  oratory to shed light on anything that the candidates don't want to be exposed.  </P> <P> The big news from the debate may well have been the issues that weren't  addressed:  </P> <P> Health care. There was no recognition of the potential implosion of the state's  health-care delivery system.  </P> <P> Insurance reform. A throwaway line.  </P> <P> The homeless. As invisible in this campaign as they are in the eyes of society.  </P> <P> Fiscal problems. Despite the fact there is a budget debacle brewing in  Sacramento as threatening to California's economy as the one rocking Washington  is to the nation's, neither candidate broached a solution.  </P> <P> Whoever is elected governor will have to hit the ground at full gallop with a  plan to deal with an estimated revenue shortfall of at least $500 million. If  the economy is in a tailspin, if voters approve the initiatives on the ballot  that require new funding or earmarked revenues, that estimate could rise to $2  billion or more.  </P> <P> In the face of increasing fiscal inflexibility -- imposed on California's  governors by legal mandates and ballot-box budgeting -- where does each  candidate propose to find the money to balance a seriously out-of-whack budget?  </P> <P> We don't know what their taxing and spending priorities might be -- beyond  buzzwords and generalities. Or how each would move to unshackle the state  budget process.  </P> <P> And we are not likely to know very much before Election Day. In today's  campaign environment, if the candidates dared to tell us what they would  actually do, it could spell political disaster for them.  </P> <P> That is one of the reasons why "change" and "leadership" were the topics of  choice in the first debate. These terms define style rather than substance. And  they are likely to be the buzzwords for the duration of the campaign.  </P> <P> Because it failed to underscore many real, substantial differences between the  contenders, the debate seemed to turn on style and emotion -- on which way each  candidate felt a favorable wind was blowing. There is every indication that the  election, too, will turn on style and emotion -- if not political pandering.  </P> <P> If that is the case, turnout -- not only how may people vote but what the  electorate looks like -- may well determine the next governor.  </P> <P> The reality is that both candidates have engaged in "weather-vane" politics.  Each is bent on using initiatives on the November ballot to catch a friendly  breeze.  </P> <P> Early on -- when a powerful environmental wind was blowing -- Feinstein aligned  herself with "Big Green," Proposition 128, banking on a heavy turnout of  committed environmentalists to boost her chances. But there appears to be no  big bang for Big Green. Will that trim her sails? Will her support for the  massive goals of Proposition 128 allow her instantly to "out-environmentalist"  Republican Wilson? Or will her linkage with what opponents have disdainfully  called "the Hayden initiative," after Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-West Los  Angeles), prove to be a drag?  </P> <P> Wilson felt a gust of wind blowing across the land, knocking down incumbents in  its path. "Voter dissatisfaction," it whistled. And he tacked in the direction  of Proposition 140, Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum's Draconian  term-limitations initiative on the November ballot.  </P> <P> It is clear that Wilson and crew hoped this dramatic endorsement would lift his  campaign out of the doldrums. It did grab a few post-debate headlines, but it's  unclear whether Wilson has been given a push strong enough to blast him into  the lead.  </P> <P> Here is a candidate who, until the moment during the debate when he endorsed  Proposition 140, based his campaign on a long record of experience in  government. How credible is his endorsement of an initiative that prohibits a  long record of experience in government?  </P> <P> On the other hand, will Wilson succeed in using term limits to hang the  Legislature around Feinstein's neck -- linking her to the banana republic that  has been Sacramento these past few years?  </P> <P> Can Wilson's endorsement of Proposition 140 be written off as a sop to the  conservative wing of the Republican Party -- which has been less than  enthusiastic about his candidacy? Will it bring the right wing out to vote for  term limits and Wilson? Will this allow the incumbent U.S. senator instantly to  position himself as "Mr. Political Outsider"? Or will Californians opting for  "change" vote for 140 and Feinstein -- who, by not being a man, simply embodies  change?  </P> <P> The bad news for both contenders is that, historically, it has been difficult  to tie a candidacy to an initiative -- particularly a proposal that wasn't the  candidate's right from the start. That sail may be full of holes.  </P> <P> From the very beginning, this campaign has been fraught with unchartable  whirlwinds. Political tradition suggests "October surprises" yet to come. More  federal budget lunacy? A recession? War with Iraq? A spate of new Sacramento  indictments? Another round of sniper fire over the candidates' spouses'  financial disclosures?  </P> <P> Whatever is in store, most likely it will not be a discussion how each  candidate would govern -- really govern.  </P> <P> In a few days, the candidates will meet again. If the issue to be debated is  change, Wilson ought to tell us how his tenure in the governor's office will  offer change from the policies of his fellow Republican, George Deukmejian,  California's incumbent governor.  </P> <P> If the issue is leadership, Feinstein ought to tell us how she will challenge  the Democratic leaders in the Legislature today.  </P> <P> Someone once said of John F. Kennedy, "He did not fear the weather and did not  trim his sails, but instead challenged the wind to improve its direction and  cause it to blow more softly and kindly over the world and its people." Now  there is a different sense of leadership, of change. Not two small boats  listing in the water, waiting for a favorable breeze to blow their way.  </P></p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Media hit Newspaper groups came under pressure as this year's advertising spending forecasts were revised downwards. The industry's umbrella organisation, the Advertising Association, now believes that spending for publicity in national newspapers will rise only 8 per cent in 1994 against a previous forecast of 10 per cent. It said regional newspaper ad-spend would increase by 7.5 per cent compared with a previous forecast of 9.5 per cent. SG Warburg pointed out the figures to clients, and Telegraph shares fell 7 to 323p while Express parent United Newspapers shed 4 to 488p. News International slipped 13 to 233p and Pearson, which owns the Financial Times and the Westminster Press regional newspaper group, saw an early 12 gain eroded, leaving the stock only a penny firmer on the day at 600p. The latest grim news from a hard hit merchant bank sector spilled over to Reuters Holdings. The international news and financial information group is the biggest supplier of dealing screens and even Mr Brian Newman, the long-term enthusiast from agency broker Henderson Crosthwaite, was discussing the impact to the company of losses suffered by its key clients. Dealers added that a sell order in the morning had been clumsily handled. The combination of technical and fundamental factors saw the shares slide 15 to 452p in spite of news that the company has announced UK price rises of up to 5 per cent effective from January 1. News of short-time working at Ford Motor put the motor component suppliers into a spin and even managed to cast a shadow over British Steel, one of the stock market's more easily identified defensive shares. T&amp;N was singled out for most of the day's punishment, tumbling 14 to 208p following Ford's decision to cut production at its two biggest plants through October. GKN fell 12 to 601p on 1.8m traded. The depression spread right across the sector. BBA lost 5 at 178p, Avon Rubber shed 11 to 570p and Lucas Industries receded 11 to 181p, although with the last-mentioned the impending interim results - due on Monday and expected to contain restructuring provisions of up to Pounds 50m - helped to heighten the tension. The consensus among analysts was that the downswing was an overreaction, with Ford's move seen largely as stock adjustment ahead of what is essentially a low selling final quarter. With the exception of British Steel - down 3 1/2 at 164 1/2 p after 12m turnover - trading volume was mostly light. The gloom surrounding financial stocks associated with bond and equity trading teams deepened as Hambros, the merchant bank, followed SG Warburg in warning of a steep decline in interim profits. Hambros said its bond business had suffered a major deterioration. Bank analysts immediately hacked their current year profits estimates, which were reduced by around Pounds 35m. Hambros shares finished 26 cheaper at 225p. BT made good progress, the shares closing 3 1/2 firmer at 363 1/2 p as NatWest Securities described the stock as a 'sound selection in a nervous stock market' and moved its recommendation from 'hold' to 'add'. NatWest pointed out BT's consistent underperformance over the last four quarters and said technical pressure associated with the final instalment had been removed. 'The interims on November 11 should produce encouraging call volume statistics and we are forecasting a 6.3 per cent increase in the dividend to 7.07p,' said NatWest. British Aerospace confirmed that it is in discussions regarding a possible recommended offer for VSEL, which gained 18 at 1195p. BAe dipped 3 to 439p on the announcement. An upbeat trading statement from contract catering company Compass Group helped the shares rise 8 to 327p. The company begins a round of analysts meetings today and researchers said they would wait to see the company before upgrading profits expectations. Vendome closed 11 ahead at 505p, with UBS said to have issued a buy recommendation on the stock. Anglo-Dutch group Unilever appreciated 13 to 1125p as the company held a series of one-to-one meetings with analysts for an update on current trading. Third-quarter trading was said to have shown good progress, with the hot summer having boosted sales of soft drinks and ice cream in the UK. The company is Europe's biggest ice cream manufacturer. Analysts also suggested that the economic recovery in the rest of Europe should boost earnings next year. Kleinwort Benson urged investors to buy the stock, as did Strauss Turnbull, which said: 'There is scope for a rerating to move the stock on to a market p/e' US buying lifted selected pharmaceuticals stocks. Glaxo improved 10 1/2 to 583p and Wellcome 9 to 663p. Other statistics, Page 41</p>

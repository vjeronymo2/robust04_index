Washington had urged Japan to promise an annual increase of  20 percent in its imports of auto components and finished  automobiles, Kumagai, head of the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry (MITI), told a House of Representatives  Budget Committee session.    But Tokyo turned down the request because MITI thought such  a  promise would be hard to keep, Kumagai said.    The February 11 talks between Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton on establishing a new  trade framework broke down when the two countries failed to  narrow a gap over the definition of "objective criteria" as a  means to gauge U.S. access to Japan's markets.    Japan is opposed to introducing numerical targets in autos  and other trade areas as sought by the U.S.</p>

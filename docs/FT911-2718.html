			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Threat of rail strikes over 7% wage offer: Main BR union leaders decide to ballot members while Aslef talks go to arbitration THE THREAT of a series of national rail strikes, similar to those two years ago, grew yesterday when leaders of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT) decided to ballot members in British Rail over a 7 per cent pay offer. At the same time, BR accepted a request from the Aslef rail drivers' union to go to arbitration. The unions split over their tactics in spite of efforts by their leaders to reach a common strategy in opposing the BR offer. The RMT's national executive decided to hold an industrial action ballot of the union's 60,000 members in BR. Leaders of the union will meet next week to decide the timing and form of action, but are likely to consider 24-hour strikes. Aslef, which represents about 16,000 British Rail train drivers, asked BR to accept arbitration at the Railway Staffs National Tribunal. The three-person tribunal recommends a settlement which has been largely accepted in the past. Although arbitration could provide a means of settling the dispute, any ruling would not be binding on the RMT. The union said it had rejected arbitration because BR had not met recommended awards in full in the past. The dispute coincides with one at London Underground over 1,005 proposed job cuts. The RMT is expected to announce on Monday that its 12,000 members on London Underground have voted for a series of 24-hour strikes on that issue. The simultaneous disputes on British Rail and London Underground echo disruption in the summer of 1989 when there was a series of one-day strikes on both networks. British Rail then raised a 7 per cent offer to 8.8 per cent after an arbitration award from the tribunal. BR said yesterday that it was glad Aslef had 'taken a responsible course' and would not disrupt services. It added that it was 'dismayed' the RMT had decided to ballot members, in spite of knowing that Aslef was seeking arbitration. The third union which has rejected the BR 7 per cent offer, the TSSA white collar union, will meet on Tuesday to discuss what action it will take. TSSA members have already voted in favour of industrial action over London Underground cuts. Mr Derrick Fullick, Aslef general secretary, said the Aslef executive had decided to seek arbitration 'because we could have come in for criticism if we had not'. British Rail raised an initial 6.5 per cent pay offer earlier this week, but said it could not afford more money. The board's external financing limit has been raised by Pounds 320m because of a fall in revenue. Standard Chartered rise, Page 4</p>

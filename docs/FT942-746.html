			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Law urged on discrimination against disabled The Labour party's Commission on Social Justice yesterday called for legislation to outlaw discrimination against the disabled. In a policy paper, the commission also called for research into a system of income-boosting payments, reflecting disabled people's drastically reduced earning capacity and extra costs of daily life. Sir Gordon Borrie, the commission chairman, said: 'Disabled people are an untapped resource of energy and ideas. We need a big shift in attitudes and policies to tap their talent.' The paper was written by commission member Mr Bert Massie, director of the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation. Mr Massie says: 'The first principle of equality for disabled people should be comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation.' His paper, Disabled People and Social Justice, also called for: Research into special payments. 'No fault' compensation, so disablement claims can be handled faster. Disabled to be able to choose local authority services or the cash equiva-lent. Full involvement of disabled in policy-making. According to government figures, the UK has 6.5m disabled people. Out of this total an estimated 70 per cent of those of working age are not employed, and fewer than one in three companies meets the quota that 3 per cent of workers in companies employing 20 or more be disabled. The paper says: 'Few people will reach their grave without experiencing impairment or disability. Public policies which are perceived to favour disabled people are in fact policies for everyone - not policies for 'them' but policies for 'us'.' It says legislation is not 'the whole answer' to disabled people's problems, and highlighted the importance of healthcare provision, housing and transport design. Disabled People and Social Justice.

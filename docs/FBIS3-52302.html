At a news  conference in Jerusalem, Peres said the Cairo document was  agreed upon by both sides, and if the PLO rejects it, it must  clarify on what basis the talks can continue. Peres was  speaking at a news conference with visiting British Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd. Jack Katzenell reports:    [Begin recording] [Katzenell] Foreign Minister Peres  rejected Yasir 'Arafat's charge that Israel is trying to  humiliate the Palestinians. We respect the Palestinian  leadership and opposition, Peres said, but he insisted that  there was a meeting of minds in Cairo on all the major issues,  and this, he said, is what the document reflects.    [Peres] I didn't say that they have automatically to accept  it, but if they reject it, they have to ask themselves: What  will be the basis of negotiations? Why do they negotiate? And  what they have rejected are points that we have agreed upon.    [Katzenell] Peres said the Gaza and Jericho arrangement  which Israel is offering the Palestinians will not be a  Bandustan, as Yasir 'Arafat has charged, since it will not be  the end of the story. On the contrary, in a few months Israel  will begin negotiations on extending the autonomy to the rest of  the territories, Peres said.    British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had talks with Peres  for about an hour this morning. Hurd said Britain has a  passionate interest in the success of the negotiations between  Israel and the PLO. It is not easy to reconcile Palestinian  dignity with Israeli security, Hurd conceded.    [Hurd] So I do not think it is surprising that there are  difficulties and setbacks. I just feel, as an outsider and  well-wisher, that all those concerned are perhaps in the middle  of a river, but they have passed the point where it is easier to  go back then to go forward. It is actually rather easier to go  forward -- although difficult -- than to go back and start all  over again. I am sure that is perceived here; I hope it is also  perceived by the PLO.    [Katzenell] Douglas Hurd said Israel took a courageous and  difficult step when it signed the Declaration of Principles and  recognized the PLO. He would recommend the most liberal terms  possible for Israel when it negotiates its new economic  agreement with the EC. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Ford cuts price of most Mondeos Ford has cut the prices of its best-selling Mondeo car range by Pounds 265 on most models. The company, however, is denying motor-trade reports that it plans to scrap its dealers' 10 per cent profit margin on the cars in favour of a simple handling charge. 'Such reports are nonsense,' Ford said yesterday. But it confirmed that it had told its dealers to cut prices of all Mondeos by Pounds 265, except the most basic version, backdated to May 1, and to more than halve the cost of some options such as anti-lock braking. The measures are equivalent to a price cut of about 2 per cent on the most popular fleet model, the 1.8 litre LX. This year the Mondeo has become the UK's single best-selling car. This follows a troubled start to sales early last year when the company was forced to cut prices by an average of 6 per cent only two weeks after the range's launch. The latest price cuts come against a background in the industry of much lower dealer profit margins compared with the 15 per cent to 17 per cent norm of 12 months ago. Vauxhall recently launched its new Omega executive car with an official dealers' margin of 5 per cent, and Ford has recently cut margins on its Granada/Scorpio executive cars to a similar level.</p>

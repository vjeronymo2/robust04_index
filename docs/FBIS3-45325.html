The central government provided 2.5 million tons of grain  and  32,000 tons of edible oil from State reserves to ease the  shortages in some provinces and cities, according to official  sources.    The local governments in Shaanxi, Shandong and Anhui  provinces and Beijing also supplied more grain and oil to  satisfy demand.    Administrative measures were also applied by local  authorities to stabilize grain prices.    The Beijing municipal government imposed price ceilings on  27  staples, including rice, flour, edible oil and pork.    Changzhou, in Jiangsu Province, set price guidelines for  grain and oil.    Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning Province in the northeast,  is strengthening the monitoring of market prices and restricting  the margin between wholesale and retail prices. The local  government is also preparing to establish a price regulatory  fund to limit price fluctuations on the market.    Experts believe local governments must adopt administrative  methods to keep prices from climbing further.    However, they said the most effective means of intervening  in  the market are economic, including setting up regulatory funds  and perfecting the grain reserve systems.    The key factors in keeping prices stable are raising grain  output and reforming the grain purchase and selling systems,  they said.    Since last November, the prices of grain, rice, edible oil,  pork and eggs have risen sharply around the country.    In coastal provinces and large cities, prices have  skyrocketed by 30 to 40 percent.    According to statistics from major cities, the price of a  kilogram of high-quality rice soared by 1.1 yuan (12.6 cents) to  2 yuan (22.9 cents).    Prices of flour and noodles and other rice products  subsequently increased by 0.4 yuan (46 cents) [figure as  published] to 0.6 yuan (69 cents) [figure as published] per  kilogram.    In large and medium-sized cities of Liaoning Province, the  price of pork jumped by 20 to 50 percent. In Henan Province the  pork price rose last month from 7.35 yuan ($0.84) per kilogram  to 8.25 yuan ($0.95).    Experts attributed the increases to anticipation of  continued  inflation, delays in deliveries caused by the persistent  transportation bottleneck, and psychological and speculative  factors.    Through the joint efforts of central and local governments,  the prices of grain and edible oil have been brought under  control.    For example, Jiangsu Province fixed the prices for grain and  cooking oil and secured an adequate supply for the market.    Just before the new year, more than 10 million kilograms of  rice and flour and 2.5 million kilograms of cooking oil were  released onto the market in Nanjing, the provincial capital.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Hall Engineering in Vietnam Hall Engineering (Holdings), the Shrewsbury-based steel products and automotive engineering group, has become one of the first UK companies to begin manufacturing in Vietnam. BRC Weldmesh, the joint venture with BHP Steel International of Australia, has set up a wholly owned subsidiary in Ho Chi Minh City, Hall said. The move is an important element in Hall's Asian strategy - it is already strongly represented in south-east Asia through associated companies in Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia. Initially, BRC Weldmesh (Vietnam) is taking over production of reinforcement spacers for poured concrete from its parent plant in Singapore.</p>

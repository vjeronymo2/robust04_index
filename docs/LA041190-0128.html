			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> "James Bond" Triumphs: Timothy Dalton, star of the latest James Bond films, was  awarded unspecified libel damages at a London court Tuesday from the publishers  of a North American movie magazine that suggested he was going to be booted  from the Bond role. Dalton's lawyer, Philip Conway, said the reports in Globe  magazine that the actor could be dropped to save future James Bond films from  financial disaster were untrue and had distressed and embarrassed him. Conway  said the producers of the films were very satisfied with Dalton's performances  in "The Living Daylights" and "Licence to Kill." GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Junji Tani, Fluid Research Laboratory, Tohoku </F> University, ``Intelligent Material for Super Structure and  Materials'']    [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   The concept of smart material and adaptive structure  equipped  with a combination of abilities to detect, (sensor function), to  judge, to arrive at conclusion (control function), and to  trigger actions by issuing instructions (actuator function) on  their own is a type of simulation modeled after bioentity. In  order to create an intelligent materials and structures which  can deal with changing environments and usage conditions by  effecting changes in order to optimize a state in which they  find themselves, a new design method known as adaptive design  will be required. In this paper, we deal with adaptive design  and its application examples.  <H5>  Adaptive Design </H5>  <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-01A>           Fig. 1. Adaptive Design </FIG>      A method of designing a conventional composite material and  structure has sought the optimum of passive variables for shape  and other elements. In other words, in Fig. 1, within a  second-dimensional surface created by an evaluation function and  passive variables, an optimal combination which satisfies a  particular condition at hand has been sought. However, as  environment and conditions became more severe, it has become  necessary to satisfy a large number of conditions  simultaneously. When an environment condition changed through  time, in some cases, no matter how many times passive variables  are changed, the optimal combination satisfying the condition  simply was not found. The inclusion of a sensor, an actuator,  and a controller in designing materials and structures to deal  with this problem, however, meant an increased number of passive  variables and search for the optimal combination in a  3-dimensional space shown in Fig. 1. For instance, as in Fig. 1,  conditions A and B could not be satisfied simultaneously using  passive variables alone; however, if the scope of conditions A  and B are changed by including active variables, the scope which  satisfied conditions A and B can be formed within the range  allowed. Thus, a method which designs the optimal material and  structure by using both passive and active variables, namely, an  adaptive design method, becomes necessary in designing  intelligent materials and structures.  <H5>  3. Functionally Gradient Intelligent Material System </H5>   The functionally gradient material is a type of material  designed to satisfy both thermal resistance and strength  conditions by continuously changing the ratio of these two  factors in material composition. Even if the two types of  materials are mixed to produce the optimal gradient, with a  thermal-resistant material maintained at super high temperatures  and a strength material at normal temperatures, it is possible  to relax the thermal stress of a functionally gradient material,  thereby making it possible to place it within the allowable  scope. However, this will be difficult unless thermal  deformation is allowed. It also is difficult to produce the kind  of a mixture ratio of the two types of materials enabling both  thermal stress and thermal deformation of the functionally  gradient material to be within the allowable scope. Moreover,  even if stress has been eased when the thermal resistent  material is maintained at super high temperatures when in use,  still when both thermal resistant material and strength material  maintain the same temperature when not in use, thermal stress  may be generated, in which event problems will arise. In order  to avoid this, it is necessary to introduce the concept of  intelligent material, designed to adapt to any change which may  occur in environment or in usage condition, into functionally  gradient materials. This means the use of the adaptive method in  designing of functionally gradient intellectual materials.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-02A>           Fig. 2. Functionally Gradient Intelligent </FIG>       <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-02B>              Distribution of Temperature and Thermal </FIG>       <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-02C>              Fig. 4. Distribution of Thermal Expansion </FIG>       <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-02D>              Fig. 5. Distribution of Young's Ratio and Poisson </FIG>        As shown in Fig. 2, by adhering the laminated piezoelectric  material to the functionally gradient material's low-temperature  strength material side, a functionally gradient material system  can be achieved. When the thermal resistant material side  (Z&lt;sup&gt; r&lt;/sup&gt; O&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; ) is T&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt; =1 100&deg;C and  the strength material side (Ti&lt;inf&gt; 6&lt;/inf&gt; Al&lt;inf&gt; 4&lt;/inf&gt; V) is  T&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; =0&deg;C, if the optimal functionally gradient  material is designed by using the finite element method to  achieve relaxation of thermal stress, as shown in Figs. 3-5,  temperature, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion  coefficient, Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratio are  distributed in the direction of board thickness. Thermal  deformation and thermal stress are as shown in Figs. 6 and 7. By  adding voltage to a piezoelectric actuator, thermal deformation  can be suppressed while maintaining thermal stress within the  allowable range. By equipping a part of the actuator material  with the sensor function and inserting it into an arithmetic  board possessing the control function, the material will be able  to maintain the optimal state even if temperature conditions of  the high temperature side material is changing by minute.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-03A>           Fig. 6.

Intelligent Panel </H5>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-03C>             Fig. 8. Intelligent Panel System </FIG>       <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-03D>             Fig. 9. Flutter Vibration Control Effect </FIG>       Presented in Fig. 8 is an example of an intelligent material  system in which piezoelectric film is bonded to both surfaces of  a cantilever thin board, using one side as a sensor, the other  as an actuator, and an external computer as a controller. When  this cantilever thin board was installed in uniform parallel air  currents and air speed exceeded a certain level, the thin board  generated flutter and vibrated violently. The use of the  actuator proved to be of no value as it was used after the  flutter had occurred. The piezoelectric film was not powerful  enough to stop the flutter. However, if control was activated  even when the speed of air current was not sufficiently fast to  create flutter, the system would sense the occurrence of  flutter, and by activating the activator even when response  amplitude was extremely small, it would be able to stop flutter.  Consequently, as shown in Fig. 9, it is possible to realize a  panel designed to prevent flutter from occurring until air  current speed reaches the point where it exceeds the normal  flutter flow speed. Moreover, if the actuator can generate  powerful force, it will become possible to raise the limit of  flow speed at which flutter will not be produced. This limit is  determined by the use of an adaptive design which takes into  consideration usage conditions.  <H5>  Intelligent Arch </H5>  <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-03E>           Fig. 10. Intelligent Arch </FIG>      Fig. 10 represents an example of the intelligent material  system, designed to bond piezoelectric film to both sides of a  half arch, using the portion of the film covering an area from  O&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt;  to X&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt;  as a sensor, from  X&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt;  to X&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  as an actuator, and an external  personal computer as a controller. The adaptive design can be  used to decide on the question of which part of the arch a  piezoelectric film should be adhered to so that the response of  the arch receiving forced vibration in both upward and downward  directions can be minimized. As shown in Figs. 11 and 12, when a  control input obtained on the basis of robust control theory was  added to the actuator, we have found that results produced by a  numerical simulation and an experiment for the most part were in  agreement. Since control input 300V was added rapidly, a  response at the initial point was large. However, this situation  probably can be avoided if we are to increase control input  gradually.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-04A>           Fig. 11.

Intelligent Cylindrical Shell </H5>  <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-04C>           Fig. 13. Intelligent Cylindrical Shell </FIG>      <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-04D>             Fig. 14. Distribution of Actuators </FIG>       <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-05A>             Fig. 15. Response Amplitude and Number of Vibration </FIG>       <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-05B>             Fig. 16. Time History Response </FIG>       In MRI system, it is necessary to run high-frequency current  through gradient magnetic-field coils, which then will turn into  a uniformly strong magnetic field. In order to enhance MRI  system performance, it will be necessary to strengthen the  uniform magnetic field and increase the frequency of  high-frequency currents. This means that a electromagnetic force  with a large high-frequency must be applied to the gradient  magnetic field coils, as a result of which a fixed drum will be  vibrated violently by the coils. The vibrations will be so  severe that they will be difficult to stop even with the use of  a damper attachment. In order to control electromagnetic  vibration and eliminate noise, it will be necessary to develop  an intelligent coil drum. The gradient magnetic field coil drum,  as shown in Fig. 13, has a cylindrical surface equipped with two  ring-shaped coils and two pairs of curved surface coils.  Electric currents are run through these coils periodically, as a  result of which the electromagnetic force (Lorentz force) is  generated as it interacts with the strong magnetic field in the  axial direction. This causes violent shaking in the coil drum.  As shown in Fig. 14, vibrations can be damped actively by using  distributed piezoelectric actuators. When the actuator is  controlled and operated, as shown in Figs. 15 and 16, the  vibration amplitude of drum coils become smaller. It was found  that when the optimal distribution of the distributed  piezoelectric actuators was obtained by using the adaptive  design method, as clearly indicated in Case 2, damping effects  were further improved.  <H5>  7. Conclusion </H5>   We have demonstrated that by designing an intelligent  material using the adaptive design method, it became possible to  create one with improved performance. Although here we used  piezoelectric ceramics and piezoelectric filters, the  magnetostrictive and other types of functionally gradient  materials can be used. Moreover, since the electromagnetic  functional material is equipped with the combination of sensor  and actuator functions, it is regarded as the most promising  intelligent material to emerge.</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ARCTIC AIR PUTS BITE ON NORTH, STRETCHES TO FLA.  </P> <P> Arctic air howled across the nation's northern tier today, and winter's bite  was felt as far south as Florida, where a possible frost kept citrus growers  checking their trees and sun lovers all bundled up.  </P> <P> Heavy snow buried parts of Maine, West Virginia and the Great Lakes states.  Some snowbelt areas received nearly two feet of winter's white by early today.  </P> <P> Schools were closed in two counties in West Virginia and in northern areas of  Maine.  </P> <P> In the Deep South, cold winds blew across Georgia. Temperatures, with the wind  chill factor, plummeted as low as 10 degrees in Atlanta.  </P></p>

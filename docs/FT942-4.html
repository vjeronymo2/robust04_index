			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Keating renews effort to strengthen economic ties with Indonesia Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, yesterday ended a three-day business promotion visit to Jakarta, reflecting his renewed effort to place Australian-Indonesian ties on a sound economic footing after a history of political differences. Relations between the two countries have had a bumpy ride over the last few years following Australia's criticism of Indonesia's record on human rights. Mr Keating's efforts to divert the focus to economic issues has become more urgent in the run-up to the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in November, which will be chaired by Indonesia. Two-way trade between Australia and Indonesia rose to Dollars 3bn last year, nearly twice its level of five years ago, and Indonesia is Australia's 11th-largest trading partner. While Mr Keating is keen to promote close business ties, Indonesia showed more interest in accelerating the pace at which its trade deficit with Australia is shrinking - to Dollars 566m last year from Dollars 833m in 1990. Mr Keating's visit coincides with Australia's biggest trade exhibition ever  -Australia Today Indonesia 1994 - which is being held in Jakarta. Although Mr Keating would have preferred to adhere to economic matters, pressure in Australia forced him to raise the question of Indonesia's recent press bans. Last week the Indonesian government banned two leading magazines and a tabloid - Editor, Tempo and DeTik - in its most severe clampdown on political debate in years. The ban came after the government had pledged to foster more political openness. Mr Keating said he expressed his regret at the press ban, which he said 'appears to conflict or at least contrast with the openness generally occurring in the Indonesian economy', but did not give the impression the press ban was discussed in any detail. This was Mr Keating's third visit to Indonesia in three years. On each occasion he has vowed to move away from discussing their relations in political terms. 'No country is more important to Australia than Indonesia,' he said during a visit in March this year. 'For too long we were inclined to see both Indonesia itself and our relationship with Indonesia, in almost exclusively political terms.' In Australia, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade published a report on the Australian-Indonesian trade relationship yesterday, to coincide with the Jakarta trade fair and business conference. The report, including a series of articles by both Australian and Indonesian officials and academics came to no firm conclusions about the relationship's likely development, but some authors stressed that the countries' geographical proximity would be no guarantee of enhanced economic ties. The report quoted Mr Richard Woolcott, head of the Australia-Indonesia Institute, as saying that 'opportunities will not fall into our lap because we are neighbours', and pointed out that while Indonesia is a very large potential market for Australia, the reverse does not hold true. 'Australia is geographically isolated, and must overcome any tendency to insularity to which this might give rise by linking in with rapidly developing regional transport and telecommunications networks,' it suggested. The report noted that in key areas, such as textiles, the trade relationship is still hampered by past protectionist policies. While Indonesia has developed its textile export industry, and is acquiring an increasing amount of cotton from Australia, one author said there could be 'more mutually beneficial two-way trade as both countries move to greater liberalisation'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Bernard Guetta: "Major's Tragic Mistake"] </F>   [Text] Politics, ideology, the absence of a historical  vision. Everything seems to have driven John Major to prompt  this European crisis. As far as politics is concerned, the  facts are well known. Unappreciated by his electorate, who  recently humiliated him by granting Labor a triumph in the  European elections, the British prime minister is, above all,  unpopular within his own party. Indeed, the Conservatives accuse  him of lacking charisma, while the Right of his party -- which  has not forgiven him for betraying Thatcher and which accuses  him of being too European (no less!) -- is just waiting for its  chance for revenge.    So John Major had everything to gain from being tough in  Corfu, because in that way he disarmed the Thatcherites while at  the same time displaying strength of character, which hitherto  has not been regarded as his foremost quality.    The second reason for Britain's veto is less petty. True,  the Belgian prime minister -- from whom John Major wanted to  withhold the presidency of the Commission -- is the opposite of  an extreme economic liberalist and therefore of a British  Conservative. A Christian Democrat, but from the left-wing of  this movement, Jean- Luc Dehaene is indeed, from the political  viewpoint, another Delors, imbued with social Catholicism;  convinced that it is the state that creates the difference  between a market economy and the law of the jungle; and, last, a  supporter of a Europe that is present on the international scene  and whose influence extends beyond that of a free trade area.    All this is a matter for a genuine debate -- a political  Europe versus a free trade Europe; a Europe of social consensus  versus a laissez-faire Europe; the Europe of the new ideological  Right versus the Europe of the social-democratic and  Christian-social center.    Then there is the question of the historical vision. Here  there is no debate. The facts are clear to all: John Major's  Britain is simply blind. It refuses to see, first, that the  United States of the post-communist era has its mind mainly on  regaining its economic health, that leading the world is the  least of its concerns, and that it therefore no longer needs a  Britain which, halfway between itself and Europe, will represent  it there.    Britain no longer has a future as a forward post of the  United States. Its future is Europe. It has no other, but,  incapable of acknowledging this obvious truth, it fails to see  that it could perform an exceptional role within the European  Union.    A crisis is in fact looming within Europe, because of the  influence that Germany is acquiring. It is the Union's most  populous country, and also the one which will derive the  greatest benefits from it. Austria, Finland, Norway, and Sweden  -- the four states that will join the Union next year -- are  closer to the Germanic world than to France, Britain, or  southern Europe. Already Europe is sliding toward the north,  toward Protestantism and austerity. And this is just the first  step. Central Europe is knocking on the Union's door. It will  enter, too, and this part of Europe is, from every viewpoint --  historical, cultural, linguistic, and of course economic --  indissolubly linked to Germany.    Having been invented by the French, the united Europe is  becoming a German Europe. It is no conspiracy. It is worse  than that. It is geography that is dictating this, because  united Germany is at the center of the western part of the  continent, which now extends as far as the borders of the former  USSR.    Apart from the Germans, who are terrified by this situation,  each country is behaving as though the collapse of the Wall had  changed nothing. The French in particular still base their  entire foreign policy on strengthening the "Franco-German axis."  But some day, doubtless soon, the malaise will surface. If  only it wanted to, Britain could, by making a real commitment to  Europe, become the guarantor of the continental balance, helping  to counterbalance Germany's power.    Britain needs Europe as much as Europe needs it. And yet  because of Britain Europe is losing time. And losing itself.</p>

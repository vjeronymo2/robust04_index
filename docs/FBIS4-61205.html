			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Boris Mkrtchyan report: "Tough Without Common Bank"] </F>   [Text] Yerevan -- Armenian Prime Minister Hrant Bagratian  has made a proposal to the CIS heads of government to set up a  single interstate bank designed to carry out financial  operations among the Commonwealth countries. This bank would  also issue a monetary unit common to all of them.    The Armenian premier's explanation for his proposal is that,  by introducing a national currency in their own country, the CIS  countries cannot fail to use the Russian ruble as the sole means  for interstate financial transactions, constantly asking the  Central Bank of Russia for loans. All this is leading not only  to the devaluation of national currencies, but also to a fall in  the ruble rate.    A single CIS interstate bank and a monetary unit common to  the Commonwealth countries will promote the rapid restoration of  economic ties within the CIS, the economic improvement of the  countries of this union, and the further process of their  integration, the premier believes.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> V. Joint Election to Have &sect;&sect;1.1398&hyph;1 and 1.1398&hyph;2 Apply to Cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenced Before November 9, 1992  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For cases commenced prior to November 9, 1992, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminating on or after that date, the proposed regulations apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only if a joint election is made by the debtor and the estate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In cases under chapter 7, the election is valid only with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written consent of the bankruptcy trustee. In cases under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chapter 11, the election is valid only if it is incorporated (a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into a bankruptcy plan that is confirmed by the bankruptcy court,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or (b) into an order of the court. Additionally, the caption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``ELECTION PURSUANT TO &sect;1.1398&hyph;1 (or &sect;1.1398&hyph;2)'' must be placed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prominently on the first page of each of the debtor's returns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is affected by the election (other than returns for taxable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years that begin after the termination of the estate) and on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first page of each of the estate's returns that is affected by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the election.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commentator recommended eliminating the requirement that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the debtor join in the election. In general, this commentator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> felt that this requirement gave the debtor exclusive control over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the passive activity losses and credits and unused section 465  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> losses to the detriment of the creditors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final regulations retain the requirement that the debtor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> join in the election. This requirement permits debtors to rely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the law in effect at the time they entered into bankruptcy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commentator suggested that because the consent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debtor is required, the regulations should clarify that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written consent of the debtor is required in cases under chapter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7, in addition to the written consent of a bankruptcy trustee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations require the debtor to show consent by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actually making the election. The debtor's election will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidenced by the return on which it is made, and it is not clear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what purpose would be served by an additional paperwork  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement. Accordingly, this suggestion was not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commentator requested clarification as to whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> election could be made on an amended return. In response to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment, the regulations clarify that the election can be made on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an amended return.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, a commentator requested that the regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarify whether the election is available for estates that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminated after November 9, 1992, but before the adoption of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final regulations. Because the regulations are sufficiently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clear on this point, this comment was not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Other Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commentator requested that the regulations provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance on the determination of basis under section 1398(g)(6),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which provides that, in the case of assets acquired by the estate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the debtor, the estate succeeds to the debtor's basis,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined as of the first day of the debtor's taxable year in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the case commenced. The specific guidance requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned the effect on basis of events (such as depreciation or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributions received by the debtor as the result of holding an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest in a passthrough entity) that occur after the first day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the debtor's taxable year in which the case commenced, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to the commencement date. It was also requested that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations provide guidance on the application of the ``varying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest'' rule of section 706(d)(1) to the estate. This guidance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is outside the scope of these regulations. Accordingly, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final regulations do not provide guidance on these issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Special Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has been determined that these final regulations are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant rules as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, a copy of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rules was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Drafting Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The principal author of these regulations is Amy J. Sargent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Income Tax and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accounting), IRS. However, other personnel from the IRS and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treasury Department participated in their development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 26 CFR Part 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Income taxes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 26 CFR Part 602  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, 26 CFR parts 1 and 602 are amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1_INCOME TAXES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Paragraph 1. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The authority citation for part 1 continues to read  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in part as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  26 U.S.C. 7805 *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

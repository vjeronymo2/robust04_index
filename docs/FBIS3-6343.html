You have brought with you the Thai  people's friendship for the Vietnamese people. For myself, I am  very pleased to have the opportunity to return the hospitality  that Your Excellency Prime Minister Chuan Likphai has accorded  to the Vietnamese leaders during their visits to Thailand, which  have achieved much in terms of economic development.    I am very pleased to note that since October 1991, when I  had  the opportunity to pay an official visit to Thailand, the  relations between our two countries have reached a new level of  development. Comrade Do Muoi, our party general secretary, paid  a visit to Thailand and the Vietnamese people had the  opportunity to welcome the Thai Prince and Princess. Those  visits were of great significance because they have contributed  to consolidating and strengthening our bilateral relations.    We have exchanged honest views on issues of common concern  in  an effort to strengthen the friendly relations between our two  countries. Bilateral economic, trade, scientific, technical,  and tourist cooperation has been expanded. The signing of  agreements on bilateral tourist cooperation and cooperation  between the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the  Federation of Thai Industries during your current visit to  Vietnam is a new indication of that positive trend of  development.    Vietnam and Thailand are two neighboring countries with many  cultural similarities and long-lasting relations throughout the  course of history. The harmonious relations between our two  peoples are a very important factor for the prosperity of each  country and also a great contribution to stability and  cooperation in Southeast Asia.    Being fully aware of this, our government and people have  done all we can to contribute to consolidating and promoting  good friendship and neighborliness. We are persisting in a  comprehensive national renovation policy while at the same  implementing a foreign policy of openness for the sake of peace,  cooperation, and development. That policy is in conformity with  the great trends of development in the region and other parts of  the world. Consequently, it is gaining the full support of our  entire people and of broad sections of world public opinion, and  is bringing about important results.    Against such a backdrop is our resolve to join efforts with  countries in the region in turning Southeast Asia into a region  of peace, independence, cooperation, and development. Prompted  by that resolve, Vietnam will make a constructive contribution  to the upcoming Regional Security Forum in Bangkok.    Your Excellency the Prime Minister and distinguished guests,  I would like to invite you to toast the health of the King and  Royal Family, the president of the Socialist Republic of  Vietnam, and His Excellency the Prime Minister and other  distinguished Thai guests. May the friendship and comprehensive  cooperation between Vietnam and Thailand continue to be  consolidated and developed with each passing day. Let us toast  the health of all those who are present here.</p>

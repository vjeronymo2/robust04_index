			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Costa Rican President Jose </F> Figueres Olsen in San Jose and Honduran President Carlos Roberto  Reina at the Presidential Palace in Tegucigalpa, by unidentified  reporters at the Voz de Honduras studios in Tegucigalpa; from  the "The Morning Paper" newscast -- live]    [Excerpts] [Figueres] We are concluding the final details  of our visit this morning. We have a great deal of hope and  expectation. We are ready to spend this afternoon with you and,  tomorrow, to attend the Central American presidents' summit with  U.S. Vice President Gore. We hope this meeting will enable us  to achieve progress in some of the topics that interest us in  Central America and areas in which friendly countries can  continue helping us.    [Reporter] Regarding the topics that will be discussed with  the U.S. vice president, in your view, which are the most  important ones that interest Central America as a whole?    [Figueres] Well, the trade topic is obviously of great  importance. Each of our countries conducts a great deal of  trade with the United States, and, in view of the signing of  NAFTA by Canada, the United States, and Mexico, we cannot be  left behind and lose a relative advantage with Mexico in both  the areas of attracting investments and our competitiveness in  this market.    In addition to the trade topic, I think another topic that  is  of great interest to us is the strengthening of democratic  institutions in our region, not only during the electoral  process every four years, but the strengthening of the various  mechanisms and institutions that consolidate our democratic  systems between elections.    Of course, other topics of great interest to us are  environmental issues and sustainable development. God has given  us a region that has a great amount of biodiversity. It has  exceptional characteristics in terms of the international  community, and we should take advantage of our natural resources  in an effort to achieve greater overall benefit from them in  terms of our production. Nevertheless, we must still protect  these resources for future generations.    [Reporter] President Figueres, at this time, Honduran  President Carlos Roberto Reina wants to greet you over the Voz  de Honduras Network, which has made possible this dialogue  between the two of you in advance of the mini-summit of Central  American presidents and U.S. Vice President Al Gore.    [Reina] Good morning, my friend, dear Jose Figueres Olsen.  We are anxiously waiting to embrace you and, at dinner tonight,  to discuss the points we will broach with the U.S. vice  president tomorrow. What you said moments ago about sustainable  growth and the strengthening of democracy is the implementation  of what we both promised in the election campaigns that brought  us into office. In the campaigns, we spoke about uniting  Central America. We spoke about combined growth with a human  face and about jointly facing economic problems to benefit our  people. I am waiting for you today, my very dear distinguished  friend. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] Let us return to San Jose for the Costa Rican  president's final message. Thank you for having participated in  this dialogue with President Reina. President Figueres, please  give us your message to the Honduran people, who are waiting for  you with open arms in Tegucigalpa.    [Figueres] Thank you, Voz de Honduras, for the opportunity  to  participate in this joint interview. I think this is the first  such interview that has ever been held in Central America. I  hope there will be more. If there is something we need, it is  to strengthen our ties and relations, shorten the distances  between our countries, and to discuss our problems, challenges,  and our hopes about Central America's future. I am optimistic  by nature, and I think that despite the region's problems, we  are pushing ahead with work, devotion, and effort. The results  will be good.    [Reporter] We will now have a final message from Honduran  President Carlos Roberto Reina, whom we also thank for accepting  Voz de Honduras' invitation. We have had President Figueres on  the line directly from San Jose. Go ahead, Dr. Reina.    [Reina] I think the Central American dialogue has already  begun for this meeting with the U.S. vice president. I warmly  congratulate the media which have cooperated with us. It is  extraordinary how the Central American people can be informed  immediately and how they can follow events to form their own  opinions about such important meetings.</p>

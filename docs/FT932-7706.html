			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Belgium stresses European union MR Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister, said yesterday greater European integration would be a priority when the country takes over the EC presidency from Denmark in six weeks' time. 'It has to be said quite clearly that the best response to the political and economic crisis we are going through is not less, but more Europe,' said Mr Dehaene in a speech in Waregem, northern Belgium. 'That means, first, implementing the Maastricht treaty and, secondly, ensuring (economic) growth in Europe,' Mr Dehaene, a Flemish Christian Democrat, told a meeting of Catholic employers. Mr Dehaene's speech is likely to create disquiet among Euro-sceptics in Britain, which has yet to ratify the Maastricht treaty. They fear that Belgium, backed by other enthusiastic EC members, will pursue a strong line in favour of greater integration during its six-month presidency, especially now that Denmark has voted in favour of the treaty. He added that monetary union would underpin the European economy and 'finally put an end to competitive devaluations' of EC currencies, which have put pressure on Belgium's export-based economy. Senior Belgian ministers have suggested in the last week that the EC might have to consider relaxing Maastricht's strict economic conditions for monetary union, if the recession persists.</p>

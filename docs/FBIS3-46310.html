			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  spokesman said on 27 January that the U.S. plan to deploy  Patriot missiles to the ROK will not be an obstacle to ongoing  negotiations between the IAEA and Pyongyang on the nuclear  inspection issue.    In a meeting with reporters in Vienna, David Kyd noted that  since this plan clearly has a defensive nature, it will not  represent a threat to anyone and that this plan is an issue  between the United States and the ROK.    Patriot missiles, which were developed and manufactured in  the United States, were used during the Gulf war for the first  time. These missiles successively destroyed Scud missiles fired  by Iraq at Saudi Arabia and Israel.    On 25 January, the U.S. Government said that the plan to  deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK was proposed by the commander  of U.S. Forces in the ROK. This plan has not been approved by  President Clinton nor has the date of deployment or the number  of missiles been decided.</p>

Skorodumov; </F> UDC 621.372.8]    [Abstract] A method of determining the value of the complex  propagation constant for a surface electromagnetic wave is  proposed which does not require kno wledge of the  electrophysical parameters of the studied material. The material  studied in this article is a rectangular plane- parallel plate  with a length of no less than two wavelengths and a width  smaller than a wavelength. The material is placed i n a UHF  field and rotated in the horizontal plane around its minor axis.  The signal scattered by the material (in the form of the  reflected beam pattern) is recorded. Irradiation of the material  with an electromagnetic wave along its long side generates a  surface wave that creates maximum reflection in near  longitudinal directions. In the reflected beam pattern a  distinctiv e main lobe of the surface wave appears which can be  used to calculate the complex propagation constant for the  material. The lobe is near parabolic, which is sufficient to  determine effective scattering area values. It is much simpler  to determine the complex propagation constant using this method.

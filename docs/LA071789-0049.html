			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EVANS, STILL GOING STRONG, HITS TWO HOME RUNS  </P> <P> The American League likes to brag about the achievements of its 42-year-old  pitcher, Nolan Ryan. The fireballing right-hander throws almost as hard as he  did when he broke into the majors more than 21 years ago. And he's having  another banner year, too.  </P> <P> The National League has a 42-year-old it is proud of, too. He's Darrell Evans.  It is much more difficult to play every game at a regular position than it is  to pitch every five or six days for any player, let alone one over 40.  </P> <P> But the Atlanta Braves pick the spots for Evans and he can still contribute  offensively.  </P> <P> Evans, playing first base Sunday at Atlanta, hit two long home runs to lead the  Braves to a 6-2 victory over the New York Mets.  </P> <P> In a game delayed by rain three times for a total of 2 1/2 hours, Evans  produced the big blows for rookie pitcher Marty Clary, now 3-0 after being  recalled from triple-A Richmond.  </P> <P> The home runs gave Evans 409 for his career, breaking a tie with former Dodger  star Duke Snider for 21st place on the all-time list.  </P> <P> Clary, who gave up just one run in 6 2/3 innings but departed after the second  rain delay, was not yet in his teens in 1973 when Evans had his first big home  run year, when he hit 41 for the Braves. As recently as 1987, after his 40th  birthday, he hit 34 for the Detroit Tigers. He has six this season in only 128  at-bats.  </P> <P> Manager Davey Johnson of the Mets knows all about the 1973 season. He also  played for the Braves and hit 43 homers. Henry Aaron had 40 that year.  </P> <P> "It's good to see my friend Darrell doing well," Johnson said. "But I wish he  didn't have to do it against us. I would have enjoyed it more watching him do  it on television."  </P> <P> Manager Russ Nixon of the Braves doesn't have a right-handed hitting first  baseman. But he figured that left-hander Bob Ojeda, who isn't overpowering,  would have some trouble with Evans.  </P> <P> "The old man did a job today," Nixon said. "He really picked us up. I just have  to find the right spots for him. He can still help."  </P> <P> Except for Howard Johnson, who hit his 23rd home run and doubled and scored the  other run, the Mets again failed to produce much offense.  </P> <P> They went into Atlanta figuring to start their move in the Eastern Division.  Instead, they only managed to split the four-game series. They trail Montreal  by 3 1/2 games.  </P> <P> Montreal 6, Cincinnati 3 -- Although they managed to extend their lead in the  East, the Expos couldn't really be all that proud of winning three out of four  at Cincinnati.  </P> <P> They had considerable trouble against a team missing five regulars because of  injuries, including three-fourths of its infield.  </P> <P> In the finale, the Expos scored three runs in the 12th to win a game in which  both clubs played poorly. There were six errors (four by the Expos), 17 walks,  two wild pitches and 26 strikeouts in the game which lasted four hours eight  minutes.  </P> <P> Nelson Santovenia had a run-scoring single in the 12th inning, then Otis Nixon  singled with the bases loaded to break the game open.  </P> <P> "We are struggling," Red Manager Pete Rose said. "But we had opportunities. We  were 0 for 10 with runners in scoring position."  </P> <P> It was a costly win for Montreal. Shortstop Spike Owen, one of the reasons the  Expos are leading the division, suffered a severe ankle sprain in the fourth  inning while sliding into third base and was placed on the 15-day disabled  list.  </P> <P> San Francisco 3, Pittsburgh 1 -- In the West the first-place Giants, even  though their best pitcher, Rick Reuschel, is in a slump, are playing as if they  intend to pull away.  </P> <P> They welcomed Scott Garrelts off the disabled list just in time for him to  pitch a strong game at San Francisco.  </P> <P> Garrelts (7-3) restricted the Pirates to two hits and an unearned run in six  innings and the Giants stretched their lead to three games over Houston, which  had its game in Philadelphia rained out.  </P> <P> Jeff Brantley and Steve Bedrosian completed the two-hitter, with Bedrosian  getting his 13th save. He has seven in eight chances since the Giants obtained  him from Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Garrelts has been out since June 29 with a hamstring injury.  </P> <P> "I was sharper than I thought I would be," Garrelts said. "I felt more  butterflies than usual in the first couple of innings before I settled down to  a groove.  </P> <P> The Giants, without a home run from either Will Clark or Kevin Mitchell,  improved their home record to 31-15, best in the league.  </P> <P> San Diego 4, Chicago 3 -- After being dominated by the Cubs all season, the  Padres finished up their play against them at San Diego wishing for more.  </P> <P> When pinch-hitter Tim Flannery hit a sacrifice fly with the bases loaded in the  sixth inning to break a tie, it gave the Padres their third win in a row over  the Cubs.  </P> <P> Chris James had three hits, including a second-inning home run.

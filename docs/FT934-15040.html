			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (30): Small is still beautiful - Mushtak Parker finds that, despite a wave of mergers and acquisitions, there will always be a demand for small and medium-sized operators / Freight forwarders THE acquisition of Bristol-based freight forwarder M&amp;M Services from the receivers last July by the Swiss-based freight giant Kuehne &amp; Nagel (K&amp;N) reflects the uncertainty independent and small freight companies are facing. The feeling among independent operators is that as the recession in the European Community continues to bite, small and medium-sized freight forwarders will find it hard to survive. M&amp;M Services, with an annual turnover of about Dollars 8m, was once the Rolls Royce of the freight forwarding industry, but with profit margins and commissions reduced, it became impossible to compete with the pricing power of the freight majors. According to a former M&amp;M Services chairman Mike Guinn, now a regional director with K&amp;N, losses sustained by the independents and small freight companies through mergers of bankruptcies is a worldwide problem. 'We could not survive because our ability to give the level required by the industry was not sustainable,' he says. 'Investment in tracking services and computerisation requires a lot of money which only the majors can afford. Ours was a personal service and not one dictated by computers.' A mixture of mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, cross-border alliances, management buy-outs or simply bankruptcy has swept across the industry in the past year. A survey by Dutch management consultancy Van der Geer and Van Hasenbroek carried out earlier this year found that in the five years from 1988, some 200 acquisitions took place in the Dutch road haulage sector alone. British and US firms accounted for a third of the takeovers. In France, bankruptcies among road hauliers during last year increased by 2.5 per cent on the previous year. Some independents such as Communication Rapide Inter-Enterprises (CRIE), the French integrator in the international parcels express sector, whose clients include Peugeot, Renault, Barclays Bank and Digital, are maintaining market share by offering a flexible service. CRIE claims a 10 per cent share of the international express market from France. With the European freight distribution market exceeding Ecu160bn (Pounds 122bn), the stakes are high. Some cross-border mergers and strategic alliances have been spurred by the perceived opportunities in the Single Market. But most multinationals, while cutting costs, are acquiring companies in target markets, then consolidating to meet local freight transport needs. Sometimes the strategy does not work, but the effect is felt across the sector. US express parcels company Federal Express (FedEx) made heavy losses attempting to establish itself in the UK, and was forced to pull out. The consensus is, however, that small and medium-sized freight forwarders have a role to play. 'There will always be a need for small freight companies,' says Colin Beaumont, divisional manager of the British International Freight Association, whose membership comprises 60 per cent small and medium-sized companies. 'From time to time you will have mergers and acquisitions and this is a reasonably healthy process. 'It is not a trend. It has happened all the time. I would say that there have not been more bankruptcies and takeovers during the recession that in normal operating times. Freight forwarding is a fragmented and a niche market business,' Mr Beaumont says. At the other end of the industry, alignment, mergers and contractions are needed to maintain margins or to stay in business. Analysts do not see this changing. David Grant, marketing director of P&amp;O containers Europe, stresses that the big companies are not getting bigger. 'Companies are helping each other out and the trend is no different from any other business or sector. 'Joint ventures and other alliances offer opportunities to reduce costs. Smaller operators will have to look at their niche markets and work with bigger companies to capitalise in terms of efficiencies and investment opportunities into computer systems and EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) networks,' Mr Grant says. The leading freight operators claim that they are not making big profits, but rationalisation does mean better rates, services and greater efficiency. Mr Grant acknowledges that the large operators do have a responsibility to the industry and partnership is definitely a trend but he remains optimistic about prospects for forwarders. 'The recession offers opportunities as well. The international movement of goods does not necessarily go down,' he says. But Mr Guinn says he would not even consider starting a venture such as M&amp;M Services now. 'We've been fortunate, despite the receivership. At K&amp;N there are the inevitable changes and these have been fairly painless. The acquisition has gone as well as one could have hoped for. In the circumstances this was the best deal for M&amp;M Services creditors, customers and employees.'</p>

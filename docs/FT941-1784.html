			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Moscow's monetarist swerve wins over IMF The agreement between Russia and the International Monetary Fund signed late on Tuesday will - if fulfilled - commit ministers to exceptionally tough measures, including cutting spending programmes if revenue fails to match targets. However, a major reason Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF director general, backed the deal was his team's recognition that the Russian government is already running a tight monetary policy - with real interest rates now around 10 per cent a month, among the highest in the world. The high rates, and the limiting of credit, has been in part the result of a new policy by the central bank. Under Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the chairman, the bank has veered from a provider of cheap credit to a pillar of monetarist orthodoxy - as the influence of new young officials has become felt. The commitments made by the government to obtain the second Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.02bn) tranche of the IMF's systemic transformation facility include: Agreement to bring down inflation to 7 per cent a month by December 1994. Raising new taxes and improving revenue collection. A provision, in lieu of a contingency reserve which is deemed too open to plundering by parliament, that all extra spending or loss of revenue will be compensated by cuts in agreed spending programmes. Professor Anders Aslund of the Stockholm Institute for the Study of East European Economies, a former Russian ministerial adviser, said last night that 'though Gaidar and Fyodorov (former reformist ministers) may be blamed for the collapse, Chernomyrdin is following their policy and it means that industrial restructuring is now happening'. Mr Camdessus said privately he was impressed by the turnaround in the central bank, whose officials he thought at least as pro-reform as those in the more conventionally radical ministry of finance.

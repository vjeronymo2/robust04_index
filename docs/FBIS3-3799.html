In order to steadily resolve the problem  of food and clothing and bring about a comparatively well-off  livelihood, we should exert our utmost efforts to develop a  high-yield, high-efficiency, and high-quality agriculture,  successfully conduct land exploitation and utilization, more  rapidly transfer surplus rural labor to nonagricultural sectors,  secure a steady grain output growth, steadily increase peasants'  income, simultaneously seek to bring about a comparatively  well-off livelihood and provide assistance to poverty-stricken  areas, and promote township and town enterprises development.

The leaders at all  levels, he added, should go deep into villages, households, as  well as the forefront of agricultural production to listen to  the views of the masses, implement policies, and resolve  problems for peasants in a down-to-earth manner.

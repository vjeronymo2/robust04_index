			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Lower Saxony N-waste accord The German state of Lower Saxony, bowing to pressure from the federal government, has approved the first shipment of nuclear waste to a medium-term storage facility in the northern city of Gorleben. The federal environment minister, Mr Klaus Topfer, forced the state's hand with an administrative order. The Lower Saxony environment minister, Mrs Monika Griefahn, said her approval was conditional on removal of the waste within seven years and insisted that the facility should pose no health risks for people who live in the area. She also said waste storage facilities should be built up at nuclear reactors themselves, and that Gorleben would accept no nuclear waste that had been reprocessed outside Germany. The first shipment of waste, from a reactor in southern Germany, could take place on November 24. The transport is likely to involve one of the largest police actions in post-war German history. An estimated 4,500 police will be deployed in Lower Saxony alone to protect the shipment, and thousands more police will be on the 500km route.</p>

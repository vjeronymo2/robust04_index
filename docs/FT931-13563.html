			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Baird comes under fire from senators THE ONE cloud on President Bill Clinton's sunny inaugural week grew a little larger yesterday as his nominee for attorney general, Ms Zoe Baird, faced tough questioning from senators concerned she had broken the law in employing illegal aliens for her household. Ms Baird repeated that she would not withdraw her nomination and said that awareness of her own transgression would make her even more determined to ensure that justice be dispensed equally. Ms Dee Dee Myers, the new White House press secretary, said Mr Clinton stood by her and expected her to be confirmed. Senator Orrin Hatch, of Utah, the ranking Republican on the judiciary committee, yesterday reiterated his support. So far only one member of the committee, Senator Larry Pressler, the Republican from South Dakota, has declared he will vote against confirmation. Another Republican, Senator Nancy Kassebaum from Kansas, not on the committee, also said she would vote against. Mr Hatch said his constituent mail was running heavily against Ms Baird and yesterday she acquired another influential opponent in the person of Ms Barbara Jordan, the black Texas University law professor known for her high principles.</p>

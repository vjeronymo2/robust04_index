			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Oil majors defy five-year low in crude  -But the possibility exists that the perception will soon change Investors may be forgiven for wondering why shares in some of the world's biggest oil companies have managed to ride the current wave of euphoria sweeping international stock markets, at the same time as crude oil prices plummet to new five-year lows. 'There is a feeling that the sector, so far, has defied the effects of declining oil prices,' according to Mr Fergus McLeod, oil industry analyst at brokers NatWest Securities in Edinburgh. But that perception may soon change, especially if oil prices, which have fallen by almost 30 per cent this year as measured by the benchmark Brent Blend, become even more volatile. In that situation, says Mr McLeod, 'share prices begin to track changes in the daily oil prices.' The absolute performance of international oil shares has varied widely this year. In the US, for example, only a few of the big integrated oil companies, most notably Chevron and Mobil, managed to outperform the S &amp; P Composite Index. But recent figures from Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, show that the majors still managed to record respectable gains. Exxon shares were up 3.3 per cent from the begining of the year to December 21, compared with a 6.8 per cent rise in the S &amp; P Composite. Texaco fared somewhat better, turning in a 6.3 per cent rise. The ADRs of a number of foreign oil companies easily outperformed the S &amp; P. British Petroleum, a quarter of whose shares are held by American investors, saw the value of its ADRs rise by 38 per cent, compared with a 43.3 per cent increase in its home market in London. The ADRs of Royal Dutch Shell, a traditional haven for investors at a time of uncertainty in the oil markets, were up by 27.8 per cent. The Anglo-Dutch group looked less exciting in its domestic markets. In the Netherlands Royal Dutch shares rose by 34.3 per cent, compared with a 38.9 per cent rise in the ANP-CBS Index. In the UK, shares in Shell Transport and Trading outperformed the FT All Share Index, by recording a 26 per cent increase, compared with the 20.6 per cent rise of the index to December 21. Elsewhere in Europe oil company shares have generally fared well. In France, Total shares were up 34.6 per cent, compared with a 25.4 per cent rise in Paris equities in general. Shares in Elf Aquitaine were some way behind the average, managing only a 14 per cent increase. In Spain, shares in Repsol, another favourite of international investors, were up 58.4 per cent, against a 47.8 per cent rise in the Madrid index. Themes which have helped to push the share prices of the integrated majors higher at a time of declining oil prices include: successful corporate cost cutting, a particular strong point for BP; higher refining and marketing margins as crude prices decline; and buoyant natural gas prices, especially in the US. But the impact of these factors is likely to wane in coming months if oil prices remain weak. Estimates by Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, suggest that 12 of the biggest US-based integrated companies could earn only Dollars 1.87bn from exploration and production activities in the current quarter, compared with Dollars 3.2bn in the same period last year. Mr McLeod believes that the cost-cutting theme will take on even more importance if weak crude prices cut deeply into cash flow next year. 'It will be difficult for them to match this year's performance, but it will be one of the few things they can do to enhance profitability,' he says. Companies will also be delaying or cancelling capital spending, although most are already committed to 1994 programmes. Mr Paul Spedding, an analyst at brokers Kleinwort Benson in London, agrees that investors will focus on companies which 'can get growth' from sources other than the oil price itself, whether these be cost-cutting, or an emphasis on higher value products such as lubricants. But, most of all, investors and company executives alike will be focusing on the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries for a sign that oil prices have bottomed out and are heading back up.</p>

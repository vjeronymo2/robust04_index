			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Letter: Time and cost overrun on naval contract inevitable The unsophisticated government policy of 'beggar-my-neighbour' which masquerades as a naval shipbuilding procurement policy, is mincing-up the last remnants of a UK strategic industry. The price discrepancy between the Swan Hunter bid and the VSEL/Kvaerner Govan bid ('2,200 jobs threatened at Swan Hunter', May 12) cannot be explained rationally by the competitive process. If we accept that Swan Hunter is one of the most experienced surface warship builders, and that its management team was not bent on committing suicide, then its bid must have been close to the proper price level for the vessel. We should also accept that Swan Hunter would be close to the bottom of the cost and the experience curve for that type of vessel. On the other hand, the competitive positioning of the successful bidders must be at the opposite end of that cost and experience curve, they having had no experience of building surface warships since the Falklands war. Any arguments about relevant skills and expertise in other naval or complex ship products affording advantages in relation to other types of vessels do not, pun not intended, hold water. VSEL and Kvaener need only look across the Irish Sea, to Belfast, to see the last demonstration of such inept thinking. The Public Accounts Committee had a great deal to say about the performance of Harland &amp; Wolff in building a naval vessel which was beyond its product range experience. If the government believes in this competitive process then it will expect to receive the vessel, in accordance with the quality specified, on time and to the price quoted. I forecast that it will be disappointed on the latter aspects and that the vessel will be a year late and will cost some Pounds 100m more than the bid. The reason is simple, this vessel is unlikely to be built in the time-scale and to the cost quoted by yards which lack the experience and know-how to meet the level of performance necessary to match their tender. I recommend that the PAC make an early start on a report, before ministers and civil servants lose the files, or move the contract goalposts. The loudest voices clamouring for an inquiry into this affair should be the successful bidders' shareholders, for it is they who must meet the cost overrun that will result.

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: PWA sees return to profits in 1995 PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines International, suffered another heavy loss for 1993. However, the airline is predicting a small loss in 1994 and a return to profitability the following year. PWA's consolidated net loss for 1993 was CDollars 292m (USDollars 221m) or CDollars 6.13 a share, after charges of CDollars 112m. Operating revenues were CDollars 2.97bn. This compared with a loss of CDollars 543m or CDollars 11.37 a share, including CDollars 333m restructuring charges, in 1992. Revenues were CDollars 2.88bn. In 1993, strong international and charter revenues were partly offset by a depressed domestic market. PWA forecasts a small loss for 1994 and a profit of about CDollars 75m in 1995. Mr Rhys Eyton, PWA chief executive, said: 'Once our financial restructuring is completed in early 1994 our results will reflect even further improvement, as expenses will benefit from reduced aircraft rental and interest costs.' The financial restructuring hinges on the CDollars 246m equity infusion from American Airlines.</p>

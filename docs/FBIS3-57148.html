The sharp jump  in inflation in the first quarter of the year is quite obvious  to all. This is being said by such different people as  monetarist Boris Fedorov and his antagonist, Leonid Abalkin. An  explosion is in the cards, and no government composition will be  able to prevent it. In this context it is very indicative that  the "driving force" behind the reforms, Yegor Gaydar, and their  chief ideologue Boris Fedorov have decided to "wash their  hands," without any longer tying themselves by participation in  the cabinet. This produces the impression of a move calculated  well in advance. It is also characteristic that in making  preliminary terms for his presence in the government, Boris  Fedorov acted not covertly, as was the done thing on Staraya  Ploshchad, but publicly, informing journalists in detail about  the nature of his interrelations with the premier. Now that the  radical democrats have disavowed any responsibility for the  state of things in the Russian economy, it is quite obvious that  the new government will be declared the main culprit for the  general disintegration. A corresponding directive has already  been issued by Mikhail Poltoranin. Commenting on cadre  reshuffles in the government, Poltoranin described them as the  advent of "a criminal- political mafia grouping," forecasting  with confidence that the present cabinet will leave before May  at the latest, under the threat of a Russia-wide political  strike. The former head of the Federal Information Center does  not use his words lightly, and apparently in the very near  future one should expect the beginning of a massive propaganda  attack. One can confidently predict that the ex-ministers will  be fairly actively using the parliament rostrum to charge the  government with ignoring the people's hardships. Naturally the  president himself will not be subject to critical attacks.    Therefore the new composition of the Chernomyrdin cabinet is  in fact a list of "politically doomed people" whose reputation  in the next few months will most likely suffer serious damage.  It is not accidental that well-known politicians did not hurry  to take charge of the bottomless ship. The clever Yavlinskiy  seems to have seen through Gaydar's design to lure aboard the  sinking ship one of his main political rivals in working out  reform strategy, and therefore stipulated his participation in  the government by a number of evidently unacceptable conditions.    Only "Shakhray party" leaders, who have failed to get enough  candidates in the Duma, but on the other hand, succeeded in both  falling out with the democrats and losing the president's favor,  have agreed to offer their shoulders to Chernomyrdin.    Formally Chernomyrdin can celebrate victory. There are no  more opponents in the government. The trouble, however, is that  the new cabinet has actually "hung in the air:" Behind the  White House walls, it is effectively deprived of organized  political support. There is no political center at present,  while the opposition will never forgive Chernomyrdin his  unqualified support for the president during the  September-October coup. Moreover there are no reasons that  could force politicians from the Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia or the Russian Federation Communist Party to take on  responsibility for the government's actions.    The sole guarantee for the existence of the Chernomyrdin  cabinet is Boris Yeltsin, who would apparently want neither to  seek support exclusively among the democrats nor to increase the  political weight of the State Duma, granting it the power to  approve the premier. Even so these guarantees for the existence  of the reformed government will hardly be sufficiently strong or  long lasting.</p>

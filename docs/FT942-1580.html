			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: S&amp;P changes outlook for Exxon to negative Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, put another question mark over the top credit rating of Exxon after last week's jury verdict that the US oil company had acted recklessly in the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska in 1989. The agency affirmed Exxon's triple-A rating, but changed the outlook to negative. This echoed an earlier move by Moody's, the other leading US rating agency. The jury verdict leaves Exxon open to an assessment for punitive damages of up to Dollars 15bn, in addition to actual damages claimed of Dollars 1.5bn. The company has argued it should not pay any punitive damages. Exxon, with Royal Dutch/Shell, has long been seen as one of the strongest credits in the energy industry.</p>

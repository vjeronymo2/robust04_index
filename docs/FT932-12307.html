			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / World Trade News: Zimbabwe opens the door to investment - Business welcome for new strategy is tinged with disappointment BUSINESS leaders in Zimbabwe have given a cautious welcome to the package of investment and export incentives announced by the government this week but warn that the country has a long way to go before it will be competitive in attracting global investment. The government's new strategy was set out on Tuesday by Mr Bernard Chidzero, finance minister. He liberalised dividend remittance regulations, increased the level of export retentions from 35 to 50 per cent, widened the scope for using blocked and surplus funds and - for the first time since exchange controls were imposed more than 30 years ago - opened the door to foreign portfolio investment through the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. There is some disappointment that the relaxation of the ceiling on dividend remittances applies only to new investments after May 1 1993 or to companies whose exports comprise more than a quarter of their total sales. Mr Chidzero announced that any new foreign investment from next week would be entitled to unrestricted remittance of dividends provided the funds are bought in the Export Retention Market (ERS), where the premium is currently 28 per cent above the official rate of ZDollars 6.40 to the US dollar. The related proposal to allow existing investors - either the pre-1979 companies (at present allowed to remit only 25 per cent of dividends) or post-1979 foreign-owned concerns (currently limited to 50 per cent) - to increase their dividend remittances in line with new investment is an important concession, too. But many businessmen had hoped the government would scrap these ceilings altogether and allow existing companies to remit as much as they wished, provided the funds were purchased in the ERS or 'free' market. The aim is to encourage existing foreign investors to reinvest in the knowledge that they will be able to remit all profits derived from new investment. But it will be difficult to separate out profits generated from past and 'new' investment, and as one businessman said yesterday: 'The main beneficiaries are going to be accountants, tax lawyers and consultants.' The scope for using blocked and so-called 'surplus' funds, which foreign companies have been unable to remit because of exchange control has been widened, to allow Zimbabwe investors to purchase blocked funds and invest them in new projects provided these export at least 75 per cent of turnover. Also any new investment in Zimbabwe since 1979 may now be repatriated - by way of disinvestment - provided the funds are bought in the ERS. Foreign investors will now be allowed to buy equities on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange provided the funds are brought into the country through normal bank channels. However, no single foreign investor will be allowed to purchase more than 5 per cent of a quoted company and foreign ownership through portfolio investment of this kind will be restricted to 25 per cent of the total issued capital.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Delors offers to stay on as EC chief MR Jacques Delors yesterday denied he was thinking of returning to French politics, and hinted he might consider an extension of his term as president of the European Commission. With France's socialist government less popular, there has been speculation President Mitterrand would call on Mr Delors to replace Mrs Edith Cresson as prime minister, perhaps after next month's regional elections. But after talks with Mr Mitterrand and Mrs Cresson, Mr Delors insisted he would serve out his full Brussels term, until the end of this year. He said he would not seek an extension of his appointment; but 'if they ask me, I shall see, according to the usefulness of what I can do'.</p>

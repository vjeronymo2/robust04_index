In order to commemorate the publication of this  important document, I interviewed Tang Shubei, executive vice  chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Strait [ARATS].  <H5>  Strategic Decision Made at Turning Point of History </H5>   Tang Shubei first pointed out that the "Message to Taiwan  Compatriots" was produced at an important turning point in  Chinese history. The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee, which was convened at the end of 1978,  established the strategic goal centering on economic  construction, and the mainland has since entered a new period of  large-scale modernization construction. At the same time as  China further developed ties with various countries in the  world, China established diplomatic relations in the late 1970's  with the United States and realized the normalization of  relations; thus, China's international status was elevated  unprecedentedly. At the same time, Chinese people on both sides  of the Strait, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, and compatriots  and overseas Chinese all hoped to see the two sides of the  Strait cooperate hand in hand to invigorate the Chinese nation  together. It was precisely against such a background that the  CPC adjusted its Taiwan policy and, through the publication of  the "Message to Taiwan Compatriots," solemnly announced to the  world that the past policy of "liberating Taiwan" had been  changed to solving the Taiwan question through peaceful measures  in order to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland.    Tang Shubei said that history in the past 15 years has  proved  that the principle of the peaceful reunification of the  motherland adopted by the Chinese Government is a strategic  decision, not an expedient measure. This principle has been  continuously perfected and developed in the past 15 years.    On 30 September 1981, NPC Chairman Ye Jianying made a speech  (generally called Ye's nine-point speech) to further explain the  principle and policy of solving the Taiwan question; he said  that "after the reunification of the country, Taiwan will become  a special administrative region, and will enjoy a high degree  autonomy." He also suggested that the CPC and the Kuomintang  hold talks on an equal footing.    On 22 February 1984, Deng Xiaoping proposed the concept of  "one country, two systems," advocating that on the major premise  of realizing the reunification of the country, the mainstay of  the country would practice a socialist system and Taiwan a  capitalist system.    On 12 October 1992, CPC Central Committee General Secretary  Jiang Zemin pointed out: "We will unswervingly and actively  promote the reunification of the motherland based on the  principle of `peaceful reunification and one country, two  systems.'"  <H3>  The "Three Links" and "Four Exchanges" Are in Accordance  With the Minds of the People on Both Sides of the Strait </H3>   Tang Shubei thinks that the basic significance of the  "Message to Taiwan Compatriots" is "pinning hope" on two areas,  that is, "pinning hope on the Taiwan authorities and pinning  hope on the Taiwan people." The "three links" raised by the  message, that is, direct mail links, shipping and air links, and  commercial links, as well as the "four exchanges," that is,  exchanges of personnel for the main purpose of visiting  relatives and places of interest, cultural exchanges, arts  exchanges, and sports exchanges fully reflect the urgent wishes  of the people on both sides of the Strait who have been  separated for several decades and conforms to the minds of  people on both sides of the Strait.    Tang Shubei said that after the issuance of the Message, the  mainland side actively adopted positive measures, such as  stopping shelling, abolishing the Fuzhou Military Region, and  removing a large number of troops from the Fujian coast,  markedly easing the atmosphere of military confrontation across  the Strait. However, the Taiwan authorities did not respond to  suggestions such as the "three links" and "four exchanges"  raised by the message; on the contrary, they raised the "three  no's" policy, that is, "no contacts, no negotiations, and no  compromise," as a means of resistance.    However, the wishes of the people are irresistible, and the  historical trend cannot be blocked. The Taiwan authorities  began to adopt some measures to adjust the way it handled  relations between the two sides of the Strait in August 1987,  and they announced the lifting of the ban on Taiwan compatriots  returning to the mainland to visit relatives, thus, they  eventually responded to some of the calls in the "Message to  Taiwan Compatriots" issued by the mainland.    Tang Shubei said that the adjustment of mainland policy by  the Taiwan authorities had some positive meaning, for it is  conducive to easing relations between the two sides of the  Strait. It was precisely after the Taiwan authorities partly  lifted the ban on Taiwan compatriots visiting relatives on the  mainland that interactions between people on both sides of the  Strait and exchanges in the civilian domain consistently  developed and ceaselessly grew. At present, the call for  expanding exchanges across the Strait in the "Message to Taiwan  Compatriots" has already become a reality in the benevolent  interactions between the two sides of the strait, as well as  real actions by people on both sides of the strait.    Tang Shubei summed up the process of the development of  interactions between people on both sides of the Strait, as well  as exchanges in the civil domain, as follows: This developed  from Taiwan compatriots coming to the mainland to visit  relatives and for tourism, from tourism and visiting relatives  to indirect trade and investment, from completely spontaneous,  scattered, and civilian actions, to the establishment of  empowered civilian groups on both sides of the strait -- the  Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] and the Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait -- to discuss problems  arising from cross-strait exchanges in the civilian domain, and  these two groups have found some methods to solve these problems.    Tang Shubei stressed that these were historic changes which  took place in the direction pointed out by the "Message to  Taiwan Compatriots," whereas the strengths behind these changes  were the people on both sides of the strait who promoted and  brought about changes with the publication and under the  guidance of the "Message to Taiwan Compatriots." Reflecting on  these historic changes, we have gained important enlightenment,  that is, people on both sides of the Strait should continue to  play a promoting role and should urge the relevant quarters on  the two sides of the Strait to continuously adjust their  policies to further provide conditions for the development of  civilian exchanges across the strait so as to conform to the  situation of the prosperous development of civilian exchanges  between both sides of the Strait.  <H5>  The Greatest Revelation From the Wang-Koo Talks </H5>   The Wang-Koo talks were an important and notable event in  the  course of the development of relations between the sides of the  Taiwan Strait over the past four decades or more. As ARATS'  executive vice chairman, Tong Shubei has participated in the  entire course of the talks, from paving the way for the talks,  to holding preparatory negotiations, to holding official talks.  He maintains that the fact that the Wang-Koo talks were  proposed and held and that agreements were reached is a vivid  reflection of an inexorable trend in the vigorous development of  exchanges between people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait  since the message to Taiwan compatriots was published,  especially since 1987.    Tong Shubei said: Of the four agreements reached at the  Wang-Koo talks, two are being implemented well, namely that on  the use and enquiry of notary certificates and the other on  enquiries into and compensation for registered mail. The other  two agreements, namely the agreement on common agreements and  regular contacts between the two organizations and the agreement  on the institution of talks, although being implemented, the two  sides have differences of understanding and implementation and  need further negotiations.    Tong Shubei stressed: The greatest significance of the  Wang-Koo talks and its greatest revelation to mankind is that  under the one- China principle, the two sides of the Taiwan  Strait have sat down to talk (despite the fact that they  understand the meaning of "one China" differently). By doing  so, it is possible to find ways to resolve differences.    Tong Shubei recalled the warm welcome accorded to them by  overseas Chinese in the United States and Canada when Wang  Daohan and he visited there not long after the Wang-Koo talks.  He said that overseas Chinese and people of Chinese descent  earnestly hope that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait sit down  and talk and find ways of to resolve differences. Regarding  this, Tong Shubei said that it was now possible to find ways to  resolve differences over ordinary matters when the two sides sat  down and talked, it is possible, I believe, for the two sides to  ultimately find ways of resolving political problems as long as  they do so in good faith. For various reasons, it takes time, of  course, to resolve political differences between the two sides,  and we should both be patient.  <H5>  Deepest Feelings About the ARATS' Work </H5>   It is two years now since ARATS was set up in mid-December  1991, and Tong Shubei has been its executive vice chairman ever  since. His name is well known by people on the island and by all  overseas people who are concerned about the development of  cross-strait relations. Asked what his deepest feelings or  experiences about his work in ARATS was, Tong Shubei answered  after thinking a little: I assumed diplomatic posts for a long  time and had contacts with some Taiwan compatriots and some  understanding of Taiwan. Since assuming the post of executive  vice chairman of ARATS, some previous work experience has been  useful and some has not. In the past two years, I have  continuously deepened my understanding of the various aspects of  Taiwan and have, given the present pattern of cross-strait  relations, always explored how to do well in empowering  nongovernmental bodies, strengthening cooperation with the SEF,  jointly promoting contacts between the people of the two sides  and various nongovernmental exchanges, and safeguarding the  legitimate rights and interests of the two sides.    Tong Shubei said: The deepest work experience over the past  two years has been that cooperation between the ARATS and the  SEF is premised on the current political differences and  unconformity between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, which  is a fact, and that the foundation for cooperation is the  existence of the people's aspirations, which demand the  strengthening of contacts and exchanges. At present, there are  differences and unconformity between the two sides over such  issues as the nature of politics, laws, common rights, and  jurisdiction. Despite these kind of differences, ARATS and the  SEF are to cooperate and make efforts to resolve problems  arising from contacts and exchanges between their people.    Moreover, Tong Shubei pointed out that when they avoided  such  issues as politics, laws, common rights, and jurisdiction, which  will be difficult to reach agreement on for some time, in the  course of negotiations over ordinary matters, ARATS and the SEF  had succeeded in their cooperation. He illustrated this by  saying that the two sides had reached agreement on the use of  notary certificates and on enquiries into and compensation for  registered mail when they avoided the above questions.  <H5>  Prospects for Cooperation With the SEF </H5>   Asked about the prospects for cooperation between the ARATS  and the SEF in 1994, Tong Shubei said that the two organizations  would probably continue to have difficulties in cooperation next  year. If the two sides could avoid political differences, then  next year could be very promising. We have note speeches made  recently by some responsible persons in the SEF and the  "Mainland Work Committee" and that some of their views conform  with ours. If the two sides avoid political differences, then  the agreements reached at the Wang-Koo talks can be implemented  very well and the two organizations will probably make great  strides in their cooperation. If so, it will surely be very good  for contacts between the people of the two sides and for various  nongovernmental exchanges. In short, hope and difficulties  coexist. I personally hope that the scope of cooperation  between ARATS and the SEF will be further expanded. If invited  to Taiwan, I will frankly and sincerely express my views to my  Taiwan friends. I am, of course, also willing to listen to  their views so that we can find more common points.</p>

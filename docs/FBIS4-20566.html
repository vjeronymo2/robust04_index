			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by T. Kuriyama, Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd.] </F>   [Text] Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) affects many  areas of automobile design. The development of the supercomputer  has spurred interest in CFD research. There are very few case  studies in which CFD has been used as a design tool. The areas  that present the biggest difficulties in using CFD include  geometrical complexity, unsteady and turbulent flows, and  boundary conditions. In this paper, we present some practical  ways in which CFD has been used, and outline what the  requirements are for using CFD. We also discuss the management  of CFD R&amp;D.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   Starting in 1986, right about the same time that  supercomputers first appeared, scientists working in the field  of CAE analysis began doing research into collision analysis and  fluid analysis. Collision analysis is being used more and more  in design and laboratory testing, and has contributed enormously  to shorter lead times for new automobiles, lower prototype  costs, and improved performance. On the other hand, however,  there appears to be some doubts about fluid analysis as  exemplified by aerodynamic analysis. We believe that this is due  to the fact that very little has been produced in the way of  concrete results where fluid analysis has been used in design,  despite the fact that a great deal of time and effort has gone  into R&amp;D.    In this paper, we try not to describe the complex techniques  used in analyzing fluids, but rather discuss the question of  what we could expect if computational fluid dynamics was used in  research and development and design with a personal view toward  uses in this company.  <H5>  2. Reasons Why is CFD Ineffective in Design </H5>   As we can see from Table 1, there are a lot of areas where  CFD has a direct effect on the performance of a car. In the last  few years in particular, companies are turning to CFD as a  design tool for achieving lower fuel consumption, lower exhaust  emissions, and better driving comfort, and it would not be  overstating matters to say that CFD is being used more and more.  There are some CFD researchers who believe that the technology  would have already been developed if high-performance computers  were available, but as things stand now, CFD is inadequate in  terms of reliability, analysis precision, cost-performance, and  ease of use.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

(2) It cannot produce a mesh around complex shapes very  easily (Cartesian mesh, BFC, unstructured mesh, etc.).    (3) It takes a long time to do calculations and requires a  large memory (no inexpensive, large-scale CPUs or memories  available at present time).    What is at the bottom of this is that more than  10[.sup]13[/] grid points are needed in order to calculate  three-dimensional mixed flows (based on the Kolmogorov vortex  scale of Re10[.sup]6[/] Reynolds number), and no matter how  advanced super high-speed parallel computers become, there is  still a limit in numerical analysis to being able to directly  solve Navier-Stokes equations that describe viscous flows.  <H5>  3. Various CFD Approaches </H5> <H5>  3.1 Mixed Flow Model </H5>   At the present time, one of the practical problems being  faced in theoretical research into CFD is constructing a mixed  flow model. This is a problem of trying to present a  comprehensive picture of flow by averaging the amount of small  swirls and fluctuations in a mixed flow. The Japanese automobile  industry is divided into those companies whose researchers use  the k-_e_ mixed flow model, and those companies whose  researchers do not use the mixed flow model but rather solve  direct Navier-Stokes equations by rough computational grids.    In Table 2, we show the unique characteristics of both  approaches. The important point to remember here is that both  approaches have their weaknesses. When considering CFD use in  design, the following conditions must be met:    (1) Simple generalized computation method    (2) Inexpensive high-speed output    (3) Reliable calculations and evaluation methods       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2. CFD Approaches                                                    |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Computation Accur-|Number of Computa-|Computation Time  |  |                  |acy               |tion Grids        |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |k-_e_ mixed flo-|Not very good     |Normal - 20,000-30|Short - from 2 to |  |w model           |                  |,000 points       |20 hours          |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |3-dimensional adv-|Depends on grid   |Very many - more  |Long - more than 1|  |anced calculus me-|                  |than 1 million po-|00 hours          |  |thod              |                  |ints              |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      Moreover, the technical level at which most designers wish  to  see CFD is not for absolute evaluations having the same level of  accuracy as experiments but rather in relative evaluations in  which designers can judge the relative merits of a number of  different design plans.    Even if the supercomputer makes notable progress in the  future in terms of the above conditions, it will still be  necessary to introduce appropriate models to analyze mixed  flows. We could say that the CFD approach using the k-_e_ mixed  flow model is the early method of choice among design  specialists at this time. There are some designers, however, who  have the knowhow to know the weaknesses of the k-_e_ mixed flow  model, and are able to make careful analysis and analyze  relative changes.  <H5>  3.2 Pre- and Post-Processing Programs--Areas of Complexity </H5>   In CFD, it is necessary to form discrete spaces around an  object having a complex shape, that is, to divide it into a  grid. Some different types of grids include Cartesian meshes,  body-fitted coordinate meshes, and non-structural meshes, but  there are no discrete methods at the present time which  integrate these. For that reason, it is necessary to separate  grid types according to their strengths and weaknesses as shown  in Table 3. Conversely, however, since there are no good  grid-generating preprocessing programs that specialize in fluid  analysis, a decision has to be made with regard to the desired  accuracy and the time allowed to produce the grid.       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 3. Preprocessing Characteristics                                    |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |              |Time          |Flexibility   |Accuracy      |Software      |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cartesian mesh|****          |****          |**            |STREAM        |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |BFC           |**            |**            |****          |SCRYU FIRE    |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Non-structura-|**            |***           |***           |STAR-CD       |  |l mesh        |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------      The use of post-processing software, which visualizes flow,  is divided into those uses having mainly to do with good  responses, i.e. being able to simply compare calculated results  with actual measurements, and to use those mainly concerned with  beautiful appealing visual presentations although they might be  more time-consuming and expensive.  <H5>  3.3 Computer and CFD </H5>   The person in charge of computational flow dynamics is  always  complaining about the CPU not having enough memory. This is  because the finer he/she draws the mesh, the greater the  importance of computational accuracy. The addition of more grid  points is not an issue when it comes to structural analysis.  Thereupon, what is necessary is that the person in charge of CFD  be aware of the purpose for which it is being used. It is  important that CFD be steadily made more practical while  techniques are developed that enable it to be used with fewer  large-scale calculations and better cost-performance. It will  not be too many years from now when we see a technical  revolution in supercomputers in which massive parallel computers  and supercomputers will be downsized to desktop models. In any  event, we must not forget that developing computational flow  dynamics based on advances in computers will realistically yield  more useful analyses and alleviate some of the work entrusted to  designers.  <H5>  4. Present Status of CFD in Daihatsu </H5>   In Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 [figures not reproduced], we show  some examples of the work Daihatsu is doing with CFD in R&amp;D  and  design.[.sup](1-3)[/] Also, in Figure 5, we show the computer  system being used with CFD. We select a hardware and software  suited to the type of analysis and put it into full service. We  check the following basic points when developing a model:    (1) Ascertain the needs of the designer and determine the  time required.    (2) Lay down the results to come out of analysis in stages.    (3) Select a method that does not require a lot of CPUs.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-26A>      Figure 5. CFD Supercomputing Network </FIG>    Organizationally speaking, the persons in charge of CFD are  assigned to a single group and are responsible for both hardware  and software. This naturally promotes a good interchange with  respect to problem areas and knowhow, and enables models to be  developed with greater efficiency. Moreover, the design,  testing, and CFD groups have formed a single entity and are  promoting various R&amp;D activities including projects involving  the development of new automobiles.  <H5>  5. R&amp;D </H5>   Computer makers have been coming out with one new product  after another, but software companies too have been coming out  with one new CFD software package after another. One of the big  choices that has to be made with regards to software is whether  to purchase it on the market, or develop it in-house. There has  been a tendency until now to equate the development of software  with a company's technical strength, but in recent years, the  questions have come down buying commercial software or  developing it in-house software, and how far does it go in  clarifying phenomena and how much does it contribute to product  development. The research institutes of companies are no longer  places that develop software, but instead are becoming places  that develop and apply analysis techniques and knowhow. If we  talk about effective research or improving technology, it  generally means adapting software to fit the needs of the  company after it has been purchased, and developing new  technologies with in-house knowhow. To that extent, the  performance of commercial software has been much improved over  the past few years. The research conducted by universities and  corporations is naturally quite different. Universities focus on  basic research while companies focus on applied research, so it  is important that these two groups work together to exchange  information. In other words, it would probably be more effective  for companies to adopt the specialized system of research shown  in Figure 6.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-27A>      Figure 6. Role of Various Laboratories in CFD Research </FIG>  <H5>  6. Making CFD Useful in Design </H5>   In order for CFD to be used in design, we will start  providing the design specialists and test researchers with  estimates prior to the test results being received in order that  we can begin trying to gain their confidence. Since the faster  we get the results the better, it will be necessary to devise a  way to simplify and standardize the analysis method, and be able  to output data quicker. Needless to say, we think it would be  best if designers were able to do the analysis, but the flow  phenomenon itself is quite complex, so in most cases, a CFD  specialist must be called in to determine whether the  calculations are correct or not. In other words, it is important  not to believe the CFD calculations as they are given, but to  use estimates and opinions corrected by knowledgeable analysts.    As things stand now, CFD fails to produce adequate  calculations no matter what the task, so it is only natural to  want to use these calculations with earlier experiences and  adopt a single track approach. In other words, to ignore the  parts that do not have a major effect on flows, simplify shape  as much as possible, and quickly output calculations. After  that, the tested knowhow that has been built up from previous  test results is used as a shortcut in making CFD useful in  design.  <H5>  7. Conclusion </H5>   Below, we list the main points taken from our discussion  above on the practical use of computational flow analysis in  R&amp;D  and design.    (1) A computer is necessary for analyzing mixed flow models  no matter how advanced.    (2) Researchers must develop techniques that meet design  needs.    (3) If earlier knowhow is added to simplified calculations,  CFD can be made sufficiently useful in design.    Now and then we see an analysis in which the flows are  beautifully animated and which make heavy use of computers, but  more often than not, they lack a colorful presentation and are a  long way from being of practical use in design. It will probably  be necessary for CFD to plod along a dark and lonely road step  by step until it builds up its own credibility.  Bibliography    1.

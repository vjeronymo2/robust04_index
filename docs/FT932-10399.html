			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Computing: Take account of your own needs THE COMMONEST application for which small businesses buy a computer is accounting. If I have been brought in to install an accounts package I usually have a discussion with the directors before we start. What financial information do they expect from their new system? 'We hoped that perhaps we could use the computer to produce our own profit and loss accounts and balance sheets. And instead of getting them just once a year we could now get them quarterly or even monthly. This would give us up-to-date financial information to run the business, as well as cut down on the audit fee.' Illusions such as this are commonplace. Patiently, I explain to them the facts of life. 'Profit and loss accounts and balance sheets are a waste of time. They are part of the statutory audit, which exists not for your benefit but for the benefit of everyone outside the company. For the taxman, to help him work out your tax bill. For your bank manager, to assure him that his loan is safe. For your accountant, to maintain him in the style to which he is accustomed. Profit and loss accounts and balance sheets are nothing whatever to do with you. Your job is simply to pay the bill.' Few businessmen understand the balance sheet; if they did, they would realise that as an aid to running the company it is useless. The profit and loss account may seem more useful, but as far as the audit is concerned it is there simply to explain how this year's balance sheet differs from last year's. It has nothing to do with providing financial information to management. The distinction, in fact, is between financial accounting and management accounting. If you go into a big company, you will find dozens of accountants, but only two or three will be financial accountants. The majority will be management accountants. By contrast, in the world of small business the only accountants we have are financial accountants, who live and breathe balance sheets and P &amp; L accounts. Management accounting, as its name suggests, is designed to provide managers with financial information to run their business. How do you produce your own management accounts? Your first step is to work out how much you have to pay out each month even if you make no sales at all. Most of these 'overheads' do not change from month to month (wages, rent, rates, lease charges etc) so they are easy to calculate; you can do it on the back of an envelope. Suppose you work out that you have to pay Pounds 10,000 every month in these fixed costs. This means you are going to have to earn at least Pounds 10,000 in margin each month in order to break even. Margin, also called 'gross profit', equals sales value less cost of sales. How you work out your margin differs from industry to industry. In a 'trading' company, that is, one that buys products and resells them, it is best done by a Sales Invoicing package. So, if this month you have sold and invoiced 1,000 of Product X at Pounds 15 each, and you bought them for Pounds 5 each, you have earned Pounds 10,000 margin. If my clients run a trading company, I always try to start them off with an invoicing package rather than a conventional set of accounting ledgers. Look at the benefits. The computer produces all the invoices with ease; most of the details required for the invoice such as customer name and address, product description and selling price, are held permanently on the computer's files. All you have to do is to enter the customer code, the product code and the quantity being invoiced, and the computer does the rest. Once the invoice has been printed, it is automatically posted to the customer's account on the Sales Ledger so you have completely up to date information on how much your customers owe you. Because the computer holds both the selling price and the cost price of each product, it can automatically work out the cost value and therefore the profit earned on each invoice. It uses this to build up histories of sales and margin earned each month, sales and margin earned by each customer, sales and margin earned by each product, and even sales and margin earned by each supplier (invaluable data this when you are negotiating annual prices and volume discounts with your suppliers). To be of real value, management information has to be up to date. This is another advantage of using an invoicing package. It will give you a report of the sales and margin earned in month one by 10 am of the first day of month two. No need to close the factory for half a day for a physical stocktake, then hang around for another three weeks until all the purchase invoices have arrived in the post, as you must with a conventional profit and loss account. The potential benefits of an invoicing package are enormous, and the wonderful thing is that there is no need to get involved in debits and credits, accruals and prepayments, or any of the paraphernalia of accounting. But the computer industry is as ignorant of this potential as anyone else. In particular, I have found it difficult to find an invoicing package which will give a completely reliable margin figure. One package that does and which I would recommend strongly to the small business without formal accounts staff, is Cornix Invoicing. The designer has both a wealth of industry experience and a firm grasp of what an invoicing package can do. Do not be put off by the initial setup which is fiddly. As I used this package I became more and more impressed. Although it costs only Pounds 89, I would say that for all-round features and flexibility Cornix Invoicing is perhaps the best invoicing package on the market at any price. Cornix Invoicing costs Pounds 89 plus VAT from Cornix Computers, Roisia House, 1 Roise St, Bedford MK40 1JE, tel: 0234-219969. Free telephone support is available for 30 days.</p>

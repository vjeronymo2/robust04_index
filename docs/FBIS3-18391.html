			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mats Knutson: "Moderate Party Gets Good Grade on </F> Bridge Issue"]    [Text] The Moderates moved up in public opinion following  agreement within the government regarding the Oresund Bridge.  Support for the Center Party was affected marginally, while the  Social Democratic Party [SDP] lost a small amount. This is shown  by the latest SVENSKA DAGBLADET/SIFO [Swedish Institute for  Public Opinion Polls] voter barometer.    According to the January poll, New Democracy is continuing  to  lose ground. The party now has only 4 percent of the potential  vote and is therefore in danger of losing its seats in the  Riksdag.    "This poll was concerned primarily with the Oresund Bridge.  The Moderates were rewarded because Prime Minister Carl Bildt  was able to hold the government together," says Alf Sjostrom,  who is in charge of SIFO's poll.  <H5>  Up 3 Percent </H5>   After the coalition parties reached agreement on the bridge  at the cabinet meeting on 13 January, public opinion's support  for the Moderates rose 3 percentage points (from 19 to 22  percent) in less than a week.    The voter barometer as a whole represents the weighted  result  of three separate polls. The full impact of the rise in public  support for the Moderates immediately after the agreement on the  bridge therefore does not show up in the combined voter  barometer.    The SVENSKA DAGBLADET/SIFO voter barometer as a whole is  based on 2,839 interviews conducted between 10 and 27 January.  The interviewees, who were selected at random, answered the  question: "Which party would you vote for if elections were  being held today?"    The voter barometer for January looks like this (with  December figures shown in parentheses): Social Democrats: 49.8  percent (48.9); Left Party: 3.9 (3.9); Moderates: 20.6 (20.3);  Center Party: 6.9 (6.4); Liberal Party: 6.3 (7.5); Christian  Democrats: 4.9 (4.6); Green Party: 2.9 (3.2); New Democracy: 4.0  (5.0); and others: 0.7 (0.2).    The number of voters who would cast blank ballots or could  not name a party came to 14.2 percent (13.2 percent in December).    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |SIFO poll for January 1994: "Which party would you vote for if elections wer-|  |e being held today?"                                                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Party                    |Percent                  |Change Since December    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Left Party               |3.9                      |0.0                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Social Democrats         |49.8                     |+ 0.9                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Green Party              |2.9                      |- 0.3                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Center Party             |6.9                      |+ 0.5                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Liberal Party            |6.3                      |- 1.2                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Moderate Party           |20.6                     |+ 0.3                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Christian Democrats      |4.9                      |+ 0.3                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |New Democracy            |4.0                      |- 1.0                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Other                    |0.7                      |+ 0.5                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Bridge Most Important Issue </H5>   The most important political event during the poll period  was  the government's talks regarding the Oresund Bridge.    The result of the agreement that was reached on 13 January  following two weeks of tough and sometimes dramatic negotiations  is that the Center Party is remaining in the coalition and the  Oresund Bridge will probably be built.    "Taking a cynical view of the result, the Center Party's  behavior meant that the party obtained a slight delay in  construction of the bridge and remained in the coalition. But  the Center Party was unable to halt the bridge," says Sjostrom.    The three separate polls forming the basis of the January  voter barometer consisted of about 1,000 interviews each. Those  three polls reflect the shifts in public opinion throughout the  period.    The first poll was conducted between 10 and 13 January --  that is, before the government reached agreement on the bridge  issue.    During that period, the Moderates received 19 percent, the  Center Party 6.5 percent, and the Social Democrats 51 percent of  the potential vote.  <H5>  Change Makes Itself Felt </H5>   The second poll took place between 17 and 20 January. That  was when the change in public opinion made itself felt: after  the bridge decision. The Moderates now had 22 percent of the  potential vote, compared to 7 percent for the Center Party and  49 percent for the Social Democrats.    The third poll, conducted between 24 and 27 January, shows  that public opinion has stabilized somewhat. The Moderates have  21 percent, the Center Party 7 percent, and the Social Democrats  49 percent.    "Once the government made its decision, support rose for the  Moderates and fell for the Social Democrats," says Sjostrom.    Support for the Center Party was affected only marginally.    This should be interpreted as meaning that the voters do not  want a government crisis, he says.    "At least not over that issue. Instead, what they are  rewarding is stability in political work, and the increased  support for the Moderates is probably due to Prime Minister Carl  Bildt's way of handling the bridge issue within the coalition."    The combined voter barometer for January shows that the  Social Democrats are keeping their hold on the voters. New  Democracy is continuing its decline and now stands at the  4-percent threshold required for representation in the Riksdag.    "That is a trend which has been accentuated since last fall,  when New Democracy reached agreement with the government on  economic policy," says Sjostrom.    "New Democracy is losing voters primarily to the Moderates  and the Social Democrats. Those are the parties from which it  got most of its voters to start with."  <H5>  Social Democratic Budget in Next Poll </H5>   The Social Democratic Party's shadow budget was presented  this week and therefore had no effect on this voter barometer,  according to Sjostrom.    "Voter reaction to presentation of the Social Democratic  Party's alternative to the economic policy will show up in the  next voter barometer," he said.</p>

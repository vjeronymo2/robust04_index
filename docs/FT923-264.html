			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Metsec losses increase SHARES IN Metsec fell 27p to 97p on news that the company, which makes building, electronic and engineering products, suffered a difficult first half, particularly in its electronic products division. Pre-tax losses for the six months to June 30 grew from Pounds 285,000 to Pounds 868,000 as 'recovery from recession in many of the group's markets was slower than expected', said Mr Keith Hirst, chairman and managing director. The USM-quoted group is passing its interim dividend, against 2.7p last time. Turnover shrank by Pounds 10.7m to Pounds 31.1m. That of the now sold Thomas Vale Construction was deliberately reduced by some Pounds 5m, and the disposal of the Muller group knocked off another Pounds 2m. The rest was down to the recession, said Mr Hirst. Electronic products were brought low by weakness in the UK, Australian, and US markets, where the hospital sector was particularly hard hit. Reorganisation has now moved the US side towards monthly profitability. As a result of last year's rationalisation, all the building products businesses traded profitably. Profits were reduced by provisions of Pounds 550,000 for bad debts - a problem Mr Hirst said should ease - though volumes were sacrificed to maintain margins. With the exception of James Trow, where the product range has shifted towards the commercial office equipment market, all the businesses in the engineering products division operated profitably. Gearing grew from about 50 to 60 per cent and losses per share increased to 5.75p (1.51p).</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Coca still vital to Bolivian economy ALTHOUGH Bolivia, one of Latin America's poorest countries, has made great strides in stabilising its economy and liberalising foreign trade, it remains heavily dependent on illegal exports of coca paste and cocaine, the country's biggest source of foreign exchange. In its review of Bolivia's trade policies and practices, published yesterday, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade estimates that the coca/cocaine economy contributed about 13-15 per cent of GDP, or about Dollars 850m (Pounds 600m), in 1991. This has inflated the money supply and put upward pressure on the exchange rate, impairing competitiveness in other sectors. Coca by-products may have accounted for 23-43 per cent of total exports (legal and illicit) in 1990, according to the report. However, Bolivian officials said yesterday that gross coca/cocaine exports were now only about a quarter of the total and, with only a third of the revenue retained in Bolivia, the effects on the exchange rate and resource allocation had 'significantly diminished'. In practice, as the report acknowledges, the real exchange rate has steadily depreciated since 1987. Gatt notes that coca eradication programmes have had only limited success, souring relations with the US. Reduced farm subsidies by the industrialised world, particularly for oilseeds, could help encourage the substitution of new crops by stabilising world prices. But Gatt members found much to praise when they discussed the report yesterday. Bolivia's inflation rate has fallen from 24,000 per cent in 1985, when the stabilisation programme was launched, to 11 per cent last year. Import duties of up to 70 per cent have been replaced by a uniform tariff, currently 10 per cent, and quantitative restrictions have been scrapped. Exports and the economy have been diversified away from minerals such as tin and natural gas. Real incomes, which fell sharply when the stabilisation programme was introduced, have been growing since 1987, although they remain below 1980 levels.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDFLY SPRAYING  </P> <P> Many of us are concerned about the arrogant and ignorant attitude of urban and  suburban residents toward the Mediterranean fruit fly problem, which  undoubtedly was caused by someone in the greater Los Angeles area carelessly  and illegally bringing contaminated fruit into Southern California.  </P> <P> Agriculture is a $15-billion business in California. That represents a lot of  taxes and a lot of employment. It provides the fresh produce Californians are  privileged to have available year-round. Because of a few thoughtless, selfish  people bringing fruit into California, this industry and its many jobs are  threatened.  </P> <P> Now the urban residents are inconvenienced by malathion applications. Are they  in an uproar about those who transported contaminated fruit into the state  (unnecessarily, I might add, as all sorts of exotic fruits which have passed  inspection are available in stores)? No. Their concern is the malathion being  sprayed at night, when least exposure is assured.  </P> <P> Logic says that those areas being sprayed contain those who started this deadly  infestation. We must stop the Medfly before it destroys our food supply.  </P> <P> Those of us who live in the outlying agricultural land resent the urbanites'  lack of concern for our livelihood.  </P> <P> GWEN ERICKSON  </P> <P> Ojai  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] London, March 8 (CTK) -- After a series of talks  with British officials Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus said on  Tuesday [8 March] it was "refreshing" and "very pleasant to be  in England where the majority of opinions were expressed in a  way and in a tone very close to ours."    Klaus, however, did not specify what he meant by the term  "ours" -- those of the Czech government, his ruling Civic  Democratic Party (ODS), the Czech Republic in general or his own.    He said that "emphases laid in Britain are closer to our  emphases than in some other European countries." In a meeting  with Czech journalists, however, he did not elaborate.    In London, Klaus did not sign any agreements. He said he did  not expect any impulse for Czech-British trade to result from  his current visit. "It is not the business of premiers," he  said, but added that talks he held in Britain dealt with the  Czech Republic, which was "highly" esteemed there.    Asked by CTK about a possible message for discussion on the  Czech Republic's future local administrative arrangement which  might ensue from the fact that Britain is a strictly unitary  state, Klaus stressed the "necessity of the existence of a  powerful state against the rest of the world."    "The Czech lands were always strong enough when they had a  powerful king and not when the estates argued and divided the  country into many parts. The unitary character of Britain thus  belongs to the same logic of my considerations," Klaus said.    On his visit to the European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development (EBRD), he said that "the unreal character of how it  was built at the cost of investments in countries that would  need it was quite interesting for me."    Klaus delivered a speech to a luncheon organized in central  London by the Adam Smith Institute.</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIS POETRY PAYS TRIBUTE TO SOLDIERS  </P> <P> Hung Cuong, who has always kept a pen and paper handy, has written poems under  the pen name of Nhat Quoc Tam. Like the songs he sings, his poetry is laced  with patriotic tributes to soldiers, refugees and the people of his beloved  South Vietnam.  </P> <P> To him, the South Vietnamese people are the innocents; communism, the beast.  Many receive his praise, like former Gen. William Westmoreland, and hardly  anyone escapes his barbs, especially Jane Fonda. He accused the Oscar-winning  actress of spreading the "Stalin virus" during her controversial trip to Hanoi  in 1972. He wrote:  </P> <P>  How can you kiss men who the day before killed innocent people and set on fire  so many innocent villages?  </P> <P>  All of you have helped build another Berlin wall, and it is a tribute, a  monument for the Russians.  </P> <P>  You betrayed 50,000 American soldiers who have sacrificed themselves for  freedom.  </P> <P>  Most of his poems are nostalgic reminders of how South Vietnam was before the  surrender to the North Vietnamese in 1975. Some recall the old path home and  tell of walking down a sodden path near where the river turns into the village,  and of happy children riding water buffalo that feed near the bamboo-edged  river banks.  </P> <P> Others pay homage to refugees who fled Vietnam by boat or land and now find  themselves stuck in a refugee camp with their futures in limbo. For example,  "In the Refugee Camps" reads:  </P> <P>  Are the people here refugees or prisoners?  </P> <P>  Young children . . . roam aimlessly, crying out pitifully from the depths of  their souls.  </P> <P>  A child tells of his mother's and sister's death because cruel and heartless  pirates raped and tortured them.  </P> <P>  But there will always be Vietnamese people ready and willing to sacrifice  themselves once more for our country and heritage.  </P> <P>  For Cuong, old soldiers never die. The battle against Communism is not over,  which is his premise for the song, "Sound of the Battle Zone":  </P> <P>  Let me go back to my homeland  </P> <P>  So I can hear the crying voices of my people  </P> <P>  Let me go back to the war zones  </P> <P>  To visit the freedom fighters who are fighting to save my country  </P> <P>  They have been fighting for 10 years, and now is the time for all the  Vietnamese people to come together and free their Motherland from the clutches  of Communism  </P> <P>  Let me go back and wake up the people who are still asleep  </P> <P>  And have forgotten their homeland is in turmoil.  </P> <P> DAVID REYES  </P></p>

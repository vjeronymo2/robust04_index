			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / More police for Israel THE ISRAELI cabinet yesterday announced measures aimed at tightening security following attacks against civilians and soldiers in the past week, writes Judy Maltz in Jerusalem. Public anxiety over security was exacerbated by the call from Mr Yacov Terner, police chief, for citizens licensed to carry weapons to do so. The cabinet announced it would increase the number of policemen stationed around the country by 2,000, bolster the civil guard and provide incentives to Israeli employers to hire Jewish rather than Palestinian workers.</p>

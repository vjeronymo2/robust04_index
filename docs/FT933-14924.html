			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Economics: Further drop likely in inflation This is a busy week for economic indicators, particularly in the UK where data relating to May and June are due out. The figures are likely to show that inflationary pressures remain light, with further falls in average earnings and underlying inflation. Special attention will be paid to Thursday's unemployment figures which may record their fifth successive monthly decline although even after four month-on-month drops, economists are not convinced that the jobless total has peaked. Further gains in UK manufacturing output are expected for May, but they are likely to be more modest than in April, when output rose a strong 0.7 per cent month-on-month. In the US, analysts are expecting encouraging reports on inflation. Sharp falls in crude oil, heating oil and tobacco prices are expected to push the overall level of producer prices downwards.

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Portillo warns on cash cuts MR Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, last night launched an intensive campaign to prepare junior ministers and Conservative MPs for the announcement of tough cutbacks in public expenditure in chancellor Norman Lamont's Autumn Statement on Thursday. In an exercise designed to minimise the chances that Thursday's statement will provoke renewed unrest on the backbenches, Mr Portillo emphasised that the spending curbs had the full support of the cabinet. Warning that public borrowing would rise sharply as a result of the economic recession, the chief secretary reminded his colleagues that the government's economic successes during the 1980s had been built on tough spending controls. He warned that without similar restraint now it would be impossible to deliver tax cuts before the general election due by 1997. Mr Portillo, who has organised a series of meetings which will include every Conservative MP before details of the spending and economic recovery package are announced, said that it was essential the cabinet decisions received the full backing of the parliamentary party. He confirmed that a tight squeeze on public-sector pay awards - expected to limit increases to less than 2 per cent - would be at the centre of a spending deal which had protected many capital programmes. It is understood, however, that the pay review bodies covering hundreds of thousands of public sector workers will not be suspended for a year. Instead they will be expected to take into account the government's economic priorities when making their recommendations.</p>

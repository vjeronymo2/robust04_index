			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Construction Contracts: Building jails in Pennsylvania TRAFALGAR HOUSE CONSTRUCTION INC, a Pittsburgh-based company, has won two contracts worth Pounds 47m (USDollars 65m) for jails in Pennsylvania. The largest is a Pounds 40m (USDollars 55m) subcontract to build the main structure for the new Allegheny County Jail, Pittsburgh. Work has recently commenced on the building which will be 16 storeys at its highest point and will contain 1,800 cells. The company must complete the main structure and cast the cells by the end of this year so that other subcontractors can begin installing detention systems and mechanical and electrical works. Four tower cranes will be used to ensure that this demanding construction programme is met. Once the main structure has been erected, work will begin on the jail's brick and curtain wall exterior and finishes to the 975,000 sq ft interior, including the installation of security ceilings, painted block walls and epoxy coated floors. Completion is scheduled for 1995. Work has also commenced on a Pounds 7m (USDollars 10m) contract to construct a two-storey county jail in Erie. Trafalgar House Construction Inc is demolishing a building and clearing 17 acres of woodland before carrying out a cut and fill operation. The 175,000 sq ft building will contain 200 cells when it is completed at the end of this year.</p>

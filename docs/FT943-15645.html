			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Clinton steps up healthcare drive The Clinton administration and the Democratic party are launching an all-out push to swing public support behind healthcare reform before Congress starts drafting detailed legislation on the issue after this week's recess. The campaign will include speeches by President Bill Clinton, Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton and administration officials, television advertising and a Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.3m) bus tour, financed by backers of reform such as unions, consumer groups and churches. Ms Donna Shalala, health secretary, took to the road on Wednesday to underscore the administration's commitment to universal healthcare, in a message echoed by officials in a series of co-ordinated speeches across the country. And yesterday saw the unveiling of a Democratic party television advertising campaign. The coming weeks will be critical for the prospects of reform as the Senate and House leaderships struggle to craft bills approved by the congressional committees with jurisdiction over healthcare into legislation to be voted on by their respective chambers. Voting is not likely to take place until next month, after which the Senate and House versions must be reconciled in conference. All four committees that agreed versions of the plan have approved legislation that varies from the Clinton plan. But the main worry for the administration is the powerful Senate finance committee, which was alone in dropping universal healthcare insurance largely financed by employers. Instead, the committee's version seeks to cover 95 per cent of the population by the year 2002 through insurance industry reforms, tax incentives and subsidies to low earners.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Arts heritage 'NATIONAL heritage in danger' is a moving cry. But is it a convincing one? True, Hans Holbein's Portrait of a Lady with a Pet Squirrel and a Starling is on the auction block and Canova's three luscious lovelies are threatened by a fate worse than death. Like the Badminton Cabinet, Constable's The Lock, Van Dyck's First Duke of Hamilton and many others, these works may leave British shores. Yet what have these works - some by great masters, some by lesser ones; one English, the rest continental; some by artists who worked in England, others by artists who did not - in common? Why are they all part of the British 'national heritage'? The answer to that question is simply possession. The work might have been unknown to the public and be British in nothing bar ownership, but it was there. Possession may be nine-tenths of the law, but must any work of art of foremost importance stay there forever? By the same logic, foreign masterpieces should not have been exported to the UK in the first place. Works of art by British artists belong more obviously to the 'national heritage', but should works by Turner or Constable not be seen and enjoyed around the world? And do those who want works by national artists to stay in the UK accept that works of Italian, Spanish, Dutch or German masters should, for the very same reason, have stayed in their native lands? Trade in works of art has allowed the British to accumulate stores of artistic wealth greatly in excess of the value of its own output. But the wealth that made that possible has now departed. That is not a reason for forcing owners of great treasures to supply national collections on the cheap. It is a good reason for accepting that the people of other nations are also entitled to acquire the cultural artefacts that are among the principal blessings of wealth. Unless 'national heritage' means mere possession, it is an empty phrase. Works of art are the heritage of mankind. What is more, if exported, they will not be 'lost'. They will, on the contrary, be gained by others no less deserving and usually far worse endowed. If the UK values these works as much as those who are panting to acquire them, it should pay the market price. If it does not, let them go to others who will appreciate them no less and seem to want them even more.</p>

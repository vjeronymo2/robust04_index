			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP SOFTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TUSTIN TIGHTENS TITLE RACE AFTER BEATING SADDLEBACK  </P> <P> Saddleback High School stayed close to Tustin for seven innings.  </P> <P> But the Roadrunners committed two errors in the eighth and Tustin escaped with  a 2-0 victory in a Sea View League softball game Wednesday at Saddleback.  </P> <P> The victory by Tustin (13-7, 10-2) avenges an earlier loss to Saddleback. Now  Tustin can clinch a share of the league title with another victory over  Saddleback (21-3, 11-1) Friday.  </P> <P> Saddleback managed only one hit off Shannon Ellis (5-6), who struck out nine  and walked three.  </P> <P> . Tustin got eight hits, two of them in the eighth inning, off Desi Abrego.  </P> <P> With one out in the top of the eighth, Laura Teal grounded a single down the  left-field line. Left fielder Claudia Rodriguez fumbled the ball and Teal  advanced to second on the error.  </P> <P> Jayme Ondracek beat out her second bunt single, with Teal advancing to third.  </P> <P> Abrego intentionally walked Ellis, who came into the game batting .438, to load  the bases.  </P> <P> Melissa Mazanet hit a high bouncer to first baseman Blanca Silva, who misjudged  the ball, and Teal scored on the error. Allison Potenza grounded out to short,  scoring Ondracek.  </P> <P> Kim Carstens led off the Saddleback eighth with a single. Right fielder Denise  Thomas fumbled the ball for a two-base error.  </P> <P> Silva grounded to Ellis, who looked Carstens back to third before throwing out  Silva. Ellis then struck out Ana Montoya. With lead-off batter Rodriguez at the  plate, Ellis threw a wild pitch and Carstens attempted to steal home. But  catcher McGuire recovered and flipped it to Ellis, who tagged Carstens to end  the game.  </P> <P> "I think our bats were asleep today," Saddleback Coach Yvonne Alonzo said.  "Defensively we did well. Just offensively, we didn't produce."  </P> <P> In the South Coast League:  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley 2, Mission Viejo 1 -- Jennifer Simth (9-11) pitched a  one-hitter and struck out seven at Capistrano Valley (10-12, 2-5).

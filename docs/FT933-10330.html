			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters in demand Shares in Reuters Holdings, the international information and news group, forged ahead in hectic trading after good US buying the night before. Dealers said the company's foreign exchange dealing equipment business was benefiting from the turmoil within the European exchange rate mechanism and the subsequent volatility in European currencies. There has also been heavy buying from income funds following Reuters' plan to use Pounds 350m of its cash pile to buy back 25m shares. Mr Brian Newman of Henderson Crosthwaite said tax-exempt funds would have shares worth Pounds 17.20 each after the tender for the 5.84 per cent stake closed on August 25. Yesterday, the shares ended 18 stronger at 1458p on high turnover of 2.8m. Marketing group Kleen-E-Ze Holdings jumped 44 to 226p after a subsidiary said it had launched a battery charger capable of extending ordinary battery life by 10 times. USM-quoted Sherwood Computer Services plummeted 63 to 155p after it said first-half 1993 earnings would be substantially lower than the year-earlier half. Yorkshire Chemicals was one of the worst market performers yesterday, its shares slipping 17 to 338p. The group reported a rise in half-year profits to Pounds 6.02m but said recession in Europe was much worse than expected and it did not believe there would be a significant pick-up in global demand this year. Analysts said the profits warning had been flagged but the shares were overvalued. Life insurer Legal &amp; General gained 7 to 481p as SGST turned buyer of the stock. Analyst Mr Charles Landa said Legal was trading at its net asset value and that the hit from mortgage indemnity losses was slightly less worrying since recent statistics showing that the number of repossessions had fallen. In a strong leisure sector, yield and recovery buying dominated, with Ladbroke surging 7 to 197p in brisk turnover of over 8m. Rank Organisation also benefited, advancing 14 to 742p. Airtours again basked in the currency fallout, adding 4 at 380p. A big buyer in Compass Group saw the shares climb 16 to 526p. Profit-takers were out in force in the food retailers, although news of a new price promotion from Tesco did little to help. Although the stock managed a half-penny rise to 214p, others stumbled. J Sainsbury slid 8 to 479p, Kwik Save 8 to 675p and Argyll 2 to 326p. A combination of yield considerations and recent underperformance spurred BT ordinary shares forward, closing 6 ahead at 424 1/2 p in good turnover of 16m. BT partly-paid advanced 5 1/4 to 180p. Profit-taking left Cable and Wireless drifting 17 down at 799p and Vodafone 3 down at 482p. A programme trade helped Courtaulds Textiles rise 6 to 564p with 2.4m changing hands. The announcement of the group's Pounds 7m acquisition in the Spanish lace business was not necessarily the driving force, although the group gained 40 per cent of the market share through the move, market analysts said. The upward trend, however, may continue on buying interest in a thin market and market expectations of some big acquisition projects in the latter half of the year. William Baird continued to ride on Monday's market reaction to its disposal of part of its non-core engineering business and its shares leapt another 8 to 263p. News International, the international media group, gained 6 to 226p following its successful purchase last week of a Pounds 350m stake in Star TV, the Hong Kong-based satellite television system which reaches 38 Asian countries. United News, which has a yield of over 5 per cent, jumped another 10 to 544p on continued hopes of interest rate cuts in Europe. In the printing sector, St Ives added 6 to 305p.</p>

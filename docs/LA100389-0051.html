			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EDD PLAYS MATCHMAKER BETWEEN EMPLOYERS, JOBLESS  </P> <P> Employers know that finding and hiring even one employee can be a trying  experience. So, when Sue Taylor, human resources director at the new Sheraton  Grande Torrey Pines in La Jolla, needed 320 new employees she decided to get  some help.  </P> <P> Taylor called the state's Employment Development Department, which provided  Sheraton with interviewers to help screen applicants. The department also  allowed Sheraton to use its downtown office for interviews.  </P> <P> "We are a labor exchange market for both the employer and the client  (prospective applicant) who comes into our office," said Mamie Greene, the  department's special projects supervisor. All of the services provided by the  department are financed by taxpayers' dollars.  </P> <P> "Employers place job offers with us, and we conduct searches for people who  come in here looking for jobs," Greene said. "We'll help out on mass hirings,"  such as Sheraton's, "or, if an employer calls and just wants one receptionist,  we'll do that, too. We'll search through our files and refer qualified  applicants to that employer."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sheraton Gets Help  </P> <P> With more than 250 job applicants flooding two interview sites Monday, Sheraton  officials were glad to get the help.  </P> <P> "They've eliminated much of the early groundwork for us," said Taylor, who must  fill a variety of positions, from butlers to banquet servers, for the  $60-million luxury-class hotel. Sheraton officials expect the EDD to screen  more than 1,000 applicants in the next two weeks. The company will then hire  about 320 employees to staff the 400-room hotel that opens Nov. 9.  </P> <P> "They're doing the pre-screening to see if they (candidates) have the  experience and qualifications necessary to work for us," Taylor said.  </P> <P> Besides screening walk-in applicants, EDD will search its list of potential  employees and invite candidates who meet an employer's criteria.  </P> <P> "We told them (suitable applicants) that Sheraton was hiring and told them to  come on in," Greene said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> EDD Conducts Interviews  </P> <P> In many cases, EDD sends staff members to an employer's office to help conduct  interviews. But, if the employer doesn't have the space to conduct such  interviews or would rather hold them elsewhere, the department allows employers  to use EDD offices.  </P> <P> There are seven EDD offices in the county -- Oceanside, Escondido, downtown San  Diego, El Cajon, San Diego East, the South Bay and Southeast San Diego. The  department also administers unemployment insurance.  </P> <P> Sheraton executives are interviewing applicants at two locations. One is at  temporary offices in La Jolla, 3242 Holiday Court, Suite 206. Interviews at  this site will be held Monday through Saturday until Oct. 14 (9 a.m. to 7 p.m.  Monday and Tuesday; 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Wednesday through Saturday).  </P> <P> Interviews will also be conducted at the San Diego EDD office, 1354 Front St.,  9 a.m to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday until Oct. 13.  </P></p>

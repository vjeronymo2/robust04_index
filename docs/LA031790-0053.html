			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'THE HANDMAID'S TALE' AS A COMMENTARY ON ABORTION  </P> <P> In his on-the-mark review of "The Handmaid's Tale" (March 7), Peter Rainer  refers to abortion only once, somewhat obliquely.  </P> <P> Did he miss the fact that the movie was an attempt to be a commentary on  abortion? Or was he just confused about what the message was and therefore left  the subject untouched? If so, I don't blame him.  </P> <P> The only way I knew the film was a pro-abortion effort was because the  director, Volker Schlondorff, spoke at the Los Angeles premiere and made his  intent clear.  </P> <P> The movie backfired on him, though. The dismal future world it portrays is one  that is the logical extension of unfettered abortion. If every woman is  entitled to abortion, then all women are entitled to abortion, and we have  delegated to pregnant women the right to extinguish the species. In the film,  only 1 in 100 women can have children; it's a short step from that to "1 in 100  will have a child."  </P> <P> KEVIN R. DAVIS, Beverly Hills  </P></p>

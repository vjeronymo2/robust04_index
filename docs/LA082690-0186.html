			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TEAMWORK LEADS TO CYCLING WIN FOR BEVAN  </P> <P> Chris Bevan, Chris Gaido and Fred Markham broke away from the 14-rider field  slightly more than halfway through the Jack Kemp Memorial 10-mile race at the  Encino Velodrome on Saturday night, which made for pretty good odds for Bevan  and Markham.  </P> <P> "We planned before the race to work together," said Bevan, 19, of Woodland  Hills. "We knew that Gaido is a good sprinter and we had to watch out for him."  </P> <P> The strategy worked as Bevan pulled away from newfound teammate Markham and  Gaido on the back straight of the final lap to win the 64-lap race in 21  minutes 19.07 seconds.  </P> <P> Bevan's time smashed Ron Skarin's track record of 22:21.4.  </P> <P> Markham held off Gaido for second, followed by Benjamin Swan and Butch Stinton.  </P> <P> Bevan, Markham and Gaido broke away from the field on Lap 23 and exchanged the  lead for the next 22 laps until Gaido took a slight advantage going into the  bell lap.  </P> <P> The race was named in memory of one of the original founders of the 29-year-old  velodrome. Kemp died earlier this month.  </P> <P> In another special race, Pushpita of the Indonesian national team emerged  victorious in the inaugural Chuck Pranke Memorial sprints.  </P> <P> Season points leader Chris Johnson placed second in the round-robin  competition, followed by Scott Skellenger, Markham and Luis Alcaraz.  </P> <P> Pranke, a sprinter on the 1968 U. S. Olympic team, helped promote races at the  velodrome in the early 1970s, including the International Grand Prix of  Cycling.  </P> <P> Kevin Anderson won the miss-and-out and placed third in the points-and-scratch  race to edge Cecil Hunte in senior men's omnium by a point, 12-11.  </P> <P> In earlier events, Amandy Henry of the Montrose Cycle Club won the  miss-and-out, points race and placed third in the scratch race to win the  senior women's omnium with 17 points, ahead of Katie Horndon (16) and Dana  Rogers (11).  </P></p>

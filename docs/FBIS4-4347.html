			<p>BFN     [Text] On 28 and 29 March, the people joined forces with  the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] in assaults  against the invading forces of the communist Vietnamese puppets  and two-headed government that had gathered at the Moung  District township and the railway station to be shipped to the  Pailin battlefield.    The communist Vietnamese puppets' state authorities had  gathered their invading forces from diverse areas in Moung  District at the district's township and railway station, from  where they were to be sent as reinforcements to the Pailin  region. When the people learned about this, they joined hands  with the NADK to attack and disperse the soldiers. As a result,  we killed 15 enemy soldiers and wounded more than 40 others.  Taking that opportunity, many soldiers freshly recruited by the  communist Vietnamese puppets' state authorities fled for home.  The people and NADK also destroyed five barracks, eight  vehicles, and 300 meters of railroad.    On the same day, the people and NADK attacked and destroyed  the communist Vietnamese puppet' invading forces. They  regrouped at Bakan District's township of Trapeang Chong on  Route National 5, killing 17 enemy soldiers and wounding more  than 20 others.    The state authorities of the communist Vietnamese puppets  and  two-headed government in Moung District and at Trapeang Chong  were terrified and fled for their lives. Some run away to the  Pursat provincial town, while others hid themselves at Boeng  Khna in Svay Don Kev.    National Route 5 and the railway lines have been cut off  since 28 and 29 March.</p>

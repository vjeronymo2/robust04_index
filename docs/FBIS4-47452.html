Pavlov, Ryazan; UDC  616.36-02:615].9-085.355]    [Abstract] The effect of normase on indicators of lipid  peroxidation in cases of toxic liver injury was studied in a  group of nonpedigree male albino rats weighing 170 to 250 g in  which toxic liver injury had been induced by 3 days of  intramuscular injection of a 50 percent oil solution of carbon  tetrachloride (2 ml/kg). The metabolism of tetrachloromethane  occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum of the hepatocytes was  accompanied by the formation of free radicals inducing lipid  peroxidation and subsequent development of hepatosis-hepatitis.  The rats were injected with normase in 1-ml doses once daily for  3 days. The intensity of free-radical oxidation was determined  by the concentration of malonic dialdehyde [MDA] in their liver  tissue, brain, and erythrocyte membranes. The data were  subjected to standard analysis of variance methods and Student's  t-test. As expected, tetrachloromethane induced  significant accumulation of MDA in the substrates studied: The  induced level in liver homogenate exceeded the starting levels  by 116 percent, that in the animals' brain tissue exceeded the  starting level by 59 percent, and that in their erythrocytes  exceeded the starting levels by 93 percent. The concentration of  SH groups in the said tissues decreased by 33, 34, and 38  percent, respectively. Normase was not found to have any direct  effect on the mechanism of primary liver injury. It did not  change the activity of free-radical oxidation in hepatic tissue;  however, it did facilitate normalization of the parameters of  lipid peroxidation in the membranes of the study animals'  erythrocytes and in their brain tissue.

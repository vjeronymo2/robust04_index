			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Setback for drug stocks KEY pharmaceutical stocks fell sharply as a result of bearish sentiment, somewhat jaded stories, currency shifts and a very cool attitude from US investors. The slide in Glaxo and Wellcome, although checked by the close of trading, accounted for almost half the overall loss in the FT-SE 100 index yesterday. Glaxo, whose price moves have the greater impact in the Footsie, was also the hardest hit. Sentiment was against it from the start of trading as dealers took note of a Sunday newspaper article which focused on the lack of new products and worries over the patent on Zantac, its highest earning drug product. Wellcome suffered from the backwash of two stories in the US press, concerning Retrovir, its widely-used Aids treatment. Neither story was particularly new but they provided a focal point on a day when sterling made gains of nearly four cents against the dollar. The currency shift left UK shares overpriced compared with their New York equivalent and forced marketmakers to cut prices. Also, analysts from Goldman Sachs, the New York investment bank, returned yesterday from a ten-day roadshow in the US, to disclose that very few clients showed interest in UK drug stocks. Glaxo, down 24 at one stage recovered to close 17 lower at 695p on turnover of 5m shares. Wellcome fell a net 14 to 915p. Lloyds wanted The absence of any predatory move from Lloyds Bank was the signal for a strong recovery in its shares yesterday. Suggestions that it was about to launch a bid for another bank were rife in the market last week and appear to have been responsible for marked weakness in Lloyds shares against an outperforming banks sector. During the five-day period Lloyds shares fell 2 per cent while Barclays rose over 10 per cent and NatWest almost 5 per cent. Favourites to attract a bid from Lloyds were Royal Bank of Scotland,Standard Chartered and TSB. Although not dismissing the possibility of a Lloyds bid for Royal Bank or Standard, specialists said a move to acquire the minority holding in Lloyds Abbey Life, the life assurance business in which it has a controlling 60 per cent stake, might be a more likely move. Lloyds Bank jumped 12 to 511p, on 1.8m traded, while Royal Bank of Scotland edged up 4 to 225p. Lloyds Abbey Life eased 3 to 434p. Guinness drifts Hints from some corners of the market that French luxury goods group LVMH may be looking to restructure its 24 per cent shareholding agreement with Guinness upset the shares, which retreated 2 1/2 to 466p. Most of the speculation emanated from French sources, but yesterday's story - reported in the Paris press and based on a broker's note - caused little excitement in London. Most UK based analysts were dismissive of the notion, which is said to have surfaced during speculation that LVMH needed to raise cash to make a big acquisition. They argued that if both groups were to reduce their holdings it would not only depress their shares but also disproportionately hit LVMH's profits, nearly one third of which come from Guinness. Stylo active Following last week's sale of a 26 per cent stake in Stylo, the footwear group, institutional demand and speculative interest combined to send the shares surging forward. The stake, which had belonged to Control Securities, was placed on Thursday with institutions at 90p, a generous discount to the then market price of 110p. Brisk demand by institutions continued yesterday, with the shares jumping 17 to 125p. There was unconfirmed speculation of stake building by one anonymous buyer. After the market closed it was announced that a member of the Ziff family, which holds around 20 per cent of the equity and management control, bought 30,000 shares at 90p on Thursday. In the transport sector, the spotlight fell on NFC as some market players belatedly caught up with last week's reports that the company would soon announce the sale of its Waste Management subsidiary for around Pounds 100m to a US buyer. The company remained coy, but the shares jumped 10 to 271p, to make them one of the best performers of the day in percentage terms, as turnover rose to 4.5m. Internationally traded stocks suffered from the effect of a weaker dollar against the pound. ICI shares, up in early trading on the belief that selling from Goldman Sachs had dried up, slipped after the US market opened and closed 4 off at 1107p. RTZ fell 9 to 656p and BAT Industries shed 7 at 966p. However, Reuters Holdings appeared to have hit a floor following heavy selling last week and rose 3 to 1313p. Recent buy recommendations from Smith New Court continued to drive Refuge Assurance, 15 up at 850p, and Britannic Assurance, 20 firmer at 1118p. The bad weather sweeping the UK over the weekend and in the recent past prompted a general markdown of the composite insurers along with Prudential and Legal &amp; General. But specialists said there was no real downside pressure on the individual stocks. General Accident eased 12 to 569p and Commercial Union 5 to 619p. BT were well supported, moving up 5 1/2 to 387 1/2 p after US newspaper reports that the company may be interested in buying a substantial stake in Electronic Data Systems, the General Motors subsidiary. Vodafone, on the other hand, suffered from US reports linking cellular phones with medical problems. the shares slipping 7 1/2 to 383 1/2 p. Reports that Opec is on the way to agreeing a reduction in output ahead of the February 13 meeting of Opec members, helped sustain an oil sector featured by strong late US buying of BP. Optimism that a reduction of around 1m barrels day in Opec's output could be implemented saw crude oil prices rise some 60 cents a barrel. BP were under light pressure during early trading but attracted keen overseas demand towards the close as US investors chased the stock higher in New York. In London the stock settled marginally higher at 231 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 12m shares, with specialists saying that BP will outperform Shell if crude oil prices improve in the wake of Opec output cuts. Shell edged up 4 to 530p on much thinner trade of 2.2m shares. Lasmo added 3 more to 154p, still boosted by recent broker buy notes. Rights issue talk faded away from Allied Lyons and the shares moved forward 6 to 597p, also helped by buying from Kleinwort Benson. Midlands Radio returned to the market with a sharp rise of 16 to 128p following its suspension on Friday. The suspension surrounded the announcement of a 130p a share bid from Capital Radio worth Pounds 17.7m. Capital gained a penny to 179p with one analyst commenting that the market liked the synergy of the deal and the fact that Capital was dipping into its own cash rather than calling on shareholders for extra funds. Haynes Publishing jumped 29 to 263p following comment in one Sunday newspaper and ahead of interim results on February 1 for which broker Beeson Gregory forecasts profits of Pounds 3m. Shares in British Aerospace bucked the market trend and jumped 12 to 227p, on speculation that the Al-Yamamah 2 defence contract with Saudi Arabia would soon be signed and talk of further hawk orders from Indonesia and possibly India. The shares have out-performed the market by 50 per cent over the last 3 months. Rolls-Royce eased 3 to 113p, on reports that Trans World Airlines may cancel plans to buy up to A 330 aircraft from Airbus Industrie that are to be powered by Rolls supplied engines.

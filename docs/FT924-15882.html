			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / 10,000 children dead or missing in Bosnia NEARLY 10,000 children have been killed or have vanished in the six-month war in Bosnia, according to figures published yesterday by Bosnian officials. Meanwhile, a large convoy of Moslems prisoners released from detention camps moved out of Serb-held northern Bosnia yesterday. It was the first large-scale evacuation of camp inmates organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Outlining the fate of Bosnian children, Mr Arif Smajkic, director of the Bosnian crisis centre in Sarajevo, said 1,447 children were known to have been killed and about 8,500 were missing. He told journalists 14,364 people had died and 57,000 had been reported missing since April. But even these figures are believed to be underestimates, because they were compiled mainly in Moslem and Croat-held areas and do not reflect Serb casualties in Serb-held territories. In Sarajevo alone, a city under siege for five months, 730 children had disappeared without trace, the centre said. Reflecting the savagery of the fighting, 47,284 people had been seriously wounded, including 12,080 children, and 78,500 slightly injured, 11,775 of them children. Some 80 per cent of all victims were civilians, many of them refugees. The 1,500 prisoners released yesterday from northern Bosnia moved out in a convoy of buses. Formerly held at the Serb-run Trnopolje camp, they were to go to a transmit camp arranged by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in the Croatian town of Karlovac. The unilateral prisoner release is seen as a public relations effort by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of Bosnian Serb forces, who control some two-thirds of Bosnian territory. Meanwhile Lady Chalker, the UK minister for overseas development, yesterday was due to deliver a consignment of medical aid worth Pounds 280,000 during a visit to Split, the Croatian port, and Mostar, the heavily damaged city in western Bosnia-Hercegovina, according to HINA, the Croatian news agency. In Washington, the US announced that it was resuming relief flights to Sarajevo, after they were halted nearly a month ago when an Italian aircraft was shot down by a missile. The Pentagon said it would send out orders today, so that flights could resume tomorrow, weather permitting. Sarajevo needs 200 tons of food and other aid daily, but was getting less than a quarter of that by road while the airlift was suspended.</p>

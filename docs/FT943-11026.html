			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / A sector awash with tides of deposits: Will building societies be left high and dry? Although volatility is not a quality usually associated with building society retail deposits, the picture given by the figures for society retail funds in the first half of this year suggests a flood of investors rushing in different directions. Throughout the first quarter savers deserted societies, leaving them with a net outflow of more than Pounds 1.3bn. In April and May they returned, producing net inflows for the first time since October. However in June they once again left societies with a net outflow of Pounds 104m. With the summer holiday season under way, there is unlikely to be much of an upturn in net receipts until the autumn. Other institutions, however, have been competing hard for savers' money and it remains to be seen how much the building societies will attract. Unit trusts - pooled investment funds - which last year enjoyed their best year ever, have registered even stronger private-investor buying this year. Net retail sales in the first six months totalled Pounds 3.9bn, almost twice the Pounds 2bn sold in the same period last year. The investment-trust industry has also enjoyed a period of heavy demand. One factor behind the attraction of unit and investment trusts, apart from the climate of low interest rates, has been personal equity plans (Peps). Most unit trusts are sold in the form of a Pep, which shelters gains from income and capital gains tax. The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds estimates that the value of funds under management in unit-trust Peps has grown to Pounds 10bn from Pounds 1.3bn in just three years. Mr Philip Warland, director-general of the association, said that Peps, which were first introduced in 1987, have proved an effective way to introduce long-term savers to the stock market. 'These Pep figures are a reflection of the increasing use of Peps to meet specific needs, such as repaying a mortgage, paying school fees or topping up a person's savings for retirement,' he said. National Savings has also done well. In January, National Savings launched the pensioners' guaranteed income bond, paying an interest rate of 7 per cent gross fixed for five years for people aged 65 and over. It has been the best-selling product each month since its launch, with the exception of last month. It contributed well over half the net National Savings receipts of Pounds 2.2bn in the first half, a spectacular increase on the Pounds 408m in the first half of last year. Premium bonds have also had a successful year following the decision by National Savings to increase the first prize to Pounds 1m. The fluctuations of savers' relationships with societies can be viewed in two ways. On the positive side, Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said they were a sign that societies were 'the residual core base, from which funds are drawn for other forms of saving'. However, the figures suggest that societies have only a limited ability to influence their own market share. If another form of savings is marketed or priced aggressively, societies are likely to suffer, even if they react in terms of the range of products they offer. Even so, when interest automatically credited to accounts is included, societies are well ahead of the banks in the value of personal deposits. Societies notched up a Pounds 3.3bn increase in savings in the first half of this year compared with a rise of Pounds 1.2bn in personal savings held in banks. Low interest rates are another factor. When rates are low - even on savings accounts - customers are less inclined to bother moving. Mr John Ecklin, statistics director at the British Bankers' Association, said: 'There is a lot of lethargy out there.'</p>

			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Construction Contracts: Rebuilding East Sussex sea defences EDMUND NUTTALL has won a contract to reconstruct a one kilometre stretch of sea wall between Ovingdean and Rottingdean, near Brighton, as well as to demolish a series of old groynes and construct five new ones at Rottingdean. The Pounds 5m project is for Brighton Borough Council which, with grant aid from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foods, is undertaking a broad scheme of which this is the first of three stages, to encase the entire failing sea wall between Brighton Marina and the borough boundary at Saltdean. The undercliff walk, which is liable to inundation by the sea under quite moderate storm conditions, was constructed in the 1930s by unemployed miners. The groynes have been built up in a number of stages, of varying grades of mass and reinforced concrete, since the 1870s. The new reinforced mass concrete sea wall facing will incorporate a parapet and wave return, the total encasement depth varying from 500 millimetres to three metres thickness; the shallower having expansion joints every six metres and those over one metre thick having joints every 18 metres. Five new 105 metre-long groynes are to be constructed at Rottingdean to retain a beach. The two terminal groynes will be rock.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (4): Top taxpayers will save Pounds 160 A NEW 20 per cent band on the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income was the prime 'goodie' in chancellor Norman Lamont's pre-election Budget. The new band will save the vast majority of taxpayers Pounds 100 a year. Coupled with the rise in the personal allowance to Pounds 3,445 (from Pounds 3,295), the Budget will save most basic rate taxpayers Pounds 137.50 and higher rate taxpayers Pounds 160. The 20 per cent band will add an extra layer of complexity for some savers. Tax will still be deducted from savings accounts at 25 per cent, and those who depend on savings income will have to claim back the Pounds 100 rebate from the Inland Revenue. The good news for borrowers is that Miras relief will still be granted at 25 per cent. Otherwise the main Budget changes which will affect the personal finance market were: The move to allow unit and investment trusts to qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 personal equity plan limit (see articles elsewhere in this Review); The plan to end the Business Expansion Scheme at the end of 1993; and The changes in inheritance tax, to help owners of small businesses and farms. The two latter changes, however, were not contained within the Finance Act, and so will have to be re-enacted by the new Conservative government. A quirk of the rules also means that the inheritance tax threshold was raised to Pounds 147,000, with a further rise to Pounds 150,000 now due. Most allowances rose in line with inflation, including the capital gains tax threshold which increased from Pounds 5,500 to 5,800. The exceptions were the married couples' allowance (stuck at Pounds 1,720) and the higher rate tax threshold (unchanged at Pounds 23,700 of taxable income).</p>

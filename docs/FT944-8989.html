			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Observer: Hopping mad An appealing feature of Japanese life looks like biting the dust. Because of an increase in under-age boozing, the government has politely suggested to brewers that they stop selling beer from their 140,000 street vending machines. Nobody lightly ignores government suggestions - even politely expressed ones. The five leading brewers will decide what to do soon. They will probably meekly bow heads and shuffle offstage - after all, the machines represent a mere 7 per cent of sales. But over-age drinkers will mourn the disappearance of these oases. Not only is vending machine beer always chilled, however hot the weather, it also comes in a range of sizes, from a one-gulp can up to two litres, enough to slake the biggest thirst.</p>

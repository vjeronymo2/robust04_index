			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / International Company News: Danish stalwart steps down THE MOST powerful man in Danish business for more than a generation, Mr Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller, head of the A. P. Moller shipping, transportation and oil and gas group, is to step down from daily control of the group. He said he will leave on June 30, just a few days before this 80th birthday on July 13. He began working for the group when he left school in 1932. His successor as chief executive will be Mr Jess Soderberg, 48, who was appointed by Mr Moller two years ago, pending his retirement. The Moller group was founded at the beginning of the century by Mr Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller's father, the late A P Moller. The group's twin parent companies, D/S Svendborg and D/S 1912, have a market value of about DKr40bn (Dollars 6.45bn), by far the highest of any group listed on the Copenhagen stock exchange.</p>

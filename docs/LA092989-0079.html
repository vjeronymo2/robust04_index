			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA  </P> <P> Neutrality is the watchword of Andreas Gursky, Thomas Ruff and Thomas Struth,  three young German photographers who dispassionately take in the passing scene.  Ruff and Struth's subject is architecture; Ruff's images are of people in  public spaces. His photographs are large, crisply executed, open-ended,  non-judgmental catalogues of subjects and situations that can be found in  contemporary urban society.  </P> <P> This enterprise is indebted to Bernd and Hilla Becher's massive  photo-documentation of German industrial buildings. The younger generation  seemingly has challenged itself to create equally sober, impersonal,  uninflected documents using large formats and -- on occasion -- color film.  </P> <P> In Struth's black-and-white images of apartments, banks and other buildings in  European cities, skies are bleached white and there is no visible human  presence. The fanatic clarity and Sunday-morning stillness of these views allow  you to ponder such details as the disposition of the blinds in apartment  windows or the patterns in which people have parked their cars. Not glorified  in any way, these buildings are oddly idealized by virtue of their seeming  removal from the bustle of daily life.  </P> <P> A trio of Ruff's very large exterior views of houses is oriented in a squarely  frontal manner. Shot in Cibachrome, each view nevertheless contains only the  most severely limited palette: gray skies, green grass, white curtains. The  very clarity of these views -- utterly devoid of people, with only rudimentary  signs of residential life -- gives them a curious transparency. They are as  plain, and invisible, as the nose on your face.  </P> <P> Gursky, who also works in Cibachrome, looks at the way people (and animals)  arrange themselves in open settings -- whether they be students lounging on a  university terrace, people at a tennis court in Paris or hens in a field. These  are social groups seen as dispassionately as bacteria on laboratory slides or  the bits of constantly reconfiguring glass in a kaleidoscope. (Margo Leavin  Gallery, 812 N.

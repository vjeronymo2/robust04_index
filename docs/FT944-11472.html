			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / FT Ski Expedition: Snowboarders in a storm Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are attempting to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. They spent October in Australasia and are now in the US on the last leg of their odyssey. At noon on October 26 we were flying over a volcano in New Zealand. At precisely the same time and date our Air New Zealand 747 was starting its descent into Los Angeles. Such are the miracles of crossing the date-line. Having skied on so many volcanoes in the southern hemisphere, we thought we should climb to the top of at least one before leaving for Mammoth Mountain in California. We chose Ruapehu, which, unusually, has a lake in its crater. As we climbed up from Whakapapa's Far West T-Bar, the weather became progressively worse - mist, rain, hail, and, eventually, a white-out. By the time we reached the lake, we could not see a thing. All that climbing had been in vain. So the following day we hired a light aircraft to get to see what we should have seen the previous day. One of the highlights of New Zealand was our visit to Queenstown, the base for two of South Island's best-known resorts, Coronet Peak and The Remarkables. But just as we drew up at The Remarkables, the Queenstown constabulary arrived to arrest some Japanese snowboarders. The charge: skiing with children's season tickets. The Japanese snowboard phenomenon is a very recent one. This is only the first year in which large groups of Japanese have spent the entire winter in New Zealand as ski bums, and according to the authorities they have brought with them a mini crime wave. After two of them had been grilled about phoney tickets another 20 admitted they had done the same. Said one ski area official: 'We want to stamp this out before it spreads.' Recently a local newspaper claimed: 'Queenstown's Japanese snowboarding community is at the centre of a glue-sniffing controversy.' Another reported a mugging in which the suspect was dressed 'like a Japanese snowboarder'. But the Japanese are not the only snowboarders who have made themselves unpopular here. As in Europe, they are viewed as being a mixed blessing. Skiers at Treble Cone resort have complained about the 'allegedly dangerous' behaviour of snowboarders and the management is reportedly talking of making the ski-field only available to skiers. In spite of this, Queenstown is a bustling but charming little lakeside town with exceptional views of the jagged snow-capped Remarkables and Lake Wakatipu, which according to Maori mythology is the only surviving remnant of a giant: a still beating heart which accounts for the regular rise and fall of the deep blue waters. The sheer Remarkables pinnacles cradle some good bowl skiing, but the best runs are not served by lifts: a long, fairly steep gulley called Scarper (also variously known as Toilet Bowl, Killing Time and Kill An Hour) involves a 25-minute climb from the top of Sugar Bowl Chair; the challenging Elevator and Escalator Chutes require a 20-minute climb; and even the homeward runs involve being picked up way below the ski area base in a kind of cattle truck shuttle. Coronet Peak, on the other hand, has more lift-served terrain, but apart from the back bowls, little in the way of 'out of bounds' skiing. But the newly-installed Express high-speed quad chair is one of the fastest in the southern hemisphere, hurtling skiers almost 1,500 vertical feet to the top of the mountain in under five minutes. Those in the business of clocking up altitude can manage as many as 50,000 vertical feet here in a day. Having such a fast-moving armchair to the slopes was bliss, after several days of struggling in New Zealand's 'daunting dozen' club fields. But in the end, we almost had the measure of these basic ski fields enjoyed by hardy skiers who thrive on camaraderie and cheap lift tickets. We have even purchased as a souvenir one of the dreaded 'nut-crackers' - metal devices shaped like large nut-crackers which you fling over the moving rope and hang on to grimly until the top. This device, which is fixed to a belt round your waist, is seen as a macho device by aficionados, and also serves to scare away wimpish recreational skiers such as Lucy and me, thus leaving the club fields uncrowded. When this system of uphill transport is combined with a total lack of grooming, it tends to make club fields the domain of the hardy and skilful few. Craigieburn, for example, had some of the most dramatic and exhilarating terrain south of the equator. But few 'ordinary' recreational skiers could get the best out of it. In some club fields, it is difficult to assess which is more exhausting: trying to use the rope tow or trying to ski down in breakable crust. Craigieburn's neighbour, Broken River had an extra impediment: you have to walk for half an hour or so up a steep path to reach the slopes. Add rain, and the fact that Broken River, was closed when we finally got there, and you have a grim day out. We eventually got it right at Temple Basin, which the manager, Tony Galvin opened especially for us, complete with our personal ski patroller Alistair Moore (who brought his dad - the only other skier on the mountain). In spite of a steep hour-long walk to get to the ski field, we managed to master the nutcracker and both snow (entirely ungroomed) and terrain were excellent. At our fifth and final attempt we had become club skiers. Our hardships were nothing compared with the pioneers who built the fields, often carrying enormous amounts of equipment and building materials up steep mountain tracks. Mount Robert, which has a two-hour walk-in, has just celebrated its 50th anniversary with a book of its history. This includes the following recollections. 'At least 50 per cent of the lodge was carried up Mount Robert on people's backs. The walls became a wonderful home for mice, so we were never lonely. One could lie in the bunk and scrape the solid ice off the bare corrugated iron about six inches from one's face. One hut lasted three months and then completely disappeared in a storm.' Being rather more hedonistic, we preferred hotels to huts. Skiing at Mount Hutt, South Island, Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker stayed at the Powder House, Methven. On North Island they stayed at the Skotel, Whakapapa Village. They also stayed at the Lakeland Hotel, Queenstown.

The December unemployment rate increased 0.1 percentage  point  from November, the fourth consecutive, identical monthly rise  since September. The figure is the highest since 3.0 percent  registered in June 1987, the Management and Coordination Agency  said.    The jobless ratio for all of 1993 grew 0.3 point from the  previous year to 2.5 percent, the highest in five years since  1988, the agency said.    The figure of 0.65 in the job openings ratio resulted from  an  adjusted 0.9 percent fall in the number of job offers from  November and a 0.4 percent drop in the number of job seekers,  the Labor Ministry said.    December's unemployment rate came to 2.7 percent for men,  down 0.1 point from the previous month, and 3.1 percent for  women, up 0.3 point.    The monthly number of jobless people stood at 1.75 million,  up 21.5 percent or 310,000 from a year before. The total figure  comprises 1.02 million men and 730,000 women.    The number of jobless in 1993 was 1.66 million, up 16.9  percent, or 240,000 from the preceding year.    The number of employed in December reached 64.32 million, up  0.2 percent or 100,000 from a year before, in a turnaround from  a 40,000 decrease posted in November.    The size of Japan's work force, including the unemployed,  stood at 66.07 million in December, up 0.6 percent or 410,000  from a year earlier.    By industry, construction jobs rose 3.2 percent from a year  before, while those in manufacturing fell 1.9 percent, remaining  in the minus column since November 1992.    Jobs in the wholesale, retail and food services sector  dipped  0.1 percent, the first drop in three months, while jobs in  services increased 2.7 percent.    The Labor Ministry said work openings in December decreased  30.6 percent in manufacturing, 20.3 percent in the wholesale,  retail and food services sector, 13.3 percent in transportation  and telecommunications and 12.2 percent in services. Job  offers, on the other hand, increased 4.7 percent in the  construction sector.    For the full 1993, the job opening ratio came to 0.76, down  0.32 point from 1.08 the previous year. The number of job  offers for 1993 dropped 17.9 percent while that of job seekers  grew 16.5 percent.</p>

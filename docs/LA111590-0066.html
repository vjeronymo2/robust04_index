			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO DISCOVERY: MORE VIDEOS:  </P> <P> "Koyaanisqatsi" (1983), directed by Godfrey Reggio. 87 minutes. No rating. For  the art film devotees among us, a movie with visual splendor and a hauntingly  rich score by composer Philip Glass.  </P> <P> It first lulls with serene images of nature, then abruptly cuts to man's  destructive influence over the very planet that sustains him. The title is Hopi  Indian for "life out of balance."  </P> <P> "Fright Night" (1985), directed by Tom Holland. 105 minutes. Rated R. Scary,  funny and intentionally campy, "Fright Night" involves a teen-ager who thinks  his new next-door neighbor is a vampire. Chris Sarandon makes a wisecracking,  smug resident Dracula, and Roddy McDowall plays "The Great Vampire Killer" with  verve. A perfect mix of comedy and chills. MIKE BELL  </P></p>

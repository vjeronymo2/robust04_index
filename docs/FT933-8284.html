			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Engineers' training review THE Engineering Construction Industry Training Board, one of the two remaining bodies able to levy its industry to pay for training in its sector, is to undergo a review. The board, which was the training committee of the Engineering Industry Training Board, was set up as a separate entity in 1991. Its operations were to be reviewed every three years. Most training boards have been abolished by the government, which prefers a voluntary approach to compulsory levies for training. However, the ECITB and the Construction Industry Training Board were allowed to remain because of the particular training problems of their industries, where employees tend to be on contracts.</p>

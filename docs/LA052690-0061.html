			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSHNELL'S THEATER  </P> <P> We were appalled by reading in Stage Watch recently of Bill Bushnell's latest  ravings and demands for another $32 million from the Community Redevelopment  Agency for his L.A. Theatre Center debacle -- and later that Mayor Tom Bradley  still backs funding.  </P> <P> A self-appointed savior of theater here, Bushnell never has had the slightest  inkling of what it takes to attract an audience anywhere, no less to the  entrails of downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> His pretentiousness of product, posing as "theater," has always been a turn-off  to audiences seeking any pure entertainment value for the inflated price of  tickets.  </P> <P> His "art and education" drivel is an arrogance topped only by his statement  "the community doesn't know what it wants. . . . It's my responsibility to put  on these stages what I want to see done." What conceit! Especially when it's  exactly that "community" -- or more precisely the Community Redevelopment  Agency -- he wants all those millions from! Give us a break, please!  </P> <P> KEITH EVANS  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 10 SPLIT $1.3-MILLION PAYOFF IN PIMLICO DOUBLE-TRIPLE  </P> <P> A double-triple pool of more than $1.3 million that accumulated over 23 days of  wagering at Pimlico Race Course has been won by 10 tickets.  </P> <P> Each winner in Saturday's double triple will receive $134,161.80 in the  second-highest payout in Maryland thoroughbred racing history.  </P> <P> The program generated a pari-mutuel handle of $4.28 million, and the  double-triple alone drew $829,617 in wagers from a combined crowd of 19,319 at  Pimlico and Laurel. It was the largest crowd in seven months and the biggest  handle on any day, excluding Preakness Day, at Pimlico.  </P> <P> The 10 winners had to pick the correct order of finish -- first, second and  third -- in the third and fifth races. One of the winners was Andrew Beyer, who  writes a racing column for the Washington Post.  </P> <P> Saturday's double-triple payoffs were short of the state record of $314,366  that went to a syndicate of Washington-area professionals at Laurel on Feb. 17,  1987.  </P> <P> Parimutuel Director Elizabeth Quill said five of Saturday's winning tickets  were bought at Pimlico, five at Laurel. The after-tax payoff was $107,329, she  said.  </P></p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / The Lex Column: On the inside track The market was well-prepared for Forte's dividend cut last week, thanks partly to a string of items in the weekend press and a shift in sentiment among analysts in the previous week. There is no evidence at all that Forte deliberately set out to leak the news, but this is a pattern which recurs in the UK equity market. The British Aerospace rights issue of 1991 is another celebrated case in point. Perhaps the frequency with which such corporate events are foreshadowed simply reflects the hard work of British broking analysts. To the trained eye, Forte's cut looked obvious after the debacle at Queens Moat. But that does not alter the fact that brokers' ability to predict depends on close and regular contacts with companies over a long period of time. To some in the City these cosy relationships appear at risk in the proposed new insider legislation. That would be damaging, the argument runs. There is nothing investors like less than a surprise. When news is filtered out slowly there is time to adjust and understand. Share prices are less volatile as a result. Even small investors benefit from the absence of shocks. Or do they? To those with the long horizons of many small investors it makes no difference how a decision on a dividend or a rights issue reaches the public domain. Over time the effect on the share price will be the same. The people who have more interest in speedy information are active institutional investors to whom broker research is directed. That is fine when the research contains original conclusions based on publicly available information. In the context of the new legislation it is more awkward to defend research that is simply a collection of semi-private hints, nods and winks relayed to an exclusive clientele.</p>

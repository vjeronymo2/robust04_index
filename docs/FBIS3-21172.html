			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Recently the STA made a proposal for the commercial  use of plutonium and an international management scheme for the  highly enriched uranium and plutonium that will be removed from  dismantled American and Russian nuclear weapons. The U.S.  government has announced a new nuclear non-proliferation policy,  and vigorous international discussions are expected over the  management of plutonium. We interviewed STA Atomic Energy Bureau  Director Hiroto Ishida concerning the goal of Japan's plan and  the likely course of future debate.  <H5>  Facilitate Mutual Understanding </H5>   Question: Why did Japan propose its own plan for the  international management of plutonium?    Reply: ``As far as overall atomic energy activities are  concerned, including Japan's use of plutonium, we carefully  follow the security measures of the International Atomic Energy  Agency, and we strive to provide the maximum amount of various  kinds of information. As a result, I believe that beyond a  shadow of a doubt we have created a system for the peaceful use  of atomic energy, and we shall continue to do so.''    ``However, the peaceful use of plutonium has become a topic  of concern with the operation problems at THORP, England's  reprocessing plant, and with the start of construction on the  reprocessing plant at Rokkasho Village in Aomori Prefecture.  There is also the problem of dismantling Russia's nuclear  arsenal. It is important that we strive to create a system to  facilitate mutual understanding concerning the use of plutonium  throughout the world.''    Question: How do you think the international discussion over  plutonium management will proceed?    Reply: ``Last year in December the IAEA invited seven  nations--England, France, China, Russia, Germany, Japan, and the  U.S.--to the first informal meeting on plutonium management, and  a second informal meeting will be held this month. The positions  of the various nations should become somewhat clearer at that  time.''    ``We ourselves do not think that the STA's international  management plan will be the final product. The most important  thing is that Japan should take a positive approach by  presenting a proposal for international review. We want to make  Japan's intentions clear.''  <H5>  U.S. Concerned About Surplus </H5>   Question: How have various countries reacted to Japan's plan  for plutonium management?    Reply: ``We have not reached the stage where specific  feelings are clear. Basically, there is a common understanding  that it is important to strive to increase openness in the use  of plutonium, but when it comes to specific policies, we can  expect a variety of opinions depending on the situation each  country finds itself in.''    ``For example, as we have learned in the nuclear  non-proliferation policy announced by the U.S. government in  September, the commercial use of plutonium will not be an option  in the U.S., at least for the time being, and naturally we can  expect the U.S. to take a strong position on preventing nuclear  proliferation.''    ``As far as Japan is concerned, the peaceful use of atomic  energy is guaranteed within the framework of the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty. We will pursue both nuclear  non-proliferation and the peaceful use of plutonium. It is  important for Japan to increase our openness as seen from the  outside so that the world will recognize we are using plutonium  in a peaceful manner.''    Question: We have heard that there is a good chance the U.S.  will propose a plan with strong regulations for plutonium  management. What do you think?    Reply: ``I think that is only natural, but the U.S. has a  greater interest in the problem of excess plutonium.''    Question: Some people say that Japan has presented a  plutonium management plan as preparation for an excess of  plutonium in the future.  <H5>  Supply/Demand Balance Maintained </H5>   Reply: ``I suppose there are people who are saying that, but  we do not think so. We will maintain the balance between  plutonium supply and demand to the end. Both the suppliers and  the demanders may have their plans, but things do not always go  according to plan. What is really important is carefully making  plutonium and carefully using it all up rather than forcing some  kind of delicate balance.''    [boxed material]  <H5>  Perspective </H5> <H5>  Alarm at Stronger U.S. Regulations </H5>   Japan's peaceful use of atomic energy was made possible  because of the nuclear non-proliferation system centered on the  U.S. and former Soviet Union. This system is now in flux as  Japan approaches the era of full-fledged use of plutonium. The  reason Japan quickly put together a plutonium management plan  was that the government decided it must strive to strengthen the  nuclear non-proliferation system on its own.    Japan and the U.S. both have the same objectives in nuclear  non-proliferation, but their situations are slightly different.  The U.S., which has abandoned the commercial use of plutonium  domestically, is leaning toward a policy that will add  regulations to the use of plutonium. Japan is alarmed that those  regulations will restrict her development of atomic energy.    In that respect, Japan's concept for international plutonium  management sends a strong message to the U.S. It will be  interesting to see how Japan forms ``alliances'' with England  and France, countries that also use plutonium.

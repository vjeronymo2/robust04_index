			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vienna Feb 1 (CTK) -- Hans Meyer, a spokesman for  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), today confirmed  to CTK that Cesium 137 was generally available on international  markets and can be legally purchased. He said this radioactive  material cannot in any case be used for the construction of  nuclear weapons.    Trade in cesium is monitored due to a high danger of  radiation, Meyer said at the IAEA's Vienna headquarters. He  said Cesium 137 is used for medical purposes and reliable firms  purchase the material legally, thus obtaining necessary data  about the intensity of radiation. The material is therefore not  suitable for smuggling, Meyer said.    He said he could imagine illegal trade in cesium only in  case  of lay people who want to enrich themselves very quickly and who  apparently have no idea about the danger. He said that a layer  of water of seven to eight metres was enough to absorb all the  radiation, provided the cover of such a delivery is not  destroyed.    If suppositions that Cesium 137 was being carried in the  small Czech Cessna plane that is believed to have crashed into  Lake Constance eight days ago are confirmed, Swiss authorities  are prepared to immediately expand investigation eastward.  However, experts considered the hypothesis that 70 kilogrammes  of Cesium 137 are lying at the bottom of the lake to be very  unlikely. The hypothesis was voiced today by the Austrian Press  Agency (APA), citing Swiss sources.    The Cessna was flying from Prague with five people on board.    Although a busy but "non-transparent" trade in radioactive  materials is going on in Switzerland, no substances that could  be used for the construction of nuclear bombs have been  discovered thus far, Roland Hauenstein, spokesman for a  Prosecutor's Office in Bern, said.    Swiss experts considered the possibility that 70 kilogrammes  of Cesium 137 were carried in the plane to be practically out of  the question. They said that without special protection, a  person in such close proximity to these materials would receive  a fatal dose within seconds. The pilot could not have survived  the trip from Prague to Lake Constance which is located on the  German-Swiss border, they said. The transportation would have  been possible only with a strong protective layer which would  have weighed several tonnes, which that type of plane was not  capable of carrying, they said. If any radioactive material was  carried on board the plane it would have been only several  grammes rather than kilogrammes.    Hans Eggenberger, spokesman for the police in St. Gallen,  who  are investigating the airplane's disappearance, said that the  rumours that the plane did not crash into the lake but landed  somewhere outside the reach of radar were "very unlikely." He  said that although it was possible for the plane to fly at a low  altitude and thus avoid to be seen on radar in Zurich, the  weather at that time made such a flight impossible. That is why  Swiss authorities continue to believe that the plane crashed  into the lake.</p>

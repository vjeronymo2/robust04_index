			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / France to reform pension system The French government is to introduce legislation to reform the country's pension system by next spring, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said yesterday. The reform would involve the establishment of powerful pension funds and would be aimed at easing the burden on the state pension system. It would also provide a significant new source of funds for the stock market and assist the government's ambitious privatisation programme. 'As long as privatisations are important, our country must have funds which have a large part of their holdings in shares,' Mr Alphandery said, referring to the government's plans to sell 21 publicly-owned companies over the next five years. The state pension system is under strong pressure as contributions from the workforce fall short of requirements for the country's ageing population. Earlier this year, the government passed legislation to extend from 37.5 years to 40 years the period which people need to work to qualify for a full state pension and recalculated this full pension on the average of a person's 25 best-paid years rather than the previous 10-year duration. But the deficit in the pension system, which stood at more than FFr15bn (Pounds 1.71bn) last year, has increased pressures for a more fundamental reform and a shift towards capitalised private pensions, as in the US and UK, rather than France's existing 'pay as you go' system. Pension reform would also form part of the government's plans to divert funds from the short-term money market into the corporate sector. The relatively high level of interest rates in France in recent years has encouraged the public to place its savings in such Sicav funds. At present, there is an estimated FFr1,200bn held in these funds. 'French companies have suffered from the tendency to invest in the money market rather than in stocks' said one French banker. 'Reform of the pension system is long overdue.'</p>

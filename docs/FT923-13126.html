			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Peace-keepers sent into South Ossetia RUSSIA and Georgia yesterday deployed 'blue helmet' troops to stop ethnic fighting in the disputed region of South Ossetia in the first peace-keeping operation since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Reuter reports from Moscow. Reports from the remote Transcaucasian region said hundreds of heavily armed Russian troops from the 104th paratroop battalion moved into a 7km-wide security zone separating rebel South Ossetia from the rest of Georgia. Georgian national guards occupied similar positions on their side of the border and pulled out all their men from the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali. But Itar-Tass news agency said gunfire overnight near the city killed four civilians, underscoring the difficulties facing the operation. The mission was the first peace-keeping attempt anywhere in the former Soviet Union, whose disintegration last year has prompted waves of bloodletting in ethnic clashes. South Ossetia is part of Georgia but wants to unite with neighbouring North Ossetia, which was assigned to Russia by Stalin. Hundreds of people have been killed since 1990 in fighting between Georgians and Ossetians. The peace-keepers have been issued with UN-style light-blue helmet bands. They will be joined later by a multi-ethnic force - Russians, Ukrainians, Ossetians and other mountain peoples - under nominal command of North Ossetian leaders. Their mission is to form a barrier between the two sides, opening the way to talks.</p>

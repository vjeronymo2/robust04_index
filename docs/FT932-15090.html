			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Letter: Contented consultants and their clients Sir, It was a pleasure to read, in your review of the Centre for Economic Performance's recent report (Management, April 5), such an elegant exposition of the guidelines that both clients and management consultants should follow to favour a productive and satisfying working relationship. But the review's title, 'A very uneasy alliance', gives the impression that most relationships end in disappointment on both sides, because the guidelines are not followed. However, I do not think that the evidence supports such a conclusion. For how do consultants go about developing their business pipeline? Doing new work for existing, satisfied clients is the way that effective consultants prefer; next comes getting a client's agreement to act as a reference when approaching new clients. The volume of management consultancy work that has been carried out in the UK for many years is not consistent with companies '. . .so often disappointed. . .' with consultants who '. . .often feel disappointed. . .' Disgruntled clients and frustrated consultants can always find an audience. Discontent is more interesting to talk and write about than is satisfaction. The rest - clients and consultants - are getting on well together, in their quiet and effective way.

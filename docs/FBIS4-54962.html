			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Grzegorz Kolodko, Polish finance </F> minister and deputy prime minister, by Andrzej Woyciechowski at  the Radio Zet studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of Radio Zet"  program--live]    [Text] [Woyciechowski] Radio Zet's guest today is  Professor Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and finance  minister. Good morning to you, Sir.    [Kolodko] Good morning to you, and to you, Ladies and  Gentlemen.    [Woyciechowski] When one reads newspaper headlines from the  past few days, they resemble war reports: Battle for Popiwek  [tax on excessive wage increases]--that is the kind of title  that keeps appearing every day. What is this battle for popiwek  all about, and who is fighting whom?    [Kolodko] I hope this will be the last battle because  popiwek is a palliative situation; it is not a good solution.  As everyone knows, it was introduced quite some time ago with  the goal of regulating the rate of salary increases. We have  been using it as an instrument of anti-inflationary policies,  and it seems that it is the working people or the trade unions  that are fighting the government, or, to put it in broader  terms, the authorities in general--after all, popiwek is [words  indistinct]...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Actually, the fight is with  the finance minister--that is, you--because it is you who  ultimately decides the issue.    [Kolodko] I would not like to think that this fight is with  me. No, it is not the finance minister who decides, even though  he naturally enjoys specific powers, he suggests certain  solutions, there is the whole legislative process...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But what about you,  personally? Are you in favor of the popiwek?    [Kolodko] I am not in favor of the popiwek, and I have just  told you about some steps concerning what should be done to  resolve this palliative situation that is not the optimal  solution. And we are indeed resolving it. Now, I understand  that the popiwek has been applied for so long because, even  though it was not the best solution, it still kept nominal  salaries in check and, by controlling salary inflation, the  popiwek unquestionably contributed to decreasing price inflation.    [Woyciechowski] But how does the popiwek fit into a free  market economy? Is there any country in the world, a capitalist  country such as Poland, that has introduced this instrument?    [Kolodko] The popiwek does not fit into the free market  economy very well because it obviously limits the sovereignty of  economic units and enterprises, whereas we are eager for them to  really conduct their own economic policies. Let me put it this  way: I am referring first of all to operational activities and  decisions regarding the distribution of economic surpluses into  that part that is being invested and that part that is devoted  to salaries--that has to be an independent process, whereas the  popiwek is about the state's interference in decisions about  distribution in an enterprise, and the popiwek's evil is about  breaking apart a fundamental relationship in economic processes  between awarding efficient labor...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Is the popiwek a necessary  evil? Is that your assessment?    [Kolodko, hesitating] It used to be a necessary evil, and  right now it is also a necessary evil, but currently, we, the  governing coalition, are suggesting--the Sejm already approved  of that and the Senate will debate it today--namely to apply  what I call the mechanism of the setting sun, meaning that we  should impose on ourselves the rigor--I mean, not so much we  ourselves as parliament will impose it on us as the  government--that we should abandon the popiwek irreversibly,  definitely, and, I hope, forever, and that should happen by the  end of this year. This is really a very short period of time...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] By the end of this year?    [Kolodko] Exactly. So that means eight months in which a  whole range of other systemwide solutions must be prepared that  will facilitate labor efficiency and award increases in labor  efficiency, but that--God forbid--will not result in an increase  of inflationary pressures, which are very strong in Poland to  begin with.    [Woyciechowski] Mr. Prime Minister, how did your first week  on the job go? You have been a deputy prime minister for one  week now.    [Kolodko] It passed under conditions of a great deal of work  and enormous pressures, on the part of not only the striking  miners but also the mass media and people I met in the hallways  of the Office of the Council of Ministers building. First of  all, I spent the week trying to overcome an organizational  jungle because a certain confusion occurred as a result of the  vacancy at the post of deputy prime minister and finance  minister for almost three months...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What happened when, after  three months, you entered the empty office of the deputy prime  minister and finance minister? Was there a huge pile of papers  to be signed, or was it not like that at all?    [Kolodko] No, as far as that is concerned, everything had  been very well prepared. What did happen, however, was that  there were lying--or actually hanging in midair, I should  say--some unresolved issues and problems, and I think the  infamous popiwek and the highly complicated sociopolitical  situation, I mean the wave of strikes I hope are on the decline  now, this is what I encountered there. Some issues are being  resolved and some need to be resolved soon, and the government  is working on that. Some proposals will be presented soon, but  the whole point about conducting economic policies is about  finding the right way or method to resolve problems faster than  new problems arise. One must have a colossal imagination and  colossal psychological discipline, and, of course, one must have  the appropriate economic knowledge. As far as the knowledge  part is concerned, I studied and analyzed these issues for quite  some time, so I am positive about that aspect. But actions need  to be intensified by all means, and, from that standpoint, I can  understand the impatience of trade unionists, of working people  and businessmen who have unambiguous expectations vis-a-vis the  government for it to fulfill some earlier declarations,  especially those made during the election campaign, as far as  the coalition parties are concerned. I did not take part in the  campaign, but right now it is also my problem to keep the  commitments.    [Woyciechowski] Let us go back for a moment to the first  week. During your first week in the post of deputy prime  minister, you must have read a great many secret documents,  figures, and statistics. After this first week, do you view  Poland's economic situation better or worse than a week ago? Is  it very bad, very good, or just average?    [Kolodko] I have not read very many such secret figures. As  deputy prime minister, I receive certain material labeled secret  and confidential, and sometimes I wonder what makes something  secret as opposed to confidential. My knowledge about the  country's economy is comprehensive enough to be able to avoid  some secret knowledge of which we would still not be aware...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So that means you were not  surprised by anything over the week?    [Kolodko] No, from that perspective, I was not surprised by  anything.    [Woyciechowski] But is it your assessment today that the  situation is better or worse than what you thought a week ago?    [Kolodko] As far as the situation of the Polish economy  goes, and also future prospects ahead of the economy, I say that  the week introduced no major changes [words indistinct]...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So what is the economic  situation like?    [Kolodko] I still think that, first of all, future prospects  are good, even though today I have more problems on my mind  because if it were not for the strikes, protests, and this  horribly arranged social dialogue--I mean the strikes--my  optimism would definitely be even greater to some extent, but I  still approach this in a very constructive way, and I think we  have good chances for resolving a whole range of economic  problems to everybody's advantage. It so happens that the  Polish economy has already entered a growth period, and I regard  it as my main mission to conduct the kinds of policies that will  strengthen the growth trend or even accelerate growth.    [Woyciechowski] Mr. Prime Minister, on the one hand, there  is growth, but, on the other, when you compare Poland with the  Czech Republic, for instance, or with Hungary, we have a much  higher inflation level and huge unemployment. Are these the two  biggest obstacles--I mean inflation and unemployment?    [Kolodko] There is no doubt that they are both limitations  to economic policies, but they are also those parts where our  economic policies should be concentrated...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What must be done to halt the  growth of inflation and to bring inflation to a normal level?  Do you have an ideas on that?    [Kolodko] Yes, I do. Of course I have ideas. But this  process is...[Kolodko pauses] You touched upon two issues here:  inflation and unemployment. There is no doubt that, especially  over the short run, there is a relationship between...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Is inflation caused by  unemployment, or is it the other way around?    [Kolodko] I mean, reducing inflation by subsequent  percentage points under the current conditions--if it is not  done with a certain monetary-fiscal sophistication, I would put  it this way--may cause a further increase in unemployment. The  goal of economic policies...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In a word, the lower the  inflation, the higher the unemployment?    [Kolodko] Yes, I mean, if we tried to reduce inflation  currently by applying instruments similar to those that were  applied at the beginning if 1990, there is no doubt that this  would result in a further increase in unemployment while one of  the goals of socioeconomic policies of this particular  government--and rightly so, in my view--is first of all to keep  reducing the rate of unemployment growth--and we are practically  at that stage now--followed by reductions in the rate of  unemployment as such.    [Woyciechowski] How does inflation in Poland come about?  What is its source? Is there any one source of inflation in  Poland?    [Kolodko] Oh, no. There is no single source. Inflation is  very complex, and it is partially of a structural nature, and  partially it....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What do you mean by structural  nature?    [Kolodko] I mean that the structure of our economy continues  to be such, that, given the current systemwide  solutions--unfortunately, this brings in the popiwek again--the  flow of income is rising at a slightly faster rate than the flow  of real supply--that is, production--so this causes [words  indistinct]....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Is this because someone awards  raises to somebody?    [Kolodko] That is true, and also because, in macroeconomic  terms, we pay out--that is, we introduce more money into the  economy, through various channels, not only through salaries,  than would be justified by a physical growth of the product.    [Woyciechowski] To make a long story short, we earn too  much, Mr. Prime Minister?    [Kolodko] Oh, no, we do not earn too much. Right now our  real wages are increasing because work efficiency and output are  also increasing. Therefore, it would seem that it should be  easier for us to conduct economic policy. Today's disputes are  not over how to distribute the decreasing production and how to  share the ever-growing amount of poverty, but over how to share  this richness, which is increasing, however slowly. I  understand that today social protests have become more intense,  and certain tensions have built up because people can already  feel, which is based not only on their intuition but also on  facts and observations, that it is rising. Now, the question  arises...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That wage increases are being  given?    [Kolodko] I would not like to use the word given because  this keeps us in the epoch of the Polish People's Republic:  Either someone gives something or it is obtained by fighting.  What one actually can obtain by fighting is only poverty--the  more strikes, the slower wage increases will be; the more  strikes we stage, the more....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Talking about the strikes.  What is your opinion on them? Do you agree with the opinion of  those who claim that these are first of all political strikes,  aimed at the coalition?    [Kolodko] I would not like to interpret them in this way.  However, as an economist, I do not fully understand these  strikes, and, frequently, when I observe the situation  carefully, I can see that first there is a strike and only then  do the strikers search for demands that should be submitted.  After that, demands follow that have not been discussed 24  hours or even 24 days beforehand. In this sense, one can  interpret these strikes as political; however, all political  players are involved in it--politicians who have certain  ambitions, certain views. We often have disputes not over the  differences of views but over the differences of interests. This  is why it is next to impossible to reach an agreement, a  consensus, because the interests are different. Now, if I were  to look at this from the standpoint of a nurse, a physician, a  teacher, a miner, or a driver, I can understand the people's  reaction: When they hear that our economy is already developing,  that the situation is good and is to improve, it is  understandable that they would like to benefit from this as  well. The mechanism that is supposed to resolve these  difficulties must be institutionalized. We place great emphasis  on the negotiations of the trilateral commission. We treat it  very seriously, and, from the point of view of...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] During the negotiations in the  trilateral commission, it was promised...[Woyciechowski pauses]  Actually, it was not you who promised it. Representatives of  the Finance Ministry promised that the personal income tax would  be less severe. What is your opinion on this?    [Kolodko] It will not really be less severe. The unionists  want this: If the next tax bracket is exceeded, the person who  exceeds it should be able to pay the tax along with his or her  spouse. In that case, the advance payments should not be made.  We have calculated this in the Finance Ministry--what the  financial result of such an operation is in a year. It has also  been discussed before. An agreement is possible here, and we  are arriving at such an agreement, which the government,  wherever there is....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, will the tax be less  severe or not? You protested when I said that it would be.    [Kolodko] Well, it will be less severe if we look at it from  the viewpoint of the entire year. It is a certain concession  for those taxpayers. However, it is a matter that does not make  any greater perturbations in the sphere of public finances. In  this area, the government is reaching an agreement with the  trade unions. However, I would like such matters to be regulated  quite unequivocally when the budget law is prepared. Again, I  am a realist, but I will now tell you this anecdotal story: I  recently visited Japan, and, in this country, people are allowed  to stage strikes only in March because the budget enters the  fiscal year on 1 April, and, once the budget has been passed by  a democratically elected parliament, then, in a democratic  society, there comes the time of hard work....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Then you would like a similar  situation in Poland? Would you like one month to be chosen for  strikes? August, for instance?    [Kolodko] You know, actually I would not like any strikes in  Poland. I believe that, in a more or less normal situation,  which we are more and more, it is possible to reach agreement  even on very difficult issues. I am a realist, and I do not  think we will reach a situation in Poland where there will be no  strikes at all. I can imagine....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Is it possible in Poland today  to fulfill the election promises made by the Polish Peasant  Party and the Democratic Left Alliance?    [Kolodko] This depends on how they are interpreted and  over what period they should be fulfilled. The foundation of my  economic policy or my view of he economic policy is the  necessity of prolonging time. I assume that the work we are  going to do will be done in the constitutional period of one  term.    [Woyciechowski] This is what you discussed in the Sejm--the  medium-term program, the medium-term strategy. This medium term  means how many years?    [Kolodko] Yes, I am even working on a strategic program, I  would say. I would like to add, however, that a strategy is  implemented over a longer period than terms of governments, even  in stable societies....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That is six, seven, or eight  years?    [Kolodko] Six, seven, or eight. Let us say....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] This is, then, the economic  program on which you are working.    [Kolodko] Of the year 2000. Yes. However, what this  government must try to implement is a medium-term strategy.  Because I am also the finance minister, I attach great  importance to the preparation of the so-called medium-term  financial strategy. In this area, we have reached a certain  creative agreement with the president of the National Bank of  Poland.    [Woyciechowski] Mr. Prime Minister, what will the situation  in Poland look like in two or three years? How high will  inflation be? How much will our incomes increase? How much  will the zloty be devaluated?    [Kolodko] I think that, in three years, the situation in  Poland will be noticeably better, which does not mean that all  groups will be the beneficiaries....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] How high will inflation be?    [Kolodko] In three years, if we manage to implement our  economic policy, inflation will near the level of approximately  10 or 12 percent....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That is, just like Hungary  today?    [Kolodko] Well, it is still very high inflation. This  should be clear. Compared to Western standards--jthe OECD or  the European Union--it is very high inflation. However, if we  take into account the inflationary hell in which we have been in  recent years....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] How much will our incomes  increase within three years--2 percent, maybe more?    [Kolodko] Well, more. According to the calculations of the  Central Planning Administration, which concerns the increase in  the GDP, it is estimated that real wages this year may increase  more than was envisioned in the budget law. What you said--that  is, 2, 3, or 4 percent--is guaranteed this year. If....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] They will increase more. What  do you mean by 5 or 6 percent?    [Kolodko] Within this year or within three years?    [Woyciechowski] This year?    [Kolodko] No, this year I believe they will increase 3 to  3.5 percent....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That makes 10-12 percent  within three years, does it not?    [Kolodko] They can certainly increase that much. We will  also have money for much faster increases in investments, for  financing growth and development, because this policy must  really be very prodevelopment. We must think increasingly more  about future generations, not only about this present-day  consumption.    [Woyciechowski] How high will the devaluation of the zloty  be? In the Sejm, you promised to defend the Polish currency. Is  it not going to be devaluated so often?    [Kolodko] It is not devaluated very often. That is, on the  one hand, we must implement the policy of strengthening the  currency so that this will further stabilize the economy and  influence macroeconomic stabilization; on the other hand, we are  still faced with the dilemma of to what extent we should take  advantage of the exchange rate as an instrument of shaping the  current circulation. On the one hand, there is a certain  temptation; there is pressure, especially from groups linked to  exports, to devaluate the zloty because this makes exports more  profitable and restricts the import trends. Right now there are  no reasons to head for a faster and greater devaluation. There  is only the question of when we will pass to the stage of  shaping the exchange rates more freely within the framework of  the interbank system. For the time being, we are employing the  so-called crawling pack [preceding two words in English]--that  is, adjusting monthly devaluation, based on the basket of  currencies. There is the question of on what level this ratio  should be. Now, earlier you asked about the causes of  inflation; one of these causes is such a mechanism of  devaluation: If the Central Bank devalues the currency by 1.6  percent a month, it sends information to all consumers and  manufacturers that the price of foreign currencies goes up by  the average of 1.6 percent a month. More or less, in the same  rate, the price of everything else goes up as well. This gives  a signal to what we economists call inflationary expectations....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] The Central Bank is  partially to blame for this inflation? Is it Ms. Waltz?    [Kolodko] It is not the fault of Ms. Waltz or the Central  Bank because it is both the cause and the result. This mechanism  also consists in the following: We adjust the price of money to  the costs that go up for other reasons. I do not want to say a  banal thing--here everything depends on everything else. It is  a very complex system of interdependencies. The point is that  we should quietly and gradually reach the lower levels of the  crawling pack [preceding two words in English]. It is possible  that, from time to time--now this time has not yet come, that we  will have to make a correctional devaluation. However, the main  goal is to stabilize the exchange rate, and this is the function  of inflation. On the other hand, this inflation is the function  of....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] This is what you call the  protection of the Polish currency. What about the  denominations? Do you like the bank notes with six zeros? When  will the zeros be less numerous?    [Kolodko] I do not like them. This sometimes makes  calculations quite complex. Our views are clear: The currency  in Poland must be redenominated. Work is under way....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Will this be done in January  or a year later?    [Kolodko] I would like us to be ready with this on 31  December....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] At the end of the year. The  last question. I have read in the papers today that, on Monday  [9 May], the government will go to Lansk for two days, to that  magnificent residence--this time not for a rest but for a  session of the government. Why is the government escaping from  Warsaw and hiding in the Lansk forest to hold a session?    [Kolodko] Well, I do not know....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Is this going to be a secret  session?    [Kolodko] I think this will be done because the waiters  there are not on strike. I do not know whether those residences  are magnificent; I have never had the pleasure of visiting them.  I will go there for the first time and in this new role of  mine. Now, seriously. Prime Minister Pawlak proposed such a  solution to have more time for a quiet, substantive, and lengthy  discussion over this long-term strategy we are preparing. I  would also like to present my concepts in greater detail. This  is why we want to leave for Lansk. This was planned much  earlier. The prime minister insists on this proposal. The idea  is that we should go there, close the doors, as it were, and  discuss issues in quiet....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Put aside the cellular  telephones.    [Kolodko] Also the cellular telephones, which sometimes are  a distraction--they make people concentrate on things outside  rather than on the issues we are supposed to discuss. I think  then we will know more questions. I also believe we will be  able to answer some of them. Now, I also said this in the Sejm:  I treat very seriously the principle of "Nothing About Us  Without Us." I hope that we--my colleagues in the government and  I--will be able to discuss these issues here with you and the  listeners quite often. I hope we will be able to subject this  to public evaluation, that we will argue and debate, until we  feel pain. However, I hope we will not strike because strikes....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, who will feel the  pain, the ministers or the people?    [Kolodko] Well, sometimes we will all feel the pain because  we will have arguments about how to distribute the effects of  the growing work efficiency. Now, the process will be difficult  all the time. Everyone who is involved in it will feel the  pain....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Will everyone feel the pain  equally?    [Kolodko] No, because it will be fair--fair means unequal.    [Woyciechowski] Thank you for the interview, Mr. Minister.    [Kolodko] Thank you.</p>

For example, if the applicant is high bidder for a license in the Interactive Video Data Service ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  47 CFR Part 95, Subpart F), the long form application will be submitted on FCC Form 574 in accordance with &sect;95.815 of this chapter.

Such agreements must have been entered into prior to the filing of short-form applications pursuant to &sect;1.2105. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1.2108 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Procedures for filing petitions to deny against long-form applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Where petitions to deny are otherwise provided for under the Act or the commission's Rules, and unless other service-specific procedures for the filing of such petitions are provided for elsewhere in the Commission's Rules, the procedures in this section shall apply to the filing of petitions to deny the long-form applications of winning bidders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Within thirty (30) days after the Commission gives public notice that a long-form application has been accepted for filing, petitions to deny that application may be filed. Any such petitions must contain allegations of fact supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) An applicant may file an opposition to any petition to deny, and the petitioner a reply to such opposition. Allegations of fact or denials thereof must be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof. The times for filing such opposition and replies will be those provided in &sect;1.45. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) If the Commission determines that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) an applicant is qualified and there is no substantial and material issue of fact concerning that determination, it will grant the application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) an applicant is not qualified and that there is no substantial issue of fact concerning that determination, the Commission need not hold a evidentiary hearing and will deny the application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) substantial and material issues of fact require a hearing, it will conduct a hearing. The Commission may permit all or part of the evidence to be submitted in written form and may permit employees other than administrative law judges to preside at the taking of written evidence. Such hearing will be conducted on an expedited basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1.2109 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> License grant, denial, default, and disqualification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Unless otherwise specified in these rules, auction winners are required to pay the balance of their winning bids in a lump sum within five (5) business days following award of the license. Grant of the license will be conditioned on full and timely payment of the winning bid. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) If a winning bidder withdraws its bid after the Commission has declared competitive bidding closed or fails to remit the required down payment within five (5) business days after the commission has declared competitive bidding closed, the bidder will be deemed to have defaulted, its application will be dismissed, and it will be liable for the default penalty specified in &sect;1.2104(g)(2). In such event, the Commission may either re-auction the license to existing or new applicants or offer it to the other highest bidders (in descending order) at their final bids. The down payment obligations set forth in &sect;1.2107(b) will apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) A winning bidder who is found unqualified to be a licensee, fails to remit the balance of its winning bid in a timely manner, or defaults or is disqualified for any reason after having made the required down payment, will be deemed to have defaulted and will be liable for the penalty set forth in &sect;1.2104(g)(2). In such event, the Commission will conduct another auction for the license, affording new parties an opportunity to file applications for the license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Bidders who are found to have violated the antitrust laws or the Commission's rules in connection with their participation in the competitive bidding process may be subject, in addition to any other applicable sanctions, to forfeiture of their upfront payment, down payment or full bid amount, and may be prohibited from participating in future auctions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1.2110 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Designated entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Designated entities are small businesses, businesses owned by members of minority groups and/or women, and rural telephone companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Definitions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Small businesses.

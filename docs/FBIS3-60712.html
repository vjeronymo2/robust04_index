We consider it necessary to strengthen control over  nuclear materials, and a new draft of the control system has  been worked out exactly for this purpose,'' the academician  noted.    According to Aleksandr Rumyantsev, one of the main think  tanks of the draft system, at present control over nuclear  materials is based on data from the institute's accounts  department. In the future the emphasis will be made on the  results of physical measurements of materials which will allow  to know a specific situation practically every week. At the  same time the administration of the scientific center intends to  take stock of nuclear products on a regular basis.    The draft of a new control system has been prepared together  with specialists from the American Technical Institute (U.S.A.).  Researchers from the ``Kurchatov Institute'' find it rather  important that for the first time the Russian state scientific  center has been closely cooperating with the U.S. private  scientific establishment.</p>

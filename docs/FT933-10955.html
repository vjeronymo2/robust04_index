			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: Successes outweigh the errors - Unit trusts / Morgan Grenfell European Fund THE European stock markets have offered fairly slim pickings since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Many a fund was launched in the general euphoria, only to suffer as German interest rates were kept high to meet the costs of re-unification. Morgan Grenfell's European fund has performed consistently well through the turmoil. Not only is the fund top of the sector over the five years to July 1, with growth of 141.8 per cent (offer-to-bid with income re-invested), but it is in the top quartile (best 25 per cent) of funds in the sector over every period published by Micropal (one month, six months, one and three years). The fund has been managed by John Armitage since its launch in 1988, when Morgan Grenfell moved into retail unit trusts. Figures show the fund beat the Morgan Stanley European (ex-UK) index comfortably in 1988 and 1989 and did so again in 1990 (although both the offer price and the index fell sharply that year). It had a poor 1991, underperforming the index substantially, but picked up again in 1992 and is well ahead this year. 'I only like to invest in things with substantial upside. I reckon that 30-40 per cent of what a fund manager does is a mistake,' says Armitage. 'The successes have to go up a lot to allow for the mistakes.' His biggest success was the Swiss watchmaker SMH, but the holding is still a source of regret. Although the share price has increased fourfold since he bought a stake, he sold part of his holding after the shares rose just 35 per cent, and did not get the full benefit of his original decision. Armitage says he tries to be as eclectic as possible and, accordingly, does not buy stocks that rise and fall automatically in line with the market. He cites his purchase of shares in Norgeskreditt, the Norwegian mortgage lender, at Nkr100 on the ground that the asset value was around Nkr220 and the dividend yield was 5.5 per cent. Almost immediately, a Norwegian financial crisis developed and the shares slumped to Nkr62. Given that Norgeskreditt was a substantial holding in the fund, this worried Armitage; but the shares have doubled over the past eight months and are 33 per cent ahead of what he paid. 'In the European bear market of 1990-92, most investors wanted liquidity and were willing to pay a premium for shares in large companies,' says Armitage. He believes there is more value to be found among small and medium sized company shares. His focus is on stock-picking rather than asset allocation, although he tries to fit stocks within an overall strategic framework. At the moment, he is not overly bullish about continental equities, particularly in the 'hard core' markets of mainland Europe. 'Markets are at levels which discount a return to profitability,' he says. But he believes industrial earnings will remain weak as volumes and prices come under pressure. On the positive side, Armitage says: 'There is a crashing need for interest rates to fall.' If this occurs, equities should benefit as funds flow out of cash and bonds. The fund's top 10 holdings are: SIP/STET (Italian telecommunications group), Astra (Swedish pharmaceuticals company), Securitas (Swedish security company), Parmalat (Italian dairy products group), Colruyt (Belgian food retailer), Bank Julius Baer (Swiss bank), Christian Dior (French fashion house), Ava (German food retailer), Scor (French re-insurance company) and Fila Holdings (Italian sportswear group). In terms of geographical spread, the Morgan Grenfell fund is underweight (relative to the Morgan Stanley index) in France, Germany and the Netherlands and overweight in Italy, Sweden and Norway. The fund's current asset allocation (percentages in brackets) is France (17.8), Germany (15.7), Italy (15.1), Sweden (14.5), Switzerland (9.2), Norway (6.8), Spain (6.7), Netherlands (2.2), cash (1.6) and others (10.4). At nearly Pounds 130m, the fund is one of the dozen largest in the European sector. Only five other funds (Eagle Star European, Fidelity European Income, Henderson European Income, Lazard European Growth and Providence Capitol European) can match its achievement of top quartile performance over six months, one, three and five years. Charges The initial charge is 5.25 per cent and the annual 1.25 per cent. The bid-offer spread is around 6.6 per cent at present. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000 or Pounds 25 a month via the regular savings plan. The trust is Pepable at no extra charge; however, it pays no income and is suitable only for those looking for capital growth.</p>

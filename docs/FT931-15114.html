			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Record sales and earnings at Intel INTEL, the world's largest semiconductor supplier, yesterday posted record sales and earnings for 1992, outperforming even the most optimistic Wall Street projections. The Californian company's stock rose Dollars 8 1/8 to a high of Dollars 110 1/8 in New York yesterday. despite nervousness in the market about Iraq. Its growth reflects strong sales of personal computers, for which Intel is the leading supplier of microprocessors. Intel said that it had exceeded its goal of shipping 4m to 5m 386 and 486 microprocessors in the year. Mr Andrew Grove, Intel president and chief executive, said: 'Our business is in excellent shape as the new year begins, with strong demand across most of our product lines.' Fourth-quarter sales rose 54 per cent to Dollars 1.86bn, up from Dollars 1.21bn a year earlier, while net profits surged 127 per cent to Dollars 429m from Dollars 189m. Earnings per share emerged at Dollars 1.97, against 90 cents for the previous fourth quarter. Wall Street analysts, who lifted estimates in mid-December when Intel signaled strong fourth-quarter earnings, had projected per-share net income of about Dollars 1.59. Booming sales in the fourth quarter completed a strong year for Intel with turnover for the 12 months up 22 per cent at Dollars 5.84bn, compared with Dollars 4.78bn in 1991. Net profits were Dollars 1.07bn, or Dollars 4.97 per share, up from Dollars 819m, or Dollars 3.92 a share. As well as record microprocessor shipments, Intel said sales of other products including standard semiconductors, system level and networking products, were strong. Intel has been the world's fastest-growing chipmaker for the past five years. Recently it surpassed NEC of Japan to become the world's largest chipmaker, according to Dataquest, the US market research firm. Intel's success has been based largely upon sales of its flagship microprocessor products. The company is, however, expected to face increasing competition in the personal computer microprocessor market later this year when Advanced Micro Devices, a Silicon Valley rival, plans to launch its own version of the top-selling 486 microprocessor. This year Intel is expected to introduce its next generation of microprocessors, called Pentium. The powerful devices are expected to be used initially to power mid-range computers called 'servers' that are linked to personal computer networks.</p>

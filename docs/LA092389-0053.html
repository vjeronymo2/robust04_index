			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY SPOTS: AN ENTERTAINING LOOK AT OLD TESTAMENT TALES  </P> <P> In "From Babylon to Nineveh" opening today at the Back Alley Theatre in Van  Nuys, Putnam Lee turns the Old Testament into a one-man show.  </P> <P> Sitting center stage with his guitar, Lee tells the audience about Adam and  Eve, Noah and the Ark, the Tower of Babel, Daniel in the lion's den and more --  all on a level that will appeal to youngsters age 2 and up.  </P> <P> The focus is on the literary and mythological aspects of the Bible rather than  the religious. Commissioned by the Back Alley, the show has no religious point  of view, presenting the stories in an entertaining way.  </P> <P> Lee, a former Christy Minstrel, runs a nursery school in Santa Barbara where he  has learned what makes kids listen -- and laugh. He includes plenty of audience  participation in the 50-minute show, teaching youngsters songs and even  inviting them on stage to do a few dance steps.  </P> <P> The stage is set with a huge tent and Lee encourages the youngsters on stage to  sing louder about the walls of Jericho, with surprising results.  </P> <P> Performances are scheduled for Saturdays and Sundays, today through Oct. 29, at  11 a.m. and 1 p.m. Tickets are $6.50. The theater is located at 15231 Burbank  Blvd. For reservations, call (818) 780-2240.  </P></p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Poverty trap with an exit: Is EU structural aid a black hole of funding from Brussels, or an effective way of raising incomes In the centre of Syntagma, or Constitution Square, in Athens there is a big black hole, emitting a 24-hour whine. It might work as a symbol for those among Greece's European Union partners who regard its economy as a hopeless case and its government's policy as little more than sustained pleading to maximise revenue from the EU budget. But the hole is, in fact, a main locus of the EU's most ambitious regional and structural aid plan, agreed at the 1992 Edinburgh summit. Overall, this plan has funds of Ecu156bn (Pounds 120.12bn) for 1994-99, more than double the Ecu64bn spent on regional policy in 1989-93. Its admirers claim this is, in real terms, more than twice the US-financed Marshall Plan which helped reconstruct post-war Europe. Syntagma itself is the hub of what will be the Athens metro - two 17.6km lines from north-to-south and east-to-west, to help turn the traffic-clogged and polluted Greek capital into a modern city. The permanent whine comes from the ventilator in the tunnels, which are progressing slowly towards the metro's completion in 1998, about a year behind schedule. It is the largest EU structural aid project and, with the completion of the Channel Tunnel, one of the biggest public works projects currently under way in Europe. The two lines are expected to cost Ecu2.4bn, and if additional branches are added later, another Ecu2bn will be needed. The EU provides 50 per cent of the finance as a grant, a further 40 per cent comes through long-term loans from the European Investment Bank, and the Greek government puts up the 10 per cent remnant. It is the grandest example of what the EU calls 'cohesion', transferring money through the Union budget from the rich heartland of Europe to the poor or run-down regions and the periphery, in an attempt to pull up their income to average EU levels and make them attractive to investors. At the Corfu summit of EU leaders on Friday and Saturday, hosted by the current Greek presidency of the Union, there will be a good deal of grumbling from the main net contributors to the EU budget - Germany, the UK, France and the Netherlands - about whether the redoubling of the 'cohesion' effort is worth it. The German finance minister Mr Theo Waigel has warned several times this year that Bonn, by far the EU's main paymaster, feels hard done by. In March, the UK foreign secretary Mr Douglas Hurd told a Brussels audience that some BFr300m a day went to Greece as part of 'very large flows' of EU resources, 'but there are too many reports of that money being wasted'. But is it? What is the quality of this spending, and does it, as intended, pull up the average per capita income of the poorer countries and regions? The only completely comparable figures for regional and national development within the 12 states measure per capita income growth, against an EU average of 100, between 1980 and 1991 - too early to register the full impact of the 1989-93 cohesion effort. Of the four poorest, or 'cohesion' countries, Spain saw average earnings per head rise from 71 to 80 per cent of the EU average; Ireland rose from 60 to 72 per cent; Portugal from 53 to 60 per cent; while Greece slipped back from 52 to 49 per cent. Such bald figures do not provide the answer, however. They incorporate Germany's eastern Lander for the first time, thereby raising everybody else's average. They mask regional slumps from the Lorraine to the Portuguese Alentejo. Most of all, there are no reliable figures which disaggregate how much of this growth might have occurred anyway. In Brussels, and in the governments in Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland, there is general assent that these countries have been able to modernise, particularly their road and railway infrastructure, much faster as a result of EU help. An examination of EU structural and regional spending in the poorer member states, particularly Greece and Spain, suggests some preliminary conclusions. The quality of Brussels spending, on projects and programmes, is generally high; The volume of spending, the Brussels revenue collection system, and the legal requirement that national and regional governments 'match' EU finance with their own funds in varying proportions, puts additional pressure on the budget deficits, not only of donor, but of recipient countries; A great deal of EU cohesion money flows back to donor countries, whose construction and engineering companies are best-placed to carry out funded projects. The EU aid is run from Brussels with parsimony and detail by the regional policy commissioner Mr Bruce Millan, the former UK Labour government's Scottish secretary. His DG16 directorate of about 240 is headed by a Spanish Basque, Mr Eneko Landaburu, one of the Commission's most highly regarded director-generals. These two have often been ruthless in witholding or transferring money from projects they regard as dubious or lacking rigour. One senior DG16 official says, in reference to southern Italy: 'My impression is that much of this money went to the Mafia', referring to the average Ecu13bn a year flowing to the Mezzogiorno in 1989-93, only 14 per cent of which, however, came from the EU. Brussels has withheld nearly Ecu3bn from southern Italy, apportioning some of it to projects elsewhere in the country that can be monitored regularly. Partly as a result, Rome now requires regions seeking national funding to comply with EU criteria on regional aid. Using outside auditors, DG16 says: 'We can generally ensure the big projects are clean.' The Commission's anti-fraud unit is, however, currently investigating a hydro-electric project in Lazio where there is a dam but no water. In Greece in 1989-93, Brussels withheld the bulk of finance earmarked for large projects, regarding them as inadequately thought through and badly managed. Scarcely 80km of motorway was built, for instance, because Brussels objected to the Greek practice of parcelling out small stretches to different companies, which regularly underbid to secure the contracts, and thereby often failed to complete the link with other stretches. The money was instead spread around smaller regional programmes, reducing internal income disparities, but not boosting Greece's economy relative to its partners. But a sea-change in Greek government attitudes in 1991 - which the current Socialist administration appears to endorse - has meant that a good deal of the 1994-99 money, worth about Ecu19bn to Greece, will go to projects such as the Athens metro and an Ecu2.5bn 550km gas pipeline being built from the Bulgarian border to Athens. The metro is the showcase for the change. Commission pressure for strengthened management brought in Bechtel, the US civil engineer, to set up the Attika Metro company, overseen by a six-strong board of Greek business figures. Bechtel has a contract for Ecu16.9m to manage the project. A 25-company consortium known as Olympic Metro, led by Siemens of Germany and Interinfra of France, is doing the building. Squabbling within the consortium, and recurring rich archaeological finds, are the main source of hold-ups, which the Bechtel team dismiss as insignificant in comparison to, say, the Channel Tunnel, or metros they have been involved in building from the US to Taipei. Mr Bill Stead, the Bechtel man put in as chief executive officer of Attika Metro, says: 'I've never received less public pressure, or as close to zero as you can get.' Lack of a similar integrated management structure has helped to hold up the half-built Greek gas pipeline, where the project manager, PLE, a subsidiary of Ruhr Gas, has been 'bolted on' to more dispersed contractors, rather than integrated on the Attika Metro model. Moreover, having contracted with Russia for the gas, Athens, in the Brussels view, has yet to decide fully what it will be used for. The Commission believes the project needs a low pressure network for domestic gas users to be viable, and is proceeding cautiously with fund disbursement. 'This could be the first (EU-funded) cathedral in the desert' if it does not get such a network, one senior Brussels official warns. While successful projects leave something of lasting value, there is little doubt contractors from donor countries get big shares of the business generated. On the Athens metro, non-Greek companies supply everything from the tunnel boring machines (designed by Mitsubishi and assembled by Framatome of France), to the rolling stock (Siemens, AEG and GEC/Alsthom), and the signals and communications systems (Siemens and Alsthom). The factory which makes concrete segments for the tunnels was assembled in France. Inside it, only the labour and the cranes are Greek. One senior Attika insider says German contractors supply even the wire mesh for the concrete segments, first 'setting the specifications to ensure the Greeks can't compete fairly'. The imported content of the total project is estimated by Attika to be 75 per cent. 'I would say that most of the D-marks go back,' one senior officer says. A Commission study shows that four out of every 10 Ecus for Portugal - which gets roughly the Ecu19bn Greece gets - flows back to donor member states. The EU flows strengthen recipient countries' capital accounts, but worsen their trade accounts and fiscal position because governments have to put up public money to qualify for the EU finance. In Spain, the biggest nominal recipient of about Ecu36bn in 1994-99, a senior Treasury official says that 'the synergy' of the cohesion idea, 'once translated into Spanish, means that we buy from Siemens'. Apart from the import content of the high-speed train (AVE) from Madrid to Seville, this is an exaggeration; Spanish construction companies are not only competitive at home, but currently involved in building the Toulouse metro. Spain's particular gripe is different. As column four of the table shows, the poor countries make above-average gross contributions to the EU budget, which is raised more from VAT receipts than on the basis of relative prosperity. Even though they are net winners after EU spending is distributed, gross outlays are made by the central government and much of the EU inflow returns to local authorities, leaving a hole in the central budget. 'This is a diabolical mechanism for our budget deficit,' the Madrid treasury official says, and obliges governments to keep public spending high. So far the EU has provided only about 10 per cent of Spanish infrastructure spending, rising to 15 per cent in 1994-99, but this official fears the EU flow could still induce spending on unnecessary projects. EU rules channel most funds towards the poorest areas, to try to iron out regional imbalances rather than reinforce relative comparative advantage in more developed areas such as Madrid, Valencia, Catalonia and the Basque Country. The Pta600bn Madrid-Seville AVE link - to which the EU contributed more than Ecu400m - fits in with this policy, even though starting with a link from the French frontier to Madrid, which Spain will largely have to fund itself, would appear more logical. The benefit of this and new road links to Spain's depressed south has yet to translate into significant investment, much less jobs. But as Mr Jose Borrell, Spain's minister of public works, says: 'You may not have industry in Andalusia and Extremadura, but you have the chance of putting some there; without roads and rail links you haven't' The link runs through Castilla-La Mancha, the land of Don Quixote, where Ciudad Real, a slumbering backwater now only 50 minutes instead of nearly three hours from Madrid, has become a dormitory town for the capital and alternative investment site for companies based there. 'It's been a sort of unexpected miracle,' says Mr Jose Bono, Socialist president of the regional government. In his office in Toledo - once the Emperor Charles V's bedroom - Mr Bono says EU funding amounting to 40 per cent of his budget is bringing the region into the 20th century. Roads, electricity and telephones, modern sewage plants and more rational irrigation, new schools and hospitals, have drawn in more private investment since Spain joined the EU in 1986 than in the previous half-century. He and other Spanish officials acknowledge that Spain might have grown faster by funding its more dynamic regions, but only at the cost of 'disarticulating' the country. 'That debate has been resolved for us by the European model,' Mr Bono says, with gratitude and feeling.</p>

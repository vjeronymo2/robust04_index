			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / 100-channel TV mooted: Digital broadcasting technology set to transform viewing THE UK could have as many as 100 television channels without the need for cable or satellite by using digital technology, the Independent Television Commission said yesterday. Such a large number would only be possible, however, if digital broadcasts from existing transmitters replaced the PAL broadcasts of the four television channels. PAL is the present analogue broadcasting system used in the UK. Introducing a discussion document on digital television yesterday, Mr Peter Rogers, ITC deputy chief executive, warned that a notice period of at least 10 years would be needed before existing PAL transmissions could be discontinued. 'Black boxes' would be needed to convert the digital signal and the commission accepts that it is unrealistic suddenly to tell viewers they will need a box if they want to continue watching. Because of the complexity of the issues, the commission favours a gradual introduction of digital technology with a combination of simulcast - the retransmission in digital form of the existing channels - plus new services. In some areas of the country, as many as 20 extra channels of television could be provided digitally over existing channels in addition to the four PAL channels - BBC1, BBC2, ITV and Channel 4. However, mainly because of congestion of PAL frequencies this would be much lower in some of the most lucrative television areas in the south and south-east. In some areas there would not be enough spare capacity to simulcast the four national channels in digital. 'It would be very difficult to go ahead without at least a European standard in place (for the black box),' Mr Rogers said yesterday. Yesterday's document states the enormous potential in digital technology for transforming television. The commission suggests that the move to terrestrial digital broadcasting could allow many more viewing options such as channels which concentrate on comedy in peak time, and others which concentrate on current affairs. Several channels could be devoted to a football match and viewers could choose which camera angle to watch from. Channels could be set aside for more regional news. The commission will publish a paper on the future of Channel 5 next month and digital use will be one of the options. The first full use of digital in Europe is likely to be by FilmNet, the satellite company broadcasting pay-television to the Benelux countries.</p>

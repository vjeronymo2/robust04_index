			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Construction Contracts: Newcastle office development The Gateshead office of WIMPEY CONSTRUCTION, part of George Wimpey, has clinched a Pounds 10m contract to build the Portland Towers office development in the centre of Newcastle for City and Northern Properties. Two thirds of the 81,000 sq ft complex has been pre-let to the Newcastle Building Society and will form the company's new European headquarters. Construction work, which is expected to take 15 months to complete, involves major refurbishment to a listed building on the site, as well as a large amount of new build. The fully air conditioned building will rise up to four storeys in height and provide extensive underground parking for the building's tenants. The Newcastle Building Society is expected to move into the new premises in December next year. Partners with Wimpey on the project are David Ash Partnership as architect, Tweeds as quantity surveyor and consulting engineer, Cundall Johnston and Partners.</p>

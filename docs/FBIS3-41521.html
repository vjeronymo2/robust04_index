			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 24 (XINHUA) -- In spite of progress  in environmental protection, China's environmental pollution  remains serious, a leading Chinese environmental official said  here today,    Zhang Kunmin, deputy chief of the State Bureau for  Environmental Protection (SBEP), said China has set up an  effective and efficient environmental protection administrative  system during the past decade or more while promoting its  economic development.    ``China's gross national product (GNP) has doubled during  the  past decades, but its environment has not deteriorated  accordingly, and in some areas environmental pollution has even  been reduced,'' the official said.    Speaking at an international symposium on the environmental  protection action plan, Zhang said that it still remains an  arduous task for China to create an ideal environment in the  coming years because of its huge and growing population and  rapidly expanding economy.    According to statistics, China's nearly 1.2 billion  population grows by 15 million each year on average, while its  cultivated land is shrinking at an average rate of 300,000 ha  [hectares] each year. The per capita share of the major  resources in China, such as fresh water, cultivated land,  forest, grassland and important mineral resources, is much lower  than the world's average.    Gao Guangsheng, an official from the State Planning  Commission, said that the total amount of standard fuel and  metal consumed each year by China will be twice as much as the  total consumed by the world in 1970 if China's economy continues  to grow rapidly in a traditional development pattern and China's  per capita GNP reaches 4,000 U.S. dollars by the mid-21st  century.    ``Obviously, the traditional development strategy is in no  way acceptable to China,'' said Gao.    He said that China has been paying close attention to the  experiences drawn by developed countries and mapped out a  strategy for sustainable economic and social development.    In response to the earth summit meeting in Brazil in 1992,  China has made up ``10 countermeasures on the environment and  development,'' ``China's Agenda 21,'' a strategy for China's  sustainable economic and social development in the coming  century, and ``China's Environmental Protection Action Plan'' in  the past two years.    ``China expects more cooperation with other countries and  international institutions in environmental protection since  China lacks expertise and investment in those regards,'' Zhang  said.    Also present at the seminar were about 60 environmental  experts or officials, including some from Britain, Germany,  Denmark, Canada and China, and some foreign diplomats in China.    The four-day seminar was jointly held by SBEP, the State  Planning Commission and the State Foreign Experts' Affairs  Bureau.</p>

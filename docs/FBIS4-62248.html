			<p>BFN     [Text] A capsule containing Cesium-137, a highly  radioactive substance, was stolen from the incineration workshop  of a facility in the Ukrainian city of Nikolayev about two days  ago, a correspondent for INTERFAX-Ukraine reports. Police have  so far failed to track down either the culprits or the capsule  which is believed to have been sawn up.    Spokesman for the Ukrainian security services Anatoliy  Sakhno  described the incident as very serious indeed.    Three of the plant employees have been sent for medical  treatment in Kharkov and Kiev following symptoms of exposure to  excessive radiation and about ten others are examined locally.    Unconfirmed reports speak of background radiation levels on  the plant's premises rising. It is believed that parts of the  capsule may have been thrown in the plant's water reservoir.</p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Swiss tranquillity disturbed by a quiet revolution AMONG European bond markets, few have escaped bouts of currency-related or politically inspired turbulence over the past year. However, unlike members of the European exchange rate mechanism, Switzerland's tranquillity has been disturbed by a quieter revolution taking place in the Swiss franc bond market. In recent months, the changes which have taken place in this corner of Europe - regulations governing the market and the issuance of larger, more liquid issues - appear to be creating a more enticing market for borrowers of a sovereign and supranational nature. At the same time, a change in the economic background has made make it more likely to encourage investors to buy bonds and for borrowers to launch longer-dated issues. A recent report by Ms Caroline Shah, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit rating agency, points out that the volume of bond issuance in the Swiss franc bond market has dwindled in recent years, as the market was 'hampered by slow liberalisation' and left behind as other countries liberalised their currency markets. According to figures provided by Euromoney Bondware, the volume of public and private Swiss franc bonds for foreign issuers declined from a total of SFr32.7bn in 1990, to SFr 29.9bn in 1991 and SFr27.8bn in 1992. Yet in the first six months of 1993, the volume of new issues has topped SFr18.5bn, suggesting the market could be set to exceed the previous year's volume. But as Ms Shah says, 'recent moves have begun to reverse that trend and . . . may pave the way for the development of a Swiss franc Euromarket'. She points out that the Swiss franc market may have benefited from the sporadic bursts of turbulence in the European exchange rate mechanism. The following four recent changes should help to lift the growth of the Swiss franc market: the abolition of stamp duty on the issue of Swiss franc bonds by non-Swiss issuers the abolition of stamp duty on inter-professional trading of foreign bonds, which had aggravated the illiquidity in the Swiss franc market the relaxing of syndication requirements, so that banks which are not domiciled in Switzerland are able to syndicate Swiss franc bonds issued by foreign borrowers new issue commissions and associated fees for borrowers have been reduced and are more evenly distributed. According to S&amp;P, the relaxation of the stamp duty on foreign issues should tempt more Swiss franc bond issues from foreign borrowers while the new syndication rules should help broaden the investor base outside Switzerland. Yet, the pace of change could be slow. A bond analyst at Pictet, the Swiss investment house, says: 'The liberalisations are bearing fruit . . . but it remains a small capital market with very few benchmark issues.' Some borrowers are taking note of the changing environment. Last month the Republic of Austria established the benchmark bond in the Swiss franc market with the launch of its SFr1bn bond due February 2000. The Kingdom of Sweden also tapped the market last month with a SFr500m 10-year issue, its first foray in this market since 1988. Austria's issue is particularly significant given that one of the most frequent complaints about the Swiss franc market is its poor liquidity. The market is dominated by Swiss retail investors who, once they have bought the bonds, tend to hold them to maturity. Small issues of about SFr100-SFr150m are placed and the liquidity dries up, forcing banks to quote wide bid-offer spreads thereafter. Mr Ruedi Zehnder, head of primary markets at Credit Suisse expects Swiss retail investor appetite for bonds to pick up now that inflation is coming down and short-term interest rates are declining. The Swiss bond yield curve has been inverse for the last three years, so while investors could obtain high returns on bank deposit accounts, there was less incentive to buy lower-yielding bonds. However, with the fall in short-term rates, the curve has flattened out, and that appears to be triggering investor interest in the longer end of the curve. Another positive factor according to one Swiss banker, is the likelihood that there will be some early redemptions of bonds with relatively high coupons this year, which should create investor demand for Swiss franc bonds. For borrowers, Swiss interest rates appear relatively low by European standards, and some borrowers have been able to take advantage of attractive swap rates. However, Mr Zehnder is less optimistic about the investor base: 'There is not a broad demand from outside Switzerland . . . we are changing but not as quickly as people thought we would change.'</p>

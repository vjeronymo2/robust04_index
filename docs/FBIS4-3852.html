			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 25 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton said today that he is pleased by the apparent holding of  ceasefire around Gorazde and urged the Bosnian warring parties  to resume peace talks.    "It appears that the pressure brought to bear by NATO and  the  U.N. is working, that the ceasefire is holding, the withdrawal  is continuing," Clinton said.    "I do want to say it's now clearly time to get the  diplomatic  initiative going again while we maintain our vigilance," he said.    Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is in  London for talks with British and French officials on the  Bosnian situation.    On Tuesday [26 April], Christopher will be meeting with  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev before going to the  Middle East.    Russian President Boris Yeltsin has proposed that Russia,  the  U.S., Europe and the U.N. convene a summit on Bosnia, but  Clinton said the idea was premature although "deserves serious  consideration."    "The United States won't be ready to move on a summit until  we have a better idea what the Serbs are up to," the ASSOCIATED  PRESS quoted an unnamed administration official as saying.</p>

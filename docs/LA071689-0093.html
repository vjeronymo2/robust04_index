			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BULGARIA TEEN-AGER USES UNDERCOVER PLOY TO JOIN EXODUS  </P> <P> A teen-ager hiding under a blanket in the trunk of a car was among 3,800 ethnic  Turks who arrived in Turkey from Bulgaria in the past 24 hours, Anatolian news  agency reported Saturday.  </P> <P> "If they'd caught me, I'd have been put in prison for the rest of my life,"  18-year-old Nihat Nurettinoglu told the agency after arriving in the trunk of  his sister's car.  </P> <P> Nurettinoglu said he had not been given a passport with the rest of his family  because he was eligible for military service. Turkey says many families in  similar situations in Bulgaria have left their young men behind.  </P> <P> The new arrivals, carrying as much luggage as they could over the  refugee-clogged border, brought to 146,000 the number of ethnic Turks who have  fled Bulgaria since early June, Turkish officials said.  </P> <P> The Turks say they are escaping from a five-year program of forced  assimilation, including compulsory name changes. Bulgaria says those going to  Turkey are tourists.  </P></p>

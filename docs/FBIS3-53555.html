At the beginning of the meeting, the House of  Representatives speaker welcomed the first deputy prime minister  and the cabinet members and delivered a valuable speech in which  he said: I would like to express my happiness and that of  people's deputies to welcome you at the beginning of this  meeting in the new year, which we hope will bring prosperity and  stability for our people who have suffered much as a result of  certain whims and desires and the placement of personal  interests over public ones.    Brothers: We in this House hoped that we would be able to go  ahead with our legislative and control duties within the  framework of the Constitution and the law, backed by everybody's  belief in the need to save the country from its difficulties and  problems. The problems have accumulated since the hateful eras  of division and the ensuing unnatural transitional period that  our people decided to end on 27 April 1993. They did this by  holding general elections that reflected the honesty of the  people and registered a wonderful achievement of cohesion among  the individuals of the society who took part in the elections.  It also silenced many tongues and refuted many speculations.    House of Representatives speaker brother Shaykh 'Abdallah  Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar added: The general elections experience in  our country produced a new political fact, which everybody had  to respect because the results of these elections represented  the will of the whole people for the first time in the history  of unified Yemen. But regrettably, some people have changed  their intentions, and their words now contradict their actions.  This forced the House to face some difficulties in carrying out  its constitutional duties. Yet, the House has played its  national role in preserving the people's interests and gains,  represented by unity, democracy, and political pluralism, and  also exerted its utmost effort to support the coalition  government to carry out its executive duties since it won the  House of Representatives' confidence in accordance with the  statement it submitted and in light of the House's comment on it.    It was natural for the coalition government to immediately  carry out the contents of its statement. As part of its special  duties, the House commented on the statement and drew up  timetables for it to be carried out. If we want to review the  government's commitments from the day it won confidence on 2  August 1993 through the rest of the year, we will not be able to  explain them all. However, we refer to the main duties:    1. Merging the Armed Forces and the Security Forces on  national bases.    2. Unifying all legislation and submitting draft laws to  the House.    3. Submitting a program for the financial, monetary, and  supply policy, in addition to a report on the economic and  financial situation of the state.    4. Presenting the draft general state budget for 1994 two  months before the beginning of the financial year.    5. Providing the required foreign currency to import  basic commodities.    All this was frozen and its execution delayed, whether with  goodwill or not, until the political crisis emerged to double  the tragedies and paralyze the various state departments.  Instead of containing the negative repercussions of the crisis  and limiting them by doubling its activity and encouraging more  efforts by all the state departments, the government pushed  matters in the opposite direction. This prompted the House of  Representatives in its meeting on 10 January 1994 to obligate  the government to return employees to their offices, including  the prime minister and the ministers; to continue the dialogue  within the coalition; and to take its time to carry out its  duties.    Concluding, House speaker brother Shaykh 'Abdallah  Bin-Husayn  al-Ahmar said that the House of Representatives, the guiding  authority of the government, deeply regrets the deteriorating  situation and the negligence the political crisis has produced  in various areas, especially the economic area in which prices  went up and in which the national currency deteriorated  seriously. This prompted the House to summon the government to  quickly discuss its statement and the House's comment on it. We  decided to hold discussions on the following areas:    1. The economic and financial area.    2. The security and military area.    3. The services area.    4. the administrative and legal area.    Afterward, brother Dr. Hasan Muhammad Makki, first deputy  prime minister, delivered the following speech:    Brother House of Representatives speaker, brother deputies:  May God's peace and blessings be upon you. It gives me and the  brother ministers pleasure to be with you in response to an  invitation which your esteemed House extended on 13 January 1994  and which set Monday, 17 January 1994, as a date for the  government's attendance to hold a general debate on the  government's policy statement and the House's reply to it in  order to learn about the extent and level of implementing this  statement.    To begin with I would like to express my deep appreciation  for your esteemed House for the effective and constructive role  it has played since the crisis began, and also for its full  eagerness to contain and stop the repercussions of the crisis in  order to safeguard the country's unity and stability. This is  so especially since your House is the first parliamentary  council to be elected through direct, free, and honest  elections, which were held in all Yemeni governorates on 27  April 1993. This House also came as an additional gain for our  people who achieved their unity on 22 May 1990 when the Republic  of Yemen was declared on a democratic basis. This basis is  established on political pluralism. Through this basis, our  people and homeland realized this historic achievement.    Brother House Speaker, brother deputies, we, as a coalition  government, highly appreciate the important role your esteemed  House has played in various legislative, constitutional, and  political aspects by devoting most of your recent sessions to  discussing the strangling political crisis the country is  passing through, and also by trying to heal the rift between the  parties to the coalition. Your invitation to the government  truly expresses the House's care, under these regrettable  circumstances, for the homeland's causes and concerns.    We regret the fact that not all ministers attended this  session, and that only two parties in the coalition attended it.  We were eager to respond to your invitation to attend this  session after the brother House speaker entrusted us with doing  so on 16 [as heard] January 1994 despite the absence of a  coalition party, including the brother prime minister, who is  preoccupied with political action and who left behind a host of  major tasks as head of government. This has completely crippled  the work of the government and all its departments and  facilities. Moreover, difficulties were created that prevented  the government from carrying out its role and fulfilling its  commitments regarding the implementation of its policy  statement, which was submitted to your esteemed House, and your  comment on this statement, according to which the government won  confidence. In addition, these difficulties impeded the  constitutional tasks assigned to the government.    The continued absence of a party to the coalition government  has prevented the government from accomplishing its plans and  programs. Perhaps the most important matter was the government's  inability to submit the 1994 state's general budget draft law on  the constitutional date. During the 1993 fiscal year, the  government had to work according to the 1992 budget and decided  not to work out (?any) development or services projects.  Moreover, we could not submit annual reports on the  government's achievements.    Brother Speaker, brother Deputies: We in the government  wished to submit to your esteemed House the replies to the  overall questions and queries that the deputies addressed to the  government. However, the absence of the brother prime minister  and several ministers has prevented this. Realizing this, some  urgent measures and arrangements were taken to handle the  economic situation in a way that would stop the continued  deterioration in the exchange rate and provide the basic  commodities, which would stabilize the homeland through an  expanded meeting comprising officials of the finance and supply  and trade ministries, the central bank, the commercial banks  operating in the country, and the federation of the chambers of  commerce and industry.    Concluding his speech, Makki said: We affirm our full  readiness to reply to the queries submitted to us. We hope that  we will be given another opportunity to prepare thorough reports  on the government's various activities and replies to your  queries.    Afterward, the deputies unanimously agreed to postpone the  general debate on the government's policy statement and the  House's comment on it to a coming session, which would be  attended by Prime Minister brother Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr  al-'Attas and all ministers.    After the brother first deputy prime minister and ministers  left the House's hall, the deputies discussed the issue of  voting on Presidential Decree No. 23 of 1992 on the salaries and  retirement allowances for the Armed Forces and security forces.  The House decided to make a final vote in the coming session.  It also decided to hold a special session to discuss its  internal affairs and situation. The House will resume work  tomorrow, Tuesday, morning, God willing.</p>

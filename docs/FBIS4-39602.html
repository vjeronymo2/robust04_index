			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary under the "Quotation" rubric] </F>   [Text] "... The former Supreme Soviet made a similar  decision three years after the elections and died there and  then. This is a sure road to death. Let the Duma set up its  own channel. I will not be taking part in this...."    Aleksandr Yakovlev, head of the federal television and radio  service, said this apropos of the well-known decision by the  Duma to "flush" its debates and decrees through television  channels.    Many politicians and journalists have since spoken in the  same vein. But the Duma, despite the ominous precedent, seems  to be bent on going whole hog. Freedom is for the free, as they  say. Why is it, then, that the majority of the Duma should be  taking chances so recklessly? Most probably because past  illusions die hard. Too many politicians are still under the  impression that television is a magic wand. That if you own it,  you just have to whisper to it: Make me a deputy for another  term, and your wish will be granted.    The "next term" is also the imminent presidential elections  -- that's what eggs on the deputies to accost television. It is  the experience of the Supreme Soviet that urges them to make  haste. The disaster that hit the previous parliament can also  be explained not by the fact that the then deputies created  docile television three years after the elections, but that they  did not create it three months after them.    In this case, though, the current deputies from various  factions do not realize one thing: That doing so would win only  one deputy, and only one faction -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and  the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia].    The precedent is too fresh in our memory. As far as the LDPR  leader is concerned, television is not an improved version of  the megaphone, but really and truly a magic wand. This is what  his friends-rivals have handed to Mr. Zhirinovskiy.</p>

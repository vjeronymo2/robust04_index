			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 13 OF GM MODELS FOR 1990 TO GET AIR BAGS  </P> <P> Driver-side air bags will be standard in 13 models of General Motors Corp.'s  1990 cars, costing the auto maker at least $500 per car, the company's  president said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Robert Stempel refused to disclose what the device would cost consumers, but  said the company has spent nearly $1 billion in research, design, development  and labor costs.  </P> <P> The cost per car could drop if consumers want the air bags on more models.  </P> <P> The federal government requires all cars made in the United States after Sept.  1 to have a passive restraint system for front-seat riders. That could involve  air bags or automatic seat belts.  </P> <P> An exemption in the law allows auto makers who put air bags on the driver's  side to equip the passenger's side with a manual lap-and-shoulder belt system  until Sept. 1, 1993.  </P> <P> The company said about 500,000 1990 cars, or less than 15% of GM's car fleet,  would have the systems as standard equipment. Included are:  </P> <P> * Buick Reatta and Riviera.  </P> <P> * Cadillac Allante, DeVille, Eldorado, Fleetwood and Seville.  </P> <P> * Chevrolet Camaro and Corvette.  </P> <P> * Geo Metro Convertible, later in the model year, and Storm.  </P> <P> * Oldsmobile Toronado.  </P> <P> * Pontiac Firebird.  </P> <P> All other GM cars will have automatic seat belts for front-seat passengers.  </P> <P> All of Chrysler Corp.'s U.S.-made cars for the 1990 model year will have  driver-side air bags and manual lap-shoulder belts as standard equipment. The  U.S.-made cars compose 90% of Chrysler's automobile fleet.  </P> <P> Ford Motor Co. has said that about 1 million of its 1990 model cars, or about  half of its car fleet, will have driver-side air bags.  </P> <P> Auto industry observers expect higher prices for 1990 cars, partly because of  the passive-restraint law.  </P></p>

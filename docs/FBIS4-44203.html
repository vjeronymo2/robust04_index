			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Patrick de Saint-Exupery: "Rwanda: France Let </F> Down by Africa"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Despite the many arguments  invoked by the Elysee [office of the president], it is now  obvious that the policy pursued by the highest state bodies from  1990 to the beginning of 1993 has resulted in complete failure.  This failure was not intended (it is difficult to accuse the  head of state of being "guilty of association with criminals,"  as Jean Carbonara, joint author of a damning report on the  Rwandan "death squads," did), but it bears witness to the  failure of a "particular" African policy.    To understand this clearly, it is necessary to go back to  1990. Africa was then part of the head of state's "preserve."  In the Elysee, an "Africa group" advises and guides Francois  Mitterrand's decisions. Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, his  father's son, headed that body, which virtually has  decisionmaking power without any outside control. He was helped  by Gilles Vidal.    Jean-Christophe Mitterrand scarcely has any diplomatic  experience. A former AFP journalist in Lome, he was appointed  almost by "imperial fiat." There is no dispute about that.  Many "scandals" were to characterize the term which  Jean-Christophe Mitterrand and Gilles Vidal spent at the head of  the presidency's Africa group. The most recent ones took place  in the Ivory Coast (speculation in cocoa and coffee) and in  Liberia (games of influence and money with the mineral resources  of that country ravaged by war).    When war broke out in Rwanda in 1990, Jean-Christophe  Mitterrand and Gilles Vidal obviously had ringside seats. The  Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry], disqualified by the presidency,  does not have any African policy. The presidency immediately  reacted to the "invasion" of the rebels: the RPF [Rwandan  Patriotic Front] soldiers who came from Uganda were presented as  the "Khmers Rouges" of Africa. Paris had clearly designated an  "enemy," a word regularly heard at the time in military and  diplomatic circles. On the basis of this position of principle,  Paris sided with the Rwandan Government led by President Juvenal  Habyarimana. Not without arguments, but unconditionally. The  French soldiers, sent in October 1990 to bring out the foreign  nationals, remained there while the Belgian soldiers, once the  operation was over, returned home. In the name of defense  agreements signed between the two states, Paris provided  logistical support and instructors for the Rwandan Army.    No dialogue was opened with the rebels: Are they not  France's "enemies?" "The Fachoda [place in Upper Volta which  was ceded to the British in 1899] complex, the view of French  speakers against English speakers, the statements about the RPF  -- the Khmers Noirs of Africa, our enemies... That is all  true!" a very highly placed source now admits.    In January 1991, in other words, after four months of  uninterrupted French military presence in Rwanda, President  Francois Mitterrand sent a letter to the Rwandan head of state.  Dated 30 January 1991, this letter provides a framework for the  French doctrine. Declaring himself to be "profoundly disturbed  by the harmful consequences which the continuation of  destabilizing military action could have for peace in the  region," Francois Mitterrand stated that this "conflict can only  find a lasting solution through a negotiated settlement and  general cooperation." He put forward three conditions and added,  for President Habyarimana's benefit: "In light of the  difficulties being experienced by your country, I would like to  assure you once again of France's support."  <H5>  Arms Supplies </H5>   Things are clear: Francois Mitterrand talks of "support." A  very highly placed source admits that the first arms supplies  then started: "In 1991, France supplied the Rwandan state with  7 million francs [Fr] worth of military equipment. In 1992, we  supplied the equivalent of Fr14 million worth. In 1993, Fr7  million worth." In other words arms worth a total of Fr28  million. The latest supplies date back to February 1993. "It  is true that in February 1992, we supplied a large amount," this  official, who has access to all the documents, admitted.    Jean-Christophe Mitterrand did not remain inactive. He made  many trips to the region: "He tried," it is now being said, "to  establish contact with the RPF." The initial line of support  for the Rwandan Government, hastily established, was  strengthened as time went by. The French soldiers who remained  on the spot were also affected by this increasingly hostile  attitude toward the RPF: "The military," it is admitted, "made  Rwanda a personal cause."    This is understandable: Sent by the political authorities in  the framework of a support mission for an army, the French  soldiers, by dint of their proximity to the Rwandan Army and the  fact that they were training it, eventually established friendly  relations. More seriously: French diplomacy, largely informed  by the military, bowed to them and repeated what they said  without any reservations: For instance, one diplomat abroad  stated in 1992 that the massacres allegedly perpetrated by the  government militias were mere "rumors."    In August 1991, the first contacts were established between  the Elysee and the RPF. It had taken 11 months. In July 1992,  real talks started. But the French parliamentary elections were  approaching, and defeat was looming: It was necessary to  protect the rear. Jean-Christophe Mitterrand left the Elysee's  Africa group. He was "appointed" to an important position in a  big French company and regularly visits Africa. Gilles Vidal,  his deputy, was appointed ambassador to Cameroon, to the great  displeasure of "career" diplomats.    The new heads of the Elysee Africa group -- Bruno Delaye and  Dominique Pin -- took over the issue in July 1992. The policy  originally decided was continued. Even now, in its official  chronology, the Elysee, referring to the RPF, talks of  "inkotanyi," in other words, "cockroaches" in Kynyarwanda.  However, slight but important changes were made by the new  team. Witness the letter sent on 28 August 1993 by RPF  President Alexis Kanyarengwe to Francois Mitterrand: The RPF,  the rebel leader writes, "thanks" France for the "role of  observer it has played during our negotiations." As proof that  it was a reconciliation, the RPF president took the precaution  of adding: "France and the RPF have not always shared the same  viewpoint with regard to the French Government's position on  this conflict." That is an understatement.    Especially because mistakes were building up. At the  beginning of 1993, the International Human Rights Federation  published a damning inquiry report on the Rwandan regime. The  leaders of the death squads in the pay of the regime were named,  and it spoke of the first signs of a genocide. The Rwandan head  of state was criticized by name. The report reached the Elysee.  However, the authorities took no account of it.    In fall 1993, Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana was  received in Paris by Francois Mitterrand. It was an official  visit with a red carpet and guard of honor. Did Francois  Mitterrand then discuss the problems raised by the report on the  death squads published at the beginning of that same year of  1993? "Yes," the Elysee now says. One official relates: "The  president said to the Rwandan head of state: `Iniquities,  unacceptable things have come to my attention. I know that you  are heading a country at war but...' The Rwandan president then  replied to Francois Mitterrand: `Yes, I know about this, but I  am not responsible. There are extremists. I have called for  investigations. Those guilty of iniquities will be prosecuted  before the courts."  <H5>  Franco-African Family </H5>   No condemnation was ever pronounced by a Rwandan court. At a  meeting in Kigali six months ago, Mr. Nkubitu, the capital's  public prosecutor, said: "The tragedy in this country is that  everybody knows who is guilty and no official has ever been  brought before the courts. In our country, there is no  justice." Last April, at the start of the "genocide," Mr.  Nkubitu was able to flee Kigali in incredible circumstances: He  hid in a sack of potatoes. He is now living in exile in Belgium.    It is the presidency which provided a final document for the  file: a letter sent by Francois Mitterrand to U.S. President  Bill Clinton on 27 September. Reaffirming the importance of  implementing the Arusha agreements, Francois Mitterrand urged  Bill Clinton to intervene to ensure that a UN force was finally  deployed in Rwanda: The international community must react  rapidly or the terms of the agreement, Francois Mitterrand  writes, "are likely to be violated."    "When I took office," a top official now admits, "I wondered  about the French presence in Rwanda. It was explained to me  that Burundi and Rwanda had joined the `Franco-African family.'  They should not be abandoned."</p>

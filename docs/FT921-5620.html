			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Environment pledge by Heseltine BRITAIN is prepared to speed up its programme to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, provided other countries do likewise, Mr Michael Heseltine, UK environment secretary, said in New York last night. Addressing the international preparatory conference for the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June, he said the UK was prepared to give more to the Global Environment Facility, run by the World Bank, to help developing countries tackle their environmental problems. In the past year Britain has given it Pounds 40m. Mr Heseltine announced that Britain was considering stabilising carbon dioxide at 1990 levels earlier than its existing target year of 2005. Carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas which contributes to global warming. The European Community target is to stabilise these emissions by the year 2000 and Britain has been criticised as the only member country to have a later target date. Mr Heseltine's undertaking was conditional on non-EC countries speeding up their efforts. In particular, he wants the US to set national targets for greenhouse gas emissions. Michael Littlejohns, UN correspondent, adds: Mr Heseltine later took issue with an estimate by Mr Maurice Strong, conference secretary general, that developing countries needed at least Dollars 125bn a year in foreign aid - Dollars 55bn above the present level - to carry out environment programmes. Calling this unrealistic, Mr Heseltine said: 'I would not dream of providing a figure of that sort at this stage of the negotiations.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vadim Gorshenin under "Version" rubric: </F> "Barkashov Meets With Military Prosecutor's Office"]    [Text] What was their conversation about? -- some analysts  are now trying to answer this question. The point is that,  according to one of the numerous versions associated with the  name of Aleksandr Barkashov, the investigation into the  participation of Russian National Unity's leader and his  subordinates in the events of bloody October 93 has been ended.  The "Barkashovites'" departure from the House of Soviets  building before the start of combat operations is being advanced  as an argument.    Another question arises in this connection: Was the clash in  which Barkashov was seriously wounded not the consequence of his  initiation into certain details concerning the shooting up of  the parliament building? According to information received by  the editorial office the Russian National Unity leader was  wounded in the back by automatic fire from a VAZ-2108 vehicle.  And... -- a new detail emerges here -- ...it was his friends  who picked him up, not a passing vehicle at all. As has been  stated, it was they who took him to the hospital, giving a false  name in the interests of personal security, because they feared  not the official authorities but the same people who had  instigated the shooting. In this context the information that  Barkashov's supporters themselves appealed to the Internal  Affairs organs 29 December, requesting that protection for their  leader be organized, looks quite plausible. According to the  same version the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] did take  such measures and transferred Barkashov to its own departmental  hospital.    Various high-ranking officials in the MVD and General  Prosecutor's Office refused to confirm or deny this version.  Nevertheless, it is contradicted by information that the Russian  National Unity Council has made a statement accusing militia  organs of making an attempt on Barkashov's life and warning that  it reserves the right to carry out its own investigation and  take adequate measures to protect its leader, with all that that  entails.    At the same time we have learned that yesterday the Military  Prosecutor's Office sent its investigators to the same MVD  hospital where Barkashov is staying and began investigative  activities.</p>

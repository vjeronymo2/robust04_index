			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> JACK KENT COOKE HAS IDEAS ON RESTRUCTURING THE NFL  </P> <P> Jack Kent Cooke, the owner of the Washington Redskins, has proposed a broad  restructuring of the National Football League, his son, John Cooke, said  Friday.  </P> <P> "This is the only worthwhile thing that's going to come out of this. We're  going to redo the league," John Cooke said Friday after Washington lawyer Paul  Tagliabue was elected commissioner Thursday even though the Cookes favored Jim  Finks, the general manager of the New Orleans Saints.  </P> <P> When the first search committee was formed last March after Pete Rozelle had  announced he was retiring, each club was asked for a recommendation on how the  league should be structured.  </P> <P> Cooke said his father wrote a letter to the committee recommending that no  owner be allowed to be the chairman of more than one committee.  </P> <P> He also recommended that the members serve fixed terms on the committee and be  rotated and that it be mandatory that each owner serve on committees.  </P> <P> "If a guy says I don't want to do it, he shouldn't have any choice," John Cooke  said.  </P> <P> Cooke said he and his father would make the same recommendations to the  consulting company of Booz, Allen, Hamilton Inc. when they meet with members of  the company next month.  </P> <P> The company has been commissioned to present a report on the restructuring of  the league when the owners meet in Orlando, Fla., next March.  </P> <P> John Cooke said another result could be that the Management Council, which has  overseen negotiations with the NFL Players Association for the last decade,  will be disbanded.  </P> <P> "We may not have a Management Council. We may give back more power to the  commissioner. I think we should be involved more in labor negotiations.  Obviously, we've got to have some kind of committee (for negotiations), but it  should go back to the commissioner's office for him to oversee," he said.  </P> <P> Cooke said his father's recommendations were designed to meet the concerns of  the new guard owners who blocked Finks' election because they felt they didn't  have enough input in the league.  </P> <P> "They guys were alienated and they became frustrated," he said.  </P> <P> John Cooke, though, felt Finks was the better candidate for an era of  transition because Tagliabue has been advising Rozelle the last two decades.  </P> <P> When Cooke was asked if he voted for Finks on the last ballot even after  Wellington Mara of the New York Giants and Art Modell of the Cleveland Browns  had agreed to switch to Tagliabue, he answered by not answering.  </P> <P> "There's no secret that I thought that of the two men, the most qualified at  this time in history was Jim Finks," John Cooke said.  </P> <P> Neither Cooke has ever felt part of the inner circle in the past, and John said  it's a good idea to get more owners involved in league operations.  </P> <P> "Sometimes we agreed with the clique and sometimes we didn't," he said, "but  we'll never be part of a bloc. We're independent and I'm saying to you that we  should all be independent."  </P> <P> In the Rozelle era, the key was consensus. Cooke feels it's more important to  have each team voting its view.  </P> <P> "I don't care about consensus," he said. "All I care about is the vote."  </P> <P> He said the owners can do a better job of voting if they're more informed by  being on committees. "It's best for the league over the long haul."  </P> <P> Cooke served on a committee for the first time when he was named to the second  search committee in July.  </P> <P> Dan Rooney, the president of the Pittsburgh Steelers and a longtime member of  the inner circle, said the strife over the election of a commissioner may turn  out to be positive because it gave all the clubs a chance to express  themselves.  </P> <P> "The old guard better realize that they have to talk to everyone," Rozelle  said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Tagliabue said in a conference call with writers around the country  Friday that he had talked with Rozelle and that they decided Rozelle would  resign next Saturday.  </P> <P> On Nov. 5, Tagliabue said he "will be functioning as commissioner."  </P> <P> When Tagliabue was asked about changes in the structure, he said he wouldn't  make any major changes the rest of this season and would wait until he gets the  consultant's report before planning any steps.  </P> <P> Tagliabue said his phone had been ringing off the hook and that one of the  calls came from former President Reagan in Tokyo.  </P> <P> The former president congratulated him and asked him to pass on his compliments  to Rozelle for a job well done the last three decades.  </P> <P> Tagliabue also said that Reagan stressed he was a two-way football player and  maybe they should bring back two-way players.  </P> <P> "That may have been his way of talking about situation substitution," Tagliabue  said, and then, "he said at some point to make sure to 'Win One for the  Gipper.' "  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikkov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 13 TASS -- The Russian State Duma adopted  on Friday, on the first reading, a law which would end in  Russia's unilateral lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia.    "In connection with the unilateral use of international  sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council against Yugoslavia,  the absence of a reliable international legal mechanism of  controlling their implementation (the Duma ruled) to suspend the  participation of the Russian Federation in carrying out  international sanctions against the union republic of  Yugoslavia", the key article of the law says.    The lower house of the Russian parliament recommended all  government agencies and enterprises to fully restore economic,  political, diplomatic and cultural relations with Serbia and  Montenegro which were disrupted by the sanctions.    The law is yet to be discussed on the second reading, but  the  Duma had already recommended the president, the government and  the Foreign Ministry to "immediately undertake energetic and  persistent efforts in the UN framework aimed at lifting  sanctions against the union republic of Yugoslavia up to a  unilateral refusal to implement the sanctions".    Besides, Russian representative at the UN was instructed to  raise the issue of imposing sanctions against those conflicting  parties in former Yugoslavia who reject an immediate ceasefire  and an unconditional beginning of talks.    "In case of unilateral lifting of the embargo on arms  deliveries to Bosnia, Russia should resort to adequate actions  up to raising the issue of a unilateral withdrawal from the  regime of sanctions", according to the document.    The Duma believes there is currently a real possibility for  ensuring peace in former Yugoslavia and called on all warring  parties to "immediately cease all combat activities and begin  talks on ensuring peace". The chamber said it is ready to  promote dialogue between the parties.    The lower house also addressed parliamentarians of the world  to refrain from decisions "capable of destabilising the  situation in former Yugoslavia", and mostly from those which can  result in shipments of weapons to a warring side.    It also proposed to the states bordering on former  Yugoslavia  to hold an international conference on overcoming the Balkan  crisis with the UN and CSCE participation.</p>

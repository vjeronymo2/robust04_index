Sobolev (Teploelektroproekt, </F> Moscow) and Candidate of Technical Sciences G.G. Karpov  (Rostovteploelektroproekt)]    [Abstract] Scientific research and design planning work  aimed at development of seismically stable thermal power plants  and electric power networks is conducted by Teploelektroproekt  in cooperation with VNIIG imeni B.Ye. Vedeneyev,  Rostovteploelektroproekt and Energosetproekt. The first draft of  additional requirements to the design of TPPs [thermal power  plants] located in seismic areas has been developed. The work  was necessitated by a substantial increase in the frequency of  seismic activity in earthquake prone regions of the country  where thermal power plants operate, are being built or scheduled  for construction. Analysis of the effect of the 1988 Spitak  earthquake on power generating facilities corroborated the need  for this work. Causes of earthquake caused damage to power  plants were determined, and specific ways to improve seismic  stability of their buildings and facilities have been outlined.  Foreign experience was also taken into account. The additional  requirements have been substantiated. At present a TPP is  considered seismically stable if it remains ecologically and  technologically safe in a maximum rated earthquake (MRE) with a  once in a 1000 years probability and provides uninterrupted  supply of electric power and heat after a design earthquake (DE)  with a once in a 100 years probability. Because TPP buildings  and facilities have different functions, a differentiated  approach to designing them for seismic stability is used.  However, it is suggested that it is more expedient to design all  TPP buildings, facilities and equipment for the same level of  seismic action with the frequency of once every 100 years. Based  on the analysis and results of the work 13 additional  requirements are presented.</p>

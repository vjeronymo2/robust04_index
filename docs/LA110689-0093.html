			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIRING A CONSULTANT: BEGIN AT THE BANK  </P> <P> If you are interested in hiring an environmental consultant, it may be wise to  heed the advice of Joel Moskowitz, author of "Environmental Liability and Real  Property Transactions," published in May.  </P> <P> Moskowitz recently characterized the mushrooming industry in real estate  environmental assessments as "akin to the Gold Rush, in the same way that all  the miners who were attracted to California were not necessarily the world's  best miners."  </P> <P> No license or certification is required at present to hang out a shingle as a  consultant. But many banks keep lists of consultants with whom they are  familiar. And the California Office of Environmental Affairs has established a  registry of consultants who meet the following standards:  </P> <P> * Five years' experience in their general field of expertise.  </P> <P> * Two years, within the past four years, doing environmental assessments.  </P> <P> * A bachelor's degree or higher in a physical or biological science,  engineering or law.  </P> <P> * Three personal references for competence and character.  </P> <P> Most people familiar with the field recommend looking for specialists; if  you're worried about water, find a consultant with extensive experience  assessing potential water problems. In this growing industry, experience can  count more than a diploma on the wall. Sound environmental assessments may be  made by engineers, attorneys managing subcontractors or consultants with fairly  wide-ranging backgrounds.  </P> <P> Moskowitz counsels buyers to first ask their lending bank for recommended  consultants, since in many cases the bank will want approval of the consultant  anyway.  </P> <P> Otherwise, Moskowitz, an attorney, has set up many environmental assessments  for clients and recommends going through a lawyer to help keep such studies  confidential. A client who contracts directly with a consulting firm, he notes,  may later find a government agency asking to see the results. Work done through  an attorney is protected by attorney-client privilege, says Moskowitz.  </P> <P> If the client wants to work without a lawyer in the middle, Moskowitz  recommends going to a larger, established firm. It will likely cost more than a  smaller consultant, but experience and quality control are less likely to be a  problem, he contends.  </P> <P> And what happens if the consultant misses an environmental hazard?  </P> <P> The potential liability is so high that many consultants draw up contracts that  limit their liability to a client. In some cases, these contracts even ask  clients to indemnify the consultant against any possible liability for working  up their site assessments.  </P></p>

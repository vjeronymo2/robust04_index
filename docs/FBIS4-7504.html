			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Nevenka Marcic] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, March 31 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslems have  launched a new offensive, "spring '94", from the Moslem enclave  of Gorazde, one of the U.N.-protected "Safe Areas" in  Bosnia-Herzegovina which should have been demilitarized last  spring, Bosnian Serb military sources said on Thursday.    According to the same sources, around 10,000 Moslem fanatics  are engaged in the five-pronged offensive launched on Tuesday in  the directions of Cajnice, Rudo and Visegrad, the Bosnian Serb  towns on the border with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and  of Grebak and Trnovo, stops on route to Mt. Igman overlooking  Sarajevo.    The offensive's objective is for the Bosnian Moslems to link  up with the Moslems in the Raska (Sandzak) region in the [word  indistinct] and have the war spread to Yugoslavia, i.e. its  republics of Serbia and Montenegro, and to link up the Gorazde  troops with those on Mt. Igman and in Zepa and Srebrenica, also  "Safe Areas" in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to  information available to the Bosnian Serb army.    Bosnian Serb military sources set out that, since Bosnian  Serb troops are deployed around Gorazde, the town could have  been supplied with arms and ammunition only by NATO aircraft as  part of the U.S. operation of air dropping relief aid to  Bosnian Moslems.    The city of Sarajevo and the Moslem enclaves of Srebrenica,  Zepa, Gorazde, Tuzla, and Bihac were proclaimed U.N.-protected  "Safe Areas" under U.N. Security Council Resolution 824 in May  1993.    The resolution called for the U.N. peacekeepers to  demilitarize the "Safe Areas." However, not only have the U.N.  troops failed to act accordingly but they have even failed to  take any steps to prevent Moslems from using "Safe Areas" for  military purposes.    U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, himself, said in  a report to the Security Council in mid-March that Moslems were  using "Safe Areas" to train, equip and give a rest to their  troops, and to open fire at Serb positions in the hope of  provoking Serb retaliation.    The U.N. secretary-general urged that the concept of the  U.N. protected "Safe Areas," in which he said crime and  prostitution were rampant, be redefined so that "Safe Areas"  could not be used by Moslems to gain "tactical military  advantage."    However, the U.N. Security Council has failed to take a  stand on the Butrus-Ghali request, just as it has failed to act  in the case of similar reports and warnings from the Bosnian  Serbs.    The Bosnian Serb leadership has many times drawn attention  to  the fact that Moslem military provocations, in particular from  Srebrenica and Gorazde, are aimed at forcing Serbs to launch  military operations against U.N.-protected "Safe Areas" and,  thereby, securing a foreign military intervention.    The warnings from the Bosnian Serbs did not reach the  Western  public because Western media have been waging a pro-Moslem i.e.  anti-Serb propaganda campaign since the outbreak of the war two  years ago.    Therefore, it would not be surprising at all if the latest  Moslem offensive, launched from the U.N.-protected "Safe Area"  of Gorazde, was to be disregarded and the Serbs were instead to  be accused of attacking the town.</p>

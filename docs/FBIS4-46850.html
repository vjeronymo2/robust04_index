			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. Morozov, Tynda: "Rails to Yakutsk"] </F>   [Text] The administration of the BAM [Baiykal-Amur  Mainline] held a conference which was participated in by D.  Trofimov, Minister for AYaM Affairs [Amur-Yakutsk Mainline] in  the government of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia). They discussed  questions of organizing the Yakutsk Department of the BAM.    A new department is going to appear on the BAM. At first it  will be a section between Bestuzhevo and Neryungri. Later on it  will have spur tracks added to it and, of course, sections of  the AYaM, in particular the Neryungri-Aldan section.    Where is the department itself to be located? Without a lot  of debate, the Yakutsk delegation decided in favor of Berkakit  instead of the original intention to locate it in Neryungri,  which already has a fairly well developed production and social  infrastructure.    True, economic problems of the Berkakit hub are taking on  new  coloration. Because of the chronic shortage of funds, the hub  has yet to reach its projected size, and when the department is  created, urgent tasks will arise, including construction of a  communications facility, the main locomotive depot, railcar  facilities, and servicing facilities at the Neryungri Passenger  Station. Housing will also be needed. Finally, for two years now  the Berkakit station's industrial zone has lacked a reliable  source of heat--a scaffold bridge needs to be built, but there  are no funds; they have all been channeled into the completion  of housing.    Participants stated that if we want to get a fully-fledged,  effectively operating department we need to open a commercial  station at Aldan, which means that a whole complex of work will  have to be done on the right-of-way, in particular track work  and, in addition, work on a permanent communications link, a  power line and substations, not counting other infrastructure  facilities.    Having decided to create the Yakutsk Department of the  Railroad, participants had apparently set their priorities in  the organization of the work of the construction units on the  right-of-way. But how are the financial problems to be solved?    There were no specific answers to this question. But, first  of all, Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin has signed a decree  affirming the status of the socioeconomic development program of  the Sakha Republic (Yakutia), in which the construction of the  AYaM is given high priority. A special account has been opened  in Yakutia to accumulate funds coming in from export and import  duties (Russia's share in the completion of the AYaM). Second,  measures have been taken to pay off debts to the construction  workers. According to present data, the debt on the Berkakit hub  has been reduced from 4.8 to 2.8 billion rubles, and on the main  Berkakit-Tommot section it has been liquidated altogether.    Finally, the government of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia)  intends to allocate 80 billion rubles this year to complete the  AYaM; moreover, Switzerland and Austria will be taking part in  the financing for the first time.    But many problems still remain to be solved. We would like  to  know the amount of contributions for the development of the  Berkakit hub (according to our information, they range between  18 and six [as printed] billion rubles), also when the account  can be used. Summer is short in the North, and if you let it  slip by, many problems will remain unsolved. This places many  obligations on the clients.    There are two clients, as we know. Participants in the  conference once more affirmed the "division of spheres of  influence" between the board of directors of the BAM project  (responsible for the Berkakit hub) and the general board of the  AYaM project (responsible for the main section of the road).  There has not been any talk of a third client, although it is  known that the Amur-Yakutsk Railroad Joint Stock Company is  going to be one.    As for the first two, participants in the conference decided  to set up a coordination center staffed by the chief engineers  of the services of the BAM administration. The center's task is  to inspect construction projects regularly and issue the  appropriate recommendations, which the General Board for the  AYaM project pledges to carry out. It is a complex system, of  course, but what can you do when the government of the Sakha  Republic has decided to keep the construction of the new  railroad in its own hands.    It can be said that the organizational structure of the  administration of the project has been decided. Optimists see  this as a good sign, while pessimists are inclined to refrain  from rejoicing--they know that the fairytale is finished  quickly, but not the job. In the case of the AYaM, so far there  is no reason to doubt the truth of that maxim.</p>

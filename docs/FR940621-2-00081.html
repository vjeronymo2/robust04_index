The organization creating and maintaining the index must be (1) engaged in the business of providing financial information, evaluation, advice or securities brokerage services to institutional clients, (2) a publisher of financial news or information, or (3) a public stock exchange or association of securities dealers. The index must be created and maintained by an organization independent of Bank of America and its affiliates. The index must be a generally accepted standardized index of securities which is not specifically tailored for the use of Bank of America or its affiliates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The price for the stock is set at the closing price for that stock on the day of trading; unless the stock was added to or deleted from an index underlying a Fund (or Funds) after the close of trading, in which case the price will be the opening price for that stock on the next business day after the announcement of the addition or deletion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The transaction takes place within three business days of the ``triggering event'' giving rise to the cross-trade opportunity. A triggering event is defined as:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A change in the composition or weighting of the index and/or model underlying a Fund;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A change in the overall level of investment in a Fund as a result of investments and withdrawals made on the Fund's regularly-scheduled opening date; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A declaration by Bank of America (recorded on Bank of America's records) that a ``triggering event'' has occurred, which will be made upon an accumulation of cash in a Fund attributable to dividends and/or tender offers for portfolio securities equal to not less than .05 percent and not more than .5 percent of the Fund's total value;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) In the event that a number of shares of a particular stock which all of the Funds or Large Plans propose to sell on a given day is less than the number of shares of such stock which all of the Funds or the Large Plans propose to buy, or vice versa, the direct cross-trade opportunity must be allocated among potential buyers or sellers on a pro rata basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) With respect to transactions involving a Large Plan:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) It has assets in excess of $50 million;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Fiduciaries of the Large Plan who are independent of Bank of America are, prior to any cross-trade transactions, fully informed of the cross-trade technique and provide advance written approval of such transactions. Within 45 days of the completion of the Large Plan's portfolio restructuring program, such fiduciaries shall be fully appraised in writing of the transaction results. However, if such program takes longer than three months to complete, interim reports of the transaction results will be made within 30 days of the end of each three month period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Such Large Plan transactions occur only in situations where Bank of America has been authorized to restructure all or a portion of the Large Plan's portfolio into an Index or Model-Driven Fund (including a separate account based on an index or computer model) or to act as a ``trading adviser'' in carrying out a Large Plan-initiated liquidation or restructuring of its equity portfolio; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Bank of America receives no additional direct or indirect compensation as a result of the cross-trade transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Prior to any proposed cross-trading by a Fund, Bank of America provides to each employee benefit plan which invests in a Fund information which describes the existence of the cross-trading program, the ``triggering events'' which will create cross-trade opportunities, the pricing mechanism that will be utilized for stocks purchased or sold by the Funds, and the allocation methods and other procedures which will be implemented by Bank of America for its cross-trading practices. Any such employee benefit plan which subsequently invests in a Fund shall be provided the same information prior to or immediately after the plan's initial investment in a Fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Part II_Exemption for the Acquisition, Holding and Disposition of BAC Stock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The restrictions of sections 406(a)(1)(D), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act, and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(D) and (E) of the Code, shall not apply to the acquisition, holding or disposition of the common stock of BAC by Index or Model-Driven Funds, if the following conditions and the General Conditions of Part III are met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

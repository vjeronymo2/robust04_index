			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Lloyd's chairman to hold first 'help tank' today LLOYD'S OF LONDON is to hold the first of a series of 'market leaders' forums' today in an effort to improve communication between Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, and the underwriters, agents and brokers who do business at the insurance market. Mr Coleridge organised the forums - known widely in Lloyd's as 'help tanks'  -after recent adverse publicity. He said this month in a letter to more than 60 executives that a 'frank and open exchange of views' would be helpful. Lloyd's said yesterday that the forums, which will take place each month, will not supplant the work of existing market committees. Initial discussions are likely to focus on public relations. 'This has to be good,' said Mr Robert Hiscox, a leading agent. 'The twelfth floor (the floor at the Lloyd's building in London on which Mr Coleridge and Mr Alan Lord, chief executive, have their offices) tends to get detached from the realities of the market.' Mr Paul Archard, chairman of the Lloyd's Underwriting Agents Association, said the meetings were 'a step in the right direction'. Lloyd's is expecting to post losses of more than Pounds 1.3bn when it reports its 1989 results in June, with the losses falling disproportionately on a minority of outside Names - the individuals whose assets back the insurance market. Loss-making Names alleged last month that working Names - those who have jobs with brokers and agents at the market - were relatively under-represented on syndicates reporting the heaviest losses. Their complaints were echoed by MPs, which attracted a wave of damaging press comment. Some Names were especially critical of Mr Coleridge's rejection in January of proposed reforms of the governance of Lloyd's proposed by the Rowland task force. Mr Coleridge labelled the proposals to establish a new market board - which would provide corporate leadership for the market - as 'codswallop', but was subsequently forced to back-track. A group headed by Sir Jeremy Morse is working on the governance issues and may present its conclusions as early as June.</p>

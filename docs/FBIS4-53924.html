			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] team  for negotiations with North Korea that arrived in Pyongyang this  afternoon will work for the replacement of nuclear fuel rods,  along with the three inspectors who have checked the replacement  of nuclear fuel rods in North Korea for the past week.    IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said that the IAEA negotiating  team  arrived in Pyongyang this afternoon and will begin full-pledged  negotiations with North Korean officials tomorrow.    In particular, it is expected that, in the forthcoming  negotiations with North Korea, the IAEA will demand [chokku] a  random choice [imui sontaek] of replaced nuclear fuel rods and  separate preservation [pyolto pogwan] of them in special  containers, and North Korea will repeatedly insist on its  previous position that it will allow this after the nuclear  issue is resolved in a package deal through negotiations with  the United States.</p>

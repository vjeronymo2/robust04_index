			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with State Tax Inspection Chief Davit Salaridze </F> by Aleko Aslanishvili: "When the Treasury Is Empty. New Tax  Legislation Goes Into Effect": place and date not given]    [Text] The level of tax discipline in a country,  attitudes toward taxes, and the extent to which taxes are fully  reported and paid, constitute an indicator of that country's  economic stability, the strength of its government, and the  effectiveness of its organized system and management. The  creation of a tax service that is independent--or, rather,  subject only to the law and free of all administrative or  political pressure--is the aim of a package of laws which was  recently passed by the Parliament.    We asked State Tax Inspection Chief Davit Salaridze to  tell our readers about new features of the tax legislation.    Biographical sketch. He was born in Tbilisi in 1947. He  majored in the law and at various times has worked in the  Procuracy, the courts, and the Internal Affairs Ministry. He has  been chief of the State Tax Inspection since September 1993. He  is married and has one child.    [Aslanishvili] Recently, speakers have had words of praise  to  say about the chief of the Tax Inspection. I believe this  department is a kind of "virgin territory" for you.    [Salaridze] Those words of praise belong to the Inspection's  collective. I have found them to be people of excellent  qualifications. The collective worked hard with the relevant  Parliament commission to draw up the new legislation, which  accounts for the first successful steps.    Eight new laws have been passed. Until now we have not  really  had tax laws. There was an interim statute that we had to work  with. The basic thrust of the new legislation calls for  relatively liberal tax rates; its principle is to encourage  entrepreneurship, boost the country's economy, and put a halt to  concealment of income.    Consider the tax on profit, for example. It used to be 35  percent; now it has been reduced by 15 points. That 20 percent  is also differentiated for industry and construction; it calls  for only 10 percent. Not only that, but a newly created  organization is totally exempted from taxes in the first year,  and it only pays half the rate in the next two years.    Now consider value-added tax. The rate is set at 14 percent,  which is much lower than in other countries. In the CIS  republics, for example, it is 20 percent.    I believe these terms are quite acceptable to all. Of  course,  such low rates could result in losses to the budget for some  time, but the state has done this deliberately. The payoff  should come later.    [Aslanishvili] In drafting the laws, did you draw upon the  experience of any particular countries?    [Salaridze] We didn't use any single pattern. We studied the  laws of several countries, including members of the CIS. In  drafting the legislation we got advice from the International  Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and other international  organizations.    [Aslanishvili] Taxes are one of the main sources of budget  revenue. What will the State Inspection's contribution be this  year?    [Salaridze] Last year the state budget's revenue portion was  400 billion coupons. As far as possible, the deficit was covered  by financial emissions, loans, and various aid contributions.  The first quarter's budget for this year is now ready. Revenues  will be 1.3 trillion coupons, and expenditures will be 1.5  trillion. So the deficit should only be 200 billion coupons.  There's a big difference compared with last year's--400 billion  in all of last year and 1.3 trillion in one quarter of this  year. To be sure, inflation has to be taken into account, but  the difference is still significant. Here the state tax  agencies' role comes into play--keeping track of taxpayers and  taxes and other fees paid into the budget and taking part in  forecasting the budget's revenues.    [Aslanishvili] Industry ought to be providing the biggest  source of taxes, but our industry is in such sad shape that we  can't pin much hope on them. Is there any other source?    [Salaridze] There are reserves which need to be activated.  For example, petroleum products. Last year, commercial  structures imported around a million tonnes of petroleum  products into the republic. According to rough estimates, the  state budget should have received about 500 billion  coupons--almost enough for one full budget backup [rezerv],  but.... When started focusing on that sector of commerce, we  managed to collect 2.5 billion coupons in December alone.    We are supporting entrepreneurship and business in every  way;  we know that Georgia's salvation depends on business, which  creates wealth for our budget and the nation. Everyone must  realize that there will no longer be state stocks of gasoline  and other products. The more gasoline the commercial structures  bring in, the cheaper it will become. But the importer also has  to know that he has to pay stipulated amounts to the budget.  This is the rule of civilized relations with the state.    Another example: There are about 3,000 sales booths  registered in Tbilisi, but last year we only got 100 million  coupons from them in taxes. Consider also the currency exchange  offices. According to statistics of the National Bank, as of 28  December 1993, 745 such offices were registered in the Tbilisi  area, and 385 of them were on the tax books. But only seven  exchange offices paid money to the budget in the form of  taxes--2.3 million coupons. And that's all. The others paid  nothing. Yet every exchange office is supposed to pay 100  dollars per month.    Travel firms are also supposed to bring in hard currency;  after all, they actually provide services for foreign currency.  There are about 200 travel agencies in Tbilisi, yet only seven  of them have licenses. We warn them that all of the income that  is earned without a license--that is, unlawfully--will be  confiscated (this also applies to the currency exchange offices)!    [Aslanishvili] The city is flooded with "improvised  markets"--that is, all kinds of buying and selling at subway  stations and in other public places. Is anybody inquiring as to  what is being sold? Besides the fact that the city's unique  character is ruined and everything looks like one big bazaar, is  the state getting anything out of this?    [Salaridze] Those citizens engaged in commercial activity  are  in fact operating without registration and, of course, the  budget gets practically nothing from them. For example, every  day there are about 5,000 citizens selling things at the  Isanskiy Rayon swapmeet, and every day they pay the fair  organizers 20,000 coupons. About 60 persons who have set up  booths on the swapmeet grounds have been assessed income taxes.  This problem is the result of the government's 4 May 1993 Decree  "On Freedom of Trade," Article 7 of which exempts citizens from  taxes on earnings from an unorganized, one-time retail trade  deal. But the decree does not explain just what is to be  considered "an unorganized retail trade deal." Hence, it is  almost impossible to determine whether a man is doing regular  business or just engaged in a "one-time retail trade deal." It  is just as impossible to determine his earnings. In order to get  all these "free businessmen" on the books and enhance budget  revenues we think it would be useful for the Cabinet of  Ministers to repeal Article 7 of the 4 May 1993 Decree and  institute a trade tax for merchants at markets and swapmeets  instead of an income tax, to be paid together with the fee for  their place of business. In addition, we need to prohibit  citizens from doing business outside of kolkhoz markets,  swapmeets, and special places designated for the purpose.    There are other reserves as well.    As you know, due to developing entrepreneurship, coupon  inflation, and other circumstances, residential buildings and  other structures have become very costly. Most of the buying and  selling is with Russian rubles and American dollars, but when  agreements are notarized the amounts of the deals are mostly  given in coupons, and usually at a lower price. Here are some  examples: According to the records of Notary Office No. 5, in  December of last year on Vazha-Pshavela Avenue a four-room  apartment (47 square meters) was sold for eight million coupons.  On Paliashvili Street a one-room apartment sold for four million  coupons. According to Notary Office No. 1 a two-room apartment  on Vazha-Pshavela Street (31 square meters) went for five  million coupons; in Gldanskiy Rayon a three-room apartment (45  square meters) went for three million coupons, and on Moscow  Avenue a one-room apartment went for 500,000 coupons. These  "cheap" deals are costing the budget considerable amounts of  money, because the state fee is supposed to be 10 percent of the  amount stipulated in the agreement. We believe it would be  useful for the relevant agencies to determine actual prices and  work out coefficients on the basis of characteristics of cities,  rayons, and individual neighborhoods, so that when verifying  deals, in order to calculate the state fee correctly, notary  offices can raise the book assessment of these structures.    There have been many cases where entrepreneurs export large  amounts of goods out of the republic but do not properly report  their income and thereby avoid paying the budget what they owe.  In June of 1993 alone 5.1 million dollars' worth of goods were  passed through Poti Customs for export (including around 11  tonnes of metal worth two million dollars). For example, a check  of one firm, Merkuri, revealed that organizations engaged in  foreign economic business are grossly violating tax discipline;  Merkuri was assessed an additional 37,200 dollars and five  million coupons to the state budget. This is just one example,  the result of inspecting just one organization!    We have collaborated with the Justice Ministry to work out a  new draft article for the Criminal Code providing for liability  for concealing income. It calls for five years' imprisonment if  the concealed income exceeds ten times the minimum wage. Severe  financial penalties are also provided for.    [Aslanishvili] Businessmen complain that all kinds of  inspectors and controllers are harassing them, that they are  audited time after time, they get it both from the Tax  Inspection and from the Chamber of Control....    [Salaridze] Their complaint is not entirely groundless. We  are now talking with the officials of the Chamber of Control in  order to coordinate inspections. We have no quarrels with one  another. Our functions are completely separate. The Chamber of  Control is the supreme control body, and monitoring of the  budget is also in its hands. It can check up on us as well, see  how we are doing, whether we are treating taxpayers right, but  taxes and taxpayers are the Inspection's prerogative; in that  sphere it is the chief and only one. The businessman will soon  sense the coordinated actions of these two organizations and can  breathe easier. As for other authorities, when the legislation  settles this matter the businessman won't have to deal with  anybody else.    [Aslanishvili] There has been a lot of talk about forming a  Tax Police. What was the final decision?    [Salaridze] The Parliament did approve the idea of creating  an enforcement structure under the Tax Inspection, but it will  be the Inspection's Detection Administration rather than a  police force. We deliberately avoided having a police agency;  there are already enough police agencies and the public is  confused. The Criminal Trial Code will empower the agency to  combat concealed income.    [Aslanishvili] Won't it be something like the notorious  OBKhSS [Department To Combat the Theft of Socialist Property]?    [Salaridze] Not at all. As I mentioned, our purpose will be  to combat concealed income and to merge control, auditing, and  enforcement forms, for the use of up-to-date information; this  will require the appropriate auditing and accounting  inspections. It will all be combined under one roof. Under  conditions where the tax inspector also has the professional  rights of detection personnel, you have to agree, the results  will not be slow in coming, and our efforts against concealed  income will be much more effective.    By the way, Tax Inspections having their own tax police is  not anything new. Services like that have been in existence a  long time in many countries of the West, and Russia has a  20,000-man service of that sort right now.    As for the Internal Affairs Ministry's Administration To  Fight Economic Crime--known as the OBKhSS--I think that this  service has a much more important task to perform, and it would  be wrong to trivialize those tasks. But when it comes to taxes,  it is necessary to think about an effective separation of the  functions in order to make taxpayers once and for all understand  both their rights and their duties with respect to the state and  the budget.    [Aslanishvili] What structural changes have taken place in  your department in accordance with the new legislation?    [Salaridze] New structural mechanisms have been established  in Tbilisi--financial-auditing apparatuses/equipment.  Record-keeping is being handled in a new way. We must say  frankly that our record-keeping system is still in the Stone  Age. We need to install a computer system, starting with  personal computers. Most important, record-keeping needs to be  improved not only in our department but with taxpayers as well.  Without cash registers they will simply no longer be able to  operate. There is already a draft Cabinet of Ministers decree by  which universal conversion to cash registers must take place. We  will do the monitoring.    [Aslanishvili] But do you physically have that many cash  registers?    [Salaridze] On that matter the Trade Ministry has a relevant  proposal. Taxpayers will have to buy them. If they don't, they  won't be permitted to do business.    A draft has been prepared for a Head of State edict on  measures to improve our service's functions.    [Aslanishvili] Batono Davit, there are three kinds of  currency circulating in our republic now--the coupon, the  Russian ruble, and the U.S. dollar. This is probably causing you  some trouble. Do you think that if we join the ruble zone it  will rectify the situation?    [Salaridze] One thing is certain: we must do everything to  preserve the national currency. What has wrecked the coupon is  that anyone can deal how he pleases. As far as the ruble zone is  concerned, it depends on what terms they offer us. One way or  another, however, we must have our own currency; once the state  has the ability to convert the coupon, it will become strong.    [Aslanishvili] Will the state have that capability in the  near future? Right now we are living on foreign credits.    [Salaridze] That's right, we're living on foreign credits  (many people don't even know that these credits were obtained  thanks to the Head of State's personal authority), but it's a  disgrace--no, it's a disaster--when all kinds of people line  their pockets with these hard-won credits and don't even settle  up with the budget for the earnings they make with these  credits. We are checking into things and will soon bring them to  light.    [Aslanishvili] Which brings me to the next question, one  that  has been bothering the public for some time. I'm referring to  the notorious billions in credits so generously issued by the  National Bank....    [Salaridze] There probably are criminal elements in this,  but  the ones least to blame are those who took out the loans. In all  the hullabaloo people forget that if an organization receives  credit and pays off the obligation to the state, it is in the  right.    [Aslanishvili] But isn't it a betrayal of the national  interest to grant billions in credits at a rate of 40 percent?    [Salaridze] Why call the businessman to account for this? We  should call the National Bank to account. The bank was supposed  to take account of inflation rates, so don't blame the  businessman! If they get us involved in checking this out, we  will only be concerned about their compliance with their  obligations to the budget. But in this sensational affair, it  seems to me, everyone is doing his job but the state is not  getting what it has coming to it, therefore, I repeat, our  service needs to get involved.    [Aslanishvili] A lot of organizations and companies are  requesting to be exempted from taxes and are putting forth  substantive arguments. What measures are you taking?    [Salaridze] According to the new legislation, only  Parliament  has the right to grant exemption. This is correct. Not just  anybody can get involved in exemption from taxes. Taxpayers must  understand that it is no use going from office to office; they  can only appeal to the Parliament. And I hope Parliament will  stand firm.    In short, our empty state treasury needs to be filled. The  tax service is going to do everything it can, as we will show by  our actions.</p>

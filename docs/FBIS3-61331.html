			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Novikov: "Interest-Free Credit--This, It </F> Turns Out, Is Possible"]    [Text] The course of the Russian Government toward a strict  credit-financial policy has forced producers to take stock. For  the majority commercial credit today is a luxury but they must  operate, and to pay off debts is also a luxury. At the regular  meeting of the board of the Russian Federation Committee on  Metallurgy a curious plan was proposed for distributing credit  funds. It was conventionally called resource-target. In the  opinion of experts, it will not save the branch from all of its  problems but it will help many to complete mutual settlements.    The essence of the "scheme" is this. Credit is granted not  to  one enterprise, which pays off its debts at its own discretion,  but to several. The debtors are arranged in a technological  chain: for example, the pipe plant is in debt to the  metallurgists, the metallurgists--to the miners, the miners--to  the energy workers. This way the same credit passes through all  links of the chain. As a result, both the sum of repayment and  the credit rate are formed through all participants in the plan,  and the last link receives money, say, a billion rubles, with  minimal interest.    At the same time, as the funds move, it is as though each  debtor in the chain gives credit to his creditor, thus there is  a mutual settlement of debts. Moreover, the entire sum of credit  reaches the final recipient in the complete and unaltered amount.    In the opinion of the chief of the administration for  finance  and accounting of the Russian Federation Committee on  Metallurgy, Leonid Rakovskiy, such a system will make it  possible to reduce the interest rate on credit, ease the burden  of the borrowers, increase the repayment of credit and, as a  result, it will draw commercial banks into cooperation with  metallurgical enterprises.    Even today the Menatep Bank and the branch bank of  Metallinvestbank are prepared to work according to this plan.  True, the banks will carefully verify the solvency of the  clients, and the credit, obviously, will be received only by  profitable enterprises. In the words of the chairman of the  Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy, Serafim Afonin, even  such a clever system will not help an obvious outsider.</p>

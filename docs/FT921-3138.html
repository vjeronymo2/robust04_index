			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Ashdown will unveil manifesto THE LIBERAL Democrats will today unveil a manifesto backing a Keynesian programme of public investment, funded partly out of higher income tax, which threatens to overshadow the party's commitment to a free-market economic policy. Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, will try to set his party apart from Labour's spending pledges with what senior party strategists describe as an 'honest costing' of its economic recovery package - including a penny on the basic rate of income tax. The party would also abolish the government's new 20p band on the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. The 15,000-word manifesto, 'Changing Britain for good,' also includes a pledge that the Liberal Democrats will not support any government which 'turns its back' on electoral reform. 'Any minority government which tries to play games with the constitution in order to cling to power, providing instability and dodging the moral challenges of democracy, will have to contend with us,' its conclusion says. The extra spending planned for housing, transport infrastructure, energy conservation, hospitals and schools will create 400,000 jobs this year, the party estimates. The manifesto will also include a series of measures to promote competition  -including plans for private rail operators to use British Rail's tracks - reflecting Mr Ashdown's determination to steal some Conservative clothes with his liberal radicalism. Addressing Liberal Democrat candidates yesterday Mr Ashdown said the party was committed to public investment, private enterprise and social justice. 'If we have to risk our vote by saying what really needs to be done then we have the courage to do that,' he told the packed London rally. 'This party does not believe in high taxation. Believe me, Liberal Democrats want taxes to be as low as they possibly can but we will not stand aside while our economy is still stuck in decline.' He dismissed Labour's alternative Budget as 'Mr Kinnock's hall of mirrors'. Liberal Democrats officials claimed a victory in forcing Mr John Major to take on proportional representation as an election issue. Mr Ashdown said: 'A vote for Mr Major is a vote against reform, against a modern system of democracy and in favour of a return to the constitutional dark ages.' About 50,000 copies of the Liberal Democrat manifesto have been printed, excluding Scottish and Welsh versions. Underlining the party's determination to change the political system, as well as its leaders, the manifesto shuns usual conventions to present a 'World Bank-style' report on Britain's economy. The opening page reads: 'Be warned: this manifesto may not be what you expected.'</p>

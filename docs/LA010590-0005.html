			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND WEATHER EXPECTED TO BE COMFORTABLY BORING  </P> <P> No frills, fewer chills. This weekend's weather forecast calls for all-around  sunshine, mild temperatures and a halt to the recent string of nightly frost  advisories in local agricultural areas.  </P> <P> Except for an occasional high cloud wafting by, the weather through Sunday  promises to be gloriously dull. Daytime temperatures will rise slowly and  nights will gradually become more moderate, forecasters said.  </P> <P> "It should be a very nice weekend with milder temperatures and no sight of rain  at least into the middle of next week," said National Weather Service  meteorologist Wilbur Shigehara. "We will see some high clouds filtering through  from storms in the Pacific Northwest, but no rain."  </P> <P> A frost advisory issued Wednesday night when temperatures dipped below 30  degrees in such agricultural areas as Bonsall, Escondido and Valley Center will  be lifted tonight, Shigehara said.  </P> <P> "We've been getting some frost, but nothing dangerous," he said. "Most crops  are fairly hardy and can take temperatures down to about 29 degrees. Growers  don't have to really start worrying until it gets to about 27 or 28 degrees."  </P> <P> The normal high temperature for this time of year is 65 and the normal low is  48 degrees, Shigehara said. The high at Lindbergh Field Thursday was 64.  </P> <P> Highs along the beaches will be from 58 to 63 today and 60 to 65 on the  weekend, Shigehara said. The ocean is 59 degrees, and the surf is at 2 to 4  feet.  </P> <P> Coastal highs for the whole weekend will range from 65 to 70 degrees. Lows will  range from 40 to 50 tonight and from 42 to 52 Saturday night, Shigehara said.  </P> <P> Light breezes along the coast will reach about 16 m.p.h. over the weekend,  Shigehara said.  </P> <P> Inland highs through Sunday are expected to range from 68 to 75. Overnight lows  will climb slightly, to between 29 and 39 degrees tonight and to between 35 and  45 degrees Saturday night, Shigehara said.  </P> <P> Highs in the mountains will be from 40 to 46 today and from 40 to 50 on the  weekend, Shigehara said. Lows of 25 to 33 tonight and 27 to 35 Saturday night  are forecast.  </P> <P> In the foothills near Poway and San Vicente, winds will gust up to 25 m.p.h.  today but will diminish Saturday, Shigehara said.  </P> <P> Desert highs will be between 65 and 70 today, and up to near 70 on the weekend.  Lows will be from 30 to 40 tonight and 32 to 42 Saturday night, Shigehara said.  </P></p>

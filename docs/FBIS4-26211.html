			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Gao Sizhang: "Call for Improved Bond Mart"] </F>   [Text] China should increase efforts to build the low-cost,  highly-efficient primary market for treasury bonds said an  official with the Ministry of Finance.    "That will ensure the Ministry of Finance has easy access to  financial resources," said Gao Jian, vice-director of the  ministry's State debt administration.    Starting this year, the central government has barred the  ministry from borrowing from the People's Bank of China to  finance its deficit. As a result, the ministry has shifted its  attention to the domestic treasury bond market.    However, the current selling format for treasury bonds poses  a problem for the ministry.    To ensure bonds are bought, the central government relies on  measures such as local government purchase quotas.    In highly-efficient, low-cost markets abroad, issue prices  are determined by market supply and demand.    Second, the main subscribers in the primary market are  financial concerns, including banks, securities firms and  institutional investors.    Gao said many attitudes need to change to ensure a smooth  treasury bond market.    "Measures should be co-ordinated to stabilize the whole  process," he said.    These measures include establishing a market-oriented  interest-setting mechanism.    Gao also said the interest rate of treasury bonds should be  decided by market demand and supply.    In an underwriting syndication format, the rate should be  set  based on negotiations between issuers and underwriters or based  on the tender prices determined by competitive bidding in  auction format.    At present, the coupon rate is set up with reference to the  bank deposit rate.    For several years, the rate of treasury bonds has been set 1  to 2 percentage points higher than bank deposit rates.    Meanwhile, Gao said, central underwriting syndication should  be expanded to replace local underwriting syndication.    Central underwriting refers to security intermediaries who  directly sign contracts with the Ministry of Finance. In local  underwriting, the ministry entrusts local governments to  underwrite bonds.    This transition will require more primary dealers, who  underwrite treasury bonds and bid for their price.    The system was introduced last year when 19 securities  firms,  trust and investment companies and banks were approved as  primary dealers.    But they have not fully become a force in the primary  market,  Gao said.    He added that the primary dealer system will be effective  depending on how much the central bank encourages commercial  banks to hold treasury bonds as liquid assets.    Furthermore, Gao said, efforts should be made to improve the  financial infrastructure, including setting up a national  trading system to deal with paperless bond trading.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk told journalists  Friday that the differences between the Constitutions of Ukraine  and Crimea could be resolved by adopting a new Ukrainian  Constitution, which would recognize the interests of every  region and take into account what he called new circumstances.  Meanwhile, he said, every individual and region had to abide by  the existing Constitution.    Kravchuk thought that as much power as possible could be  given to Crimea on the proviso that Ukraine remained an integral  whole.    He recalled that under Ukrainian legislation and  international law Crimea was part of Ukraine and this should not  be changed.    The conflict of Crimean and Ukrainian legislation started on  20 May 1994 when the Crimean Supreme Soviet restored the initial  6 May 1992 wording of the Crimean Constitution under which the  relations between Crimea and Ukraine were to be guided by a  treaty between them and Crimean residents could have dual  citizenship.    Kiev demanded that the Crimean Constitution be aligned with  Ukrainian legislation.</p>

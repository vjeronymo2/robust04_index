			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HISTORIC HONKY-TONK;  </P> <P> ROARING '20S CLUB STILL GOING STRONG  </P> <P> Dust devils swirl in the parking lot and sometimes gust through the open double  doors of the Pomerado Club, once known as the Big Stone Lodge and soon to again  bear that historic name.  </P> <P> A little dust seems right at home in this ranging wooden structure with its  supporting columns of boulders brought from the surrounding Poway hills. The  rungs of the wooden bar stools are scuffed from decades of cowboy boots, the  historic pictures on the walls are flecked with beer foam and an occasional  hole from an errant dart. The corners host cobwebs and the walls and ceiling,  according to old-timers, bear at least a dozen bullet holes.  </P> <P> It's a place that leads one to wonder: "If those walls could talk . . . "  </P> <P> Big Stone Lodge claims the title of "the county's oldest continuously operating  honky-tonk," according to its new owner, Jerry Long, who bought the old Poway  building about five months ago and plans to make it a restaurant and dance spot  with a decidedly country-western theme.  </P> <P> In doing research on the building, Long discovered that it had been a roadhouse  and dance hall since the mid-1920s when Dr. Homer Hansen had the namesake  boulders brought down to the creekside tract and built the building near the  site of the Twenty Mile House, an adobe way station and drinking establishment  where drivers on the San Diego &amp; Escondido Stage Line had once obtained  fresh horses for their daily run. Area historians are unsure if the Twenty Mile  House was still operating when the Stone Lodge was build.  </P> <P> But Dolora Powers, a Poway Historical Society member who came to Poway in 1925,  remembers when the Stone Lodge was new.  </P> <P> "It was built after I moved here," Powers recalls. "It must have been in the  '20s that it was built."  </P> <P> Powers remembers how Hansen and his partners at first planned to build a motel  -- called a tourist court in those days -- on Metate Lane. But the project  "went belly up," so the developers moved over to Pomerado Road -- then the main  artery between San Diego and Escondido -- and built the Big Stone Lodge.  </P> <P> "When I was a teen-ager, I just didn't go in that place," Powers said. "I just  couldn't stand the idea of having to hold up my partner all around the dance  floor. It was a wild place in those days."  </P> <P> She did venture into the Big Stone a few times, she confessed, because it was  one of the few places where young folks, or anyone else for that matter, could  go to dance on a Saturday night.  </P> <P> "I remember the wonderful hardwood dance floor there," she recalled. "It was so  wonderfully smooth."  </P> <P> Arie DeJong emigrated from Holland to Poway in 1949, along with his parents and  nine brothers and sisters. They were sponsored by his father's brother-in-law,  Uncle Sam, to work on his 800-acre dairy farm and they lived in several small  stone houses in Wyoming Picnic Grove, south of the Big Stone Lodge.  </P> <P> "I didn't speak a word of English," DeJong said. "Every morning my brothers and  I would get up about 2 in the morning to walk or ride our bikes to the dairy  for the milking. We had to go right past that place and it was going strong at  2 or 3 in the morning.  </P> <P> "It was off-limits to us, of course," he said. Probably a wise ban, considering  the English vocabulary he might have picked up at the rowdy roadhouse.  </P> <P> But even before Big Stone Lodge earned its reputation as a wild, western dance  hall in the 1920s, the site on a bend of Old Pomerado Road was a well-known  watering hole for man and animal. Back in the 1870s and 1880s, the Twenty Mile  House was in its heyday, according to Ernest Cravath, who interviewed Poway  pioneers in 1951.  </P> <P> One old-timer told Cravath about how, back in the 1880s, Daniel Dodson shot  Henry Feeler dead in the Twenty Mile House, which Dodson ran.  </P> <P> The story went like this:  </P> <P> Dodson's "stepdaughter was a handsome blond girl who started going with Feeler  and Dodson became jealous. Feeler walked into the Twenty Mile House bar one day  and Dodson shot him through the heart with a rifle.  </P> <P> "Dodson pleaded self-defense. He claimed Feeler started to pull a gun.  </P> <P> "At the coroner's inquest, the prosecuting attorney had the dead man's heart  brought in in a pail as evidence. He hoped to demolish the self-defense plea by  showing the direction of the bullet through the heart.  </P> <P> "He kept the pail in the anteroom, intending to produce it as a surprise, but  hogs got into the room and devoured the heart.  </P> <P> "At the trial, Dodson was set free."  </P> <P> Over the years and under many names, the Big Stone Lodge has kept the  reputation of its predecessors as a rough-and-tumble tavern with a  country-western flavor. That flavor is something that Jerry Long hopes to  preserve, but without the rowdyism.  </P> <P> "It's been five or 10 years now since there's been any problem here," Long  said. "Back then, a bunch of bikers, Hell's Angels, discovered the place and  took it over for a while."  </P> <P> Two years ago, the roadhouse became a roadless house when the city of San Diego  annexed a huge chunk of unincorporated land to the south of the Pomerado Club  and closed the road as "unsafe" and "not up to city street standards."  </P> <P> A new Pomerado Road, built to meet modern highway safety standards, is due to  open any day now, but it won't help the Big Stone Lodge because it bypasses the  former highway to the east, leaving the former stage route and federal highway  a quiet cul-de-sac.  </P> <P> Long had 20 years' experience in food service with Service America Corp. (the  firm that brought sushi to San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium), rising to vice  president in charge of operations in the western United States.  </P> <P> "One thing I learned was, don't make something into what it's not," he said.  </P> <P> He plans to reopen the restaurant at the roadhouse, but it won't be a fancy  place. Just good Western food like steaks, chicken-fried steak and hamburgers.  No white tableclothes or maitre d', Long said. "We're going to keep it simple  and authentic."  </P> <P> Long already has made many changes in the aging Big Stone and hired its former  owners, the Savery Brothers, to provide live music. The Savery band is ranked  at the top of the charts locally by country-western fans, Long bragged, and  brings in fans from "all over the county, from Imperial Beach and Ramona,  Lakeside and Encinitas."  </P> <P> The new owner plans some incentives to bring in the people, including concerts  and free dance lessons, "something for everyone, all age groups, but only in  authentic country-western style."  </P> <P> He also plans to "maybe expand on the history of this place" by building  old-time western storefronts on the hill. "A blacksmith shop, for instance. And  a little wedding chapel over by the creek.  </P> <P> "I've got 3.5 acres here, with a beautiful stream down there that runs  year-round, and some 100-year-old oak trees," he said.  </P> <P> But mainly, Long is banking on over 100 years of history to fashion his new,  old honky-tonk. As he puts it: "Go with what you've got."  </P></p>

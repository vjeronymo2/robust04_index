			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KREMLIN VOWS TO CUT MILITARY, AID CONSUMERS  </P> <P> Through sharp cuts in defense spending and capital investment, the Soviet  government Monday promised its citizens better supplies of food, clothes,  medicine and other consumer goods in the coming year in what officials  described as a fundamental reorientation of the country's economy.  </P> <P> Deputy Premier Lev A. Voronin told the Supreme Soviet, the national  legislature, that the government plans a massive shift of resources to develop  agriculture and light industry in response to widespread complaints that four  years of perestroika (restructuring) have not improved the daily lives of most  people.  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who opened the autumn parliamentary session,  reminded deputies of the popular dissatisfaction.  </P> <P> "High and even exceptional importance is attached in society to this session,"  he said. "People expect it to produce significant results, answers to many  vital questions and major decisions. . . .  </P> <P> "Urgent measures are needed both to lift social tension and to advance  perestroika decisively in every area, most notably the social and economic  ones."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Significant Changes Promised  </P> <P> Outlining government plans to pay more for agricultural produce, to open new  consumer goods factories, to convert munitions plants to civilian production  and to import more from abroad, Voronin promised significant changes within the  next 12 months, including an end to some of the Soviet Union's chronic  shortages of many basic products.  </P> <P> But Voronin also acknowledged that consumer demand will continue to outstrip  supply as the government attempts to transform the centrally planned economy,  with its state-owned industries and huge bureaucracy, into one that would  operate on the principles of "market socialism," which are still difficult to  define.  </P> <P> "We are carrying out a massive and broadly based transfer of the economy to a  regime in which the solving of social problems has priority," Voronin said,  detailing what he called a "sharp change of direction" after another year of  serious economic decline.  </P> <P> In agriculture, the government will pay farmers in dollars, rather than Soviet  rubles, for increased production, hoping to stimulate substantial growth in  farm output. Virtually all farm earnings will also be reinvested rather than  being turned over to the state as in the past.  </P> <P> In industry, the production of consumer durables is scheduled to jump by 20%  and of other consumer goods by 11%, according to the plan. Overall retail sales  are expected to grow about 10% next year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1.1% Growth Expected in 1990  </P> <P> But the economy is expected to grow about 1.1% next year in terms of national  income, the value added to production through labor and processing, because of  the severe cutbacks in other areas.  </P> <P> The government's budget deficit, now $185 billion at current exchange rates,  will be reduced by half through raising more money and trimming expenditures,  according to Valentin V. Pavlov, the finance minister. Overall, the Soviet  budget will amount to $751 billion next year.  </P> <P> In an initial effort to develop a capital market, the deficit will be financed  by public borrowing, Pavlov said, rather than a government demand on the State  Bank of the Soviet Union to finance its shortfall out of deposits.  </P> <P> The government's domestic debt already amounts to about $615 billion; its net  foreign debt to about $50 billion, including $45 billion owed Western banks.  The foreign debt is so large, Pavlov said, that it grows simply through  deferred repayments of principal and interest without any further loans.  </P> <P> Military spending will be reduced 8.3%, from $119 billion to $109 billion, as  part of a previously announced plan to cut defense expenditures by 14% by 1991,  Pavlov said. Spending on weapons development and military construction is to be  cut more sharply, he said, and production of tanks, military aircraft and  helicopters will be reduced substantially.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Consumer Goods  </P> <P> By contrast, defense industries are to increase their production of consumer  goods by 35% next year to $62 billion, according to the plans submitted to the  deputies.  </P> <P> Although characterized largely as "emergency measures," intended to meet  popular demands for an improved living standard, the state budget and  development plan are the first tangible steps in the country' economic  transformation.  </P> <P> Far-reaching legislation will come before the Supreme Soviet during its  two-month session that Gorbachev said would lay the foundation for a new  economic system, which will become the heart of perestroika.  </P> <P> Among the 80 items on the agenda are new laws that will allow private  entrepreneurs and cooperatives to compete on equal footing with state  enterprises. The new laws will authorize the leasing of state-owned factories  to their workers and managers and will permit the ownership and sale of land  and other natural resources.  </P> <P> Other laws will establish the rules by which Soviet companies operate and  provide for collective bargaining by workers with their employers. The laws  will institute corporate, income and turnover taxes in place of a system in  which the state has taken all profits.  </P> <P> Voronin and Pavlov, however, said the government's immediate task was to halt  the country's economic decline.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Production Declines  </P> <P> In the last year, according to Voronin, production had declined in about a  third of the 178 key areas -- among them oil, coal, gasoline, synthetic fibers,  sugar, canned food, paper, socks and stockings -- that the government tracks in  its efforts to assess the state of the economy.  </P> <P> "The dynamism of the economy has been steadily falling in many major areas this  year," Voronin said, his remarks contrasting sharply with the traditional  upbeat appraisals delivered by his predecessors. "Social tension has increased,  and the national economy has been losing its balance. Against the background of  these trends, deficits on the consumer market and in production have grown."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Big Budget Deficit  </P> <P> The goals of the 1990 plan consequently were to reverse the negative trends,  including the large budget deficit and resulting inflation, and to stabilize  the economy, he said. With the fiscal improvement, more resources could be  devoted to production of consumer goods and ultimately to satisfying consumer  demand.  </P> <P> Virtually absent from Voronin's outline of development plans were announcements  of increased capital investment -- he called for a cutback -- and of the  greater industrial capacity that the Soviet Union has regarded as the measure  of real economic growth.  </P> <P> Tough decisions will be required in both the adoption of the state budget and  development plan and in the broader economic legislation, Gorbachev told the  deputies.  </P> <P> "We must convince our people why they are necessary and show them what  consequences they will have in the near future, and what we shall face if these  decisions are not made," he said.  </P></p>

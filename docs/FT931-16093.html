			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: Renault and Volvo seek deeper alliance RENAULT, the French state-owned carmaker and Volvo, its Swedish partner, yesterday confirmed they were seeking to deepen their alliance of nearly three years. The companies refused to comment on reports that the French government was considering plans for Renault to take majority control of Volvo Car. However, officials at Renault and the French industry ministry said they were looking at ways in which Renault and Volvo might move closer within the French carmaker's existing statutes, although no immediate steps were planned. Volvo owns 20 per cent of Renault and has the right to build up to 25 per cent. Nothing in Renault's statutes stops it from taking majority control of Volvo's car division, said an official. However, such a move could raise political problems in Sweden, unless Volvo received substantial compensation. 'It is no secret that Renault and Volvo are seeking a deeper and stronger alliance than today,' said Volvo. Speculation that Renault and Volvo might merge or exchange their car and truck businesses has been rife ever since the pair swapped minority share stakes in 1990 to help each other face growing competition. To date, the partners have pooled much of their component purchasing activities in both trucks and cars, agreed to exchange car engines and are planning a range of luxury cars based on a common platform for sale in Europe.</p>

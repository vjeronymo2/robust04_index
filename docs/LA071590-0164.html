			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SHEEHAN SPLASHES TO RECORD  </P> <P> Patty Sheehan shattered the U.S. Women's Open record for 36 holes Saturday when  she completed a two-day round of four-under-par 68 to take a six-shot lead in  the rain-plagued event.  </P> <P> The leading money winner on the LPGA Tour this year faces a 36-hole test today.  </P> <P> "I'm very happy with my position," Sheehan said after her 10-under-par 134  score for two trips around the 6,298-yard Riverside Course at the Atlanta  Athletic Club in Duluth, Ga.  </P> <P> USGA officials said it was believed to be the first time a player ever was  10-under in the Women's Open. She broke the 36-hole scoring record of 138 set  last year by Betsy King.  </P> <P> An overnight rain kept players off the course until Saturday afternoon and  limited play to those players finishing their second rounds. Sheehan played 15  holes Saturday.  </P> <P> She held the lead over Jane Geddes, the 1986 Open champion who needed 12 hours  and endured two rain delays before completing a 74 on Friday that left her at  140.  </P> <P> Scott Verplank is enjoying playing "catch me" instead of catch up, in the Bank  of Boston Classic PGA tournament at Sutton, Mass.  </P> <P> "At least I don't have to pass anyone tomorrow," Verplank said after he  retained a one-stroke lead with a three-under-par 68 for a 54-hole score of  203, 10 strokes under regulation, at Pleasant Valley Country Club.  </P> <P> In a bid for his first tour victory since the 1988 Buick Open, Verplank had a  one-stroke lead over Brian Tennyson, who finished a bogey-free third round with  birdies on the last two holes.  </P> <P> At 206, three strokes back, were Mike Smith, Sam Randolph, Willie Wood and  Clarence Rose.  </P> <P> More than 20 players have a shot at the $90,000 winner's check in the Kroger  Senior Classic at Mason, Ohio, co-leader Lee Trevino said after play was rained  out.  </P> <P> "You've got to go all the way to the two-unders -- at least a dozen guys,"  Trevino said. "It would be difficult to come from even par."  </P> <P> After Trevino and Dave Hill, who are tied at six-under-par 65, there are 21  other players who were at least two under par after Friday's round.  </P> <P> The $600,000 tournament was also halted by rain on Wednesday and Thursday.  </P> <P> One stroke behind the leaders were Joe Jimenez, a 64-year-old lifetime club  pro; Walt Zembriski, a retired ironworker; and John Paul Cain, a stockbroker  from Houston.  </P> <P> Welshman Ian Woosnam won back-to-back golf tournaments for the first time when  he shot a final-round 68 to win the $680,000 Scottish Open at Gleneagles.  </P> <P> Woosnam moved away from the field to a 19-under 269 for a four-stroke victory  over Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe.  </P></p>

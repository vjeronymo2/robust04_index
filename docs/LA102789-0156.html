			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TEAM EFFORT GETS ESPERANZA PAST CYPRESS, 28-3  </P> <P> His team doesn't roll up flashy statistics, but Esperanza High School Coach  Gary Meek knows the most important numbers are the ones on the scoreboard after  the game.  </P> <P> Esperanza rolled up the right numbers Thursday night, defeating Cypress, 28-3,  in an Empire League game at Bradford Stadium.  </P> <P> "We're a very unselfish team," Meek said. "We have 48 football players on this  team who don't care who gets the credit."  </P> <P> Chipping in for Esperanza (5-3 overall, 2-1 in league) Thursday night were  tailback Lance Brown, who gained 118 yards in 20 carries and scored a  touchdown; tight end Reid Pullen (four receptions for 62 yards); receiver Jarod  Smith, who had two scoring passes of 16 and 15 yards, and fullbacks Mark Parlin  and Garrett Emry, who gained 78 and 74 yards, respectively, against Cypress  (3-5, 1-2).  </P> <P> Esperanza inside linebacker Keith Navidi, the team's defensive leader,  dislocated and possibly fractured his right elbow in the first quarter and was  sent to Placentia Linda Hospital. Later, Cypress nose guard Jason Bern suffered  a neck injury and was admitted to Placentia Linda. His condition was unknown  late Thursday night. STUART MATTHEWS  </P></p>

In determining need for an Upward Bound project, the Secretary reviews each type of project (Regular, Math and Science, or Veterans) using different need criteria. The criteria for each type of project contain the same total weight of 24 points and are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The Secretary evaluates the need for a Regular Upward Bound project in the proposed target area on the basis of_(i) High school dropout rates in the target area;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) College-going rates of the high schools in the target area;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Student/counselor ratios of the high schools in the target area;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Income level of families within the target area;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Education attainment levels of families within the target area; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Unaddressed academic, social, or economic problems of low-income, potentially first-generation students in the target area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Secretary evaluates the need for an Upward Bound Math and Science project in the proposed target area on the basis of_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The extent to which student performance on standardized aptitude or achievement tests in mathematics and science in the proposed target schools, is lower than State and national norms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The extent to which target schools lack the resources to offer a full range of mathematics and science courses, which are prerequisites for entry into postsecondary programs in mathematics, science, or engineering;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The extent to which attendance data, dropout rates, college-going rates and student/counselor ratios in the target schools indicate the importance of having additional educational opportunities available to low-income, first-generation students; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The extent to which there are eligible students in the target schools who have demonstrated interest and capacity to pursue academic programs and careers in mathematics and science, and who could benefit from an Upward Bound Math and Science program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The Secretary evaluates the need for a Veterans Upward Bound project in the proposed target area on the basis of clear evidence that shows_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The proposed target area lacks the services for eligible veterans that the applicant proposes to provide;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A large number of veterans who reside in the target area are low income and potential first generation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A large number of veterans who reside in the target area, have not completed high school or, have completed high school but have not enrolled in a program of postsecondary education; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Other indicators of need for a Veterans Upward Bound project, including the presence of unaddressed academic or socio-economic problems of veterans in the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Objectives <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (9 points).

			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GOV. TAKES CREDIT FOR RAPPERS' ARRESTS  </P> <P> Gov. Bob Martinez claimed credit today for sparking a crackdown against the rap  group 2 Live Crew, as authorities prepared to charge a third band member with  violating the state obscenity law.  </P> <P> Broward County sheriff's deputies arrested two band members early Sunday,  shortly after the band finished a live performance in Hollywood, Fla.  </P> <P> Martinez, a Republican facing a potentially tough reelection race this year,  asked statewide prosecutor Peter Antonacci in February to mount a racketeering  and obscenity investigation of the group's album "As Nasty as They Wanna Be,"  saying sale of the sexually explicit recording to minors "violates all  conceivable standards of decency."  </P> <P> Antonacci declined, saying local prosecution made more sense.  </P> <P> "I think the local jurisdictions took him (Antonacci) at his word," Martinez  said in Tallahassee. "I think this (album) is a form of, in this case, audio  pornography."  </P> <P> The album has been declared obscene in south Florida and in at least eight  other counties across the state.  </P> <P> Broward Sgt. Bob Faulkner said authorities plan to issue a notice to appear  charging band member Mark Ross with the first-degree misdemeanor, punishable by  up to a year in jail and a fine of $1,000.  </P> <P> Faulkner said a fourth band member, David Hobbs, will not be charged because he  did not recite the controversial lyrics during the performance.  </P> <P> 2 Live Crew is not expected to return to south Florida from Phoenix until  Tuesday, said Bruce Rogow, the band's attorney. The band flew to Phoenix on  Sunday for a performance there.  </P> <P> Authorities had planned to arrest all four band members after the weekend  concert but failed to nab Ross and Hobbs after they left the club in a separate  car.  </P> <P> Authorities decided Monday not to issue warrants for their arrest.  </P> <P> Rogow said band members will cooperate.  </P> <P> Band leader Luther Campbell, 29, and member Chris Won Wong, 26, were arrested  Sunday without incident several blocks from Club Futura.  </P> <P> Broward deputies acted under the authority of a civil ruling issued Wednesday  in Ft. Lauderdale by U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez, who said "As Nasty as  They Wanna Be" is legally obscene by south Florida standards because its lyrics  vividly depict sexual acts and lack any redeeming social value. His ruling  applied in Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.  </P> <P> In Tallahassee, Martinez was asked about reports that the controversy had  boosted sales of the album.  </P> <P> "There's always a small percentage that that (album) will appeal to," Martinez  said. "It doesn't to me, and I think it doesn't to the majority of the people  in this state or the majority of people in this nation."  </P> <P> Earlier story on F2.  </P></p>

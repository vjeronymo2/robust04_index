			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Fees <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1309.11 proposes the application fee for registration and reregistration of manufacturers, distributors, importers and exporters of List I chemicals, as authorized by section 3(a) of the DCDCA. The proposed fee was established pursuant to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;25, as revised on July 15, 1993 (58 FR 38142), which sets forth Federal policy regarding user fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Circular A&hyph;25, Section 6 provides that ``[A] user charge *&blank;*&blank;* will be assessed against each identifiable recipient for special benefits derived from Federal activities beyond those received by the general public.'' The section further requires that the user charge be sufficient to ``*&blank;*&blank;* recover the full cost to the Federal Government for providing the special benefit.'' A special benefit is described as a Government service which ``Enables the beneficiary to obtain more immediate or substantial gains or values (which may or may not be measurable in monetary terms) than those that accrue to the general public (e.g., receiving a patent, insurance, or guarantee provision,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> or a license to carry on a specific activity or business <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [emphasis added] or various kinds of public land use)''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 822 and 957 of Title 21, United States Code, as amended by the DCDCA, require that any person who manufactures, distributes, imports or exports a List I chemical must obtain annually a registration in accordance with DEA rules and regulations. A registration to manufacture, distribute, import or export List I chemicals is a benefit under Circular A&hyph;25, in that it allows the registrant to engage in certain activities while a member of the general public may not. Therefore, the costs associated with DEA's issuance of a registration to manufacture, distribute, import or export a List I chemical; certain costs associated with advising registrants of their responsibilities; and maintenance of the integrity of the registration system must be recovered through assessment of a user fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Section 6(d) of Circular A&hyph;25 describes the requirements for determining the full cost of a service or benefit. ``Full cost'' is defined as all direct and indirect costs, including, but not limited to: direct and indirect personnel costs, including salaries, fringe benefits (such as life and health insurance and retirement) and travel; physical overhead, including material and supply costs such as forms, postage, equipment, rent and utilities; management and supervisory costs; and the costs of enforcement, collection, research, establishment of standards, and regulation. Section 6(d)(1)(e) provides that the cost figures shall be established utilizing ``the best available records of the agency and new cost accounting systems need not be established solely for this purpose.'' The cost of the services provided by DEA were determined by use of proven and accepted budget estimating techniques as outlined in the DOJ budget guidelines and OMB Circular A&hyph;11. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Considerations for the Establishment of the Original Fee <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DEA has identified two distinct categories of chemical registrants: retail distributors, such as convenience stores, gas stations, truck stops, liquor stores, etc., whose regulated activities consist of the direct sale to walk-in customers of drug products that are regulated as List I chemicals; and non-retailers, such as manufacturers which distribute, distributors, importers and exporters of List I chemicals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon contacts with the chemical industry and surveys of the industry over the past three years, DEA estimates that approximately 1,500 applications for registration will be received from non-retailers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the information gathered from various sources, including association data, surveys of ephedrine manufacturers and distributors, and correspondence received from ephedrine distributors, DEA estimates that there may have been as many as 100,000 retail distributors that, prior to the April 16, 1994 effective date of the DCDCA, sold drug products that are now subject to regulation. However, estimating the number of persons who will continue to engage in activities with the regulated drug products is speculative, due to a variety of factors. Some retailers who engaged in this previously unregulated activity may decide to no longer sell items for which registration is required by law. Also, the activities of retail distributors may be affected by state laws, such as those in Wisconsin, Florida and Missouri, which require that drug products containing ephedrine as the sole medicinal ingredient may only be dispensed pursuant to prescription. Another consideration is the availability of alternative products that are not subject to the registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. DEA has learned that certain distributors of single-entity ephedrine products have already advised their retail customers to switch to such alternative products to avoid the registration and recordkeeping requirements. Therefore, for purposes of establishing the initial fee, DEA estimates that 10,000 applications will be submitted by retail distributors. The number of applications is important only when considering apportionment of indirect costs associated with initial registration. For the first year of the registration program, this amount will constitute $22.00 of the total fee. Thus, a larger or smaller number of applicants would not result in any significant increase or decrease in the registration fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the implementation of the DCDCA, DEA will focus on processing applications, conducting pre-registration and follow-up investigations and the creation and dissemination of information regarding the registrant's responsibilities under the DCDCA. DEA expects that the majority of its chemical control resources will be required to handle the applications which will be submitted immediately following implementation of the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once the pre-registration process for existing businesses has been handled, the primary focus of DEA's chemical control program will be investigations of violative firms and registration denial or revocation proceedings. Such enforcement activities protect the integrity of the registration system by ensuring that registrants continue to meet the requirements of the DCDCA. DEA's activities will include, but not be limited to, extensive investigation and collection of documentation regarding violative practices by registrants; attorney review and preparation by DEA's Office of Chief Counsel; staff and attorney time to prepare for proceedings to deny or revoke a registration; Administrative Law Judge and staff to conduct registration denial hearings; and DEA budget and controller staff time for budget planning, accounting and auditing of fees collected. The benefits of these activities accrue to the over-all registrant population and the costs for such activities must be averaged across the entire registrant population. However, as described earlier, the expected registrant population and the extent of these enforcement activities are speculative at this time. Therefore, the costs associated with these activities have not been included in this initial fee, since they are indirect costs that would have to be averaged across a presently unknown population of applicants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

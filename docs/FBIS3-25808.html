			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Preferential Treatment for Farmers"] </F>   [Text] The government's newly promulgated consumption tax  will not apply to the farm machinery industry, according to the  State Taxation Administration.    This decision reflects the government's preferential  treatment for farmers, who need a stable rural market with few  price fluctuations in agricultural-related products.    "Chinese farmers cannot afford a further swelling of price  surges on the agricultural production materials this year," said  an official with the administration.    Last year, the country's 14.5 percent inflation rate  seriously hurt the improvement of farmers' real income, which  chalked up a rise of only 2 percent.    As a result, the taxation administration hopes it can  contribute to the government's macro control over the rural  market as well as to the development of the rural economy, which  is crucial to social stability, the official added.    Some domestic speculators are now taking advantage of the  farmers, he said. Since the farmers do not have the latest  information about the consumption tax, speculators have been  profiteering by raising prices of farm machinery and blaming the  need for the increase on the new tax.    Fearing further price increases, some farmers have been  staging a buying spree since the last month of 1993, snapping up  tractors, harvesters and other big farm machinery.    Official figures show that in 1993, the gross value of  agricultural machinery owned by the country's rural residents  hit nearly 125.4 billion yuan ($14.6 billion), up 3.9 percent  from the previous year.    However, the amount of farmland that was ploughed by machine  remained essentially the same over the two-year period. In  1993, 51.4 million hectares were ploughed by machine, down 0.01  percent from 1992.    Analysts say some farmers now believe they can protect their  renminbi from further devaluation by purchasing agricultural  machines, although some of their machines are already lying idle  in their backyards.    In fact, farmers have become reluctant to use farm machines  to help round out their field work, due to the rocketing prices  of diesel oil and the lack of a machine-repairing network in the  countryside.    Last year, some 110 million hectares of farmland were sown  with grain. Of that, only 26 million hectares were sown by  machine.</p>

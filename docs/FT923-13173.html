			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Contract failure knocks Birse to loss of Pounds 13.2m BIRSE GROUP, the building and civil engineering company in which Bilfinger &amp; Berger, the German contractor, has a 15 per cent stake, incurred a loss of Pounds 13.2m during the year to end-April. The deficit compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 10m the previous year, and was struck on turnover up from Pounds 317m to Pounds 356m. Losses per share were 16.6p compared with earnings of 7.6p last time. Following a same-again interim of 1.65p, the group is proposing not to pay a final dividend. The result had been widely expected and the company's share price yesterday remained unchanged at 23p. This compares with a price of 120p when Birse was floated and Bilfinger acquired its strategic holding in the autumn of 1989. Losses included exceptional charges of Pounds 13.1m. Of these, Pounds 8.5m arose from the failure earlier this year of Quietwaters, a private developer which owed substantial sums to Birse for the construction of a golf course, hotel and leisure complex in Essex. Mr Peter Birse, chairman, said another Pounds 3.5m of losses arising from the collapse of Quietwaters had been deducted from operating profits, which fell from Pounds 13.6m to Pounds 4.3m. The remaining Pounds 4.3m of provisions, he said, came from write-downs of the group's residential and commercial property interests. Mr Birse said the group's order book now showed a good mix of business. More than 80 per cent of contracts were either with public sector customers or secure large privatised water companies. Construction profits excluding provisions fell from Pounds 12m to Pounds 3.4m. Housing incurred a Pounds 600,000 operating loss (Pounds 700,000 loss), and remained a difficult market. Commercial property made an operating profit of Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 100,000) before write downs of Pounds 3.7m. COMMENT Questions have been raised in recent weeks about Birse's ability to survive the sharp downturn in the UK construction market, illustrated so savagely by the collapse of the Quietwaters contract. The group, which has been very aggressive in bidding for work in recent years, took pains yesterday to underline the security of its order book, particularly in northern England where it says average margins remain between 1 per cent and 2 per cent. In southern England contracts are lucky if they do more than cover overheads, according to Mr Birse. Gearing of 92 per cent on net debt of Pounds 24.9m may be uncomfortable but is not life threatening and is an improvement on the previous year. Judging by comments from analysts, the group convinced the market yesterday that speculation about its future had been misplaced. Nonetheless it should do little better than break-even in the current period and the share price, given the problems in the sector, will struggle to improve much. Bilfinger - which has still to win a contract in joint venture with Birse - must be feeling a little sick.</p>

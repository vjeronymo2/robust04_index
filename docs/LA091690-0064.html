			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART;  </P> <P> LETTERS LINK FAMILIES TO LOVED ONES IN MIDEAST  </P> <P> Six-year-old Kenneth wants his daddy to come back.  </P> <P> When Barrie Leonard found her husband's dirty clothes, just for a moment, it  seemed like he was home. Then she cried when she thought about where he had  gone.  </P> <P> Michael Zimmerman gets startled looks when he tells people that his wife has  been deployed to the Middle East.  </P> <P> Tonya Robinson keeps dreaming the same nightmare: saying goodby to her husband.  </P> <P> These families are trying to regain their balance after husbands and wives  departed 11 days ago aboard the San Diego-based Acadia, sailing for the Middle  East to assist in Operation Desert Shield. Their departure was abrupt -- the  destroyer tender was scheduled to ship out in January -- and there are no phone  calls at sea. Suddenly, their only link is through letters.  </P> <P> The day before Arrington Leonard shipped out, he took an old blue cotton shirt  and made a snugly pillow out of it for his 6-year-old son. The shirt smells  comfortingly like Leonard. With his father gone, Kenneth sleeps wrapped around  the "Daddy pillow." And, when the young boy is upset, he grabs for the pillow.  </P> <P> Barrie Leonard said her 10-year marriage has not always been easy and that her  husband has left home before. But this deployment is different -- the  possibility of violence looms larger. Barrie, 30, worries whether her husband,  a second class petty officer, will return in a body bag.  </P> <P> And she worries whether their marriage will survive the strain of a prolonged  separation.  </P> <P> "Depending on how he spends his time, it's going to ultimately decide whether  we stay married or not. He knows that," Barrie said in their Imperial Beach  apartment. "In my heart, I don't think he's going to blow it, but I guess we  will find out."  </P> <P> Though less than a week since Arrington, 35, departed, he has already missed a  number of significant family events: Six-month-old Johnathan's first haircut,  Kenneth's first day at school, the couple's 10-year wedding anniversary.  </P> <P>  My Dear Len: 7 Sept. 1990 2215 HR  </P> <P>  I've been keeping very busy since you've gone.  </P> <P>  The boys and I went to the park again; Johnathan really likes the grass and  Kenneth needs to keep busy. He is still having a hard time with this, honey,  but it's still early into it.  </P> <P>  The Kirby (vacuum cleaner) demonstrator came by and did a 2-hour demo (which  included cleaning quite a bit of our house). They really wanted me to go for  it, but I had to tell him, "my husband doesn't make major purchases without  talking to me, and I don't make major purchases without talking to him!" So he  wants me to talk to you about the Kirby next time you call . . . like we don't  have anything better to discuss?!  </P> <P>  Johnny got his first hair cut today. And it's forever recorded on tape. . . .  </P> <P>  I felt real tired again today. . . . I suppose I'm winding down after all the  turmoil of your departure. It took a real toll on me, too. I thought I fared  well, but I'm feeling so tired now.  </P> <P> </P> <P> I wonder how you are doing, my love! Kenny cries for you anytime the slightest  thing goes wrong for him; and I think Johnny is wondering where his daddy is  too. I imagine you are keeping busy enough to keep from getting too sad. That's  what I am doing too! I love you sweetheart. Goodnight. Isaiah 41:10  </P> <P>  Always, Barrie.  </P> <P>  Dear Len: 8 Sept. 1990 2145 HR  </P> <P>  Well, Happy Birthday Dear! I know we celebrated early, but I wish I could have  been with you on "your day!" Hopefully, you had a nice time, considering. I  miss you, babe! Happy 35th.  </P> <P>  When I checked on Kenneth tonight, he was asleep holding his pretend "Daddy"  (pillow). I'm glad that it's helping him; I wish I had one, too! . . .  </P> <P>  I came across some of your things while doing the laundry this morning. It  was, just for a moment, like you could have been there . . . and I could smell  you . . . but it was just your clothes. It made my eyes tear up -- I miss you  so. It seems so silly to cry over the laundry, Len, but I did.  </P> <P>  My father called to wish us a happy anniversary and said we "should be proud  of being able to celebrate your 10th year anniversary, considering the  hardships you've been through."  </P> <P>  I am just thankful that our marriage is growing and that we're growing even  though you're far away.  </P> <P>  Goodnight, my love!  </P> <P> Always, Barrie  </P> <P>  2230 HR xxxooo  </P> <P>  Dear Dad, 7 Sept. 1990  </P> <P>  I was wondering if you would like to have this letter and if you miss us. I  miss you.  </P> <P>  TOP SECRET  </P> <P>  xxxxoooooo Love, Ken  </P> <P> John Hunter, 13, started drawing pictures of airplanes dropping bombs and  robots menacing soldiers. In one picture, he scrawled: "Nuke Iraq."  </P> <P> His mother, Kaye Hunter, is ombudsman for the destroyer tender Acadia. And,  since its departure, she fields about 50 calls daily. Late into the night at  her Serra Mesa home she is on the phone trying to console young wives, enduring  their first separation from husbands, as well as those who've been in the Navy  for years and years.  </P> <P> Kaye Hunter's husband, Chief Petty Officer John Timothy Hunter, 37, has been in  the Navy almost 17 years and he has shipped out on six-month deployments  before. But this time, his departure was particularly hard because of the  abruptness and because of the possible danger. For Kaye Hunter, an organized  woman who plans well in advance, the sudden deployment jangled her nerves.  </P> <P> Kaye Hunter, 39, is used to chatting with her husband, filling him in on the  events at the church school where she works. She is used to watching and  discussing the news with him and taking long drives together. Now she spends  her evenings bolstering the spirits of spouses and family members who call her.  She usually waits until late at night, then she breaks down and cries.  </P> <P> Her mother came to visit after the deployment and the two women took young John  to Disneyland for the weekend. From the hotel bathroom, while her son and  mother slept, Hunter wrote to her husband.  </P> <P> (Undated, on Disneyland letterhead)  </P> <P>  Dear Tim:  </P> <P>  No, it's not a letter from Mickey!  </P> <P>  A friend of John's wound up coming at the last minute, so they are off and  running, spending those last few quarters, before they burn a hole in his  pocket!  </P> <P>  Mom and I hit Star Tours right away, as usual. We finally got John on it, and  he loved it. Just like we figured he would.  </P> <P>  The van is running good. I'm gonna check the oil tomorrow and will make a note  to check it every Sunday (right after church!). Mom and I went on all the  (rides) that were slow and cool -- Small World (kill the dolls!), train, etc.  Let's hear it for air conditioning the roller coaster!  </P> <P>  We finally found that orange stuff mom found last time she was here. Just like  frozen OJ!  </P> <P>  Our room here is the "suite" type -- a little side room for the kids, 2  bathrooms, 2 TV's. It's very nice -- AC on high, of course! . . .  </P> <P>  I am doing OK, I guess, but I miss you. This would be a much nicer weekend if  you were here, too. Did you get your seasick tablets in time? I hope so, or  else it's gonna be a long trip west! I hope all is well with you and the CD  player is running fine.  </P> <P>  I love you, Tim. You know, Capt. G was right -- it never gets any easier. I  find myself thinking, "I've got to tell Tim" and then getting kind of a lump in  my throat, since, of course, you're not there to tell! Keep yourself safe and  comfy, honey. I'll write again, soon.  </P> <P>  love,xxoo,  </P> <P>  Kaye.  </P> <P> Many people are startled when 26-year-old Michael Zimmerman tells them that his  wife, Eva -- a second class petty officer -- was deployed to the Middle East.  Zimmerman, in fact, doesn't get a lot of sympathy -- since most civilians  forget that husbands have also been left behind.  </P> <P> Eva Zimmerman's departure was particularly difficult since she is leaving the  Navy in January. Under the original schedule, her ship was supposed to deploy  this winter -- and it was an assignment she would have missed. Eva cried when  she got two weeks' notice to pack her sea bag.  </P> <P> Before she left, Michael Zimmerman asked her where she wanted to be buried. She  replied: "With you." And they discussed the subject no further.  </P> <P> For Michael Zimmerman, whose mother died when he was 12, the prospect of  anything happening to his wife is more than he can bear.  </P> <P> "It's just scary. When you love someone, you don't want to think anything will  happen," said Michael, a Lemon Grove resident who left the Navy to work  full-time as a courier and attend college at night.  </P> <P> Asked how his life is different without Eva, Michael replied bluntly: "No sex."  </P> <P> There are other changes as well. Michael wakes during the night when her cat,  Josh, pounces on his chest. "Josh jumps on me and meows -- he looks where Eva  used to sleep," Michael said. "I say, 'Josh, go to sleep.' We do that night  after night."  </P> <P> Hi Gorgeous:  </P> <P>  How are you doing on this fine day? I hope all is well and you have not  forgotten us.  </P> <P>  I have the motorcycle running again. . . . The eight-two brake setup seems to  work, and I wish you were here to go with me on its maiden voyage.  </P> <P>  There is a motorcycle course that they supply the bike, and it only costs $60.  The course has three sections, beginning, intermediate, and professional. I was  thinking once you make it to professional, if you need to take that part, I  could take it with you.  </P> <P>  When you get back, we could also lower the rear end of the bike by putting  shorter shocks on it. This would probably make it easier for you to ride. . . .  </P> <P>  I didn't go to church today, for I got up at 9:45.  </P> <P>  Michael  </P> <P> Tonya Robinson, 19, met her husband, Seaford, at a picnic in Detroit. This past  year, things happened in a blur. Seaford, also 19, joined the Navy, the couple  married, moved to San Diego, and they had their first baby -- Seaford III.  </P> <P> Tonya Robinson doesn't understand how she so abruptly lost her husband, a  machinist mate.  </P> <P> "I am in a state of shock," said Tonya, cuddling her 2-month-old baby. "My  husband and I have never been away from each other."  </P> <P> And she is plagued by the same bad dream. Over and over, she dreams that she is  saying goodby to her husband. "I just hurt inside."  </P> <P> </P> <P>  Sept. 12, 1990  </P> <P> Dear Seaford:  </P> <P>  Hi Baby, I love you. I miss you and I wish you were here with me. I hate that  you won't be here for our anniversary, your son's very first Christmas, and  bringing in the New Year. The most important one is little Seaford's first  Christmas, I wish you could come home. I just wish we could be together.  </P> <P>  I am still having dreams about when we were saying goodbye to you. I know that  when you come home we will have to start all over getting to know each other.  </P> <P>  Anyway, be careful out there. Remember we love you.  </P> <P>  Kisses,  </P> <P>  Tonya  </P></p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Wal-Mart strategy hit by ruling WAL-MART STORES, the US discount store giant, yesterday suffered a blow to its retailing strategy when an Arkansas court ruled that it had broken state law by selling a range of pharmaceutical products below cost. The ruling could have ripple effects throughout the US retailing industry by encouraging a series of similar legal suits against Wal-Mart and other store groups which price aggressively to win market share. Wal-Mart said it was 'extremely disappointed' by what it termed an 'anti-consumer' ruling and said it would immediately appeal to the Arkansas Supreme Court. Its shares fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 26. The civil suit was brought by three independent pharmacies in Conway, Arkansas, who claimed they were suffering from low prices offered by Wal-Mart on items from toothpaste to over-the-counter drugs at its Conway store. The pharmacies said Wal-Mart's pricing policies were in breach of the Arkansas Unfair Practices Act, which forbids the sale of merchandise below cost 'for the purposes of injuring competitors and destroying competition'. They claimed Dollars 1.1m in damages. Wal-Mart acknowledged that it sold some items below cost, but argued that this was part of normal retailing practice and was not intended to destroy competition. The court, however, found against Wal-Mart and ordered it to pay a total of Dollars 96,469 in damages to the three pharmacies. Wal-Mart has become America's biggest retailer by competing aggressively with smaller stores on price. Independents have often accused it of selling goods below cost to put them out of business, then raising prices once the competition had disappeared. The company has lost at least one other case of predatory pricing, in an Oklahoma state court in 1986. As a result, it agreed to raise prices in the state. This latest case is likely to encourage a flurry of suits against the company in the 22 other states with similar pricing statutes. Announcing its decision to fight the ruling, Wal-Mart said: 'If this decision is allowed to stand, the result will be higher prices - not just for Wal-Mart customers, but customers of every retail store, large and small, in Arkansas.'</p>

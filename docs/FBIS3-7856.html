			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, March 1 (AFP) -- A 12-truck Danish UNHCR  convoy was held up overnight and still blocked Tuesday [1 March]  from entering Sarajevo by Serb women demonstrating on a road, UN  High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Kris Janowski  told AFP.    He said there were dozens of women asking for their husbands  to be released from what they said was a Bosnian government  concentration camp at Pazaric, also near Sarajevo.    The convoy, escorted by two UN Spanish armored personnel  carriers, had arrived Monday afternoon in Serb-held Hadzici, 15  kilomtres (nine miles) southwest of Sarajevo. It took three  hours to clear a Serb checkpoint there and then was held up by  Monday evening by the women's demonstration.    Janowski said the blockade by civilians was similar to what  has happened to UNHCR convoys trying to get into the  Serb-besieged Moslem town of Maglaj in the north. That town has  been cut off for months from humanitarian aid.    "We're trying to talk with them, reason with them. We hope  for the best," said Janowski. "But it's certainly a problem,"  he added. Janowksi said Serb troops often checked the contents  of UNHCR convoys.    The women's demonstration occurred shortly after the convoy  had left the Serb checkpoint. The trucks spent the night  overnight at a UN checkpoint, Janowski said.    UNHCR land convoys moving through Serb territory were  suspended Monday as a security measure after NATO air attacks  over central Bosnia. The Danish convoy had, however, already  left Metkovic, in Croatia on the Adriatic coast. The UNHCR air  lift to Sarajevo was resuming Tuesday after being suspended  Monday, Janowski said. U.S. planes flying for NATO shot down  four Serb jets over Vitez in central Bosnia Monday morning.    Janowski had said Sunday the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  had decided not to negotiate the passage of convoys as it had  been doing but simply to announce their routes to Bosnia's  warring parties. But he said the convoys would not use force to  drive through checkpoints.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed MTH: "Blows for CDA and PvdA, Gain of D66 </F> Disappointing"; as released by The Hague ANP Database]    [Text] The Hague -- All leaders of the major parties called  the advance of the far right, the election result's main setback.    In Amsterdam, the CDA [Center Democratic Appeal] climbed  from  2 to 4 seats. In Rotterdam, the combined ultraright-wing  parties will probably become the second largest movement, with a  total of almost 14 percent. The CD has five councilors, CP '86  [Central Party 86] keeps its only present councilor. In  Utrecht, Janmaat's party (CD) tripled, and has now three  councilors. In addition, the city is witnessing the entry of  the Dutch Block, headed by Janmaat's former companion Vreeswijk.  In the Hague, the CD doubles its number of seats from 2 to 4,  while CP'86 keeps its only present seat.    A conversion to the consequences for the House of  Representatives, is very precarious. First of all, the  municipal elections are characterized by the phenomenon of local  lists, secondly the turnout is generally higher for  parliamentary elections, and a third uncertain factor is that,  in local elections, the voter may vote for a well-known  candidate of a different (national) party than in national  elections. However, this does not alter the fact that municipal  elections are generally considered to be a reliable poll for  parliamentary elections.    Converted to the House, the CDA [Christian Democratic  Appeal]  would take a dramatic plunge of 15 seats to only 39 seats. The  PvdA [Labor Party] would also suffer a considerable loss, and  would keep 32 of its present 49 seats. The VVD [People's Party  for Freedom and Democracy] would win six seats, and arrive at 28  seats. D66 [Democrats 66] would soar from 10 to 22 seats,  Groenlinks [Green Left] would double its number of seats to 12.  SGP [Political Reformed Party], GPV [Reformed Political Union]  and RPF [Reformational Political Federation]) combined would  climb from 6 to 11 seats. The CD would grow from its present  one seat to 4. The SP [Socialist Party] would enter Parliament  with 2 seats.    The outcome of the municipal elections shows an almost  terrifying correspondence with the latest poll conducted by  Inter/view last Monday on behalf of Press Agency ANP and current  affairs feature Nova.    Considering a reliability margin of 1.5 percent for the  major  parties, the poll was perfectly correct. The only exception is  the considerably lower gain for D66 (22 seats instead of the  anticipated 28), which Inter/view failed to forecast. CDA's 39  seats correspond to the 38 forecasted on Monday. This is also  true for PvdA's 32 seats (was 31). VVD's score of 28 was  perfectly correct, as well as GroenLinks' 12. The CD's  converted 4 seats were also exactly as forecasted.</p>

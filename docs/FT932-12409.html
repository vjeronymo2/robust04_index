			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Tokai Bank senior rating downgraded by Moody's TOKAI Bank, a leading Japanese commercial bank, had its senior rating downgraded from A1 to A2 yesterday by Moody's, the US credit ratings agency, which said the bank's core earnings were under pressure and non-performing loans were an increasing burden. The agency said Tokai, based in the central city of Nagoya, had a 'high level' of exposure to the international and domestic property markets and, like many other banks, problems with finance company affiliates, the so-called non-banks. Mitsubishi Trust and Banking is to take advantage of financial reforms to establish a brokerage subsidiary later this year to expand its role in domestic bond markets. The Japanese government introduced reforms at the beginning of this month allowing trust and long-term credit banks to open brokerage subsidiaries, though excluding these units from dealing in the stock market. Banks expect that the finance ministry will broaden the range of institutions permitted to open new subsidiaries next year, and gradually allow them to deal in stocks. Mitsubishi said its new unit would be capitalised at about Y20bn and employ 30 staff.</p>

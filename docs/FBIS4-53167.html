			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 18 May 1994 Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Vice ministerial-level preliminary negotiations on  the resumption of Japan-U.S. economic framework talks will begin  on 19 May. The main purpose of the negotiations is to air views  on the conditions for resuming talks set by the United  States--these include the enforcement of macroeconomic measures  such as tax reduction, and the setting of objective criteria to  measure the degree of market liberalization. The negotiations  are expected to deal with a range of issues, including a  possible compromise agreement to set objective criteria only on  government procurements. Efforts to converge views will be  hastened at working-level negotiations so that the framework  talks may resume before the Japan-U.S. summit in July.    The government will send Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy vice  minister for foreign affairs, and Suzaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice  minister for international trade and industry, to the  preliminary negotiations in Washington, and they will begin  informal meetings with U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey  Kantor and Deputy USTR Charlene Barshefsky to find a  breakthrough to the impasse in the framework talks. They will  hear specific explanations of three U.S.-demanded conditions,  including macroeconomic measures and clarification of the  purpose of the framework talks, and will present Japan's  responses to them. They will probe to uncover the real  intention of the United States, whose position on macroeconomic  measures can be interpreted as having softened somewhat.    The focus of the negotiations will be the search for a  compromise on the question of setting objective criteria. Since  U.S. President Clinton declared "we are not seeking numerical  targets," Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa has proposed  setting "some kind of quantum [ryoteki] criteria which would not  lead to actual numerical targets." Negotiations will  concentrate on this issue, though also discuss ways to expand  imports of foreign commodities and services into Japan.    Of the three priority areas of government procurement,  automobiles and auto parts, and insurance, Japan feels  government procurements is one in which deregulation on access  procedures has made progress, and see agreement near to  realization. Japan is expected to propose the idea of setting  criteria in the area of government procurement first. It will  also try to steer the United States toward a compromise by  presenting a "step-by-step approach" to deal with the question  of setting criteria in the areas of insurance and automobiles  and auto parts.    As far as macroeconomic measures are concerned, Japan will  seek the understanding of the United States by announcing its  intention to continue reducing income taxes into next year and  beyond. The United States is concerned lest the current delay  in finding a breakthrough in Japan-U.S. economic relations leads  the dollar to lose value further and long-term interest rates to  rise.    The U.S. attitude toward Japan appears to have softened on  the surface at least, but Japan wants to know its "true  intentions" under the surface. It also wants to exchange  information to help determine whether demands are acceptable.</p>

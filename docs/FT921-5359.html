			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Social Fund receives Pounds 34m boost THE GOVERNMENT yester-day announced a Pounds 34m increase in the Social Fund which provides discretionary loans and grants for people on social security. This follows a Pounds 41m boost in August and will take the fund's budget for 1992-93 to Pounds 302m - more than 30 per cent higher than the amount budgeted last April for the current year. The announcement was made soon after publication of a report from the Social Security Advisory Committee which was critical of the fund's inadequate budget. The official social security watchdog also called for the operation of the fund to be restructured to make it fairer. Benefits offices can currently use up their share of the cash-limited fund. This means that applications refused in one area could succeed in another. The committee described this as 'inequitable'. The report proposed changes to the rules so that fewer non-repayable grants would be made and funds available for grants and repayable loans would not run out. Mr Nicholas Scott, social security minister, welcomed the committee's report. He said it would be considered after the completion of another study, by researchers at York University.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Brown attacks Rosyth timetable The rundown of the Rosyth naval base in Fife was a 'high-risk' option for the Royal Navy, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said yesterday. Mr Brown, whose Dunfermline East constituency includes Rosyth, produced a two-page naval signal marked 'restricted', sent from the commander of the Faslane naval base on the Clyde to officials at Rosyth in July. The Faslane commander warns in the signal that some facilities will not be available for the transferred mine - sweeper squadron until late 1996. He says a satisfactory outcome to a 'challenging programme' will depend on getting enough men and money to manage it. In particular, the commander warns that there is a 'high risk' of being unable to convert two berths at Faslane by 1996 for the minesweepers to occupy long-term. There is a similar risk, he says, that specialist storage facilities will not be completed in 1996. The Rosyth base is to be run down and its minesweeper squadrons transferred to Portsmouth and Faslane as part of defence spending cuts. Speaking at Inverkeithing near Rosyth, Mr Brown claimed Faslane was unable to take the transferred workload from Rosyth without massive investment. He said: 'The timetable for the closure of Rosyth naval base by 1996 cannot be met. Faslane is unable to take the Rosyth workload without massive financial investment. 'The whole project was not properly costed when the decision was made. The timetable runs the risk of going completely wrong.' Mr Brown said the decision to run down Rosyth was made without proper financial information, without justification and without explanation of the difficulties of timing. He said he had screened the signal and carefully removed any confidential or secret information that had no bearing on the Rosyth case. This would be used in the Save Rosyth campaign's reply to the closure plans. 'The closure of Rosyth naval base has become the high-risk, high-cost and high-unemployment option and should be rejected,' he said.</p>

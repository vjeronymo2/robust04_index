			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> BRITON DISRUPTS POPE'S AUDIENCE  </P> <P> A Briton was dragged out of Pope John Paul II's general audience today after he  jumped up, screamed "I am the son of God, I am Christ!" and told the Pope:  "I'll take your place."  </P> <P> Security men, papal Swiss Guards and stewards immobilized the man after he  rushed to an aisle from a seat at the back of the hall and appeared to head  toward the stage where the Pope was sitting. Witnesses said the man, identified  as Joseph McGovern, 23, of London, also claimed to have received revelations  about the end of the world. McGovern was held for questioning but a Vatican  spokesman said no charges would be brought.  </P></p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Redrow at 5% discount on first day of dealings - New Issues First day dealings in Redrow, the latest housebuilder to come to the market, ended with the shares trading at 128p - representing a 5 per cent discount to the issue price of 135p, writes Andrew Taylor. At one stage the shares had been as low as 118p but recovered by the close. The issue, which raised Pounds 55.4m of new money for the company and Pounds 62m for Mr Steve Morgan, the founder and chief executive, has fallen foul of the recent fatigue regarding new issues, particularly by housebuilders. Of the minimum 21.75m shares offered to the public only 17.12m, or 78.7 per cent, were taken up. The issue was fully underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, with Cazenove acting as broker.</p>

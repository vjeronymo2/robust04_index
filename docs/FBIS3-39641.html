Spokesman Djoeke Koekoek said a number of trucks, including  some registered in the Netherlands, had been stopped by Greek  border guards from crossing into Macedonia.    The government here was alerted by the Dutch association of  international transporters, EVO, after receiving a flood of  telephone calls from drivers stuck at the border.    EVO demanded late Thursday that Athens let the trucks  through, threatening to send the Greeks the bill for the lost  business otherwise. It advised its members to start transiting  though Bulgaria, Hungary or Romania.    Since the start of the Yugoslav civil war most trucks from  the Netherlands have gone by ferry to Greek ports from Brindisi  in southern Italy.    Greece Wednesday closed its port of Salonika to Macedonian  goods, severing its northern neighbour's main lifeline. There  was no immediate word from Athens on the Dutch charges on  Thursday.    Greece accuses Macedonia of usurping a name which Athens  says  is solely part of Greek heritage and of harbouring expansionist  ambitions over the Greek province of the same name.    Dutch European Affairs Minister Piet Dunkert made a brief  visit to Athens Thursday for talks with his Greek counterpart  Theodoros Pangalos which included the Greek measures against  Macedonia.    An aide to the minister said that if Greece closed more  ports  it could mean an infringement of European law on goods in  transit.</p>

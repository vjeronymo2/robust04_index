			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Support found for dispute mediation British industry could save millions in legal costs each year by resolving contractual disputes through mediation rather than litigation or arbitration, says a survey of publicly quoted companies by Herbert Smith, a City law firm. Support for the concept of alternative dispute resolution from 60 companies in the computing, construction, insurance and oil sectors will boost mediation in the UK. Since the CBI-backed Centre for Dispute Resolution was launched in 1990 to promote ADR, the use of mediation services by industry has been small. The centre has handled just 400 cases involving about Pounds 1.5bn. The Herbert Smith survey showed that almost all the companies had been involved in litigation in the past two years, with 44 per cent expressing some dissatisfaction with the cost and time involved. A typical court case was said to take up to two years to resolve. Satisfaction with mediation among the 10 per cent of the companies which had tried ADR was high. ADR users found mediation saved time and money and was less confrontational, allowing the parties to maintain relationships. The main disadvantage of ADR was the uncertainty of the outcome in the absence of the structured nature of litigation, although the Centre for Dispute Resolution claims a successful outcome in more than 90 per cent of cases. Paradoxically, the lack of a structured approach was identified as one of its main advantages.</p>

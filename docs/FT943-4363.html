			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Lasers can clean dirty buildings Lasers can clean the dirty faces of old buildings more effectively than the conventional methods of blasting with abrasive powder or high-pressure water, the British Association meeting heard. Although building conservators have been talking for 20 years about using lasers to remove industrial grime, practical and affordable systems are only now coming into use, said Mr John Larson of National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside. He heads the first UK project to develop a laser for cleaning buildings and sculpture. The system has been tested successfully on patches of delicate stone carving on Lincoln and Salisbury cathedrals and on the terracotta exterior of the Henry Cole wing at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The V&amp;A now plans to raise money from the Millennium Fund to clean the whole Henry Cole wing by laser. Lasers have been used more extensively in Italy and France, including cleaning the whole front of Amiens cathedral. The crust of dirt on stone or other material 'absorbs laser energy, which swells the dirt, lifts it off the surface and partly vaporises it,' Mr Larson said. 'When the laser reaches the clean surface, all the energy is reflected back and the conservator can rely on it not to remove any more material.' That is one advantage over conventional abrasive techniques, which are liable to remove some undamaged material with the dirt, according to Mr Larson. Another is that it avoids the creation of large amounts of mess and debris. National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside is negotiating with an unnamed American company to commercialise the system. Each one is likely to cost in the region of Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 30,000. As Mr Larson pointed out, it would be an unusual step for a public museum to develop a product in this way in collaboration with the private sector. 'Our trustees are very keen to go ahead - and at the same time nervous about it,' he said. He and his colleagues are also working on an ultra-violet laser for cleaning and removing varnish from paintings.</p>

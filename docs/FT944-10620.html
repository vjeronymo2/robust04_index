			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Labour leader stresses 'interdependence of business and the community' Mr Blair, addressing the Per Cent Club, spoke of the 'interdependence of business and the community', Alan Pike writes. The club, he said, was a recognition by business that it had a responsibility to wider society. Business involvement in the community was more than an act of charity. 'Our communities are your customers, and communities are your employees. The state of society beyond the factory gate, the shop window and the office entrance matters to business.' Mr Blair supported the idea of a national youth and community service scheme.</p>

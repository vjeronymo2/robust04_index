			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] In its 25 January issue, Cairo 'AQIDATI  publishes on pages 1, 12, and 13 a 1,200-word report on a new  experiment started by the Awqaf Ministry involving setting up  "fatwa boxes" in the its mosques, where ordinary people can  place any questions that require an Islamic legal ruling.    A 75-word report on the front page cites the mufti as  denying  a report published by a Gulf paper that included his name on a  list of those who are defending British writer Salman Rushdie.  Mufti Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi asked, "How could I defend a  person who is mentally deranged and who had the nerve to mock  Islam and its teachings and to ridicule God's prophet?" He then  asserts that the Gulf paper's report was baseless, adding that  he personally boycotts anyone who gets in touch with Rushdie.    The paper also carries a 200-word report on page 2 saying  that the secretariat general of the Higher Committee of Islamic  Propagation in al-Azhar and the Awqaf Ministry are preparing for  a series of intellectual meetings and seminars to be held during  the month of Ramadan. The report says that these meetings will  discuss major issues such as drugs and how to combat them, Islam  and the environment, social problems, Islam and the extent of  the comprehensive development, and unemployment. The  discussions will also include other major issues, such as "the  issue of apostasy, its gravity and controls, and also Islam's  call for security and stability, as well as the nation's unity  in its capacity as the safety valve and the challenge." The  report adds that "the regiments of propagation, leaders, and  writers will visit the governorates throughout the month to  discuss these issues, with the participation of the moderate  Islamic societies and there will be a special emphasis on the  villages to rid them of false ideas."    A 2,500-report is carried on pages 4 and 5 detailing the  proceedings of a seminar organized by 'AQIDATI at the Arab  Language College in al-Zaqaziq University. The seminar, which  involved answers from various scholars and teachers to questions  posed by the students, dealt with the causes of various  interpretations of the Koran throughout history. Several  scholars stressed that each person has the right to think,  argue, and ask questions and should not just accept what earlier  scholars and interpreters of Islam said without thinking. Dr.  Su'ad Salih, dean of Islamic and Arab Studies at the al-Mansurah  Branch of al-Azhar University, then explains the Koran's rules  on women's dresses.    In reply to a question by one of the students about the  causes of the phenomenon of terrorism and whether the Islamic  groups are involved, Dr. Sa'd-al-Din Salih, dean of the Religion  and Propagation College in al-Zaqaziq University, says: "There  are several expressions that we have become used to hearing from  the Western media, such as fundamentalist and Muslim terrorism.  These are used by the Western media, which is financed by the  Jews to make people frightened of Islam. This media does not  differentiate between an observant Muslim and what it calls  terrorists and extremists." He quotes Prophet Muhammad as  urging his followers not to exaggerate or go to extremes in  their religion. Giving the historic reasons for this  phenomenon, he says: "The first reason is that religious  teaching is neutralized and completely separate from civic  teaching, which has no interest in teaching religion except on  the margin and the marks given for this subject are not added to  the total marks. The second reason is that there is a group of  people who have taken it on themselves to attack religion and to  call for moral decadence. Extremism in decadence leads to  extremism in religion. Hence the state must tackle these two  causes to eliminate the phenomenon of terrorism." The seminar  then discusses the plight of Muslims in Bosnia and elsewhere and  concludes that the Muslims themselves are to be blamed for this  because they are divided and attack each other. Dr. Muhammad  'Abd-al-Mun'im al-'Arabi, teacher of literature and criticism at  the Arab Language College, says on this issue that: "The Islamic  world must use economic boycott and political pressure in  support of its causes. We have to preach and contribute our  money to support our brothers dispersed in the world."    On pages 8 and 9, the paper carries questions from several  readers asking for a religious ruling on various issues.  Included in them is a question from Wajih al-Jamal from  al-Qalyubiyah asking about the meaning of terrorism and Islam's  concept of it. Shaykh Mahmud 'Abd-al-Wahhab Fayid replies that  Islam calls for moderation in all matters in our life, citing  several Koranic verses. He adds that Islam rejects terrorism,  whether from the rulers or the ruled, because terrorism means  the use of violence and frightening people.    A 350-word column written by Majdi Salim on page 10  criticizes the Egyptian media's way of confronting the western  immoral and debased programs that are transmitted through  satellite. He says this media tries to outdo the Western one by  transmitting still more decadent programs and liberalism that  defies laws and controls. He argues that the only way to combat  this cultural invasion is to strengthen religious beliefs at  school, home, work, and through the media.    On the same page the paper carries a 700-word report on a  seminar on "intellectual extremism" held at Cairo University.  The report begins by citing Mufti Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi's  explanation of the origin of the word extremism. He adds that  Islam calls on its followers to be moderate in all their affairs  and daily life. Muslim thinker Dr. Ahmad Kamal Abu-al-Majd  lashes out at those "who do not differentiate between piety and  extremism and swear that there are no moderates. I tell them  that the Egyptian people are moderate, perform the prayers, and  fast during the month [of Ramadan]." He then adds that the  crises facing us are the result of the custom among Egyptians,  Arabs, and Muslims to regard "reading as an absolute evil to the  extent that Arab and Muslim thinking was afflicted by a great  imbalance in logical education and this is manifested by the  absence of the literature of dialogue." After stressing the  universality of Islam, he says that: "Islam's priorities today  are to guide its people toward it and to strengthen it and not  to call on people to follow it. The evil afflicting the Islamic  groups from east to west is that they are preoccupied with Islam  at the expense of Muslims and they believe that their mission is  to train jurisprudents only."    Dr. Mufid Shihab, Cairo University President, differentiates  between extremism, violence, and terrorism and explains each  one. He says extremism is deviation that has not reached the  extent of harming others, while violence means the use of force  or the threat to use it against others, which is a violation of  the law, while terrorism means the use of violence and force,  contrary to the law, not with the aim of harming a certain  person but to cause general destruction and ruin. He adds that:  "?he terrorist is a criminal and has to be dealt with according  to the law." He th?n conjectures that dialogue and not violence  or punishment is the only way to deal with an extremist who does  not harm others. He says that "extremism is a first step that  might turn into terrorism. We must stop it before it turns into  terrorism. Therefore, the treatment differs from case to case.  There can be no dialogue with the terrorist or criminal but  there has to be a dialogue with the extremists in an attempt to  explain the truth."    Dr. 'Ali-al-Din Hilal, teacher at the College of Economics  and Political Science, Cairo University, then argues that  extremism exists in the mind and behavior and that there is  extremism not only among Islamic groups but also among some  Christian and Jewish groups and among various ethnic groups in  other parts of the world.    'AQIDATI carries on page 16 an 800-word report on a question  and answer session held by a "religious convoy" with the  students of Alexandria and al-Mansurah Universities. The  questions deal with the contradicting fatwas, population  control, drug addiction, and other issues. Following a  teacher's reply to a question on drug addiction, Dr. Muhammad  Hasan al-Hafnawi, teacher at al-Azhar's School of Medicine,  answers a question by Suhayr Muhammad al-Bardisi on the reasons  for the spread of terrorism in this way that harms Islam. He  says that: "Ignorance is the main reason. The extremist has  filled his brain with wrong information and followed it and thus  has turned into an extremist. He would not have become so had  he understood his religion well. The first step to reform him  is science, then conviction, and then guidance of the right  will. True religious knowledge is the safety valve against  deviation. All the forces must rally for this decisive  confrontation. Who will defend Egypt if its sons lose faith in  it?"    The Awqaf minister then answers a question on why the state  has canceled some religious television programs. He explains  that each program has its own temporary objective and is meant  to tackle a specific point. Management then replaces it with  new programs that raise new issues for debate.    On page 20, the paper carries a 900-word report on an  interview with Moroccan Muslim thinker Muhammad al-Wazzani in  which he discusses the plight of Bosnia's Muslims, the situation  in Somalia, and the spread of Islam in Africa. He also asserts  that the "terrorist actions" in Algeria and Egypt "have nothing  to do with Islam and are alien to our Muslim societies."</p>

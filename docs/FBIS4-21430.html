			<p>BFN     [Text] Vientiane -- Laotian officials have expressed  concern about the feasibility of the proposed Khon Phapheng  Resort mega project at Li Phi falls in the southern province of  Champassak.    Thai developers plan to invest in the Bt [baht] 12 billion  tourism development, which would comprise an international  airport, a 10-megawatt hydropower station, 100,000-hectares of  eucalyptus plantations, two 18-hole golf courses, a 1,200-room  hotel, 1,000 resort units and a casino.    An official in Vientiane who asked not to be named said the  area is plagued with Schistosomiasis disease, better known as  blood fluke.    ``We are suspicious of how the project is going to bring in  tourists as Schistosomiasis is widespread, unless the project  has a plan to eliminate the disease first,'' said the officer.    ``We are concerned that the project might fail, after having  already irreversibly destroyed nature in Laos,'' he said.    Chanthaviphon Inthavon. deputy director of the National  Office for Nature Conservation and Watershed Management in  Vientiane, said he was worried about the proposal to transform  100,000 hectare of dry deciduous forest into eucalyptus  plantations.    ``It is too ambitious,'' he said.    Chanthaviphon said the nature conservation committee had  suggested the area planted to eucalyptus should be scaled down.    ``We recommended that only a limited area, not full scale  development, for the plantations project should be approved as a  study whether it will really work,'' he said.    Dr. Tysons Robert, a fish biologist of Mahidon University  and  one of the few scientists studying the Lower Mekong Basin, said  the project's impact on fish and riverine ecology is among major  environmental concerns.    Robert said the location of Li Phi falls is unique in the  whole Mekong system, with rapids extending over 3-5 kilometres.    ``It is the only place where the main channel of the Mekong  has such a big waterfall, separating the lower river from the  upper river. So it provides a lot of habitats in a long place  and fish are different,'' said Robert.    ``Waterfalls or rapids are healthy places for fish. It's  good for food, with a lot of oxygen. Many fish prefer to live  in places with fast flowing water and a rocky habitat. There  are more fish than other places.''    Robert said the proposed golf course would probably be kept  green through the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, as  well as water from the mainstream Mekong. All of this could  affect the fish ecology in the area.    ``Water draining from the golf course, which has a lot of  strange chemicals in it, could have a very bad effect on fish,''  noted Robert.    Another Laotian official told THE NATION that the small  hydro-power station will be located at the edge of Khon Phapheng  fall and will use a ``floating generation system''.    The Khon Phapheng resort is planned to be the first  development project on the mainstream of the Lower Mekong Basin.</p>

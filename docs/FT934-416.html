			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Irredeemably attractive - Bonds With most bond and equity markets continuing their strong rallies, and the most optimistic forecasters starting to predict interest rates of 3 per cent, investing for income will become increasingly difficult. If the predictions are anywhere near accurate, income-seeking investors should give careful consideration to bonds. Irredeemable bonds - those with no fixed repayment date - such as permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs), preference shares and certain Euro-sterling issues offer the highest incomes at present. The table shows that some very high yields are available from Birmingham Midshires Pibs, an issue from the country's 13th-largest building society. We also highlight an issue from Britannia but there are several others, details of which can be obtained from stockbrokers or other professional advisers. Professional investors assess the value of bonds by monitoring, among other things, the 'yield spread': the difference between the yield of the bond and that of comparable gilts. Despite the strength in price terms, it is interesting to note that the spreads for many irredeemables are virtually unchanged from the start of the year. At the start of 1993, Britannia 13 per cent Pibs were offered at 11.42 per cent compared with 8.78 per cent from long gilts (a spread of 264 basis points), whereas now the Pibs are 9.08 per cent and the gilts 6.52 per cent (a spread of 256 basis points). More important: in proportional terms, the Pibs' yield is nearly 40 per cent greater than the gilt yield, having been only 30 per cent at the start of the year. Severe pre-Budget weakness in the price of preference shares led to a 7 per cent post-Budget rally when the feared changes to advance corporation tax did not occur. Many preference shares have made gains of 15 per cent during the year. There are, of course, risks involved with buying irredeemable issues. First, they rank as one of the lowest creditors in the event of financial difficulties. Second, the capital value of your investment will depend on market forces (ie, you can get back your capital only by selling the investment at whatever price is available at the time). Thus if expectations for interest rates or inflation rise, the value of your investment will probably fall. A third concern could be demands from issuers to raise new capital through these instruments. Michael Dyson is a director of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Capital Markets Ltd. This is a market-maker and cannot deal with private clients direct; those interested in buying bonds should approach a broker.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FIXED INTEREST SECURITIES FOR PRIVATE INVESTORS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Coupon              Call     Yd to   Inc Issuer                           %     Price     date   call sa   yield  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High income (paid net) Birmingham Midshires PIBS     9.375   103.25      n/a       n/a    9.08 Britannia PIBS                13.00   143.75      n/a       n/a    9.04 Bk of Scotland Pref            9.75   145.5       n/a       n/a    8.46  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- General Accident Pref         8.875   131         n/a       n/a    8.49 High income (payable  gross offshore) Scottish Amicable EuroPounds  8.500    99.06   30/6/2018   8.43    8.58 Ryl Bank of Scot EuroPounds   9.500   114.06   12/8/2018   8.33    8.33 Barclays Bank EuroPounds      9.000   110.25    11/10/23   7.92    8.16  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    Interest         Net Inc                                       dates             25%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High income (paid net) Birmingham Midshires PIBS           1/3 1/9            6.81 Britannia PIBS                     endJa/Jl            6.78 Bk of Scotland Pref                endMa/Nv            6.77 General Accident Pref               1/1 1/7            6.79  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High income (payable  gross offshore) Scottish Amicable EuroPounds           30/6            6.44 Ryl Bank of Scot EuroPounds            12/8            6.25 Barclays Bank EuroPounds              11/10            6.12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NB Capital gains arising from the sale of preference shares may give rise to a CGT liability.

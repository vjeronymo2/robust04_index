			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Mellor resigns after backbench support evaporates MR DAVID Mellor resigned as national heritage secretary last night after accepting finally that a summer-long onslaught by tabloid newspapers, and, more recently, pressure from Conservative MPs, made it impossible for him to remain in his job. Mr John Major, the prime minister, accepted Mr Mellor's decision as executive officers of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee met to consider demanding Mr Mellor's resignation because of the damage he was causing the government. The announcement came less than 24 hours after Mr Mellor launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage his career in a series of television interviews in which he protested that he had been caught in 'a trial of strength between the tabloids and the prime minister'. But Mr Mellor had said he would step down if his remaining in the government became an embarrassment to colleagues. As MPs returned to Westminster for the emergency debate on the economy, it was clear his support on the Tory backbenches was slipping away, with the 1922 executive preparing to act as executioners. Sir Marcus Fox, 1922 Committee chairman, rang Mr Mellor yesterday morning. Mr Major, who invested much political capital in remaining loyal to Mr Mellor during the summer, accepted the resignation with 'deep regret'. But it appears he made little attempt to dissuade Mr Mellor. The toppling of Mr Mellor - the first cabinet resignation apart from reshuffles since Mr Major became prime minister - added to the air of political crisis surrounding the government. Mr Mellor was a close friend of Mr Major, and fellow football supporter, as well as being responsible for a department created by the prime minister after the general election. A successor is expected to be announced shortly. Speculation last night centred on Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office minister, or Baroness Blatch, education minister. Mr Mellor telephoned Downing Street before 9am yesterday, saying he was minded to resign. He met Mr Major before cabinet in the morning and spoke again on the telephone afterwards. Mr Mellor also met Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, before handing his resignation letter to Mr Major as the prime minister left the Commons after his speech on the economy. Mr Mellor will make a Commons statement today. In his letter, Mr Mellor said he had 'concluded that it is too much to expect of my colleagues in government and in parliament to have to put up with a constant barrage of stories about me in certain tabloid newspapers'. On allegations that he had acted improperly in accepting a paid holiday in 1990 from Mrs Mona Bauwens, daughter of a Palestine Liberation Organisation member, Mr Mellor wrote that he was glad Mr Major had 'been able to make clear that . . . I have acted within the guidance on the conduct of ministers'. He also thanked Mr Major for deciding his 'folly' in becoming embroiled in an affair revealed in July, 'did not warrant leaving the government'. His resignation brought expressions of regret from prominent members of the arts world. 'It is a thousand pities that his tenure as secretary of state for a brand-new department, which was so full of promise, has been cut short in such tragic circumstances,' said Lord Palumbo, chairman of the Arts Council. Mr Peter Jonas, general director of English National Opera, said: 'It is a tragedy for the arts, for the country and the most unfair and cruel thing to have happened to a man who was potentially the best secretary of state we could ever have had.' Mr Bryan Gould, Labour's national heritage spokesman who pressed the prime minister over Mr Mellor's conduct, said it 'has become increasingly clear that Mr Mellor was in breach of rules regarding ministerial conduct and that has prevented him from carrying out his duties'. But Mr Gould added that, 'in many ways today is a sad day for Britain's cultural life'. Mellor pays price, Page 8 Editorial Comment, Page 16</p>

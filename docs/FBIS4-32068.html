			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [HINA report: "Government's Office for Displaced Persons and </F> Refugees Warns: Western Bosnia Being Intensively `Cleansed'"]    [Text] "The latest convoys with a very large number  of Croats and Muslims indicate that the Serb authorities in the  occupied regions are continuing with ethnic cleansing, but also  that Croatia is having an increasingly difficult time caring for  such large numbers of refugees and displaced persons."    Zagreb--On Thursday, the government's Office for Displaced  Persons and Refugees sent a letter to foreign embassies in the  Republic of Croatia and to the media repeating the warning that  it is at the limit of its abilities in caring for all the  refugees, especially those who continue to arrive. "Once again  we call on all international bodies, governments and government  bodies, and the international political community to halt ethnic  cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to help the Croatian state  to care adequately for the approximately half a million  displaced persons and refugees," the letter states.    The letter recalls that two weeks ago the office similarly  warned of an intensification and continuation of quiet ethnic  cleansing in western Bosnia, which the Serb authorities have  been conducting for two years now, but which they have been  intensifying in recent months. "We were prompted to send out  this letter," it goes on, "by the increasingly frequent and  ever-larger convoys with new refugees of non-Serb nationality  from Banja Luka, Prijedor, Kotor Varos, Prnjavor, and Derventa,  who seek refuge from violence in Croatia."    The latest such convoy, which arrived in Croatia with 600  new  Muslim and Croat refugees on Tuesday, 31 May through the  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] checkpoint at Dragalic near Nova  Gradiska, motivated the Office for Displaced Persons and  Refugees to "warn about the same problem for the umpteenth  time--ethnic cleansing in western Bosnia and the arrival of an  increasing number of refugees in Croatia, and the inability of  Croatia to care for all these people under current conditions."    "Especially worrisome is the fact that this convoy was again  organized by the Serb authorities in Bosnia, through their  Serbian Red Cross, literally deporting these people," the Office  for Displaced Persons and Refugees emphasizes.    The letter also alleges that some of the people on the  convoy  had entry or transit permits for Croatia, but that there are  indications that some of those permits were forged. The majority  of the people arrived with only a little clothing, and around  200 of them sought assistance from the Office for Displaced  Persons and Refugees the very next day. "On Wednesday and  Thursday, they were assigned mostly to the Gasinci refugee  center near Djakovo, which meant that we were forced to overfill  the already inadequate living quarters. We must note that  neither the office nor any international body knew about the  arrival of this convoy," the letter emphasizes.    "Based on the number of new refugees, the latest convoy is  an  indication that the arrival of the remaining Croats and Muslims  from that part of Bosnia can be expected shortly. That would  complete the ethnic cleansing of western Bosnia, and Croatia  would be inundated with new refugees," according to the  assessment of the Office for Displaced Persons and Refugees. The  office again warned that there are no new structures for  organized housing and that the only solution is to house them in  structures that are already overcrowded. In addition, an  increasing number of hitherto privately housed displaced persons  and refugees--of whom there are around 400,000--are seeking  organized housing.</p>

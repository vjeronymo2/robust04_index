It is not ruled out that in  connection with the forthcoming parliamentary elections in a few  months' time the wave of terror in the republic could rise even  higher -- some political adversaries could settle accounts with  the aid of weapons....    Street hooliganism and thefts have become everyday  occurrences in the life of Makhachkala and none of the city's  inhabitants has felt safe. That is why the republic's  leadership has deemed it necessary to take emergency measures to  combat crime. From the first days of the New Year militia  patrols have received the right to check the documents of all  citizens and to search all vehicles. Those who have come to  Makhachkala for no specific purpose can be expelled from the  city within 24 hours. The special regime has been introduced  for six months, and time will tell whether it is extended.    According to Magomed Magomedov, the head of the city  administration, and Gadzhimagomed Gadzhimagomedov, chief of the  internal affairs main administration, the militia has embarked  on the special regime program in a state of full combat  readiness. Reinforced detachments of internal affairs main  administration staffers are serving at stations, markets,  hotels, and airports. They have already made a "haul": Several  owners of unregistered weapons have been arrested.    Understandably, the measures which have been adopted have  been greeted with mixed feelings by the city's inhabitants: It  is unpleasant for anyone to be subjected to total checks and to  get involved in roundups, on the other hand nor could they  tolerate the criminal anarchy. Indeed, the experience of the  emergency situation in Moscow has shown that it is usually only  the small "minnows" who get caught in the nets of such street  checks, the big "sharks" are seldom caught without painstaking  searching and investigation work.    However that may be, it is not out of the question that the  Makhachkala experiment will be a positive or negative example to  other cities, where crime is also rampant. In January it will  already be clear whether it has given a good account of itself.</p>

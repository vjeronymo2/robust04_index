			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Observer: Meals on wheels After successful forays into Britain's communications and security businesses, where else to turn - except to the bed and breakfast lark? Securicor has plans to dish up two types of porridge: one at a small hotel chain, dominated by the Richmond Gate Hotel in Surrey, the other in two new prisons the company hopes to build and operate. Roger Wigg, Securicor's chief executive, reckons the company's experience in both enforced and voluntary leisure sectors admirably equips it for the new ventures. When booking a room, please ensure you get the correct establishment.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 6 (CTK) -- It is the unambiguous  goal of the new Slovak Government to speed up the process of  economic transformation in a way society can bear, Prime  Minister Jozef Moravcik told the Bratislava diplomatic corps  today.    Moravcik said the government would take concrete steps to  develop the private sector, support small and medium businesses,  increase the competitiveness of Slovak products, and create job  opportunities.    He also promised that privatization would be speeded up in a  fair way. "We welcome more active participation by foreign  investors in the privatization process in the Slovak Republic,"  he said.    The government also intended to create the necessary  conditions for the broadest possible integration of the Slovak  economy into European and world economic structures.    Even though his government will only last until the  elections  six months from now, it would introduce innovations into the  economy that should outlive the government's term of office,  Moravcik said.</p>

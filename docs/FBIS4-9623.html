			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Edvard Popovic: "Hello, the Director Here"] </F>   [Text] Both Vrdoljak and Bolkovic are more  interesting as Croatian media cliches than as individuals or  personalities. Both of them entered the program directly, not as  listeners or viewers, but rather as directors, and for both of  them the telephone has been a remote control.    The intervention at Radio Sljemen, the electricity cutoff  for  Youth Television [OTV], and the blocking of an announced  Croatian Television [HRT] broadcast during the past 10 days have  caused an uproar among the Croatian public. In the first  incident, Antun Vrdoljak, by telephone, in the ether--the  occasion is completely meaningless--resolved with broadcast  director Zvonko Sebo things that are usually resolved in  editorial staff meetings. In the second case, OTV's program  director, Romano Bolkovic, used the telephone to try to "shut  off" Nightmare Stage [in English as published] director Zeljko  Malnar, and when he failed, the electricity in the studio was  shut off and thus the broadcast was interrupted. In the third  case, the elements of the "game" are well-known: the broadcast  (Latinica), the director (Denis Latin), and the guests (Mile  Dedakovic Jastreb and Tomislav Mercep), while the one who one  shut it off is so far unknown. Actually, the names of those who  shut it off (the censors) are not even important here--in this  case both Vrdoljak and Bolkovic are more interesting as Croatian  media cliches than as individuals or personalities. Both of  them, in fact, "entered" the program directly, but not private  persons, i.e., as "ordinary" listeners and viewers, but rather  as directors of the media in question, and both of them used the  telephone not as a means of communication, but rather as a  remote control.    The idea of the media as a means of control and manipulation  is as old as the media themselves. In this sense, the harshest  critics do not view the media as a "window to the world," but  rather as a blind in that window, which the owners raise or  lower to the extent that it suits their overall and current  interests. That is precisely the thesis on which Zeljko Malnar  built his nighttime show on OTV. Nightmare Stage, with its lack  of restraint and informality, destroyed the very foundations of  television as a means of controlling and manipulating the  masses. Malnar did not offer answers and finished opinions, but  instead raised questions and forced people to think.  <H5>  Provoking Vanity </H5>   Malnar's ultimate goal in provoking personal and national  vanity ("You Are Ugly and Stupid," or "One Should Love All  People Regardless of Their Color, Race, or Religion, Which Is  Quite Difficult If You Are a Pure-Blooded Croat") was probably  not to insult, but rather to install a "mirror of reality,"  which would offer a picture the opposite of the one offered by  the "big" state media. Even though it then went to the opposite  extreme, Malnar's nighttime "nightmare" on OTV can also be  interpreted as a sort of group psychotherapy for, generally  speaking, the frustrated "populace." Perhaps he did not even  "expand horizons," but in any case, by raising the veil from  people's eyes, provoking and insulting, he destroyed the  embellished, retouched picture of reality for which the  "strictly controlled" media were responsible.    Without going into how much whiskey Malnar had inside him on  the night when his show was cut off (which is also part of  destroying the ordinary, "sober" image of television directors),  or the extent to which he "crossed the boundaries of good  taste"), for which Bolkovic is criticizing him, it seems that  that is not the hitch. OTV officials knew, or at least could  assume, what they had gotten when they "bought" Malnar. In fact,  Malnar crossed the boundary of good taste in the bourgeois  interpretation of that concept at the moment when he publicly  called his guest or viewer on the telephone line a fool, but he  has done that for a long time. Seeking the boundary of that  taste in measuring the specific seriousness of the concepts of  "fool" or "idiot," as the OTV program director is trying to do,  is only a good way to cover up the essential thing. That is that  Malnar has considerably overturned a medium, that he used it to  show something else, the ugly face of our reality and ourselves,  and in order to shove that picture in the faces of everyone who  watched Nightmare Stage, thus committing an unforgivable media  sin--he did not play up to the vanity of the viewers, but  instead, in a way peculiar to himself, activated their critical  capability, and forced them to think. Bolkovic formulates it  this way: "I am criticizing him because he turned an  entertainment broadcast into a political one, because he was not  paid to present his political opinions. He is here to entertain  people, and not to insult them, and therefore he has to  distinguish independence from anarchy."  <H5>  Turning Off the Disobedient </H5>   Consequently, who is it that will "turn off" the disobedient  child of the Croatian media? Is it an institution that is a  throwback to the former cat paws of the political power centers,  or is it the adult, enlightened viewer (reader) who can do it by  pressing the remote control, i.e., ceasing to buy this or that  news? In Malnar's case, judging by his show's audience  (unusually large for its slot), the viewers are not the ones who  pressed the remote control button, the one that brings darkness.  It was done by an institution that was least interested in an  enlightened, mature public, which can hardly be manipulated.    In this case "stopping Malnar" and all the other similar  cases in the media world are almost superfluous, unnecessary  steps. The Croatian media's influence upon public life is  insignificant, and almost nil. For example, we do not remember  when any article or radio or television program that provided  arguments and documentation in favor of "removing" some forms of  public life or individuals from public life has initiated  change. In the last few years, the pages of newspapers have been  full of examples of violations of the Constitution and positive  legal regulations, theft (illegal acquisition of property), war  profiteering, the abuse of one's position, crime.... In an  insignificant number of cases, the articles have been denied. In  most cases, people acted according to the logic that articles  live until the last issue, and they counted, not without reason,  on their being forgotten. It was rare that they were followed by  any official investigation, resignation, or explanation; people  rarely were held responsible for the consequences.  <H5>  Role of the Loudspeaker </H5>   In that sense, the blocking of the scheduled HRT broadcast  Latinica, in which the first commander of the Vukovar defense,  Mile Dedakovic, and the controversial Mile Mercep were to  appear, was completely superfluous. In view of the series of  ambiguities and contradictory information about the defense of  Vukovar, about the role of individuals in its defense, one can  assume what the topic of conversation would have been. It is  equally possible to assume that on that occasion a lot of what  is colloquially called "dirty laundry" would have been  presented, which actually does not mean anything more than facts  that mental hygienists claim are not suitable for the average  Croatian ear. By "turning off" the above-mentioned guests, the  mental hygienists indirectly and probably unconsciously, but  very precisely, indicated what kind of media they would like.    In any case, they would not like media that would be  responsible to the public and for which true, honest journalism  would be the foundation and only reason for action, and not even  journalism that would "dabble in" awkward topics and write  critically, without calculations, because, it seems, this is not  the right time or the right moment. Unfortunately, a  considerable portion of the media have consented to the role of  a loudspeaker, recognizing, in the chain of responsibility, only  responsibility upward. In that kind of distorted division of  roles, anything is possible. It is thus even possible to turn  telephones into remote controls, which at the same time "turn  off" journalists and directors, and lower the blind on the  "window to the world."</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Observer: About turn Britain's Conservative Euro-sceptics who warned of a transfer of power away from the UK if the Maastricht bill was approved are apparently being proved right. First Edwina Currie, a former Tory health minister, and Tony Banks, Labour's chirpiest London MP, announced plans to stand for the European parliament. Now Tony Speller, the Conservative who lost North Devon to the Liberal Democrats by a wafer in 1992, says he is looking for a Strasbourg seat. Speller, an MP for 13 years, says the centre of political debate is shifting to Europe. He reckons Westminster will end up as little more than a training ground for aspirant Euro MPs. It used to be so different. Ann Clwyd, a defeated 1992 candidate for Labour's deputy leadership, is one of many MPs from both sides of the Commons who cut her political teeth in Strasbourg, and then took the first chance to shift to London. The complaint then was that the European assembly lacked real power. But Banks and co are clearly betting that future political leaders are more likely to emerge from Strasbourg than Westminster. What price president Currie?</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Adel Sa'ad: "War of the Satellite Channels in </F> the Arab Skies!"]    [Text] During the last few months, the undeclared war  between Arab television channels for control over the satellite  world has intensified!    It started with the transmission of the Egyptian satellite  channel, and in one year, the number of Arab satellite stations  reached 14. Their number is expected to reach 28 in the next  five years    Thus the competition has intensified, and the confrontation  has multiplied in the war that men with neckties and white  collars and beautiful women announcers are waging directly in  the air    What is this conflict?! Has the map of media leadership in  the region changed? And what is the role of Egyptian production  [facilities] and of Egyptian television along with its rich  archives in this frantic Arab competition for the world of space?    First, we must admit that there are no satisfactory answers  to all these questions. The fact is that this Arab rivalry is a  collection of puzzles and filled with mystery.    On this basis, we will try to get acquainted with this  subject through meetings with the people responsible for some of  the satellite channels--Egyptian and Arab--and those in charge  of television production work, despite their discrepancies.  <H5>  The Air Wars </H5>   In mid-October 1994, the trial transmission of ART [Arab  Radio &amp; Television] television on four seperate channels  began  from Rome. An Italian television company had gone broke, so the  owners of ART television bought it and rented four channels on  the Arab Arabsat D.I. [expansion not given] satellite at a rate  of $1 million annually for each channel! The Arabsat D.I.  satellite carries 13 satellite channels reserved completely for  renters through Lebanese, Saudi, and Gulf agencies. The first of  the channels is the Lebanese "Future" channel that began trial  transmission and then was stopped by the war in Lebanon. Another  leasee is the "Resources" group that has been getting ready for  several months to start transmission on four channels. It is  composed of a group of Saudi businessmen!    The top managers of ART television are Shaykh Salih Kamil  and  Shaykh Walid Bin Sulman. The management of the four channels is  distributed as follows: Samia Sadiq is the president of the  general purpose channel, Mona Gaber is the president of the  children's channel, Muhammad Yasin (Lebanese) is the president  of the Arab and foreign films channel, Ali al-Bunud (Saudi) is  the president of the sports channel as a backup for the  broadcasts of Salah Zaki, who presented his resignation before  the start of trial transmissions. There is also Hamdi Quandil,  the regional representative, who handles the company's relations  with the international organizations and associations!    Hamdi Quandil summarizes the most important characteristics  of ART television as follows:    "Currently, the average daily broadcast is for 15 hours per  channel, except the children's channel, which is linked to the  children's schedule because it receives television programs at  fixed times. Among our future goals is 24-hour transmissions,  except for the children's channel, which will operate between 12  and 15 hours a day.    There are several companies providing private television  support for ART channels like the Arab Production Company in  Cairo. There are also other production centers in Tunis, Jordan,  Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Lebanon. ART television does not  offer any news programs or news transmissions, especially since  most of the other Arab and foreign satellite stations are  already doing it."    I asked him why the Arabs go to Europe for satellite  transmission and why specifically to Italy?    [Quandil] We wanted to broadcast ART television from Cairo.  We submitted actual requests, and we negotiated with the  Ministry of Communications, but circumstances didn't permit!    [Sa'ad] Which circumstances, and what is the reason for the  lack of agreement?    [Quandil] The truth is that the request was not approved,  and  I still don't know why!    [Sa'ad] There is a charge that ART television overpays its  business partners, as though it were trying to pull the rug out  from under the feet of Egyptian television.    [Quandil] This is not true, because we benefit from the  financial regulations of Egyptian television and our rules don't  permit payments more then 10 percent above the Egyptian  television [schedule].    [Sa'ad] Why do you believe there is the increased interest  in  satellite stations in the Arab region?    [Quandil] Arab investors are realizing the importance of  investing some of this capital in this field!    [Sa'ad] What is the rate of return that the Arab investors  are deriving from these channels?    [Quandil] Income is from the advertisements and  subscriptions. We expect each one of these private channels to  encrypt its message, just like the news channel CNN. So far no  Arab channel depends on subscriptions; most financing is from  advertisements, especially since the volume of advertisements  and their price go down when subscription charges begin.    [Sa'ad] What is the future of these many channels, and can  the advertisements cover the cost?    [Quandil] These channels are like any other project--they  are  exposed to profit or loss and in constant need of great economic  expertise and outstanding experience. Although I am sure that  some of the Arab satellite channels will go broke, I am also  sure that many more channels will appear over the next few years!    [Sa'ad] Is it correct that there is a war between these  channels?!    [Quandil] Without a doubt. There is sharp competition, and  survival of the fittest, at least for the private channels.  Because countries can support their stations to maintain their  national prestige, because, unlike the private companies, the  governments do not depend on money alone!    There are now 14 satellite channels in the Arab region as  follows: Egyptian, MBC [Middle East Broadcasting Center], four  channels of ART, Moroccan, Amman, Tunis, Abu Dhabi, Dubai,  Kuwait, Qatar--which began trial transmissions one month  ago--and Jordan.    This, in addition to a number of other land-based stations  that are waiting for the opportunity to break into the satellite  world. For example, in Lebanon there are 34 [local] television  stations available, plus the "closed cable" systems that are  present in a number of Arab countries. The first of these  countries is Dubai, which operates three television systems:  land-based, satellite, and closed cable.    Note: The Dubai station's broadcasting hours approach the  hours of television broadcasting on all of the channels of the  Arab Republic of Egypt, from the first channel through the  seventh. Dubai has the first channel; the foreign channel; the  satellite channel; and, on the closed cable system, the  educational channel and the information channel; and the trial  stations for sports and films. And, during this past Ramadan,  Egyptian television entered as a partner into production of the  "Qays and Laila" series, which Dubai television produced for  broadcasting on Egyptian television!  <H5>  Crowding in Space </H5>   'Amar Al-Lagthi, president of the MBC, thinks there is a  difference between government and private channels, because the  government channels have strategic goals, the most important  being its presence outside the political borders!    He adds that the government satellite stations have an  economic advantage over private television stations becuse the  state channels have a source of television materials from the  land-based channels which feed them programs and products. MBC,  however, needs to do everything because it doesn't have the  backup stations on the ground. Even marketing these products has  been a problem. It is assumed that the broadcasting of material  comes first, but their marketing is hard in countries that have  seen them by way of the dish, and we are forced to sell at  reduced prices, except in one instance--that we agree with a  number of stations to all broadcast the same program at the same  time, as happened with "The Riddles of Samir Ghanim" last  Ramadan.    'Amar al-Lagthi confirmed that most of these private  stations  depend first and foremost on advertising, because private  stations can only depend on subscriptions if they offer  different content from other stations. The fact is that all the  Arab satellite channels have similar content!    [Sa'ad] I observed that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia issued a  decision forbidding the use of the dish, and asked how  advertisers can agree to pay an advertising price when Saudi  Arabia doesn't receive it?    [al-Lagthi] I believe that Saudi Arabia forbid the dish, but  it supplied the alternative cable system which permits receiving  some channels and not others.    [Sa'ad] Also, there is an accusation that you are  contracting  with the Egyptian television workers for higher sums of money.  Is this true?    [al-Lagthi] We are working with movie producers not  television staff, and we respect the decisions of Safwat  al-Sharif, minister of information, that forbid doing business  with two stations at once. Therefore, we didn't make use of any  current broadcaster. We decided from the beginning to give the  opportunity to unknown young people, because broadcasters are a  part of the personality of the channel and it is not permissible  for them to appear in multiple stations!    I don't deny that our prices are high, for a simple reason:  We are the private sector. The difference between our prices and  the television prices is the difference between work in the  government and work in the private sector.    [Sa'ad] Is there a "satellite war" now between the Arabs in  the area of satellite channels?    [al-Lagthi] No. But there is a satellite crunch. That's all.  Nothing else. The reason being that the volume of television  production in the Arab world has not risen in spite of the  additional channels. The channels that will last are those that  set up television production facilities and studios. MBC plans  to establish television studios. Egyptian television is still  the leader in this area. It owns the largest production base in  the Arab region. I hope all the Arab owners of these channels  will unite to complete the studios project in the 6 October City  so they will be exploited to expand the production base,  increase the labor force, and improve the Arabic media tools,  because we assume that our goal is the same--to fight off the  foreign satellite channels and to lure the Arab viewers away  from them.  <H5>  Outside the competition </H5>   Suhayr al-Atribi, president of the Egyptian satellite  channel, said that there is no decision forbidding doing  business with the Arab channels, with the exception of the  broadcast announcers. This is the situation inside Egyptian  television itself, which forbids an announcer who works on one  channel from appearing on another!    Suhayr al-Atribi sees no danger from these channels for  Egyptian television because they basically do not compete. And  in the last opinion polls of the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-ANBA', the  Egyptian satellite channel was ahead of all the satellite  channels during 1993!    [Sa'ad] The Egyptian satellite station is supposed to be  supported by Arab advertising in the geographical areas that use  it. So, does this happen?    [al-Atribi] In our new plan Mr. Safwat al-Sharif, minister  of  information, promised that the satellite channels would transmit  to the United States of America and agreement has actually been  reached. As for advertising, I believe that the entire Arab  region is competing to advertise [in Egypt]. There is a  Saudi-American agency that bought the advertising of the  Egyptian satellite channel. Every Egyptian is entitled to  advertise with us through the economic production sector.  Advertising is continually increasing. When I took charge of the  channel in 1992, advertising was 15 seconds daily. It has now  risen to 72 minutes daily!    [Sa'ad] There are also accusations concerning the quality of  the satellite channels and the news they offer!    [al-Atribi] The news on the satellite channel is not my  speciality. So far we get the news from the central television  news [service]. When I took over the channel, Mr. Safwat  al-Sharif told me I was to be responsible for the programming  only. As for the news, it will arrive ready made from the  television news [service].    [Sa'ad] Is this channel to have a different status, and is  it  supposed to be provided with a number of correspondents in the  Arab world to cover real-time news and transmit it immediately?    [al-Atribi] This question is above my competence. Generally,  I try to cover the Arab world by following the meetings and  activities that occur in Cairo. Also, the [Egyptian] satellite  channel has begun to show 25 percent of the programs that are  produced for it on an exclusive basis, because our study  confirmed that some programs are only of local interest.    [Sa'ad] Suhayr al-Atribi, what is the satellite channel's  policy in light of the prevailing competition, and what is your  opinion of the decision forbidding the dish in Saudi Arabia?    [al-Atribi] I don't think about the competition. We just  work  and, thank God, we have what we need and no one can compete with  us. As for the issue of the dish, I asked and they said that the  Egyptian satellite channel will not be abolished. Saudi Arabia  will bring in the cable system and I believe that the Egyptian  satellite channel will be among the first of the channels that  will be included in this system.    The president of the production sector, Mamduh al-Lagthi,  said that the decision of Mr. Safwat al-Sharif, minister of  information, is a basic organizational process. Egypt is rich in  the expertise of its young people, and it doesn't withhold its  expertise from any Arab state. Rather, it supports them  culturally and in production. The decisions aimed at  guaranteeing the level of wages and protection of our work  secrets and our television archives from every temptation. Thus,  the goal is regulation and not forbiddance.    He added that Egypt, its production sector, the television  union, and the Egyptian media are beyond Arab media competition,  becuse Egypt has organizational and technical capabilities and a  history and literary wealth unlike anything in the region. We do  not compete with anyone, but we support the Arab brothers, and  this is not arrogance or a type of pride.    [Sa'ad] [addressing al-Lagthi] But the Arab stations pay  much  higher prices than the television production sector?    [al-Lagthi] If it were only that... Money isn't everything.  Believe me, any artist thinks it over carefully when he knows  that his work will be seen by a wide audience in Egypt. Yes,  there are material temptations, but there is a very important  spiritual burden for the artist, and his value is limited here  in Egypt. His income level in the future will also be limited  here. His work in Egypt is what will limit his earnings  elsewhere!    [Sa'ad] But is there a fear of a brain drain to these  television stations?    [al-Lagthi] No. This is also not true, as is evidenced by  the  fact that we have been working in the production sphere for 34  years, while these stations were also producing television  productions. And if you consult the list of names of artistic  productions that were produced outside of Egypt and stuck in the  minds of the Arab viewer, you will find them not exceeding two  or three productions. Muhammad Fadil directed them and Mahfudh  Abd al-Rahman wrote them, i.e., directors and writers of  Egyptian television. At the same time, there are names of  thousands of important dramatic works that Egyptian television  has produced!    [Sa'ad] What is the size of the production of the production  sector and the broadcasting and television union as compared to  the production of the Arab satellite channels?    [al-Lagthi] I believe it is more than five-fold what all the  Arab channels produce collectively.  <H5>  The First Egyptian Satellite </H5>   Amin Basyuni, president of the broadcasting and television  union, preferred to speak about the evolution of Egyptian  television after clarifying that there is no danger to the role  of the Egyptian satellite channel from competition like the  following:    The Egyptian media is working toward and has its sights on  the future. Recently, Mr. Safwat al-Sharif prepared a study on  the project to launch the first Egyptian satellite that would  provide more media services for culture, education, and  training. During the next few days, the study of the project  will be presented to the Council of Ministers.    Currently, Egyptian television makes use of the fiber optics  system for transmission of the broadcasting and television  service, in addition to microwave links. This helps make the  picture clearer. And we started their propagation from our  transmission stations!    Egyptian television now uses the digital system. It is the  most modern television technology. It is what is called overseas  high definition television. It means programming of receivers  and transmission stations and recording by a high precision and  high definition system. It is the most recent international  experiment in the field of communications.    [Sa'ad] Some people think that there is a fear of losing the  television archives to other satellite channels.    [Basyuni] The tapes of the archives come and go by a system  of regulations, and no television tape can be taken outside of  the building even if it is empty. The owners of these channels  can buy what they want from the archive officially through the  television and broadcasting union and at fixed prices, and there  is never any business conducted behind closed doors!    [Sa'ad] What were the reactions to the decision of Mr.  Safwat  al-Sharif, minister of information, to prohibit television staff  from contracting with other television stations?    [Basyuni] First, I want to clarify something important.  There  is a difference between duty and cooperation. We do not permit  anybody to combine two posts at one time. This is an Egyptian  labor law. Secondly, we have allowed our staff to do business  with these television stations on the condition that management  is sure that it doesn't affect the amount of effort given to  basic television assignments. Anyone who wants to occupy a post  in one of these television stations can submit a request for  rotation or resignation. These are the facts of the decisions,  removed from any conjecture!    [Sa'ad] Why are there no systematic arrangements with the  owners of these channels?    [Basyuni] There is actually an existing arrangement through  the Arab Broadcasting Union whose headquarters is in Tunis and  which belongs to the Arab League. There is a permanent committee  of this union that is composed of authorized representatives of  the Arab information ministries. It presents its reports to the  Conference of Arab Information Ministers. Thus, there is  coordination at the highest level. But the problem currently is  that these committees work for television cooperation between  the Arab government stations. The private stations need to  participate in this integral web!    For example, the Arab television stations have had  difficulties for many years in communicating with each other to  exchange media feeds due to rising media charges. Recently, an  Arab satellite channel was rented for media exchange between all  the Arab stations. Every Arab television is to send three  packets--news, culture, and sports--via this channel which  receives and retransmits them to any Arab channel requesting  them--without reciprocity. The permanent committee is  responsible for the channel's rent, which amounts to 1  million [Egyptian] pounds annually!    There is another side to the picture--the producers' side.  Ibrahim Abu Dhikri, general secretary of the Arab Distributors  and Producers Union for television productions made it clear  that the producers have several reservations concerning the  nature of business with the satellite channels, such as the  following:    In the past, the land-based stations contracted to buy the  producers' works. With satellite transmission, the television  product is transmitted over a wider geographical area. This has  led to problems with the producers for the following reasons:    The producer used to sell a single work to two or three  countries. With the satellite channels, the producer sells just  once to a channel that covers all of this area and pays  approximately the same price as a single country!    The producers confirm that [using] the old contracts is  absurd and that the agreement does not specify this wide  geographical area.    The satellite stations are deriving their authority from  documents written as contracts for intellectual property.    The Arab intellectual property is not used on the satellite  stations as it is on its foreign counterparts. For example, the  foreign serial is shown for the first time at full price. The  second time, at half-price, and its use ends within a specified  time period. The Arab stations are obligated to do that, but  they don't work with the Arab intellectual property in this way.  They buy it once and use it forever!    Currently, we are preparing a detailed memorandum on these  problems to present to the Permanent Committee on Arab Media of  the Arab League to be raised at the Arab Information Ministers  conference this coming July in Cairo!    The current situation is causing many problems with  distribution. All of the old schools of marketing have died, and  another, unknown language has risen.    The strange thing is that these situations themselves are  producing television productions and they know how much they  cost. If a station can produce a program for $20,000, and can  buy it ready-made from the producer for $3,000, is that  reasonable?!    What is even stranger is that some of the satellite stations  strip the distinguishing logo off the satellite channel material  so that the producer that sold the literary work to the  land-based station can protest in spite of the fact that the  intellectual material is broadcast by satellite!  <H5>  A Last Word </H5>   These are not the only words that were said on the issue of  the future of the Arab satellite channels. Perhaps what helps to  understand these puzzles is this strange succession and  competition for buying ownership of Egyptian technical products  and the invasion of the world production!    The most recent news of the satellite channels now is that  last week Shaykh Salih Kamil bought all of Jordan's studios, and  it is anticipated that he will buy Lebanon's studios also. It is  expected that these studios will be the site of the sports  channel belonging to ART television.    A number of television producers adjusted their work to  offer  quick services to these stations by opening studios of voice,  makeup and television photography!    Mona Jabir, president of ART television's children's channel  is presently managing the "Gemini" Studios of voice and image.  They are outfitted with the most modern equipment and material.  This is in addition to her work as the president of a channel  for offering facilities for new television!    A number of Arab stations have begun to gradually introduce  the local dialect of their countries through satellite stations!    This is the final picture of the competition that is  occurring in the Arab arena, and the opinion of the officials in  it. Does it help to solve the puzzles that still intensify the  mystery of the picture in the sphere of Arab space? That is the  question!</p>

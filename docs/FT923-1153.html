			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Recovery under way at SR Gent SR Gent, the South Yorkshire-based supplier of fashion clothing to Marks and Spencer, staged a partial recovery in the 12 months to June 30. Pre-tax profits more than doubled from a depressed Pounds 1.08m last time to Pounds 2.29m reflecting benefits of the reorganisation of production resources. Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 128m. The outcome was also helped by interest charges reduced to Pounds 2.71m (Pounds 3.58m). Gearing dropped from 85 per cent to 47 per cent. The recommended final dividend is lifted to 1.25p, maintaining the total for the year at 2p, payable from earnings of 3.4p (1.3p) per share.</p>

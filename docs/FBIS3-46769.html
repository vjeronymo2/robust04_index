			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Army Commander General Wimon Wongwanit by </F> THAI RAT political correspondent; place, date not given]    [Text] [THAI RAT] Will you leave your post as Army  commander when the October 1994 military reshuffle is made?    [Wimon] You have to ask my superior, not me, because he can  tell you what will happen in the reshuffle. I will not tell you  what I have in my mind. No matter who becomes the new  commander, he will do what I have been doing, and even better.  I believe that the younger generations must be better than the  old. I can prove this statement. In ancient times, people  lived in caves. Now people live in houses. If the younger  generations were not better than their elders, people would  probably be living in holes in the ground. Personally speaking,  I do not agree with one person holding two positions.    [THAI RAT] You have always stressed mutual affection and  solidarity, but many people are still suspicious of soldiers.  What type of image do you want soldiers to have?    [Wimon] I believe in the old saying: "Distance tests a  horse's strength; time proves a man's heart." I have been doing  my best, and those who distrust me will one day understand. We  cannot force others to agree with us, because we have a  democratic system. Everyone has his own views. Anyone with a  fair and unbiased mind can tell whether I have done right or  wrong. I have the answer for myself and my subordinates because  what I have done is based on my own judgment. I am not  disturbed by what other people think about me. But I am hurt  when someone criticizes my institution instead of me. That is  unfair, because the military institution belongs to the people  of the whole Kingdom. Everyone wants it to be strong so it can  defend our national independence and sovereignty. I welcome  suggestions and criticisms regarding my performance. I will not  hesitate, however, to counter any unconstructive criticisms that  are aimed at sowing discord within the institution. I feel it  is my responsibility. I must do my best.    [THAI RAT] You used to say that if the military is hit too  hard, the soldiers might not be able to tolerate it.    [Wimon] I have not said this. I can tolerate it. But if  others cannot, violence can occur. By violence, I do not mean  that I will bring the soldiers out to do this or that. Violence  can take the form of lawsuits. If those who have been hurt do  not feel that they have been given justice, however, they may  resort to other means of violence, such as dark influences,  physical assault, or killing. I do not want to see that happen.  Misinterpretation has damaged the military. They even say that  the military is about to stage a coup. That is untrue. Why  should I do that? I do not want power. I do not want to grow  bigger than I am now. I graduated from the military academy to  build up the Army.    [THAI RAT] You have declared that you will not get involved  in politics. How sure are you that your subordinates agree with  your firm stand?    [Wimon] I believe that every unit commander believes in  democracy. We must admit that everyone loves the country.  Every soldier has been taught to love democracy. Elections are  not the sole ingredient of a democracy. There are many other  factors involved. I can reaffirm that in this new era the  soldiers are more democratic than some of the people preaching  democracy.    [THAI RAT] How are the current relations between the  military  and the government?    [Wimon] I say very good, because the soldiers and the  government are each doing their duty without interfering in each  other's work. We receive and implement the policies the  government has presented to National Assembly. The working  relations between the government and the military are excellent;  no problem at all. The government has never interfered with us.  The government gives us their policies and we implement them  for the sake of national security. Soldiers always comply with  the government's policies. The government does not interfere  with the promotion or transfer of sergeants or sub-lieutenants.  Politicians find it unnecessary to interfere in these matters.  I believe that we must work faithfully and honestly.  Wrongdoers must be condemned, while those who do right must be  respected. For the survival of our nation, we must not practice  favoritism or think only of our personal gain.    [THAI RAT] Many people say that military support for this  government is based on your personal relations with the prime  minister.    [Wimon] As a matter of fact, it is the duty of the armed  forces to support the government. Regardless of who is prime  minister, the armed forces must comply with the government's  policies. Prime Minister Chuan is doing his duty. He is a clean  and honest man. I am also doing my duty. If what I have done  brings stability to the government, then it is right. This is  the duty of soldiers under a democratic system. I would do the  same regardless of who heads the government.    [THAI RAT] How is the Army's image since the May incident?    [Wimon] As Army commander, I believe that unity is the  foundation of success. If we do not join our mental and  physical efforts, there will be no unity in the Army. When I  was first appointed Army commander, I announced my top priority  was to consolidate my subordinates so that they could make joint  efforts to serve the country. At this stage, I am very proud to  say that affection and unity prevails in the Army beyond my  expectations. The second task is to instill among Army personnel  the consciousness of serving the country and people at all  costs. I am proud of being Army commander and of the sincerity  and affection I have received. My success in the performance of  my duty must be evaluated by the general public and mass media.</p>

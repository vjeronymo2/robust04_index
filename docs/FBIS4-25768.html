			<p>BFN     [Text] Chengdu, June 13 (XINHUA) -- Tens of thousands of  migrant laborers in the rural areas of southwest China's Sichuan  Province have now become bosses in various forms of business.    According to the Sichuan Rural Labor Management Department,  Sichuan has 5 million migrant laborers all over the country and  last year the income from labor services in Sichuan reached  about 10 billion yuan.    An official of the department said that the number of  self-employed households and private enterprises totals more  than 1.6 million.    About 10 percent of the bosses of these businesses are  former  migrant laborers.    In recent years, many of the migrant laborers applied their  experience and technology gained from their labor services in  other provinces, even in foreign countries, to economic  development in their home villages.    They opened their own businesses and served as "managers",  "directors" and even "chairmen of the board of directors".    Ma Zhizhen, director of a cement packaging factory in  Pengshan County, was once a baby-sitter in Chengdu city. She  collected all her savings from her work and set up her factory  in the early 1990s.    With the rapid growth of the profits and fixed assets of her  factory, in 1992, she jointly set up a rubber products company  with a Hong Kong investment firm and hired over 200 laborers in  her village.    Last year, the profits and taxes of Ma's new factory reached  more than 2 million yuan.    In Tiangong Township of Langzhong city in northern Sichuan,  a  forest park was recently set up along the dike of the Jialing  River by a young farmer named Zhao Xiaorong.    The 28-year-old Zhao collected more than 1.2 million yuan  for  the project, which also has holiday accommodations.    Now the park has opened to the public with swimming pools,  entertainment facilities, traditional-style tea rooms and a  tavern.    Zhao worked in Shenzhen city for a decade before 1992.    "The migrant labor brought me opportunities to make money  and  gain skill in management," he said.    In Guang'an County, Liu Yanlin, a 29-year-old millionaire,  built his fortune from being a migrant laborer in Shenzhen and  Henan in the past decade.    He now manages Chuanhui Hotel in Huizhou city, Guangdong  Province, and his annual taxes to the state exceed 100,000 yuan.    He has donated more than 1 million yuan to the primary and  middle schools in his hometown.</p>

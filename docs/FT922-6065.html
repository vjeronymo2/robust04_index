			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Security design urged for buildings POLICE yesterday launched a campaign to incorporate crime prevention into the design of commercial buildings. Secured by Design, an initiative that originally applied only to new residential properties, has been extended to new and renovated commercial properties. Last year there were 550,000 commercial and 600,000 domestic burglaries but police say that simple measures, such as good lighting for footpaths and car parks, can deter burglars. Properties that meet police guidelines will be able to have the Secured by Design logo used as a selling point.</p>

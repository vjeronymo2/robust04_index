Foreign Aerospace Firms  Provide One-Third of the Orders for the Largest Aviation  Scientific Research Institute"]    [Text] The TsAGI (Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute) in  Zhukovskiy in the Moscow region and its Moscow affiliate in the  former USSR carried out virtually all the theoretical work and  static tests of aviation technology. The institute has an  entirely modern and the world's largest ensemble of wind tunnels  (more than 60) for the wind tunnel testing of aircraft and their  models. Now, when orders from the principal client, the Ministry  of Defense of the Russian Federation, have ceased, the volume of  these tests has been reduced by a factor of three. Research  related to the Buran spaceship, for which TsAGI had constructed  unique test stands such as even NASA does not have, has been  stopped in its tracks.    Nevertheless, today the institute is supplied with resources  adequate for carrying out research, development, testing and  engineering work at the very highest technical level (40%  of  the TsAGI orders are received from the Russian space and defense  industry, the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy and the  Russian Space Agency, 27-30% of the work is funded by  agreements with aviation design bureaus and the rest is earned  by filling orders from foreign aerospace companies).    Among the foreign partners the first place is occupied by  the  Boeing Corporation, with which the institute has been  cooperating since 1991. Major orders have been placed by French,  but also by German, Indian, Japanese, South Korean and British  companies (research on the An-226 "Mriya-Hotol" aerospace  transport system has already been carried out in collaboration  with British Aerospace for more than 2.5 years).    Cooperation with Chinese enterprises is developing in three  directions: testing of models of civilian aircraft,  modernization of the aerodynamic base of the Chinese People's  Republic, reoutfitting of plants producing helicopters.    In the words of German Zagaynov, TsAGI director, there is an  extremely high probability that some foreign producers of  passenger aircraft will turn to the institute for carrying out  tests and certifications of those planes which may be in demand  in the Russian market.    The TsAGI also is developing industrial equipment for  agriculture, fuel and energy complex branches, medicine and  metallurgy. Solar cells for the heating of cottages enjoy a  great demand. The institute has served as an organizer for  establishing the "Regional Scientific-Industrial Association of  the Southeast Moscow Region," which is concerned with the  conversion of defense technologies. It is proposed that it will  include aerospace enterprises located at Zhukovskiy, Ramenskoye,  Lyubertsy, Lytkarino, Reutovo and Balashikha.    Telephone: TsAGI: (095) 556-42-05</p>

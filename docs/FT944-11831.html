			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Brussels attacked on banana imports The US yesterday attacked the European Union's banana import regime claiming it contravened a Gatt code of fair trade practice on import licensing and did not conform with rules of the future World Trade Organisation. The claim, made to Gatt's import licencing committee, was strongly denied by Brussels. Ms Barbara Chattin, head of tariff affairs in the US trade representative's office in Washington, said the EU's import licensing scheme for bananas was 'blatantly discriminatory' and 'contrary to both the letter and the spirit' of the import licensing code. A tougher version of the code will be incorporated in WTO rules. Two US-based banana multinationals have called for an investigation under Section 301 of US trade law of the EU's recent 'framework agreement' on banana quotas which they say favours the signatories - Costa Rica, Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela - over other Latin American exporters.</p>

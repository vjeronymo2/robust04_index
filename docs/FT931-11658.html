			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Morocco to ease exchange controls MOROCCO has signalled its readiness to lift exchange controls on current account operations. It has advised the International Monetary Fund that it wishes to comply with the IMF's Article 8, under which countries are also required to allow foreign investors freedom to repatriate their capital investments and remit their profits. In a further liberalisation measure, private citizens will be entitled to higher foreign currency allowances than previously, allowing payment for medical treatment and education abroad. Tunisia made a similar approach to the IMF over Article 8 early in January. The moves mark a big step for both countries towards liberalising their economies.</p>

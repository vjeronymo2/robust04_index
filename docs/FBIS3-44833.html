			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 8 (XINHUA) -- The People's  Construction Bank of China has announced that its savings in  individual renminbi accounts reached 158.4 billion yuan (about  21 billion U.S. dollars) in 1993, a record for the bank.    Last year, the bank's total increase in individual savings  was 50.5 billion yuan, roughly equal to total increases between  1986 and 1990.    Since the beginning of last year, the bank, which is mainly  in charge of issuing loans for major state construction  projects, has done unprecedentedly brisk business in personal  savings.    Bank officials attributed the achievements to the contract  system carried out in a bid to bring the workers' enthusiasm  into full play.    Taking advantage of the Central People's Bank raising  interest rates in May and July last year, the construction bank  held a 100-day savings promotion program from July 11 to October  20, 1993. The effort resulted in an increase of 22.5 billion  yuan in personal savings.</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: LATINO DIET ITEMS CAN BE MODIFIED TO REDUCE THEIR  CHOLESTEROL CONTENT  </P> <P> When Carol Franco learned she had high blood cholesterol, it came as "good  news."  </P> <P> At 39, Franco had been afraid that she was developing diabetes. "Every other  member of my family has the disease, so I was relieved when my doctor told me  that I only had a cholesterol problem," Franco said. Diabetes afflicts 14% of  the Hispanic community but only 5% of the general population, according to the  American Diabetes Assn.  </P> <P> And although Franco's blood cholesterol is 270 milligrams per deciliter, which  places her in the high-risk category for heart disease, she is optimistic. "If  I watch my diet, I can lower my cholesterol," she said. "Diabetes would have  been more difficult to control."  </P> <P> Three weeks ago Franco began modifying her menus to bring her cholesterol level  closer to the desirable 200 milligrams per deciliter. She replaced many  traditional Latino foods -- enchiladas, sweetbreads, quesadillas and avocados  -- with whole grains, poultry and fish, and is seeing positive results. "Of  course, I miss real Mexican dishes, some of my favorites," Franco said, "but I  feel much healthier." And she is even able to treat herself to a bit of her  favorite candy.  </P> <P> The number of health-conscious Latinos like Franco appears to be growing, and a  new program operated by the UC San Diego Cancer Center hopes to attract even  more. Comida Da Vida (Food Gives Life) aims to teach Latino women how to  improve their health by adjusting meal-planning and shopping habits.  </P> <P> Unlike other community nutrition plans, Comida Da Vida has been developed with  cultural differences in mind, according to registered dietitian Joan Rupp,  coordinator of epidemiology, prevention and control at the San Diego center.  Written by Latino dietitians for Latino consumers, the program hopes to improve  the ethnic group's food buying habits through a series of cooking  demonstrations, brochures and recipes available at supermarkets in the San  Diego area. And by changing long-held Latino ideas about what tastes good and  what is healthy, the program could eventually decrease the number of Latino  deaths due to chronic illness.  </P> <P> "Most nutrition information (available in this country) is written in English  and is designed with Middle America in mind," Rupp said. "The few materials  available in Spanish are usually direct translations from English and don't  take cultural differences into account. Consequently, few of our health  messages are reaching non-English-speaking populations.  </P> <P> "Even the accepted terminology sometimes works against us. For example, whole  milk in Spanish is leche entera," Rupp explained. "Therefore, low-fat milk is  viewed as missing something, or inferior, by many Hispanics."  </P> <P> Comida Da Vida emphasizes low-fat, high-fiber foods: lean beef, low-fat milk  and cheese, apples, bananas, broccoli and cabbage. Tomatoes and red peppers,  excellent sources of Vitamin C and major ingredients in Mexican cuisine, are  highlighted.  </P> <P> Following are a few of the program's serving suggestions and lower-fat Latino  recipes:  </P> <P>  Salsa can serve as a side salad if tomatoes, onions and peppers are cut into  larger, bite-size pieces and are presented on a lettuce leaf and garnished with  a wedge of lime and fresh cilantro. And in place of deep-fried chips with dip,  the program recommends an appetizer of jicama and other vegetables served with  salsa.  </P> <P> Avocados can fit into a lower-fat diet, despite their high fat content.  Moderation is the key: an average avocado contains about 300 calories and 30  grams of fat. However, more than half the fat is monounsaturated, the type  recommended by health experts.  </P> <P> Corn tortillas are preferred over flour, which have slightly more fat. When  buying flour tortillas, Comida Da Vida recommends those made with whole-wheat  flour and vegetable oil instead of lard, a highly saturated fat. To reduce  calories and fat, steam, do not fry, tortillas for soft tacos and enchiladas.  </P> <P> Meat is a vital part of any diet, even a low-fat one. Leaner cuts, which are  often tougher than fat-marbled meats, can be tenderized by marinating them in  lemon juice, herbs and spices. Broiling the meat instead of frying will allow  fat to drip off. The program also suggests ways to slice lean meats into cuts  familiar to Latinos, such as those used for carne asada and bistek.  </P> <P> Although lard contributes its own distinct flavor to Mexican dishes, it is  highly saturated and should be avoided. A very small amount of vegetable oil  can be used to fry fideo. And refried beans may be mashed with milk to provide  texture and a creamier taste.  </P> <P> Cheese is another high-fat ingredient popular in Mexican cuisine. Rather than  eliminating it entirely, select queso fresco, a soft crumbly variety, and  substitute low-fat Cheddar and Jack for regular cheeses.  </P> <P> "Hispanics drink a lot of liquadas (a traditional fruit drink) in Mexico," Rupp  said, "but in this country they tend to drink a lot of soda." As an alternative  to soft drinks, she suggests a combination of frozen orange juice concentrate  -- or other fruits such as mangoes, strawberries, blackberries, papaya or  raspberries -- a banana, ice cubes and low-fat milk. When blended until frothy,  the drink is a refreshing way to increase daily intake of fruit and calcium,  both of which are poorly represented in many Latino diets.  </P> <P> MEXICAN PIZZA  </P> <P> 1 (1-pound) loaf frozen bread dough, white or wheat  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon oil  </P> <P> 1/2 medium onion, chopped  </P> <P> 1/2 pound lean ground beef or turkey  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons packaged taco seasoning mix  </P> <P> 1/4 cup cornmeal  </P> <P> 2 cups shredded low-fat Cheddar cheese  </P> <P> 2 cups shredded low-fat Jack cheese  </P> <P> 1 (8 3/4-ounce) can kidney beans, drained or 1 cup canned chili beans, drained  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons diced green chiles or jalapenos  </P> <P> 1 (2 1/4-ounce) can sliced black olives, drained  </P> <P> 1 green pepper, sliced  </P> <P> Let frozen bread dough thaw according to package directions until pliable.

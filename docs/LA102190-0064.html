			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHERLIVES: THE TIME OF MY LIFE BY DENIS HEALEY (W.W. NORTON: $29.95; 607 PP.)  </P> <P> When this book was published in London last year, the Economist was compelled  to call Denis Healey "probably the best prime minister Britain never had." It's  hard to argue with that assessment, for Healey comes through in "The Time of My  Life" as a man of conviction, confidence and significant political savvy. More  important, he also demonstrates a clear political philosophy -- call it  "liberal pragmatism" -- that ensured, paradoxically, both his leadership in the  Labour Party and his failure to take up residence at 10 Downing Street. Healey  often writes that he would much rather "do" than "be," and that's easy to  believe; often described as a loner, Healey seems more interested in the job of  governance than in promoting himself.  </P> <P> "The Time of My Life" often is less than engaging for that very reason -- arms  control and budgeting issues (Healey was defence secretary from 1964 to 1970,  chancellor of the exchequer from 1974 to 1979) are sufficiently technical to be  only intermittently interesting. However, Healey's description of Labour  politics is absorbing, largely because it parallels that of the Democratic  party in this country; the ascendancy of the conservative viewpoint in both the  United States and the United Kingdom is directly linked to decades of liberal  backbiting and indecisiveness.  </P> <P> Healey distinguishes himself from most American political memoirists by failing  to spend much time settling old scores -- although when he does, he's wickedly  effective. Of Harold Wilson during his first term as prime minister, he writes:  " . . . a capacity for self-delusion which made Walter Mitty appear  unimaginative." Of a fellow Member of Parliament: "I cannot say my heart always  rose when his long anteater's proboscis began to quiver, and his mouth began  its gobbling splutter." Of Lyndon Johnson: simply "a monster."  </P> <P> "The Time of My Life," in short, contains gems, but they take some excavating  to find.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOS ALAMITOS;  </P> <P> STRIKIN JET, ON CASH FAVORED IN KINDERGARTEN  </P> <P> Harvey Wallbanger, the world's only racing buffalo, shares the marquee with the  $230,000 Kindergarten Futurity on Saturday night's program at Los Alamitos Race  Course.  </P> <P> Harvey Wallbanger will be featured in an exhibition race Saturday night with  rider/trainer T. C. Thorstenson at the reins.  </P> <P> Facing the racing buffalo will be two horses ridden by Danny Cardoza and James  Lackey.  </P> <P> The 36th running of the 350-yard Kindergarten Futurity goes as the 9th race  Saturday.  </P> <P> Miss Strikin Jet and Takin On The Cash are the two early favorites to capture  the 1990 renewal of the Kindergarten.  </P> <P> Miss Strikin Jet and Bruce Pilkenton scored an upset in the Leo Handicap in  April, posting a half-length margin over Femmes Flam.  </P> <P> Takin On The Cash won the Bay Meadows Futurity decisively in mid-April with  veteran rider Danny Cardoza in the irons. The horse has won two of four career  starts, finishing second the remaining two.  </P> <P> Femmes Flam is another talented contender. The daughter of Pie In The Sky has  won three of her five career starts, including an impressive victory in the Bay  Meadows Futurity Consolation.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most notable riding assignment in the Kindergarten is the decision  by Baffert to put thoroughbred rider Gary Stevens on Raised Toperfection.  Stevens also will ride Kite In The Sky in Saturday night's seventh race.  </P> <P> Here's how they'll line up for the Kindergarten Futurity: Splitsville (Lute  Proctor), Ramtac (Roman Figueroa), Femmes Flam (Steve Treasure), Cash N Cara  (Alvin Brossette), Resolutions (Kip Didericksen), Ms Bush Whacker (John  Creager), Takin On The Cash (Danny Cardoza), Miss Strikin Jet (Bruce  Pilkenton), Jacks Special Gem (Eddie Garcia), Raised Toperfection (Gary  Stevens).  </P></p>

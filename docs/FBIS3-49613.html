His lawyer  appealed for Postelnicu's temporary release from prison after  producing as evidence a medical certificate proving that the  former top communist dignitary was suffering from eight severe  diseases requesting surgical intervention.    Tudor Postelnicu is part of the group of former high  dignitaries under the Ceausescu regime -- together with Emil  Bobu, Ion Dinca and Manea Manescu -- arrested shortly after  Ceausescu's runaway, who were put on trial on 27 January 1990.    After a military court convicted him to life imprisonment  under a genocide crime on 2 February 1990, the Supreme Court of  Justice accepted an extraordinary appeal on 26 April 1993,  changing the charge to complicity at aggravated murder and  complicity at attempted aggravated murder. The sentences were:  17 years of imprisonment for Tudor Postelnicu, 15 years for Ion  Dinca, 10 years each for Emil Bobu and Manea Manescu. The court  also ruled for the first three to be stripped of their military  ranks.    Tudor Postelnicu is the second former top communist  dignitary  that was granted a release on parole in the past two weeks,  after ex-general Iulian Vlad, the former head of the Securitate,  released at the end of 1993 after serving one third of his  sentence.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Consultants: the alibi for indecision Sir, As you reported ('Whitehall waste over consultancy projects attacked', April 26), more than half a billion pounds has been spent by the government and its agencies on consultancy contracts; but all of this expenditure saved only Pounds 10m, a derisory return. However, the total expenditure incurred on consultants is likely to be immeasurably greater in real terms - though unquantifiable - when including the tens, if not hundreds of thousands of man hours spent by well-paid civil service employees in the ministries, quangos etc explaining the problems to the consultants. The importance of qualified professional consultants should not be underrated - and in this instance I have management consultants in mind. Their effectiveness in 'the firm' hinges substantially on the support and co-operation of the insiders. Hence, the derisory government savings reflect some inadequacies in communicating with and in using consultants. A cult has grown up in the past decade or two, enlisting an increasing number of outside professional consultants in government, and in the National Health Service (counsellors). Judged by the government's propensity for paid outside advice and the cost incurred, has this trend gone too far? Could it be that consultants often provide the alibi for decisions managements know they have to take? A director of one of the big banks not so long ago asked shareholders at the annual meeting for a hike in the non-executives' honorarium in a year of massive losses and redundancies. When asked from the floor to justify his proposition, he replied: the consultants suggested it] Such and similar examples are an expensive way of passing on responsibilities for action taken or contemplated. I wrote a book about 'Living in an alibi society' a few years ago; I am now watching it being realised. Nicholas Stacey, Reform Club, Pall Mall, London SW1Y 5EW</p>

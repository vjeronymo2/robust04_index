			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 30 (XINHUA) -- Japan's newly formed  cabinet headed by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has a support  rating of 56.8 percent, the YOMIURI SHIMBUN newspaper reported  today.    This approval percentage is the third highest ever for a  Japanese cabinet, following 71.9 percent for the Hosokawa  cabinet last August and 60.5 percent for the tanaka cabinet in  1972.    The telephone poll was conducted by the YOMIURI daily  earlier  this week.    The disapproval rating for the cabinet stood at 25 percent.    About 45 percent of the respondents favoring the cabinet  said  it "can do something new," and 24 percent said Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata "can be trusted."    The major drawback cited for the cabinet was its fragility,  the paper reported.    Hata's cabinet was formed earlier this week to replace that  of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who resigned on  April 8 because of controversial personal finances.</p>

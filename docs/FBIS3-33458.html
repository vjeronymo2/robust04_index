Lizana and Corpesca [Fishing Corporation] leaders met Diaz  Albonico to express their total annoyance at the measure, which  Lizana characterized as discriminatory, because the Mexicans  have made a basic mistake in definition by believing that anyone  can dump a raw material such as fishmeal.    Asked about Mexico's intentions, Lizana said:    [Begin Lizana recording] Well, we cannot judge a country's  possible intentions when adopting certain measures. But it is  clear, since we are talking about a product freely traded in the  world market, that when you leave one supplier out you let  another supplier in. [end recording]    Under Secretary Diaz Albonico was also consulted on the  issue. He said that on 18 February he met Mexican Foreign Under  Secretary (Rosario Grin) to discuss the discriminatory character  of the measures adopted by Secofi [Commerce and Industrial  Development Secretariat].    [Begin Diaz Albonico recording] The measures are  discriminatory for two reasons. First, because they only punish  Chilean products; and second, because the tariffs or quotas  established for the products are much steeper than the tariffs  that existed before the signing of the economic cooperation  agreement. [end recording]    Diaz Albonico said the previous tariff on fishmeal was 15  percent while today it is nearly 24.8 percent, adding that this  is discriminatory.    According to Diaz Albonico, the Mexican under secretary  showed concern about the problem and talked with Secofi  officials about it. Chilean authorities expect Secofi officials  will be able to visit Chile and investigate the matter at the  beginning of March in order to solve the problem before Eduardo  Frei's inauguration. Diaz Albonico said the Mexican under  secretary believes there is political willingness to drop the  sanction, which is absolutely provisional, and that Chile has  made Mexican administrative authorities aware that the country  does not implement any dumping practices.</p>

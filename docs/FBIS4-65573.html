			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pekka Vaisanen: "Supplemental Budget Promises </F> Youth Jobs and Educational Opportunities"]    [Excerpt] The government is trying to create 40,000 new  positions for young people yet this year in either the labor  force or in schools. The employing of young people was a central  theme in this year's second proposed supplemental budget that  was presented to the Eduskunta on Friday [22 April].    About 700 million Finnish markkas [FMk] are set aside for  increasing educational and job opportunities for youth.    The intention is to increase by 33,000 the projected number  of young people that will be accepted for educational placement  this fall. About 8,000 of these slots will require indentured  service by the recipient. Education by indenturement will almost  double if reality follows the projections.    Job-providing subsidies will be paid for those accepted  under  the indenture program. This will amount to FMk1,500 monthly per  person for the first year, and FMk750 per month during the  second year.    The remainder of the educational spots will be provided in  the 10th grade of high school, in trade schools, and in tertiary  schools.    Some 6,500 young people completing their education this year  will have job-providing subsidies offered on their behalf for a  period of six months if they do not find employment on the open  market.  <H5>  Insuring EKA Costly </H5>   The supplemental budget will add almost FMk1.4 billion to  this year's government expenses. The increase in expenses will  be covered by additional borrowing.    Besides the program for the youth, the biggest budget item  will be the insuring of savings deposits in EKA [expansion  unknown]. This phase of the government deficit will amount to  FMk635 million. The total government deficit will be almost  double this amount.    The government will achieve spending cuts in financing  arrangements and bonuses linked to the national debt. These  spending cuts are estimated to equal FMk400 million. Over FMk100  million will be cut from the supplementing of local government  tax income. Expenses associated with refugees will be FMk80  million under earlier estimates.    Some FMk40 million will be set aside for humanitarian aid to  Bosnia.  <H5>  50 Million for EU Referendum </H5>   Fifty million markkas are being set aside in the  supplemental  budget for conducting the referendum on European Union [EU]  membership. Some of the funds needed for this purpose have  already been provided by this year's budget.    Compensation payment for the whitewater preservation will  cost 55 million more over the remainder of the year.    The local government crisis act, the so-called Karkkila Law,  formulated by the cabinet, will lead to an expense of FMk15  million over the rest of the year. This to-be-enacted law will  authorize the granting of over FMk200 million in loans to local  governments in financial crises. [passage omitted]</p>

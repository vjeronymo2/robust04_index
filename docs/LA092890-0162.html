			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> STUDENT TRUSTEES COACHED ON POLITICS  </P> <P> People who attend school board meetings on a regular basis are familiar with  the panel of student representatives who sit in front of the trustees. In some  districts they cast straw votes alongside their adult counterparts; in others,  the students just watch the proceedings and occasionally voice opinions during  designated sections of the meetings.  </P> <P> On Thursday, more than 30 high school juniors and seniors who sit on district  school boards throughout Southern California gathered at Woodbridge High School  for a daylong symposium. The topic on many of their minds was how to get the  adults to listen.  </P> <P> "A lot of people in education get so caught up in their jobs, in doing what  they see as their jobs, that they lose sight of the people they're doing it  for, the students," said Rebecca Toth, a member of the California Assn. of  Student Councils, which sponsored the program. "The main goal of the program is  to get students to be able to actually do something on the school boards."  </P> <P> Another student, Jeff Melo of the Saddleback Valley Unified School District,  said he has found that adults aren't usually prepared to take action on  students' concerns.  </P> <P> "We don't have the power, but the people who do have it aren't listening," he  said.  </P> <P> The symposium included seminars on time organization and effective  presentations. But Toth said the most important lessons were on how to deal  with school board politics and how students can use their positions to advance  the concerns of their classmates.  </P> <P> "A lot of them said that their principals don't want them to talk about issues  that will rock the boat," Toth said. "So we suggest that they get together with  some of the board members on a one-to-one basis and talk about what they feel  are imminent concerns."  </P> <P> In fact, diplomacy with the elected members is often the best way to get  something done, said Maureen DeMarco, president of the California Assn. of  Student Councils and a speaker at the symposium. And, she said, getting more  students interested in important issues helps, too. LAURA MICHAELIS  </P></p>

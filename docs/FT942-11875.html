			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / US steps up peace efforts on Rwanda The US has stepped up its involvement in efforts to end the fighting in Rwanda with the despatch of two senior diplomats to the region and a promise of Dollars 15m (Pounds 10.2m) of humanitarian aid. Mr John Shattuck, assistant secretary of state for human rights, and Mr David Rawson, former US ambassador in Kigali, were due to set out yesterday for talks in neighbouring Uganda, Tanzania and Burundi. But US officials said they were working mostly through the United Nations, adding that US involvement might extend to providing money or logistical support for a UN force though not to despatch of US troops. State Department officials added that the US was pushing for the UN Security Council to impose an arms embargo on Rwanda and had approached other countries in the region in an effort to stop the flow of weapons into the country. Reuter adds from Nairobi: Rebels of the Rwanda Patriotic Front failed to appear yesterday for peace talks in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha. A delegation from a rump government which now controls barely a third of Rwanda had already arrived in Arusha. However, Mr Emanuel Ndahiro, RPF military spokesman, said the RPF was prepared to talk to elements of the armed forces in an attempt to halt the killings.</p>

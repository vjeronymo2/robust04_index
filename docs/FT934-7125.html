			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: Caravaggio - the real thing / Patricia Morison visits the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin IT WAS a great week for revellers in Dublin. On Tuesday night, the National Gallery in Dublin unveiled its rediscovered masterpiece by Caravaggio, 'The Taking of Christ'. The next night, Ireland qualified for the World Cup. Caravaggio would have loved it, one minute basking in the adulation of experts and art-lovers, the next out roistering with the lads. For the past 60 years 'The Taking of Christ' hung in the parlour of a Jesuit community in Lower Leeson Street in the heart of Georgian Dublin. Again, Caravaggio would have appreciated the setting. Respectable by day, the street is famed for its cellar bars which roar into life in the small hours. The Jesuit Fathers are now the toast of town for their generosity in placing this priceless masterpiece on indefinite loan to the National Gallery. The painting was spotted three years ago by Sergio Benedetti, senior restorer at the National Gallery. It was labelled as being by the Dutch artist and devoted follower of Caravaggio, Gerard van Honthorst. However, it was quite obviously a composition by Caravaggio hitherto known only from copies. These range from tolerable to execrable but one, in Odessa, was good enough to have convinced some experts. Benedetti's task was to see whether his intuition was right, and that the Jesuit's strikingly lovely picture was indeed the lost original. Cleaning and technical examination showed the tell-tale pentimenti, signs that the artist had changed his mind; copyists generally get things right. It also revealed Caravaggio's hasty, thick brushwork as he deftly laid out his original composition. Experts shown the picture gave the right verdict, culminating in the approval of Sir Dennis Mahon, doyen of Baroque Italian art. (Oddly enough, when Guinness Mahon agreed to sponsor the unveiling, the company was unaware of the role played by the great nephew of the bank's co-founder.) The shadowy career of Caravaggio has been made clearer by recent research in Rome. It was known that 'The Taking of Christ' was painted for Cyriaco Mattei in 1602, when Caravaggio was 31, a mature artist at the height of his fame. The Mattei family had taken over as Caravaggio's patrons from the louche Cardinal del Monte, who had commissioned (among other things) the notorious homoerotic paintings of cupids and musicians. For two years, probably the happiest in his life, Caravaggio had rooms in the Mattei family's grandiose palaces. Another masterpiece he painted for them was 'The Supper at Emmaus', in London's National Gallery. 'The Taking of Christ' was the last of the group. It is a mesmeric and immensely poignant portrayal of the moment when Judas betrays his Lord with a kiss. Caravaggio's is an intense psychological interpretation of the arrest of Christ. Swords play such a prominent part in many of his paintings that it is striking that this time Caravaggio, the fanatical swordsman and tavern-brawler, chose drama without violence and left out the traditional figure of St Peter severing unlucky Malchus's ear. On the right stands a figure who is not in armour, but holds a lantern and gazes intently with parted lips at Christ. This man could be just a Jewish official, but long ago the Caravaggio scholar Roberto Longhi spotted him as a self-portrait of the artist. It is therefore the artist's hand at the top of the painting, holding the lantern. The counterbalance at the bottom are the fingers of Christ, linked in a gesture of prayer and submission. Christ, and no one else, is shown full face, eyes closed, with an expression of intense, wordless suffering. To his left there is the hysterical shrieking figure of the young man who, according to the gospel, ran away naked when one of the soldiers grabbed his cloak. Caravaggio's youth is clothed and his red cloak billows over the heads of Christ and Judas, ingeniously rather than naturalistically framing them. Christ's deadly pallor contrasts with the coarse, wrinkled features of Judas. Yet he is not a caricature, for in those eyes we see an expression of shock as the traitor realises what he has done. Cardinal Girolamo, Cypriano's brother and a deeply pious, austere character, may have influenced the artist. There is a strongly Franciscan message in the painting's emphasis on abnegation, obedience and martyrdom. The declining fortunes of the Mattei family forced them to sell 'The Taking of Christ' in 1802 to a Scottish laird, William Hamilton Nisbet, along with five other fine paintings. Nisbet thought he had bought a Honthorst and labelled it thus, or rather, as being by 'Gerard of the Night', a common nickname. When the Nisbet pictures were sold in Edinbugh in 1921, someone paid Pounds 10.10s for 'A Curious Old View of a Racecourse'. Someone else paid Pounds 8.8s for the so-called Honthorst. Soon afterwards, the painting was taken to Dublin and in the 1930s, was given to the Jesuit fathers by Dr Marie Lea Wilson, childless widow of a murdered police officer. Caravaggio's reputation made its rapid ascent, but the Honthorst was unseen by scholars. It is splendid that such a masterpiece seems now to have come to rest permanently in Ireland. It is also strangely fitting, for one of Cardinal Girolamo Mattei's titles was defender of the faith in Ireland. Caravaggio: The Master Revealed, is sponsored by Guinness &amp; Mahon until 31 January 31. The gallery itself is undergoing major renovation so much of the permanent collection will not be seen for several years.</p>

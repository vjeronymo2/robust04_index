			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Ukraine and Crimea have pledged to resolve the  dispute about the degree of autonomy enjoyed by the Crimean  peninsula through negotiations. However, according to the  statement of Ukraine's deputy prime minister Zhulynskyy,  President Kravchuk intends to dissolve the Crimean Parliament in  the near future and introduce presidential rule on the territory  of the peninsula in the event of the Crimean legislators  refusing to reject the new constitution. It is still not clear  what place Crimean President Meshkov occupies in the political  plans of President Kravchuk. One thing is clear -- at any  moment the situation may get out of control.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Asian Aerospace (2): Passenger aircraft on the horizon - South Korea has ambitious plans The South Korean aerospace industry is entering an ambitious new phase as the country's leading conglom- erates unveil plans to produce medium-sized passenger aircraft in the next few years. The main aerospace companies - Samsung Aerospace, Daewoo Heavy Industries and Korean Air - have existed until now primarily on the licensed production of US military aircraft and the supply of airliner components to foreign manufacturers. Annual turnover has reached Dollars 1bn. But the government wants the country to develop an expertise in the design and development of aircraft, instead of just assembling foreign models, and transform Korea into one of the world's 10 leading aerospace manufacturers by 2020. To achieve this goal, the government plans to spend Dollars 2bn over the next 10 years on research and development for aviation and space projects. This includes Dollars 300m for the development of medium-sized commercial aircraft, considered the first stage for Korea's eventual participation in the international co-production of large passenger jets. It is a difficult challenge. So far, Korea has developed only military trainers and light aircraft. A consortium of the country's three main aerospace companies is expected to be formed by May under state direction to develop a commuter airliner with 50 to 100 seats, in co-operation with a foreign partner. Korea's big business groups are already vying to lead the programme, with three proposed joint venture projects with foreign partners for medium-sized airliners being announced in the past few months. Samsung Aerospace, Korea's largest aircraft manufacturer, last autumn signed a memorandum of understanding with Aviation Industries of China (Avic), the umbrella group for Chinese aerospace companies, to produce commuter aircraft with 50 to 100 seats. The programme, called Phoenix, will begin development this year, with production scheduled to start in 1998. Development funding and engineering will be largely provided by Samsung, while Avic will offer the aircraft technology. Daewoo Heavy Industries and Korean Air, the country's main airline, have also formed a venture with Avic to produce a medium-sized airliner by 1998. Hindustan Airlines of India and Singapore Airlines are also expected to participate in the Dollars 1bn project, called Asian Air Express. A basic programme plan is scheduled to be issued in March. Daewoo has already developed a 33-seat commuter airliner with Dornier of Germany. But Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry, a new entry into the aircraft industry, may have stolen a march on its rivals by establishing a joint venture with Yakovlev of Russia, which will design and develop passenger aircraft based on the 150-seat Yak42H and the 30-seat Yak40H. They will be assembled in Korea by Hyundai, which has a 51 per cent stake in the joint venture and will also establish a worldwide marketing and after-sales network. Hyundai Precision is a main producer of transport equipment, such as railway cars and engines. In return for tapping the superior design and technology capabilities of China and Russia, the Korean companies can provide vital financing and better production technology. China and Russia have also proved more willing to transfer aircraft technology to Korea than western aerospace companies, which possibly fear a future competitive threat from Asia. The new Korean projects are seen as part of a wider Asian attempt to reduce the region's dependence on western aircraft manufacturers as air travel in the area increases. Weak domestic demand has been one main obstacle to the development of the Korean civil aviation industry. But the Korea Aerospace Research Institute estimates that the country may need 170 commuter aircraft within the next 15 years as small airports in the country are improved and expanded. Samsung is also considering starting a domestic carrier to provide a market for its aircraft. The possible reunification of North and South Korea may increase sales since air travel could partially overcome transportation problems caused by the north's crumbling road and rail networks. The manufacturing alliance with China will also provide a potentially large market for the Korean companies. Sales of the mid-sized airliners to the Asian market may reverse the losses that the Korean aerospace industry is now suffering as exports of aircraft components fall due to the downturn in the global aviation industry. The government believes that Korea could capture 10 per cent of the global commuter aircraft market by 2000, with sales of 70 aircraft a year. In the meantime, the industry depends on military orders to boost sales. Samsung Aerospace, with an estimated 1993 turnover of Dollars 395m in aviation-related business, is the prime contractor in the Korea Fighter Programme (KFP), which involves the assembling of 36 US-designed F-16 fighters and the licensed production of another 72, beginning in 1997. Korean Air and Daewoo are KFP subcontractors. Korean Air is the main supplier of helicopters to the Korean military, with estimated 1993 sales of Dollars 358m in the aircraft sector. It has been assembling American-designed UH-60 Black Hawk combat helicopters since 1990. But Korean Air recently suffered a blow when the government ordered it to transfer the technology and equipment for assembling the helicopter engines to Samsung Aerospace, which is the most advanced among Korean manufacturers in aero-engine technology. Daewoo Heavy Industries, which had estimated aviation-related sales of Dollars 123m in 1993, mainly serves as a subcontractor on military aerospace programmes, though it has built training aircraft.</p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RELATIONSHIPS: NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION SHOULD GET TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER  </P> <P> You refuse to drive anywhere on New Year's Eve and you're so burned out on  holiday cheer by then that you'd rather not invite anyone to your place, so you  are settling in for a quiet evening at home.  </P> <P> If you're like many other New Year's Eve couch potatoes, you'll probably end up  falling asleep in front of the tube long before the countdown in Times Square  reaches your living room. You'll greet 1991 in the morning, just in time for  the first kickoff.  </P> <P> But you might want to consider planning a more stimulating celebration at home  that will keep you awake long enough -- and put you in the right mood -- to  collect a midnight kiss (or two . . . ) from your mate. You might try an  elegant dinner with candles, champagne and, most important, intimate  conversation that sets the tone for a promising New Year.  </P> <P> This is the time to make some resolutions about how you and your partner can  work together to improve your relationship with each other and your children --  and perhaps other family members -- in 1991. If your resolutions in the past  have been mostly pragmatic -- things like getting your 20-year-old body back,  bathing your dog more often or finishing your novel -- it may be difficult, at  first, to come up with resolutions focusing on the deeper matter of making your  loved ones happy.  </P> <P> Fortunately, you are about to get some help from Orange County family  therapists, who were asked to identify the New Year's resolutions they would  most like to see couples make. Because therapists work mostly with families in  distress, they relished the opportunity to suggest ways to enrich relationships  that might help prevent crises. So here goes.  </P> <P> Todd Creager, a Huntington Beach marriage, family and child counselor who  specializes in couples therapy, stressed the importance of effective  communication. He suggested that couples resolve to: "Be honest with each  other. Stop holding back or hiding feelings. Remember you cannot not  communicate. If you are not expressing yourself directly, you are doing it  indirectly, and that is always worse. We often communicate unexpressed feelings  by acting them out in such ways as withdrawing, starting arguments and being  defiant."  </P> <P> In addition to communicating more directly, couples should show respect for  each other even when they are angry, negotiate in a way that allows both to  feel that their opinions and desires matter, and put aside their own agendas so  that they can really listen to each other, Creager added.  </P> <P> He'd also like to see couples make a commitment to "focus on the best in each  other."  </P> <P> "People change behaviors much more quickly if given strokes for their  constructive behaviors, even if those behaviors are few and far between," he  explained. "Ongoing criticism about negative behaviors tends to preserve the  status quo."  </P> <P> Helen Greenblatt, a Laguna Hills psychotherapist, encourages people to "let go  of old beliefs so they're free to seek new challenges" in their family  relationships.  </P> <P> She explained: "We cling to the old patterns and habits because they're  comfortable, but they're really not moving us forward."  </P> <P> Those old beliefs may prevent people from finding peace in difficult  relationships, she said. "We stereotype our family members, especially our  parents. If we could just step back and look at them objectively without any of  the guilt or shame or past hurts, we might see them in a way more acceptable to  us. We should be charitable with our families and give them the benefit of the  doubt."  </P> <P> The tendency to resist change in a relationship often leads to major crises,  said Gerry Owen of Owen Family Counseling in Brea.  </P> <P> "The way we talk tends to focus on keeping things the same," he said. "If  someone goes off in one direction, we try to pull them back toward the past."  </P> <P> Couples can tell they're resisting change if they keep repeating a "stuck  conversation" that always leaves them feeling bad but never gets resolved, Owen  noted.  </P> <P> If couples don't face changes in each other and their relationship as they  occur, they may eventually be forced to do so by a crisis such as an  extramarital affair, and by then it may be too late.  </P> <P> "It's better to have small shakes than a major quake," Owen said.  </P> <P> So he urges couples to allow for change and try to resolve their difficulties  as they come up rather than carry over bad feelings from one day to the next.  </P> <P> As couples get better at dealing with their conflicts, they need to balance  those often-difficult encounters by finding more time for romance, said Owen's  wife, Linda, who is also a family therapist.  </P> <P> Just touching each other more can make a big difference, she said.  </P> <P> She and her husband also offer couples this deceptively simple advice: "When  touched, say 'thank you.' When angry, walk. When sad, hug. Whenever, laugh."  </P> <P> Lee Hachey, a marriage and family counselor in Costa Mesa, agrees that couples  should be more demonstrative; without open affection, too many end up "being  like roommates," he said.  </P> <P> He and his wife, therapist Jeanne Nelson, share an end-of-the-day ritual that  has given an indefinite life span to the honeymoon feeling in their marriage.  Whoever gets home first drops whatever he or she is doing when the other  arrives and offers an embrace and a far-from-perfunctory kiss at the front  door.  </P> <P> "It makes a tremendous difference when you drive up to your house and you know  you're going to be greeted at the door -- and not just with a peck on the  cheek. You really feel like you're coming home," Hachey said.  </P> <P> He said people who don't greet their partner warmly at the end of the day may  be inhibited by a fear of rejection. They may also worry that their affection  will be misinterpreted as a sexual advance. Or they may feel pressure because  they have misread an embrace from their partner.  </P> <P> "You have to make it clear that this is just a greeting," Hachey stressed. "If  sexual feelings occur, it doesn't mean it's a demand. Once that's out in the  open, you feel more free and the fears go down."  </P> <P> While many therapists stressed the importance of couples forming stronger bonds  in the new year, others focused on the needs of children.  </P> <P> Patricia Adams, a Brea psychotherapist, said parents should resolve to set  aside time every week for family activities that are sure to generate laughter.  And, she added, there should be a daily family meal when the conversation  focuses on the day's events and no negative topics are introduced.  </P> <P> No matter how busy you are, find time each day to give your children undivided  attention, advised Marian Blakely, a Placentia marriage, family and child  counselor.  </P> <P> "We're all busy but if we don't focus on whatever it is we're doing at the  moment, nothing gets done with quality," she observed. "We're bathing the kid,  but our mind is on the grocery list. If we don't give our attention to the  activity at hand, it loses meaning."  </P> <P> Ken Rhea, a Huntington Beach psychotherapist, suggested that each parent spend  time alone with each child "so the kids don't get lumped together." He  remembers sitting in the car with his dad at fast-food restaurants when he was  a child, sharing talk over a hamburger and fries. "That was a special time  because we were away from home, and I knew if I had something to say, this was  the time to bring it up and he wouldn't be distracted."  </P> <P> Michael Dennis, a Huntington Beach therapist, said parents should not only  spend more time with their children, but also show respect for them as  individuals and resist the impulse to live through them vicariously. Dennis  made a long list of resolutions for parents wanting to strengthen their  relationship with their children. Among them:  </P> <P> * "I will let my kids act their age."  </P> <P> * "When disciplining, I will consider whether I am doing this to teach the  child or to express my own anger and frustration, and I will make the  consequences appropriate in degree, quantity and quality to the inappropriate  behavior."  </P> <P> * "I will not take the good things for granted. I will notice the positives in  my children and praise them more than criticize them."  </P> <P> * "I will give my children a chance to show they can be trusted."  </P> <P> Underlying those resolutions is a commitment that Helen Kohn, a Fullerton  marriage and family therapist, described when she said the most important thing  that families can do "is treat each other kindly and with love."  </P> <P> She sees many abuse victims who grew up associating love with pain. "Many  people grow up thinking love hurts, and they get into relationships where this  is fulfilled," she explained. "Love should be meaningful, gentle and  fulfilling, and we need to teach our children that."  </P> <P> Joan P. LaMontagne, a psychologist who practices in Mission Viejo and Irvine,  feels that couples are too quick to break up troubled marriages at the expense  of their children. She wants to see more couples try to work out their problems  within the context of an "unconditional commitment to marriage."  </P> <P> "The holy commitment to marriage has been lost in the need for the institution  to change, but I think we will come back around to that," she said.  </P> <P> Although LaMontagne and other therapists are optimistic that New Year's  resolutions such as these can lead to better relationships, they caution  couples not to get carried away by good intentions when the champagne starts to  flow.  </P> <P> As Gerry Owen pointed out, you'll only be disappointed if you make resolutions  that you can't back up with actions.  </P> <P> "Decide what you need to do and say to help make your resolutions work," he  advised. "And give yourself credit for small steps you take on the path to big  goals."  </P></p>

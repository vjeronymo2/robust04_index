			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Hot under the collar of the law: Fast-growing, unregulated security groups are causing concern in the UK industry - and the police If you want to know the time ask a policeman, advised the old music hall song. How things have changed. Telling people the time is not an activity requiring the commitment of expensive, highly-trained police. Neither, the UK government may be about to conclude, are more important activities such as checking fingerprints, tracing missing persons or monitoring automatic speed-check equipment. The Home Office is currently completing an internal review of specific policing functions as part of the government's review of public expenditure. Although ministers say this will not necessarily lead to changes in police responsibilities, the service is not convinced. Officers suspect the review will prove the prelude to market testing and the transfer of 'ancillary' tasks to the private or voluntary sectors. Events have not awaited the review's completion. Last week's announcement by Wandsworth council in London that it was considering extending its uniformed parks patrols to housing estates has sparked debate about the appropriateness of assigning policing duties to individuals who lack the training and status of police officers. Controversy over Wandsworth's plan is in the detail - specifically its suggestion that patrols, with the powers of constables, should be sworn in by magistrates - rather than the substance. The Association of Chief Police Officers said patrolling was 'one of the most difficult jobs which police officers are asked to undertake' and should not be attempted by under-qualified individuals. Several local authorities have, without arousing opposition, begun using uniformed personnel to combat crime, while private security staff are increasingly deployed on guarding activities that bring them into contact with the public. Completion of the review may mark the beginning of a government attempt to formalise such activities. But such a move would face practical hurdles that could, surprisingly, include reluctance of leading private security companies to take on duties that the government might want to offload. Other problems include doubts among senior police officers about the ability of the private sector to give an adequate service and political arguments about taking police activities out of the state's hands. Reputable security companies believe that the opportunities created in a fast growing sector are leading to an influx of 'cowboy' operators whose disreputable, or incompetent activities, reflect badly on the entire industry. The UK market for private security, already one of Europe's biggest, is growing with the introduction of private management of prisons and rising demands for security guards at shopping malls, industrial estates and other locations. According to a study last month for the Economic and Social and Research Council, the sector employs at least 162,000 people. This would make the sector as big in employment terms as the police. The core security guarding market is worth about Pounds 1bn a year. Information is short because the industry lacks statutory regulation. Anyone with a van, a mobile telephone and a convincing-looking dog can set up a security company. Cynics add that a criminal record is no impediment. Reputable companies deplore the absence of regulation. The British Security Industries Association, which represents most of the leading operators, senior police officers and opposition MPs all support statutory regulation and licensing of security companies. The government has rejected such demands for action. It prefers self-regulation and has told industry representatives that licensing would favour bigger companies and so be anti-competitive. It is not convinced that 'cowboys' are more prevalent than in any other sector. Leaders of the industry may, however, insist on regulation to control rogue operators as the price for taking on any police duties. Even with statutory controls, some security company managers share chief constables' reservations about the implications of transferring police work to the private sector. Mr David Dickinson, director of security company Group 4, told the Association of Chief Police Officers last month that the role of security companies must be confined to crime prevention and not stray into the area of law enforcement. He fears that the public would fail to understand a blurring of the edges between companies such as his and the police. Setting a limit on the role of security companies would, however, allow scope for imaginative developments in joint working between the public and private sectors. Some police forces, Mr Dickinson says, already employ private security companies to guard their own headquarters. He suggests the police should consider whether to spend some of their budgets on buying in 'preventative uniformed patrols in the community under the total control of the chief constable'. Chief constables' control is likely to emerge as a central theme in the police service's response to any government attempts to introduce a greater private role in policing. The service is unhappy about the prospect of two-tier policing - it holds passionately to the view that whenever a police officer walks along a street he or she might be confronted with any number of emergencies, and must be trained and equipped for them all. But if the private security industry won statutory regulation, police confidence in it would increase. That would put pressure on chief constables to become managers of a 'mixed economy' of policing. They could, in a pattern becoming increasingly familiar in the public sector, retain overall responsibility for activities carried out under contract by other agencies. There is a precedent for this: chief constables are now responsible for the management of large numbers of civilian staff recruited in recent years to relieve police officers of behind-the-scenes support duties such as running control rooms. A 'mixed economy' approach was proposed last month by an independent inquiry into police roles and responsibilities initiated by two academic bodies, the Police Foundation and the Policy Studies Institute. It raised the possibility of street patrols run by local authorities, community groups or private security companies, operating under the direction of the regular police. Such support groups could, suggested the inquiry, relieve the police of administrative burdens such as delivering summonses or making inquiries about under-age drinking in public houses. The inquiry's ideas have alarmed the Police Federation, which represents the rank and file. 'It is estimated that the police service costs about 31p a day per head of population,' says Mr Fred Broughton, its chairman. 'By raising public spending by a few pence per head, it would be possible to put more police officers on the streets. They would be real, fully-trained officers capable of dealing with everything that arose, unlike the alternative patrols that are being considered.' The federation scorns the idea of substituting police officers with lower-cost replacements; but there are fears in Britain's police stations that some chief constables, who are about to become more accountable under fixed-term contracts, may be attracted to it as a means of trying to meet and finance public demand for more street patrols. As last week's reaction to the Wandsworth plan showed, transferring police duties to other providers generates ethical and constitutional concerns. Such worries have not been a obstacle before in the government's law and order policies. The introduction of private prison management was not halted by the argument of opponents that only state employees, untouched by the profit motive, should be allowed to deprive individuals of their liberty. Having failed to deflect ministers on that issue, critics could not with equal seriousness claim that it would be an outrage for charities to become responsible for lost dogs, or private security companies or motoring organisations to escort wide loads along motorways. But the argument does not end there. Those activities most suited to contracting out - from lost property to routine patrols - are the ones that bring ordinary citizens into most contact with the police service. Take them away, and where does it leave the regular, front-line police? As an increasingly remote, heavily armed, centrally deployed force, say critics - some of them in the police service itself. This raises big constitutional questions. Yet they may not be heard amid the clamour from a public that wants more visible protection from burglars, car thieves and muggers, and is not particularly concerned whether the protectors wear the uniforms of the police, Securicor or the local council.</p>

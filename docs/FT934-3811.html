			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Westpac Banking forms derivatives trading unit Westpac Banking Corp, the Australian bank, has set up a separately capitalised offshoot for derivatives trading. Westpac Derivative Products (WDP) will be rated triple-A by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agencies. Several participants in the derivatives market have set up similar units, notably Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers and Paribas. Banks and securities houses with ratings below double-A are at a disadvantage in the lucrative derivatives business, as clients are credit-sensitive; a triple-A rated unit allows them to compete on a more even playing field. WDP will have an initial capital base of Dollars 200m, half in paid-in capital from Westpac; the balance will be provided by a surety bond issued by Capital Markets Assurance Corp (CapMac), a specialist insurance company. The amount of capital required will increase according to the level of exposure. WDP will be wound up if Westpac falls below investment grade, and if other defined 'trigger events' occur.</p>

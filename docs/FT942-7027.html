			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Radio licence sale rules slated The system which allowed the sale of London's AM and FM licences by a merchant bank consortium four months before broadcasting was to start was yesterday criticised by Mr Gerald Kaufman, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons heritage committee. Reuters, the financial information and news group, is buying London News Radio - the consortium backed by Guinness Mahon - which will start broadcasting in October. Last September the LNR team won the battle for the AM and FM licences then held by LBC. Mr Kaufman said: 'This is the outcome of the broadcasting Act. Reuters is a reputable company, so I am not too concerned about them, but the system is deplorable.' Guinness Mahon yesterday said: 'We were gearing up from day one to deliver a real live broadcasting station.' The Radio Authority, which approved the transfer, said there was no question of unqualified parties being awarded licences and then selling them on without safeguards. LNR had produced the best broadcasting proposal, and Reuters would be obliged to abide by the conditions on which the licence was awarded. These lasted for the full eight-year term of the licence, and would apply to any purchaser. Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act, the sale of a national radio licence must be approved in advance by the Radio Authority for the first year after the licence is awarded, but local radio licences can be sold at any time. The Guinness Mahon consortium is thought to have received up to Pounds 5m for the LNR licence, which is Reuters' first move into radio. The merchant bank described the Reuters approach as 'an offer we couldn't refuse'. The consortium also spent an undisclosed amount last month to buy LBC, which went into receivership after it lost its two London licences and was then outbid for the third national commercial radio licence. LNR was anxious to prevent a damaging gap before it began broadcasting. Apart from Guinness Mahon, the principal beneficiary of the transaction will be Mr Bruce Fireman, a corporate financier and media expert with Guinness Mahon who became managing director of LNR but will now return.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 10. Applicants assert that the terms of the relief requested with respect to Contracts to be issued through the Separate Account or through Future Accounts are consistent with the standards enumerated in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Without the requested relief, Applicants would have to request and obtain exemptive relief for each Future Contract. Applicants state that such additional requests for exemptive relief would present no issues under the 1940 Act not already addressed in this request for exemptive relief. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Applicants assert that the requested relief is appropriate in the public interest because it would promote competitiveness in the variable life insurance market by eliminating the need for Applicants to file redundant exemptive applications, thereby reducing administrative expenses and maximizing efficient use of resources. The delay and expense involved in having to seek repeated exemptive relief would impair the ability of Applicants to take advantage fully of business opportunities as those opportunities arise. Additionally, Applicants state that the requested relief is consistent with the purposes of the 1940 Act and the protection of investors for the same reasons. If Applicants were required to seek exemptive relief repeatedly with respect to the same issues addressed in this application, investors would not receive any benefit or additional protection thereby and might be disadvantaged as a result of increased overhead expenses for Applicants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conditions for Relief <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants represent that FKLA will monitor the reasonableness of the charge to be deducted pursuant to the requested exemptive relief. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants represent that the registration statement for each Contract under which the charge referenced in paragraph one of this section is deducted will : (i) Disclose the charge; (ii) explain the purpose of the charge; and (iii) state that the charge is reasonable in relation to the increased federal income tax burden under Section 848 of the Code resulting from the receipt of premiums. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants represent that the registration statement for each Contract under which the charge referenced in paragraph one of this section is deducted will contain as an exhibit an actuarial opinion as to: (i) The reasonableness of the charge in relation to the increased federal income tax burden under Section 848 resulting from the receipt of premiums; (ii) the reasonableness of the after tax rate of return that is used in calculating such charge; and (iii) the appropriateness of the factors taken into account in determining the after tax rate of return. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants submit that, for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from Section 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, and Rules 6e&hyph;2(c)(4)(v) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4)(v) thereunder, to permit the deduction of up to 1.25% of premium payments under the Contracts meet the standards in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. In this regard, Applicants assert that granting the relief requested in the application would be appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

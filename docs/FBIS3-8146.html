			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Hugh Pope article: "Albanians at Crossroads In New </F> Republic"]    [Text] It was a bloodless coup in the mist-shrouded town  of Tetovo, in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM),  that captured the headquarters and seals of office of the  country's main ethnic Albanian party. Hardly a major threat, it  seemed, to the security of the Balkans.    But if violence in former Yugoslavia does shift from Bosnia  to the tense ethnically Albanian Serbian province of Kosovo, the  actions of Albanians in the FYROM will be a key to whether the  fighting spreads. The radical faction that seized control in  Tetovo last month will clearly not take any threat to their  kinsmen, just over the border in Kosovo, lying down. Even  moderates believe the risks are great.    "War in Kosovo probably means war in Macedonia, even a  Balkan  war," said Servet Arviu, a minister of state from the Albanian  minority. Any such conflict would test the FYROM's ethnic  balances and the fragile Slav-Albanian coalition government.    Strains have already risen since Mr Arviu's moderate faction  was ousted by more nationalist radicals during a February  congress of the ethnic Albanians' Party for Democratic  Prosperity.    The results of the congress are still contested, but  Albanian  Muslims are now at a crossroads critical for the future  stability of this country, where they have a very different  language, script, religion and culture from the Orthodox  Christian Slav majority.    Shazim Mehmeti, a hard-faced ideologue from the radical  faction, tried to calm any worries. "There won't be a big  change. But we will insist that our parliamentary group does  not serve as mere decoration," he said. He added his gratitude  for the goodwill of Albania proper, emerging from decades of  isolation just over the mountains to the west and beginning to  make its psychological weight felt.    The people of the FYROM are also trying to stay calm.  "Albania is trying to strengthen the idea of one Albania and  has links to the radical elements. It could be dangerous, but  it's unlikely.    Albania will be the big issue in 10 to 15 years' time, if  current demographic trends continue. Right now they can do  nothing. They have no foreign support," [quotation marks as  published] said a commentator, Saso Ordanovski.    If left alone, the FYROM still seems far from the brink of  any ethnic bloodbath. The government has tried hard to keep the  nationalist genie in the bottle. The Turkish ambassador, for  instance, said that ethnic Turks in the FYROM were the  best-treated in the Balkans.    Enlightened policies by the 65 per cent majority FYROM Slavs  and President Kiro Gligorov have helped. Albanians have five of  22 ministries in the coalition government and 23 seats in the  120-seat parliament, most of them intellectuals from the  moderate Albanian party faction. The Albanians are being  promised a bigger share in government and investment in Tetovo  and other Albanian-populated areas of the western FYROM.    The Defence Minister, Vladi Popovski, said the ethnic  Albanian percentage of new conscripts had gone up from 14 to 26  per cent in the past year, and that their share of the officer  corps had doubled to 3.9 per cent. He did not believe that  there were any more large armed Albanian networks like one  uncovered last November.    Nobody is sure of the exact proportion of ethnic Albanians  among the FYROM's 2.2 million people. Officially they make up  21 per cent of the population, but Albanians claim up to 40 per  cent.    "We managed to maintain peace in Macedonia. The people in  power know what peace means and the price of peace, and the  international community has also shown far more prior concern  for Macedonia (than Bosnia)," Mr Arviu said, although his face  was drawn with worry about the long-festering political split  among the once united ethnic Albanians.    Another problem is the troubled economy. The FYROM has just  embarked on an IMF stabilisation programme and is subject to a  total blockade of its main trade route by Greece.    Ethnic Albanians wanting schools and other benefits are  being  told to be patient and that any favouritism could provok FYROM  Slav nationalists, who have been a declining force since 1991.  That could change. "Albanians are the biggest real problem of  Macedonia. They smuggle, they are unemployed, they want work,  schools, autonomous areas. They have large families. Illegal  immigrants come from Albania and Albanian bandits attack our  villages," said the young manager of a clothes shop in the  capital, Skopje. "They want a state within a state. It started  out like that in Bosnia. Everyone is very pessimistic."</p>

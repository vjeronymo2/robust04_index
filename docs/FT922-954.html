			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Letter: An insensitive generalisation Sir, I should like to object in the strongest terms to remarks made by Malcolm Rutherford in his review of As You Like It (Arts, June 18). Commenting on the performance of Bette Bourne as Jaques, Mr Rutherford states that there is an 'underlying suggestion' that Jaques is suffering from 'some fatal disease, quite probably Aids'. The patent leap in your reviewer's mind from the actor's deliberate choice of a campy, languid persona in his interpretation of Jaques to homosexuality, to Aids, displays an appalling insensitivity. Such a generalisation, made on such insubstantial evidence, is profoundly offensive  -and not only to people whose lives have been directly affected by Aids.

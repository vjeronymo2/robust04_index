			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Marina Garbesi report: "`These Are the Men Who Must Be </F> Sacked'"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- The guillotine has already been greased,  the list of the probable "beheaded" is four pages long. The  names of the First Republic "mandarins" destined to climb into  the tumbril leading to the scaffold are typed in bold. This,  however, is not an edict, but a newspaper item whose title is  "How Many Heads Must Roll." The list was scrupulously compiled  by ITALIA SETTIMANALE (chief editor: Marcello Veneziani;  leading commentator: Gustavo Selva) which claims to be the  semiofficial mouthpiece of the new triumphant Right, and openly  supports the government pact between [Forza Italia leader]  Berlusconi, [Italian Social Movement (MSI) Secretary] Fini, and  [League Secretary] Bossi.    A sort of "Who's Who" for the new era. In fact, following  the era of power-sharing deals -- the weekly magazine claimed --  the beheading era is now to begin.    Who, then, will ride in the tumbril? Quite a few of the  "powerful" risk losing their heads. A few judges, to begin  with, such as Caselli, Cordova, Casson, Borrelli, and  D'Ambrosio, "who are unlikely to continue their RAI3 [third TV  network] careers in politics and justice, or follow the  judiciary road to socialism." There are, then, the "anti-Mafia  professionals," thus defined in a short article under the  concisely effective, albeit somewhat sinister title of  "Decollated Gowns," such as Luciano Violante, Antonino  Caponnetto, and Giuseppe Ayala. These people must "retire  early" from all institutional posts, and "less TV time must be  made available" to them. The judges mentioned were in the front  line in the war against Cosa Nostra and bribe city crimes and  misdeeds. In the past -- so concern was being voiced yesterday  in various public prosecutors' offices -- isolating those who  were in the front line had negative, if not tragic,  consequences, and we would be well advised not to forget this.    The metaphorical "executioner" also seems to have quite a  huge job on his hands at the RAI [state broadcasting company].  The "new course" is said to have already arranged its basket to  collect some outstanding "heads": Away with RAI1 Chairman Nadio  Delai, away with TG1 Director Demetrio Volcic, away with RAI2  Chairman Giovanni Minoli! On the scaffold are also TG2 Director  Paolo Garimberti, RAI3 Chairman Angelo Guglielmi, newscast  director Livio Zanetti, and radio broadcast programing director  Aldo Grasso. ITALIA SETTIMANALE did not forget to mention also  other predetermined (i.e., disliked by the winning coalition)  victims among journalists. Thus, it was pushing Lilli Gruber  and Corradino Mineo, Michele Santoro and Roberto Morrione, Italo  Moretti and Giulio Borrelli -- all of whom are labeled "left" --  into the tumbril.    A good cleanup is also to take place in the entertainment  industry. Gillo Pontecorvo, Luca Ronconi, Giorgio Strehler, and  Lina Wertmuller will not escape.    Among the boyards to be purged, there are "many officials  who  are often more powerful than ministers." These are the names:  Treasury "number one" Mario Draghi, economic programing general  secretary Corrado Fiaccavento, and Antitrust Commission Chairman  Franco Saja. The detailed list suggested that the heads of  Federcalcio [soccer federation] Chairman Antonio Matarrese, and  former minister Marco Carraro would also end up in the basket.  Even the sins of someone like Volleyball League Chairman Carlo  Fracanzani were deemed to be unpardonable.    The list (drawn up by Tuccio Risi and Lorenzo Stella) ended  with a touch of malice reserved for police chief Parisi, who  would also be waiting for the final verdict: "Will he save  himself by becoming one of Fini's allies?"

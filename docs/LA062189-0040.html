			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF  </P> <P> U.S. Rep. Sidney Yates (D-Ill.) said Tuesday he will offer legislation to block  federal grants to a North Carolina arts agency that supported a controversial  photograph featuring a crucifix immersed in the photographer's urine. Under the  Yates amendment to a National Endowment for the Arts funding bill, the NEA  would be required to make its grants directly to artists, a change in endowment  procedures that would affect 200 of the NEA's 4,500 annual grants with an  estimated value of $15 million. The change in procedure, a Yates spokesman  said, is intended to prevent a recurrence of a controversy in which  conservative senators and congressmen have demanded action against the  endowment because of its indirect support of the photographer who produced the  crucifix-urine image. The work, by New York photographer Andres Serrano, was  selected for inclusion in a traveling show that received partial NEA funding  and was organized by the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art, a North  Carolina agency that receives about $75,000 a year from the endowment.

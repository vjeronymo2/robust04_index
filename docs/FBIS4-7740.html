			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sumegi report: "Assessment of Liberal Chances -- The SZDSZ </F> Would Not Join an MSZP-Led Coalition"]    [Text] The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] would not  participate in a coalition in which the Hungarian Socialist  Party [MSZP] is the leading force. We can only imagine an  opening toward the MSZP if the SZDSZ is the dominant force of  the coalition, SZDSZ campaign chief Balint Magyar said at the  party's news conference on 1 April.    He also said that the chances of the SZDSZ forming a  coalition with the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] are minimal.  Magyar believes, however, that cooperation with the Christian  Democratic People's Party [KDNP] is "worth considering and it  can be a healthy development in a given situation." It seems to  be natural -- and is also supported by public opinion polls --  that people want to vote the MDF out of government. The only  question is whether the people will give their confidence to the  SZDSZ or the MSZP to form the government. According to Magyar,  it is the SZDSZ whose policy will not increase the division of  society. Therefore, the ideal solution would be a government  dominated by liberals, with a concentric structure. The data  that 81 percent of people would like to see the SZDSZ as part of  the future coalition also shows society's support for the party.  However, in order also to find the way toward the center right  parties and to form a broad coalition, it is necessary that the  MSZP does not become dominant.    Gabor Fodor reported on the public opinion poll data  according to which the SZDSZ is "slowly but surely" progressing  toward its goal. According to Fodor, it is important that the  MSZP has the largest number of sure supporters but, because of  the characteristics of the Hungarian electoral system, the SZDSZ  may achieve a very good result in the second round of the  elections. It can be expected that, because the MSZP  considerably divides society, many people will choose the SZDSZ  in the second round because it is the least rejected party. In  contrast to this, due to the worrying processes in the party and  the strengthening power of the etatist trend that advocates  redistribution by the state, the MSZP is rejected by a large  segment of society.</p>

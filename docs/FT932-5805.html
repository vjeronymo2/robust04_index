			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / People: Stenham and Evans to Trafalgar Following months of boardroom upheaval, Cob Stenham and Dick Evans are joining Trafalgar House as independent directors in a move foreshadowed in the interim results in early May. Although Hongkong Land is only a 25 per cent minority shareholder, there are now four representatives from the Jardine Matheson empire on the Trafalgar board, including chairman Simon Keswick, finance director David Gawler, and non-executives Sir Charles Powell and Rodney Leach. If yesterday's appointments are not to be seen as cosmetic, as some analysts worried, Stenham and Evans will have an important role in listening out for the interests of the rest of Trafalgar's investors. It is a task that ought to be familiar for Stenham (pictured left), who is non-executive chairman of Anglo-French paper group Arjo Wiggins Appleton. However, some Arjo investors have been questioning not just the size of Stenham's remuneration but also the influence apparently being wielded by the French minority shareholders. The new recruits join Sir Archibald Foster, David Howell and Tony Ryan, the embattled chairman of GPA. There have been rumours the latter will leave the board but Trafalgar House has not made any announcement. For Evans (pictured right), it is the first major plc outside directorship he has accepted. Chief executive of British Aerospace since 1990, Evans joined the military aircraft division of British Aircraft Corporation in 1967. He has been on the board of BAe since 1987.</p>

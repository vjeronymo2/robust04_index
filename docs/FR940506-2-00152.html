The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant's Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Each Series will be a series of applicant, a unit investment trust registered under the Act. Prudential Securities Incorporated (``Prudential'') is applicant's depositor. Prudential currently intends to offer a new Series four times a year at about the beginning of each calendar quarter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Each Series' investment objective is to provide total return through a combination of potential capital appreciation and current dividend income. Each Series will invest approximately 20%, but in no event more than 20.5%, <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  of the value of such Series' total assets in each of the five lowest dollar price per share stocks of the ten common stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (``DJIA'') having the highest dividend yields. Dividend yields will be calculated by annualizing the last quarterly or semi-annual ordinary dividend distributed on that security and dividing the result by the market value of the security at the close of the New York Stock Exchange either on or shortly before such Series' initial date of deposit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Prudential will attempt to purchase securities so that each of the five common stocks in a Series portfolio represents twenty percent of the value of a Series' total assets on the initial date of deposit. Prudential may purchase the securities for a Series in odd lots in order to achieve this goal. However, it is more efficient if securities are purchased in 100 share lots and 50 share lots. As a result, a Series may purchase securities of a securities related issuer that represent over twenty percent, but in no event more than 20.5 percent, of a Series' assets on the initial date of deposit to the extent necessary to enable Prudential to meet its purchase requirements and to obtain the best price for the securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. The DJIA comprises 30 widely-held common stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange which are chosen by the editors of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Wall Street Journal.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The DJIA is the property of Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc., which is not affiliated with Prudential or any Series, and does not participate in any way in the creation of any Series or the selection of its stocks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The securities deposited in each Series will be chosen solely according to the formula described above, and will not necessarily reflect the research opinions or buy or sell recommendations of Prudential. Prudential will have no discretion as to which securities are purchased. Securities deposited in a Series may include securities of issuers that derived more than fifteen percent of their gross revenues in their most recent fiscal year from securities related activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. During the 90-day period following the initial date of deposit, Prudential may deposit additional securities, maintaining to the extent practicable the original proportionate relationship among the number of shares of each stock in the portfolio. Subsequent deposits made after the 90-day period following the initial date of deposit must replicate exactly (subject to certain limited exceptions) the proportionate relationship among the face amounts of the securities comprising the portfolio at the end of the initial 90-day period, whether or not a stock continues to be among the five highest dividend yielding stocks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

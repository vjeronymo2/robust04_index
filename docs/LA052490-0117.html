			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / INSURANCE COMMISSIONER;  </P> <P> ZELMAN, GARAMENDI UNVEIL CAMPAIGN ADVERTISING PLANS  </P> <P> Democratic insurance commissioner candidate Walter Zelman has unveiled a  television advertisement portraying him as the only major candidate who is  taking no special interest money in the campaign.  </P> <P> Zelman, former director of California Common Cause, says in his 30-second  television commercial that his lack of special interest financial support means  that "my campaign can't afford a major television ad campaign."  </P> <P> He said he hopes to be able to buy up to $40,000 in air time before the June 5  primary. This compares with reported television commitments by other Democratic  candidates thus far exceeding $700,000 for state Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut  Grove), and close to $600,000 for State Board of Equalization Chairman Conway  Collis and TV commentator Bill Press.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, it was revealed that Garamendi has obtained, for an undisclosed  price, the services of the Berman &amp; D'Agostino campaign firm. The firm,  which has a reputation for shrewd and often controversial campaigning, calls  itself BAD Campaigns and is the campaign arm of the powerful political machine  headed by Reps. Howard Berman and Henry Waxman, Democratic congressmen from Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Revels Cayton, Garamendi's campaign manager, said, "We've hired BAD to produce  a television spot for us and that's being completed in time for Memorial Day,  and we're going to be on their slates."  </P> <P> Cayton added that, "I'm not sure, no one is precisely sure, how much mail will  be going out in our behalf." But managers in at least three other campaigns  said they had been told that Berman and D'Agostino will send out at least three  pieces of mail on Garamendi's behalf to households throughout California  containing at least two Democrats who had previously shown a high propensity to  vote. They estimated that mail alone could cost Garamendi $600,000.  </P> <P> Press, who has either led or closely trailed Garamendi in a number of polls,  commented that "not even the talents of Michael Berman (one of the partners in  the firm) can sell California voters a professional politician who did not  support Proposition 103."  </P> <P> But obtaining the services of the Berman firm has long been seen as a vital  prerequisite for a Garamendi primary victory.  </P> <P> The senator, who has run unsuccessfully twice before for statewide office,  carried a large majority of the state's 58 counties in 1986 in his race for  state controller against Gray Davis, but his weak spot was the Los Angeles  metropolitan area. That is the area where the Berman political machine is  strongest.  </P> <P> Garamendi, criticized by Zelman for taking campaign contributions from many  political action committees, does not get contributions from the trial lawyers,  who are mainly backing Press, and has returned most contributions from the  insurance industry. But he is collecting heavily from medical practitioners and  other powerful Sacramento lobbies, while vowing to defend consumer interests.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> The race: Insurance commissioner. Whose ad? Democratic candidate Walter Zelman.  </P> <P> Zelman has a 30-second commercial that tries to get across the point that he is  the only major candidate in the race who is independent of the special  interests.  </P> <P> At a maximum, Zelman says he will be able to afford only $40,000 worth of air  time, not much by statewide campaign standards.  </P> <P>  Elements of the ad, with an analysis by Times staff writer Kenneth Reich:  </P> <P> Ad: "Not many people will see this ad because I don't take special interest  money," an unsmiling Zelman declares. "I don't take money from the insurance  industry. I don't take money from trial lawyer associations, and I don't take  money from political action committees. And I'm the only major candidate who  can say that." He concludes, "If you want to elect a fund raiser, vote for the  guy with the most commercials. If you want to elect a consumer leader, vote for  me. . . . I'm the one without the special interest money."  </P> <P> Analysis: This ad is franker than most, and its main elements are correct. Of  the candidates in the top two or three positions in the polls on both the  Democratic and Republican sides, Zelman is the only one to bar taking money  from all three powerful interest groups. One phrase, however, "trial lawyer  associations," is carefully worded. Zelman does take money from individual  trial lawyers, and this is potentially a sizable loophole in his purist  position. Zelman, however, has supported no-fault auto insurance, so few trial  lawyers are contributing to his campaign. The phrase "major candidate" is, of  course, subjective, because some candidates may or may not be considered  "major." Democrat Ray Bourhis, for example, also does not take money from the  three interests. "The guy with the most commercials" is an apparent gibe at one  of two Democrats, state Sen. John Garamendi or television commentator Bill  Press, both of whom have made major television buys. Garamendi has raised  considerable money from political action committees and Press considerable  money from trial lawyers. Zelman, whose campaign is nearly broke, doesn't take  from either.  </P></p>

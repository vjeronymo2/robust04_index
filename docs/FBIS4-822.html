			<p>BFN     [Text] The Federation of Labor Unions of Niger [USTN]  launched a general strike to demand salary increases to stem the  effects of CFA devaluation. Now the opposition is calling for  civil disobedience. Andre Salifou, the former speaker of the  interim National Assembly and leader of the opposition Union of  Progressive Patriots and Democrats, explains their demands.    [Begin Salifou recording] The (?UCI) [expansion unknown] is  ailing. Democracy has been twisted for a year now, and the  negative result is that our freedom of movement is not  respected. What can we do in the face of such a situation?    After a year of various attempts, I repeat, various  attempts,  to solve the issue, because we condemned the way things were  being conducted in Parliament and I myself am a parliamentarian,  nobody listened. We issued press communiques, most of which  were censored, asking the authorities to change their methods.  We also held rallies and organized demonstrations. We  petitioned and sent motions to the head of state, the prime  minister. We sent a number of letters without receiving a  single response. The only recourse left to us is the use of an  article contained in our Constitution. Article 6 stipulates that  the Niger people can call the state to order. The second point  of this article further describes any power, any regime that  deliberately violates the present Constitution, as oppressive.  That is why we will launch a campaign of civil disobedience,  because Niger is stifled and threatened with chaos. We should  stop this devilish machine that could crush the country and its  citizens. [end recording]    The Niger head of state, President Mahamane Ousmane,  believes  that the opposition should return to the negotiating table. To  Mr. Ousmane, this call for civil disobedience is merely an  emotional reaction from the opposition.    [Begin Ousmane recording] The opposition is expressing its  fears. This is absolutely normal in the context of freedom of  speech, of democracy, and political pluralism. Everybody has  the right to express himself, express what they think, their  views and conception on what is going on in the world. However,  we have a framework that is the Constitution, the parties'  manifestos, the laws and regulations of the Republic. As far as  I am concerned, the opposition is not questioning these  fundamental elements. I also think that until now, the  opposition publicized their intention to use Article 6 of the  Constitution and call for civil disobedience. Therefore, I  believe this is an emotional expression. With consultations  and dialogue, everything will be fine. [end recording]</p>

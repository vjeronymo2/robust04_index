			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> POINDEXTER JURY TO HEAR NORTH  </P> <P> Oliver L. North will be the first witness at the Iran-Contra trial of his  former boss, John M. Poindexter, a federal judge ruled today, rejecting a  defense motion to bar North from testifying because of alleged perjury.  </P> <P> As jury selection for the trial entered its third day, U.S. District Judge  Harold Greene revealed that Poindexter's lawyers had filed two sealed motions.  </P> <P> The first, which Greene denied, asked that North not be allowed to testify  during Poindexter's trial because North allegedly committed perjury during his  own Iran-Contra trial last year.  </P> <P> The second motion by Poindexter's lawyers seeks to limit North's testimony, and  Greene said he will hold a hearing on that issue later.  </P> <P> Full details of the motions were not clear because they were filed under seal  and kept secret. Poindexter's lawyer, Richard Beckler, refused to discuss the  matters in any detail.  </P></p>

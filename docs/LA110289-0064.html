			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VALENCIA MAN ARRESTED IN PORNOGRAPHY CASE  </P> <P> A Valencia man was arrested Wednesday on charges stemming from the seizure last  month of more than 30 child-pornography videotapes and a computer for  cataloguing his porn collection, the Los Angeles city attorney's office said.  </P> <P> Randall L. Holding, 42, was taken into custody at his Glendale office and was  being held at the Los Angeles Police Department's Parker Center Jail, said Mike  Qualls, a spokesman for the city attorney's office.  </P> <P> Holding was charged Tuesday with one count of exhibiting pornography involving  a minor to a person over 18 years old and one count of exchanging a photograph  in which a person under the age of 14 is depicted engaging in sexual conduct.  Holding could be jailed for up to one year and fined as much as $2,000 on each  count, Qualls said.  </P> <P> Holding, a consultant who finds inexpensive moving companies for clients, was  arrested once before on Oct. 6 after he showed child-pornography magazines to  an undercover detective, to whom he also made statements about fondling his  6-year-old stepdaughter, said Deputy City Atty. Tracy Webb.  </P> <P> The day after his initial arrest, Holding was freed from jail when his wife  posted $5,000 bail, Qualls said. He is awaiting arraignment on a charge of  annoying a child in that case, Qualls said.  </P> <P> While searching Holding's house Oct. 6, investigators also seized several  videocassette recorders, televisions and a video camera, Qualls said. That  search led to Holding's arrest Wednesday.  </P> <P> The investigation started in September after detectives received a tip about  Holding's interest in child pornography, Qualls said.  </P></p>

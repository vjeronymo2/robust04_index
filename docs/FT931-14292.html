			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Money Markets: French rates softer CASH RATES in the French markets closed softer yesterday, even though the Bank of France decided not to alter its officially posted interest rates, writes James Blitz. The French franc's good performance against the D-Mark last week had led some dealers to think that France might reintroduce its five to 10-day lending window yesterday, and cut the overnight lending rate to below the 12 per cent level. Lingering bearishness in the Bundesbank may have stopped the French authorities taking this decision. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank deputy president, said yesterday that the German inflation rate was still far above acceptable levels. However, the French currency appeared to be unaffected by this comment and continued to hover around the FFr3.38 level to the D-Mark, which is more than 5 centimes above its floor against the German currency in the European exchange rate mechanism. French cash rates consequently softened. Three-month money yesterday declined from around 11 1/2 per cent to 11 1/4 per cent. French franc futures also progressed slightly, with the March contract closing 9 basis points higher on the day at 90.45. At this level it still assumes that three-month money will be at 9.55 per cent by the spring, some 180 basis points below yesterday's level. Helped by Mr Tietmeyer's comments, Euromark futures fell back yesterday, with the March contract finishing at 92.16, some 7 basis points down on the day. Short-dated rates in the sterling cash market were soft yesterday, in spite of a large shortage of Pounds 1.7bn forecast by the Bank of England at the start of operations. However, most of the shortage was removed in the early round, conditions were easy for most of the day and the overnight lending rate progressively fell from its opening level of 6 7/8 per cent. Three- month money ended the day unchanged, fractionally below the base rate figure of 7 per cent. At the weekend, Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, signalled a cautious approach to further UK interest rate cuts, and this may have been responsible for the 6 basis-point retreat in the March short sterling contract to a close of 93.43. One dealer suggested that the market had never been expecting a rate cut, and the only issue of debate now was whether rates would be reduced in the March budget by 50 or 100 basis points.</p>

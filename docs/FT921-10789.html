			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Seacon tops Pounds 1.6m after 5% increase In a difficult year, which took in the Gulf war and the deepening recession, Seacon Holdings, the USM-quoted transport and freight group, raised pre-tax profits by 5 per cent, from Pounds 1.58m to Pounds 1.66m. Mr Chris Roth, chairman and chief executive, said the result for the 12 months to September 30 was achieved from an increased share of a falling and more difficult market, as well as higher interest receivable (Pounds 788,000 net against Pounds 547,000) on cash resources. Turnover showed little change at Pounds 17.7m (Pounds 17.3m) but operating profit fell to Pounds 847,000 (Pounds 1.04m). Earnings were 12.05p (13.91p) and the final dividend is 2.7p for a total of 4.2p (3.5p). Mr Roth said in the first quarter of the current year profits were marginally ahead. But he did not expect any marked improvement in results for the rest of the year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Iran-America Relations"] </F>   [Text] Talks, comments and features on Iran-America  relations are heard and seen in the western media quite often  these days. Last Thursday the Islamic Republic of Iran News  Agency (IRNA) reported, without quoting the source, that Mr.  Robert Pelletreau, undersecretary of state for Near Eastern  affairs had said that Washington did not intend to subvert the  Islamic government in Iran and that it was ready to sit down  with Iranian officials and discuss outstanding issues on which  Tehran and Washington have different views. Mr. Pelletreau was  also quoted as saying that the political system in Iran is here  to stay for a long time to come.    It has been noticed that the subject of Iran-America  relations is usually raised when some tragic event occurs in the  Muslim world. For instance, the topic was widely discussed in  the western media simultaneously with the signing of an accord  in Washington last September between Mr. Yasir 'Arafat and Mr.  Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister of the Zionist state.    And now we hear the same story told by a different person  after the slaughter of more than 60 Palestinian worshipers at  the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Al-Khalil (Hebron).    This might have been done with the intention of diverting  attention of the people of Iran from vital issues and maybe for  conveying a message to its officials that if they should look  the other way, they would be compensated.    Nevertheless, the official stance of the Islamic Republic of  Iran on this issue has been made known on many occasions. The  last time it was done was by the leader of the Islamic  Revolution, Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, who said on the 14th  anniversary of the seizure of the former U.S. Embassy by Muslim  students in Tehran that, "The Iranian nation does not need to  negotiate, or have relations with an arrogant enemy such as  America."    Anyway, if Washington is sincere in its aims to reconcile  differences with a big Muslim country in the Middle East the  easiest way would be to settle all financial matters with Iran.  The first step Clinton's administration can take is release all  Iranian assets that were frozen by the former U.S. president  Jimmy Carter. The next step would be to attend to other issues  of dispute between America and Iran such as the downing of the  passenger airliner in the Persian Gulf. These and several other  points can be negotiated and a solution found to end the  animosity between Iran and America. But will the U.S. ever be  able to keep aside its arrogance? Will it realize that a  revolutionary nation can never be forced to yield by arrogance,  threats and baseless accusations such as international terrorism  and violation of human rights?</p>

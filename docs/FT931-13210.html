			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Hafnia The orderly queue of bidders forming for the various bits of Hafnia is not as surprising as it looks. With group debt parked in the holding company, the core Danish insurance operations look attractive. The disaster which befell Hafnia had more to do with misguided corporate ambition than the ability of Denmark's second largest insurer to make a decent return on underwriting and investing. Even allowing that some business will have been lost since the shares were suspended, the buyer should acquire a decent market position. The business should be worth more to a domestic competitor, who could use the scope for rationalisation and synergies. On that basis Codan - in which Sun Alliance has a majority stake - looks the most logical buyer. Skandia might equally be prepared to pay a premium for the chance to repatriate the 15 per cent slice of its share capital held by Hafnia. Potentially interested parties from outside Scandinavia, such as Allianz, are hardly short of capital. But the most likely candidates are still digesting prey from the last round of acquisitions. It is less clear where a buyer for Hafnia's 34 per cent stake in Baltica Holding might come from. Like Hafnia, the basic insurance business is sound enough. But the holding company bears the scars of ill-fated ventures in property and banking. Having seen the shares fall by some 80 per cent in the last two years, Suez might just be tempted to add to its 23 per cent stake and take control on the cheap. But that looks too tidy a solution for Hafnia's creditors to hope for.</p>

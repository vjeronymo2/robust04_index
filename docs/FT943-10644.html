			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Zurich's services sector gets back to basics Zurich has long prided itself on providing the finest and safest in banking and shopping for the world's rich. Soon the city may be able to offer them similarly trustworthy services of a more traditional kind. Zurich is about to get its first official brothel. An application has been lodged with city authorities seeking to change the use of a building in Allmendstrasse to 'erotic services, a brothel from offices and shops' (erotische Dienstleistung, Bordell anstelle von Buro- und Gewerbesraumen). The detailed plans call for the creation of 12 apartments (Arbeitsplatzen) to be rented to prostitutes individually, administration and medical rooms and a 'contact and recreation room'. This is not a joke, but a well-meaning and, of course, typically practical and commercial, Swiss response to a recent change in the law which decriminalises prostitution in some circumstances. The project is the brainchild of Mr Valentin Landmann, a colourful Zurich lawyer who has fought for years to legalise prostitution. Mr Landmann's view is that the power of pimps over prostitutes can only be removed if women are allowed to practise the oldest profession freely. The Swiss federal government appeared to come to a similar view two years ago, altering the criminal code article dealing with prostitution so that each canton could determine in what circumstances it was a criminal offence. This has left the situation uncertain in Zurich, and Mr Landmann takes the view that if a prostitute practises her trade of her own free will, it cannot be a criminal offence. He and Mr Erwin Herren, the builder behind the project, plan to rent the rooms directly on a daily or weekly basis, precisely to prevent pimps from interposing themselves. Prices would be similar to those of a middle class hotel, they say. They have been careful enough to take a purchase option on a building where there is likely to be little disturbance to, or objections from, neighbours. It sits half under an elevated motorway on a busy trunk road and is surrounded by parking space. A waitress at the Restaurant Hocklerbrucke 200m away said yesterday that the news caused much ribald comment among regulars at first. 'But we do not think it will make much difference. We are full anyway.' The Zurich authorities concerned with these matters - the police, the justice department and the building and planning department - have all given a cautious welcome to the application. They see it as a way of getting the women off the city's otherwise pristine streets. In the past few years, pimping and streetwalking have reached distressing levels in Zurich, being an inevitable adjunct to the city's oversized hard drug community. Coincidentally, the brothel application comes just after the Swiss federal finance ministry has ruled that, for purposes of its new value added tax, prostitution will be classified as a service, not an element of medical care, and therefore will be taxable. There have been many jokes about how diligent Vatmen might enforce this decision, but they now know where to begin their patrols.</p>

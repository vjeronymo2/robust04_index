			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLOMBIAN DRUG LORD DENIES LINK TO MURDER OF CANDIDATE  </P> <P> Fugitive Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar on Friday denied the government's  contention that he was behind the assassination of leftist presidential  candidate Bernardo Jaramillo.  </P> <P> The president of the Patriotic Union, Diego Montana Cuellar, meanwhile, said in  a televised interview Friday on the news program Cinevision that his party is  withdrawing from the May 27 general elections.  </P> <P> The Patriotic Union, Conservative and Communist parties all asked the governing  Liberal Party of President Virgilio Barco Vargas to postpone the elections,  saying they fear for the safety of the candidates.  </P> <P> The government, fearing the start of a new offensive by drug traffickers,  strengthened security in the capital, Bogota, after street demonstrations  Thursday by protesters accusing the government of complicity in the murder.  Jaramillo, the candidate for the Patriotic Union Party, was gunned down at the  main Bogota airport Thursday morning.  </P> <P> A telephone caller who claimed the assassination for the Medellin cocaine  cartel said Cesar Gaviria, the Liberal Party presidential candidate, would be  the next victim.  </P> <P> Jaramillo's body was to lie in state in the National Capitol until it is flown  today to his hometown of Manizales, 120 miles west of Bogota, for services.  </P> <P> An official government communique released Thursday accused Escobar, reputed  head of the Medellin cocaine cartel, of hiring the teen-ager accused of  carrying out the assassination.  </P> <P> "Why would I attack someone who has always shown himself to be in favor of  dialogue with drug traffickers?" Escobar wrote in a letter to UP leader Montana  made public Friday.  </P> <P> The government said the gunman was paid about $650 or $750 in advance by the  Medellin cartel to kill Jaramillo, who was on his way to a Caribbean holiday  with his wife.  </P> <P> The 40-year-old Escobar, a high-living billionaire, is the cocaine trafficker  most wanted for extradition to the United States.  </P> <P> Jaramillo, 38, died in a Bogota hospital two hours after being shot four times  in the chest and stomach by the assassin firing a submachine gun, police said.  </P> <P> The government identified the gunman, seized at the airport, as Andres Arturo  Gutierrez of Bogota. He had not been charged.  </P></p>

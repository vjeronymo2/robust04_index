			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> FDA OKS CELL THERAPY FOR CANCER  </P> <P> The first cancer therapy using genetically altered living cells was approved  last week, and doctors at the National Institutes of Health said the first  patient should start treatment within a few weeks. Steven A. Rosenberg said his  team has been poised to start the revolutionary gene therapy in patients  critically ill with advanced melanoma, a deadly skin cancer, and was only  awaiting the final approval from the Food and Drug Administration.  </P> <P> The still-experimental therapy amplifies the body's own cancer-fighting  ability. It uses natural cancer-fighting cells, called tumor-infiltrating  lymphocytes, that have been removed from a patient's tumor and given extra  genes that should enhance their ability to attack the tumor. The technique has  been shown to be effective in laboratory animals.  </P> <P> Earlier this fall, other NIH researchers were granted permission to use gene  therapy to treat children with an inborn defect in their immune systems that  renders them highly susceptible to infections. Those studies are already under  way.  </P> <P> Rosenberg's team was given permission to treat up to 50 melanoma patients using  the new gene technique.  </P></p>

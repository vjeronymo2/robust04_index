			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOLUNTEERS TO BE TRAINED BEFORE HANDLING WILDLIFE  </P> <P> Officials are asking volunteers who want to help find and clean oil-injured  wildlife not to telephone with any inquiries.  </P> <P> Instead, volunteers are to go to an outdoor training facility set up on a  grassy area next to the beach at Pacific Coast Highway and Lake Street in  Huntington Beach before they may help in the cleanup effort.  </P> <P> The 20-minute training sessions are offered at 10 a.m. and noon each day. After  completing one of the sessions, volunteers are issued rubber gloves, boots and  an orange hat, then assigned to teams that rove the beach in search of injured  birds and animals.  </P> <P> Volunteers are being used only to find and clean wildlife, not to assist in the  oil cleanup.  </P></p>

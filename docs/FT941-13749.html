			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Return to profits predicted for steel Some of the biggest US steel companies are predicting a continuing sharp upturn in their operating performance this year, in the process pushing the industry as a whole back into profit after one of its most prolonged periods of losses. Results released by two of the six big integrated steel producers last week indicated that soaring demand from carmakers and the construction industry had already driven the steel companies' output and prices sharply higher. US Steel, the US's biggest producer, said sales in the final three months of last year were 28 per cent higher than a year before, at Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.01), helped by an 18 per cent rise in the amount of steel shipped and a series of price rises. 'The market outlook is solid, with order book levels high through the first quarter,' added Charles Corry, chairman of US Steel's parent company, USX. Robert Darnall, chairman of Inland Steel, which turned an operating loss of Dollars 173m in 1992 into a profit of Dollars 27m last year, was even more optimistic. 'We expect a continued improvement in our operating results of at least the same magnitude as we experienced in 1993,' he said. The heightened demand for steel has meant that producers have been operating at near-full capacity, supporting the price rises introduced last year. US Steel said it was operating at 98 per cent of capacity in the final months of 1993, compared with 84 per cent at the end of 1992. Inland Steel, held back by the shut-down of a blast furnace and coke plant, sagged to 74 per cent. The demand for their products in the US has already made the steel companies among the best-performing on Wall Street so far this year. US Steel on Friday reported net income for the last quarter of 1993 at Dollars 124m (Dollars 1.67 a share), compared with an after-tax loss of Dollars 225m (Dollars 3.80 a share) the year before. Inland Steel made a net loss of Dollars 20m (79 cents a share), compared with a net loss of Dollars 67m (Dollars 2.15 a share) the year before.</p>

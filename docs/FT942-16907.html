			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A recovery in stock index futures which began on Tuesday continued yesterday, although the lead futures contract closed off the day's peak after a poor opening in the US markets, writes Joel Kibazo. The Liffe June contract on the FT-SE 100 started at 3,140, up 13 from its previous close, and moved steadily forward over the next few hours. Buying was mixed, coming from both independent traders (locals) and the large institutions, and June climbed to its peak of 3,156 over lunchtime. Light profit-taking saw the contract surrender some of the earlier gain, but it was the decline on Wall Street that led to increased selling of June in the last hour of the session. June finished at 3,133, up 6 from Tuesday's closing level but at a 7-point discount to its fair value premium to cash which stands at around 6 points. Volume was 15,265 lots. The Liffe FT-SE Mid 250 contract ended at 3,777, up 17 from its previous close, on substantially improved turnover of 217 trades. However, business in the Liffe traded options was dull and volume fell to 29,165 contracts from Tuesday's 37,197. The total included 14,071 lots dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 4,090 done in the Euro FT-SE 100 option.</p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GREETINGS NEED SPECIAL HANDLING: COLOR, CLARITY AND NEATNESS COUNT  </P> <P> At the U.S. Postal Service's busiest time of the year, ironically, all those  bright red and green Christmas card envelopes slow the process.  </P> <P> The electronic eye in the stamp-canceling machine sometimes cannot distinguish  a stamp placed on a colored envelope, and banishes the letter to the "reject"  drawer to be hand-canceled. Such detours can slow delivery of the letter by a  day or more.  </P> <P> So if you are slow about getting your season's greetings in the mail, yet you  want them to arrive by Dec. 25, you might consider using white or beige  envelopes.  </P> <P> Other pointers that will help move your Christmas cards along:  </P> <P> * Address envelopes with dark ink that contrasts with the envelopes' color.  Green felt tip on green background not only will baffle electronic eyes, but  also will strain human eyes.  </P> <P> * Better yet, type the address on the envelope. The Postal Service's artificial  intelligence is not intelligent enough to read handwriting and will send such  letters to the more intelligent -- but less speedy -- human mail-handlers.  </P> <P> * Positioning the stamp neatly in the right-hand corner, rather than  willy-nilly wherever it happens to stick, will assure that the stamp-canceler  will spot it.  </P> <P> * Over-size, bulky envelopes must be handled by hand from the starting line, so  save your 20-page family update with photos for another letter.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The popular resistance in the al-Shu'ayb district  succeeded in resisting an aggressive assault mounted by the  enemy forces last night and today, and inflicted heavy losses on  them. This happened when the enemy forces sent a company  [sariyyah] from the Hamzah Brigade forward, with support from  all forms of heavy weapons, including Katyushas. They attempted  to occupy a number of villages in al-Shu'ayb. They carried out  random shelling against the villages and their peaceful  inhabitants, which led to the wounding of four citizens.    Popular resistance forces engaged the attackers, led by the  fighters of the liberation war, from last night until this  afternoon. The enemy suffered heavy losses, as 24 men were  killed or wounded. Our forces also destroyed three military  vehicles, along with their crews. An enemy reconnaissance  officer was captured. The rest of the enemy forces were  compelled to withdraw and flee in the direction of Qa'tabah.</p>

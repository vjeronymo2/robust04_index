			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Paints and the Environment (7): Emphasis on management - The seven ages of paint production / Fortunately for the coatings industry, management skills have been well applied in the past couple of decades Most of today's coatings technologies were conceived by the 1960s, before environmentalism was even a twinkle in Californian eyes. Plastics were being powdered and fused to metal. Laboratories were finding out the mechanisms by which some liquids could be solidified with ultraviolet light. Life in the coatings industry flowed on tranquilly, with all the excitement of watching paint dry. Then marketing burst in on the scene. By the mid-1960s, the DIY industry was blossoming, and one of the largest single drivers was the multi-million marketing spend of large paint companies - with Hadrian, Valspar and Magicote setting the pace for Dulux and Crown to match. Industrial paints remained aloof from these antics, considering a half-crown slipped into the lid of each tin for the paint shop foreman to be a more appropriate purchasing inducement. Indeed, so successful was this approach that some foremen were known to pour fresh paint down the drain to keep up the supply of half crowns] The industry's complacency was rudely shaken by the oil crisis in 1973. Solvents quadrupled in price. Paint companies scurried to reduce solvent usage. Around this time, industrial coatings users were trying to raise productivity in paint shops. Previously, the painting process had been the Cinderella department of many factories, but the combination of rising oil prices and rising paint shop productivity gave a real impetus to new industrial technologies. By contrast, decorative producers' concern about solvent costs was not enough to force radical technical change, but by the mid-1970s it was dawning on producers that California's quest for cleaner air was more than just an aberration among people who had spent too much time in the sun. Stricter environmental regulations were set to become a fact of life for the paintmaker. Gradually, coatings companies caught up with the spirit of the times, and this became the age of divorce. Twenty years previously, paints were more or less similar products across the decorative/industrial spectrum. But by the 1980s the strategic drivers of industrial and decorative paints businesses had become completely different. Decorative paints, both for trade and DIY use, became driven by the needs and demands of their distribution channels. With limited product differentiation, brands which had weathered 50 summers were easily peeled from the shelves of the DIY sheds if they failed to live up to their distributors' expectations. Industrial markets were differently driven. Users of coatings were globalising, and industrial coatings managers had to become international managers. Backing the winning hand of new technologies became critical for each market, so technical competence was crucial. Environmental issues became fundamental drivers of industrial coatings strategy, while remaining marginal issues for decorative businesses. As management processes and philosophy diverged, the divorce between industrial from decorative businesses was the only answer, even if both parties sometimes chose to continue living under the same corporate roof. Businesses with less than critical mass in both decorative and industrial areas got rid of the weaker partner, or they were acquired by a stronger company who did it for them. Environmental pressures were now affecting the shape of the industry. The number of companies supplying the retail market dropped as a result of the decorative shake-out, but the stronger industrial coatings companies still clung on to most of their historical markets. For example, since most industrial coatings companies supplied coatings for metal, and since powder coatings were taking a steadily increasing share of that sector, the companies which had supplied liquid coatings nearly all invested in powder. At one stage there were more than 18 UK companies making powder coatings, most with a far smaller share than the harsh economic realities of the business would allow. A third was all that was needed for both efficiency of scale and competition. This is the number of significant powder coatings producers the UK now has. As these rationalisations have peaked, the past few years have marked the age of portfolio restructuring. Decorative businesses have been regionalising whilst industrial businesses have sought to focus and globalise. With the exception of some speciality finishes, particularly wood finishes, truly international retail brands are still thin on the ground. 'Own-label' manufacturers such as Kalon are regionalising in Europe to exploit their transferable operational skills and build the economies of scale which are vital to them. Environmental pressures on decorative architectural coatings are growing but are still an insignificant driver of strategy compared with distribution channels or manufacturing economies of scale. The do-it-yourself paint consumer continues to buy on the basis of price, colour and finish from any brand, or own-label brand, perceived to have a good reputation. Environmental considerations are well down the list of purchasing determinants. Industrial users now, by contrast, are increasingly constrained by environmental regulations: coatings and coating procedures with lower environmental impact have become crucial in every sector. Since no industrial coatings company can now keep up the pace in all their historical markets whilst trying to globalise and master all the technologies required, portfolio changes have recently been as frequent as car boot sales. They have radically affected nearly all industrial coatings suppliers as they seek to build competitive positions. Today's important question is: 'What is the seventh age, and what will happen in the next decade?' Portfolio restructuring will continue, but at a slower pace in some sectors at least because the number of competitive coatings suppliers is approaching the minimum that the market will tolerate to retain competitive supplies. Aerospace manufacturers now really only have a choice of two coatings suppliers while automotive manufacturers have a choice of four or five. This will be the time to digest what companies may have rather hurriedly swallowed during the past few years. It will be the age of management. Fortunately, management is something the coatings industry has become rather good at over the past couple of decades. Coatings businesses which are subsidiaries of heavy chemical majors, rightly supply more than their fair share of managers, culture and ideas to their institutionalised parents. Managers with a coatings background, even those with quite a modest area of responsibility, have had to develop good strategic understanding, high customer care skills, long term customer-supplier relationships, high quality products efficiently produced - all the ingredients of successful modern business. Often they interface with state-of-the-art customers in their daily work and some of the best industrial strategy and practice rubs off in the process. Environmental pressures may have pointed the direction for the industry. That it has arrived safely is because its management has grown with the challenges and thrived on strong and fruitful links with its customers. This should be a formula for success, in any age. The writer, John Asher, has worked in the coatings industry for 26 years, with 15 years as a director of what was then Crown Paints and 11 years as managing director of Crown Industrial Products. He is now a consultant working in the chemical industry and author of the Financial Times Management Report, 'Industrial Coatings - A Time of Change?' published in 1993.

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Labour well ahead in polls: Local council results snuff out chance of general election in June HEAVY Conservative losses to both Labour and the Liberal Democrats in the local elections yesterday finally closed Mr John Major's option of a June general election. The results, however, were disappointing rather than devastating for the Conservatives and left wide open the eventual result of the parliamentary election which the prime minister must call by July 1992. The view among senior ministers is that an autumn election is still a distinct possibility, although Mr Major will want to keep open the possibility of next spring. With about half of the results announced by the early hours of this morning, Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaign manager, claimed a sweeping victory. He declared that his party was firmly on course to win the general election. As Labour registered particularly strong gains in many areas in the south, Mr Cunningham said: 'The Tories will not win an election now, but our country desperately needs one'. In some local authorities, such as Plymouth, Labour recorded swings against the Conservatives of more than 10 per cent. But there were wide variations from council to council and the average swing across the country appeared to be 5 or 6 per cent. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, was equally upbeat about his party's prospects as it gained scores of seats and captured several councils, confounding forecasts that it would suffer heavy losses. Against that, Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative Party chairman, voiced his confidence that a sharp fall in inflation and an upturn in economic growth over the next few months would restore his party's fortunes by the autumn. Labour's share of the national vote in the 12,000 seats outside Scotland and London contested yesterday appeared to stand two or three to the Conservatives. Both parties looked likely to emerge fairly close to their present opinion poll standings of just below 40 per cent. But a Labour analysis of the voting in 31 marginal seats put it 5 points ahead with 43 per cent against the Conservatives' 38 per cent. In spite of the prospect of losses running into several hundred council seats, Mr Patten said it was clear the government had recovered significantly from its low-point last year. He acknowledged implicitly, however, that a June general election was now an impossibility, commenting that his party was in the process of climbing a 'very big hill'. Mr Patten shares the view of his colleagues that the autumn is now the earliest possible general election date. Projections based on the declared results suggested that overall the Conservatives would lose about 400 council seats to both Labour and the Liberal Democrats. By the early hours of this morning, Labour had won control of a number of key councils including Cardiff, Nottingham, and Darlington. For their part, the Liberal Democrats' strong performance gave them control of Eastbourne, Lewes and Gosport in Hampshire. Overall the apparent 5 per cent swing in favour of Labour marked a dramatic reversal of the results in May 1987 when the same seats were last fought. It would not be enough, however, to give Mr Neil Kinnock outright victory at a general election. In 1987, the Conservatives won 40 per cent of the vote against the 31 per cent secured by Labour and the 27 per cent which went to the then Liberal/SDP Alliance. The outcome prompted Mrs Margaret Thatcher to call a general election the following month. Mr Patten will be spending this weekend with friends in Yorkshire rather than following the example of his predecessors in 1983 and 1987 by travelling to see the prime minister at his Chequers country residence. Mr Michael Heseltine, whose announcement late in the campaign of the Conservatives' plan to replace the poll tax with a property-based 'council tax' failed to restore his party's popularity, echoed Mr Patten in suggesting that the prime minister would wait until inflation had fallen decisively before seeking a fresh mandate. Among the Conservatives' council losses were Brentwood in Essex and Reigate and Banstead in Surrey. They also lost control of Derby.  ----------------------------------- FATE OF KEY COUNCILS  ----------------------------------- Lab           Con        Lib Dem gain          loss*      gain  ----------------------------------- Darlingtn     Derby      Eastbrne Nottnghm      Brentwd    Gosport Plymth        Reigate    Congltn Amber Vly     Solihll    NWilts Luton         Winchstr   Oadby Wirrl         St Albns   Torby Erewash       Cntrby     NDevn Blackpl       Strfrd     Lewes Kingswd       C gain     Wear V Lab loss      Bthfry Barrow        Farehm Chorly        Salsbry Basldn  ----------------------------------- *To no overall control  -----------------------------------  ----------------------------- Seats Gained &amp; Lost  ----------------------------- Party   Gains   Losses  ----------------------------- Con      65      246 Lab     205       92 LibD    170       61 Ind      28       53 Other    16       22  ----------------------------- With results declared by 188 authorities at 1.45am Total seats contested: 12,255 in 369 local authorities  ----------------------------- LOCAL ELECTIONS Results up to 3am and analysis Page 8 Parliament Page 12</p>

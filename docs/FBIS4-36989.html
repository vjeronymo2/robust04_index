			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nikhil Chakraborty] </F>   [Text] What are the problems being faced by Narasimha Rao  at home after his visit to the United States? This is the  question being raised today. The prime minister's visit to the  United States is a matter of honor to the ruling and the  opposition parties.    The opposition parties had raised questions in the  parliament  with the apprehensions that the Narasimha Rao government would  probably succumb to the American pressure on the stalemate on  signing Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, human rights, and the  Kashmir issue. Their voices in the parliament convinced the  prime minister that he should clearly apprise the Clinton  administration of the Indian stance on these issues and should  return home without succumbing to any pressure. Besides, being  a prime minister with a slight majority in the parliament,  Narasimha Rao was in a suicidal situation, if he would bow down  to any such pressures. It is a matter of gratification that  Narasimha Rao was firm on very important issues and clarified  India's points in his address at the American Congress.    Now nobody can find fault with the prime minister and say  that he failed in putting forward national issues. Another  significant feature is that the prime minister made his position  amply clear. Does this mean that the differences with the  United States have been completely overcome? No. We have  presented our contradicting views in a slightly different manner  at the talks held with the U.S. President. In other words, we  have made it clear that we will be by and large friendly even  though differences of opinion persist.    At the Indo-U.S. summit-level talks, differences existed,  especially on Pakistan and the nuclear weapons issue. President  Clinton's statement confirmed that he endorses Islamabad's views  and Benazir Bhutto's statements that Pakistan does not supply  arms to the extremists to help the secessionist forces in  Kashmir. At the same time, the United States did not accept  Pakistan's contention that India does not have any right in  Kashmir, as the extremists have an upper hand there. It has  supported the view that Pakistan and India should hold bilateral  talks under the Simla agreement. This indicates the United  States position that it wants to support neither Pakistan nor  India in this matter.    Besides saying that Kashmir does not belong to India, U.S.  Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphel also spoke about human  rights abuses in Kashmir. Islamabad has also been voicing the  same concern. However, now the issue of human rights abuses  rears its head in Washington infrequently. Washington does not  want to have too much discussion with India on the human rights  issue. Now, the United States has retraced its steps from  criticizing India on the human rights issue. This shift in  stance was noticed earlier at the UN Human Rights Commision  conference in Geneva. There, the U.S. representative did not  support Pakistan's resolution against India, and he kept quiet.  Thus, the United States' behavior of changing its stance  whimsically on the issue of human rights abuses is not a  surprising thing nor something new. Earlier, there was strong  criticism against the Chinese Government for cracking down on  innocent students at Tiananmen Square in 1989. However, when it  was the question of commercial cooperation, the United States  did not hesitate to grant Most Favored Nation status to China.    On the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] issue, the gap  between New Delhi and Washington has not been bridged. This  issue was not included at the Washington talks as India has been  saying that the NPT was discriminatory. It clearly shows that  both countries have different perceptions on this issue.  However, the United States wants to resolve the nuclear  nonproliferation issue through talks at the regional level.  This implies the United States' position that Pakistan and  India can hold talks on the issue. However, India is of the  view that this issue should be discussed nor resolved at global  level. In other words, India's stand is that nuclear  nonproliferation cannot be achieved by the reduction of nuclear  weapons by some countries through regional-level or bilateral  talks.    Therefore, although differences persist between them, the  United States and India have come to the conclusion that the  issue should be resolved through continuous bilateral talks.  Nuclear nonproliferation is the most significant element of the  Clinton administration's foreign policy. However, the behavior  and activities of the corporate bodies in the United States have  a say in the final decision of the Clinton administration.    That is why the United States had to play a dubious role and  devise its policies in China's matter. As far as India is  concerned, in the joint statement issued by President Clinton  and Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, both countries expressed their  willingness to strike a "new partnership". This term has not  been used with any member of the Atlantic family. [sentence as  published] It can be construed that the interest evinced by  American megacompanies to grab India's colossal markets and  encourage investment there is the cause for issuing this term.    Keeping this in mind, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao called on  the directors of megacompanies in New York, Houston, and  Washington during his visit. This approach has never been used  by any other prime minister of India. These meetings were  arranged as a prelude to the meetings in coming years, maybe  within a few months.    American companies are making efforts to grab the  opportunities available in India before the companies from the  European Community or Japan take the initiative and seize the  markets.    Following the mega American companies, nonresident Indians  are showing keen interest to invest in their motherland in this  regard.    After great calculations, Indian authorities speculate that  the nonresident Indians will also invest in a big way, if  American companies start investing in Indian markets. That is  why, in various states, local affinity is getting stronger. The  tendency to invest according to the origin of the investors such  as Bengalis, Gujarathis, Punjabis, and Maharashtrians, is  becoming conspicuous now.    With a view to bring American capital to the country, the  prime minister has extended an invitation to the nonresident  Indians to invest in India. This has been viewed as an act of  gambling. Any outside intervention is a matter of great anxiety  to the Indians. When the gigantic American companies like Ford,  General Motors, or Exxon establish their sway in India and if,  out of a sheer sense of patriotism, there is a call for  sponsoring only indigenous goods in the country, it cannot be  easily rejected. Because, when economic forces join political  forces to gain influence and if politicians back it, it will be  a challenge to the honor of the country. Under these  circumstances, corruption at higher levels will assume alarming  proportions and will bury the system of democracy itself.</p>

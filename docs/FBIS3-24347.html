Each of the Parties recognizes the right of its citizens  to acquire the citizenship of the other Party without losing  their first citizenship.    2. A citizen of one Party acquires citizenship of the other  Party on the basis of a free expression of the citizen's will  under conditions and by the procedure established by the laws of  the Party whose citizenship is being acquired.  <H5>  Article 2 </H5>   Citizens of one Party who, before this Agreement goes into  effect and at their own request, have received citizenship of  the other Party without losing their former citizenship, keep  citizenship in both Parties.  <H5>  Article 3 </H5>   1. Children whose parents at the moment of the child's birth  were both citizens of both Parties become citizens of both  Parties on birth. Before these children reach the age of 18  years their parents may choose for the children citizenship in  one of the Parties by renouncing citizenship of the other Party  by joint written declaration.    If one of the parents has died or been deprived of parental  rights before the child reaches the age of 18 years, the other  parent keeps the right to choose the citizenship of the child.    In both parents acquire the citizenship of both Parties or  if  their citizenship in both Parties terminates, the citizenship of  children who have not reached the age of 18 years changes  accordingly.    If the citizenship of both parents in one of the Parties  terminates and citizenship in the other Party is preserved (the  same for both parents), the citizenship of children under the  age of 18 years changes accordingly.    If one of the parents who is a citizen of both Parties  ceases  to be a citizen of one of the Parties, citizenship in the Party  for children under the age of 18 years is determined by written  agreement of the parents.    A change in the citizenship of children in the age bracket  from 14 to 18 years is done only with their written consent.    2. Upon reaching the age of 18 years a person who is a  citizen of both Parties may keep both citizenships or choose  citizenship in one of the Parties by renouncing the citizenship  of the other Party in a written declaration of renunciation of  citizenship offered during the first year after reaching the age  of 18 years.    3. The provisions of Points 1 and 2 of the present Article  also apply to children where at the moment of the child's birth  one parent was a citizen of both Parties and the other parent  was a person without citizenship or unknown, as well as to  adopted children who acquire citizenship in both Parties or lose  this citizenship from the moment of adoption.    4. The declaration of renunciation of citizenship in one of  the Parties according to Points 1 and 2 of the present Article  is given to an authorized organ of the Party whose citizenship  is being terminated. Depending on the place of the child's  permanent residence such authorized organs may be internal  affairs organs who deal with citizenship matters or a diplomatic  office or consular institution of the appropriate Party.  <H5>  Article 4 </H5>   Persons who are citizens of both Parties terminate  citizenship in one of the Parties according to the laws of the  Party whose citizenship is being terminated.    No professional or other activity by persons who hold  citizenship in both Parties can be grounds for terminating  citizenship in either of the Parties.  <H5>  Article 5 </H5>   A person who holds citizenship in both Parties exercises in  full the rights and liberties and bears in full the duties of a  citizen of the Party in whose territory he resides permanently.    Social support for persons holding citizenship in both  Parties is provided according to the laws of the Party in whose  territory they are permanent residents, if not otherwise  provided by appropriate agreements between the Parties.    Persons who hold citizenship in both Parties go through  compulsory military service in the Party in whose territory they  are residing permanently at the time of the call-up. Persons who  hold citizenship in both Parties and have gone through  compulsory military service in one of them are exempt from being  drafted for military service in the other.  <H5>  Article 6 </H5>   Persons who hold citizenship in both Parties have the right  to the protection and patronage of each of the Parties. The  protection and patronage of these persons in a third country is  provided by the Party in whose territory they are permanently  residing or, at their request, by the other Party whose  citizenship they also hold.  <H5>  Article 7 </H5>   Disputes between the Parties in connection with  interpretation and application of the present Agreement are  resolved through diplomatic channels.  <H5>  Article 8 </H5>    The present Agreement is subject to ratification, goes into  effect on the day that certifications of ratification are  exchanged, and operates for five years.

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Tietmeyer firm on re-entry to ERM BRITAIN and Italy should put their economies on a stable footing before being allowed back into the European exchange rate mechanism, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy president of the Bundesbank, has suggested. Speaking at a conference in London at the end of last week, Mr Tietmeyer also said he hoped the recent devaluation of the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo had 'cleared the air', and that no more ERM adjustments would be needed in the foreseeable future. In a broad swipe at European governments, Mr Tietmeyer said they should continue to put their faith in the Bundesbank's ability to act as the linchpin of the ERM. He also hinted that European monetary arrangements were more likely to evolve around the concept of a two-speed system, with specific countries excluded from an inner core of nations centred on Germany. Echoing the tone of Mr Tietmeyer's comments, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, also urged caution before Europe proceeded to a common economic and monetary policy. He told the conference that while many EC nations were 'tackling deep seated structural shortcomings', it would be unwise to fix exchange rates across the continent as part of economic and monetary union. Mr Tietmeyer, who is due to step up next summer to the top job at the German central bank, blamed the recent strains in the ERM on 'economic policy discrepancies' within Europe. While agreeing that high German interest rates related to German unification had been one factor, he said another reason for the summer's turbulence had been the divergence of the economies of the 'core group' of ERM nations from those of Britain, Portugual, Spain and Italy.</p>

			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (At A Glance): Pearl cuts savings bonuses Pearl Assurance has reduced its bonuses on with-profits savings contracts. The adjustments to the contracts are complex, and vary between the ordinary and industrial branches. The overall effect follows the trend for the industry, with pay-outs for 10-year policies hit hard, while 25-year policy maturity values have risen slightly. Using the standard assumption that policies were started by a 29-year-old man paying premiums of Pounds 30 per month, the ten-year has dropped by 6 per cent from Pounds 8,046 (which made it one of the market leaders) to Pounds 7,561. Pay-outs over 25 years increased by 0.3 per cent from Pounds 55,462 to Pounds 55,631.</p>

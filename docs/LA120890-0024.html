			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEARNING THE LESSONS OF IRAN-CONTRA CONSPIRACY  </P> <P> I can't share Rosenberg's high opinion of Moyers' documentary. While I admire  much about Moyers, he is not a man without political bias -- and a program of  this kind should have none.  </P> <P> Moyers might have mentioned the Soviet interference in the politics of Central  America that brought about the support for the Contras and, more important, he  might have touched upon the fact that President Reagan was not dealing directly  with terrorists. The hostages were not captured or held by Iranians.  </P> <P> That Iran had influence is something else. But it is these "something else"  factors in the complex Iran-Contra affair that makes it almost impossible to  get it clearly in focus -- and Moyers' interpretation was not quite acceptable.  </P> <P> TONY THOMAS  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

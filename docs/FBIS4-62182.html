			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Aleksandr Krylovich </F> and Vladimir Taranov]    [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- Russia warned North Korea on  Thursday that if the human rights of its lumberjacks in the  Russian Far East are not observed, it will not prolong a  corresponding agreement with Pyongyang.    Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mikhail Demurin told a  briefing that a Russian delegation is leaving soon for North  Korea to discuss a new agreement on timber processing in  Khabarovsk and Amur regions as the latest one expired in 1993.    "The Russian side believes that the most important article  of  the new document should become the provision, according to which  the rights of citizens of the People's Democratic Republic of  Korea working in Russia should correspond to Russian legislation  and international norms", he said.    Russian press reports said that the rights of North Korean  workers are being rudely violated by their authorities.    "If no agreement (on human rights) is reached Russia will  consider itself free from the rights and obligations fixed in  the earlier agreement", Demurin stressed.    He also informed that Russian-North Korean talks at the  level  of deputy foreign ministers began in Moscow on Thursday. "The  sides plan to consider the whole complex of bilateral relations  and international problems", according to Demurin.    He explained that this includes political and economic  relations, key aspects of the situation on the Korean Peninsula,  including the nuclear non-proliferation problems and the Russian  proposal to convene an international conference on security and  nuclear-free status of Korea.</p>

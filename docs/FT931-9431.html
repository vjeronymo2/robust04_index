			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: How CGT can trap home-owners - Many think their properties are exempt when selling, but that is not always so WHILE AN Englishman's home traditionally has been his castle, it might have felt more like a mausoleum in recent years. Some people, unable to sell, have therefore considered other ways of using their property. You can let all of it and move away, or stay at home and sub-let some. You might even work from home to save the cost of travelling and office space. Doing any of these things could, however, risk the property's exemption from capital gains tax. Many people assume their home is exempt from the threat of CGT when they sell it, but this is not always the case. Its liability for tax could depend on the amount of time you have spent there and what it was being used for. Relief is available in proportion to how long you have used the property as your main or only residence. But certain periods of absence  - called 'permitted absences' - are treated as if you were still living there. For the most part, the way you used your residence during the last 36 months of your ownership is ignored by the Inland Revenue. This does not mean that you can buy a property, leave it empty for three years, sell it and still get 100 per cent CGT relief. You must have lived there as your main or only residence at some time if the last 36 months are to be ignored. But the exact amount of time is debatable. Assuming the Revenue accepts that you lived there long enough to qualify for the relief, you can then elect for another property to be treated as your main residence, or even sub-let it during those last 36 months. The relief will still be available in full. But if you have been using part of your house exclusively for business purposes, full relief might not be available although roll-over relief might be. In addition to the last 36 months, there are three types of 'permitted absence' which the Revenue will treat as periods in which you were living in the property - provided that, both before and after your absence, you lived there as your main or only residence: Any period or periods not exceeding three years. Any period, no matter how long, while you are employed abroad. Any period or periods not exceeding four years when you are absent due to your employment. The Revenue can ignore the rule that you must have used the property as your residence after a period of absence, but only if you were unable to take up residence again due to employment. You cannot, during your permitted absence, have another house on which you hope to claim relief as your main and only residence. These periods of absence are cumulative. Say Harold leaves 5 Acacia Avenue, in which he has lived as his main residence, to go to Spain for five years. He then returns to the UK to live for two years in rented accommodation, followed by one year in Acacia Avenue as his main residence and two years in another property before selling Acacia Avenue. Any gain made on the sale would be tax-free. But if Harold had not returned to Acacia Avenue, or had not used it as his main residence, he would have lost the full relief. You should also be careful that the property is your 'residence.' If you have a flat in London and a house in the country, but the flat is used by your daughter and your visits there are infrequent, the Revenue might argue that the flat is not, in fact, your residence even though you own it and can stay in it when you want. (In this case, you could consider transferring the flat into the name of your daughter, or into a trust for her, so that the relief can be preserved). Even if the flat is treated by the Revenue as your 'residence,' it might not be regarded as your main residence unless you have elected for it to be treated as such, in writing. (Husbands and wives are treated as one so that, if you own one property and your wife owns the other, only one can be your main residence). You can back-date the election for up to two years. In the Revenue's eyes, this means you must elect within two years of first acquiring two residences  -otherwise, the right to do so is lost. In that case, the Revenue can decide which is your main residence, which might not produce the least tax payable. Remember that an election could still be necessary if you live in two properties but own only one. You must also be careful that the whole of your property is treated as your main residence. If you use the basement exclusively as your office, it cannot be said that all the property is being used as your main residence; thus, the relief will be apportioned according to the amount of space actually used for residential purposes. When you sub-let part of your house, it is no longer used as your residence, so the main and only residence exemption will not be available. If the basement was sub-let to a tenant for accommodation, there would be another relief available (so long as you had not let more than half your residence) and depending on the amount of gain made when the property is sold. The Revenue is also quite lenient if your house is used by lodgers or if areas are occupied by your staff, such as housekeeper or nanny. But you must be careful whose staff they are. If the chauffeur is actually employed by your company, he will not be your staff. And you should also consider if all or part of the garden or grounds will qualify as your residence. The Revenue always allows one hectare, or such larger area of garden and grounds as is needed for 'reasonable enjoyment' of the property. This could include woods, a paddock, a tennis court and a swimming pool. The rules relating to your main or only residence are detailed and fiddly but, with CGT at a maximum rate of 40 per cent, it is certainly worth trying to get it right.

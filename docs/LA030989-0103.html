			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW ISRAELI STUDY URGES NEGOTIATIONS WITH PLO  </P> <P> Warning that attempts to maintain the status quo in the occupied territories  could lead to war, a prestigious Israeli think tank called Wednesday on the  government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to negotiate with the PLO and to  leave open the option of an eventual Palestinian state in the West Bank and  Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> Outlining what it said was a "realistic path" to peace in the Middle East, the  Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University endorsed the idea of  eventual Palestinian sovereignty but said it should be preceded by a  10-to-15-year period of "confidence building" during which the Palestinians  would exercise self-rule in the occupied territories.  </P> <P> The proposal, less notable for its originality than for its attempt to graft  Arab demands and Israeli concerns into a workable compromise for peace in the  Middle East, was contained in an annex to an exhaustive, six-month study of  Israel's options in dealing with the intifada, the 15-month-old Palestinian  uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Upcoming Shamir Visit  </P> <P> Its release, timed to precede Shamir's visit to Washington next month, also  coincided with the 15-month anniversary of the intifada, which was marked by  the start Wednesday of a two-day general strike in the West Bank and the Gaza  Strip. Only sporadic violence was reported after a day of widespread violence  Tuesday in which one Palestinian was killed and more than 30 were wounded by  Israeli troops.  </P> <P> "The uprising impelled us to prepare this report and we felt it imperative to  complete it before the Israeli government and the new U.S. Administration  announced their plans for the area," said Joseph Alpher, deputy director of the  Jaffee Center.  </P> <P> "This is not a peace plan but a 10-to-15-year process for progress to peace  which should be acceptable to 60 to 70% of Israelis . . . and probably lead to  Palestinian state sovereignty," he added.  </P> <P> The process envisioned by the Jaffee Center academics, who include a number of  former officials from both the Israeli government and military establishment,  entails substantial concessions from both sides.  </P> <P> Israel, the report said, must halt the building of new Jewish settlements in  the occupied territories, reconcile itself to the emergence of "some form of a  Palestinian state" at the end of the process and accept the fact that "no  settlement of the conflict is possible without direct negotiations with  authoritative representatives of the Palestinians." In both the current and  foreseeable future, "only the PLO or, at the very least, Palestinians  identified with the PLO, meet this criterion," it added.  </P> <P> For their part, Palestinians living in exile must renounce their "right of  return," giving up all claims to the homes they left behind Israel's pre-1967  war borders, and agree to enter into a negotiating process that is "open-ended"  -- that is, a process whose outcome is not subject to preconditions by either  side.  </P> <P> They must also accept a transitional period of autonomy that is at least twice  as long as the five-year period envisioned in the decade-old Camp David  accords, which the Arab world unanimously rejects.  </P> <P> However, Jaffee Center director Aharon Yariv, a retired major general and  former head of army intelligence, said the Palestinians must accept the fact  that Israelis will require a long period of "confidence building" before they  will accept the establishment of a Palestinian state.  </P> <P> "Most Israelis would not now accept the possible end-product of the scenario (a  Palestinian state). But if Palestinians are not prepared to accept a  10-to-15-year transition period, there won't be any scenario at all," he said.  </P> <P> Israel, for its part, "can set conditions on its agreement, but it is going to  have to talk to the PLO to solve the problem under the present circumstances,"  added Alpher, who headed the 20-member team of Israeli and American academics  that produced the study.  </P> <P> The report focused on the implications of various scenarios for Israel and  skirted such questions as the role of an international peace conference favored  as a negotiating format by the Arab states or the part that the Soviet Union  should play in the peace process.  </P> <P> However, it indicated that the United States would have to play a central role,  both in mediating the negotiations and in supporting whatever security  arrangements Israel required. Substantial Western financial help would also be  needed, both to offset the economic impact that giving up the territories would  have in Israel and to help ensure that the fledging Palestinian state could  survive, it said.  </P> <P> The Israeli government had no immediate reaction, but several analysts said  beforehand that they did not expect the report to be well-received by Shamir,  who steadfastly refuses to negotiate with the PLO or to consider the creation  of a Palestinian state.  </P> <P> Shamir, who has made it clear he will not go much beyond the old Camp David  autonomy formula, is said to be putting together his own ideas for the peace  process in a bid to recapture some of the diplomatic momentum seized by the PLO  late last year when its chairman, Yasser Arafat, publicly renounced terrorism  and accepted Israel's right to exist. The prime minister's aides have said that  he will unveil them in Washington next month.  </P> <P> However, the limits that Shamir has placed on a settlement were strongly  criticized by the Jaffee Center study as designed only to perpetuate a  dangerous status quo that in the long run will undermine both "the foundations  of Israel's society and its deterrence (capability) . . . thus raising the  specter of war."  </P> <P> The report considered and rejected in turn six possible options for dealing  with the intifada, ranging from autonomy to annexation and forced deportation  of the 1.7 million Palestinians living in the territories -- an extreme option  that it said would jeopardize Israel's peace treaty with Egypt, tear apart  Israeli society from within and make another Arab-Israeli war "inevitable."  </P> <P> Conceding that its recommendations entailed "a mix of risks and opportunities,"  the report said that, while other options might have been preferable for  Israel, "they are not feasible" any longer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PEACE FOR ISRAEL: A NEW PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies evaluated the six  most commonly discussed options for a political settlement in the  Israeli-occupied territories and rejected each. In their place, the center  proposed a fresh approach to peace, starting with the principle that each side  "must act to accommodate the other's basic needs." Among other things, the  study said, the Israelis must accept:  </P> <P> That remaining in the territories indefinitely will exact a heavy price and  constitute a strategic disadvantage.  </P> <P> That security can be maintained without physical control over all the  territories.  </P> <P> That given Israeli security measures, an eventual Palestinian state need not  constitute a threat, either strategic or terrorist.  </P> <P> That no settlement is possible without direct talks with the Palestine  Liberation Organization.  </P> <P> In turn, the study said, the Palestinians must accept:  </P> <P> Recognition of a Jewish state plus renunciation of the Palestinians' "right of  return."  </P> <P> An open-ended peace process in which Israel offers no commitment as to the  ultimate settlement.  </P> <P> A transition stage of at least 10 years in which there is no Palestinian state  and Israeli security measures are tested.  </P> <P> That a final settlement will involve territorial concessions by Israel in the  West Bank and Gaza Strip and permanent security arrangements.  </P></p>

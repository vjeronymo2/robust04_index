			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Japan farm plan paves way for trade deal Ratification of new world trade rules moved a step closer at the weekend when Japan announced plans to spend Y6,010bn (Pounds 37.79bn) to help its protected farmers adjust to foreign competition. The decision is a victory for politicians from rural constituencies, who had threatened to block the parliamentary vote on the Uruguay Round accord unless the government included substantial cash aid in the farm programme. Now the way is open for Japan's divided parliament to ratify the Uruguay Round accord, under which a ban on rice imports would be gradually phased out from next year and replaced with tariffs. Japan's main trading partners, the EU and US, are unlikely to ratify the trade treaty until the end of next month. Until recently the three ruling coalition parties - the Liberal Democratic party, the Social Democratic party and the New Harbinger party - had officially opposed opening the rice market because of sensitivity towards powerful rural voters, who stand to lose business to cheap foreign rice. The weekend agreement to compensate rural communities means the parties will change policy, so the government can present to parliament the five bills needed to ratify the Gatt accord. The coalition overruled finance ministry reluctance and decided to allocate the cash, which is to be spent over the next six years. Of the total, Y3,550bn is for public works including roads and draining paddy fields; Y770m is for cheap state loans; and Y890m is to encourage small rice farms to merge into larger, more efficient units. Half the total will be shouldered by the central government, the rest by municipal authorities. In addition, the government has earmarked Y1,200bn to help rural regions develop new businesses, making a grand total of Y7,210bn. The weekend decision follows weeks of wrangling between the agricultural ministry and the ministry of finance, which had wanted to limit the package to Y2,700bn - less than half its final size - and opposed debt relief. While the package appears generous to Japan's farmers, it means they have surrendered serious political support for their campaign to halt the liberalisation of rice imports, a landmark in the deregulation of the Japanese economy. The former government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa agreed to partial liberalisation of the rice market last December, but delays seemed likely when the present coalition took power in June. The farmers' political clout is set to diminish further with the arrival of a new electoral system - likely to take effect in January - in which urban voters will be given more weight.</p>

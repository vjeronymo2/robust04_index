			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Base metals prices rally - Market Report Base metals prices were back on their upward track by the end of London Metal Exchange afternoon trading. A strong NICKEL market in the after hours 'kerb' session ushered in impressive rises in the COPPER and ALUMINIUM contracts in the final minutes, traders said. 'It was all largely technical,' one said. 'A lot of the longs were shaken out earlier. Once there was no further selling, speculators were happy to take it on again.' Nickel's strength followed a successful attempt to hold above Dollars 7,000 a tonne for three months delivery. Covering and stop-loss orders carried it to Dollars 7,125.

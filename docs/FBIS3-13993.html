			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Not Wanted in Kashmir"] </F>   [Text] The offer of the Islamic Conference Organisation  [ICO] to mediate in the Kashmir dispute is a cruel diplomatic  joke which has been rightly spurned by New Delhi with the  contempt it deserves. No other foreign body has given such solid  and consistent support to Pakistan in setting the Kashmir valley  virtually ablaze in the last four years as the lCO. What has  suddenly made its Saudi-funded secretariat change its tune and  posit itself as a peace-maker? The ICO Secretary-General, Dr Al  Gabid, has a long record of indulging in anti-Indian propaganda  at Pakistan's behest. It is he more than anyone else who has  helped Pakistan manipulate the ICO to get anti-Indian  resolutions passed at its meetings. He is again being true to  his commitment to the cause of Pakistan in accusing India of  grave human rights violations in Kashmir on the eve of the UN  Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva. Yet, the ICO has the  temerity to offer mediation. This is akin to Pakistan's own  terrorist trainers posing as a detached party solely concerned  with bringing peace and harmony to Kashmir.    It is possible that a few balanced members of the ICO are  secretly not quite happy with the way Pakistan has misused the  organisation for its own anti-Indian designs. Indeed some of  them have individually sought to allay New Delhi's suspicions  about their bonafides by claiming to have worked behind the  scenes to moderate the anti-Indian resolutions introduced by  Pakistan in the past. But even if this were true, the more  important issue is that the ICO just has no locus standi in the  Kashmir dispute. Its concern for alleged human rights violations  is only a pretence. Apart from the fact that this is simply a  ruse to play the Pakistani game, would it not be more relevant  for ICO to confine its attention to large-scale human rights  violations in the very Islamic countries it represents? After  all, even Pakistan has been indicted by both its own human  rights activists and foreign organisations.    The ICO's avowed interest in protecting human rights may  have  been a little more credible if it had routinely raised its voice  against shocking cases of barbarism in the Islamic world. These  include the use of poison gas against the Kurdish rebels in  Iraq, air-raids on the Kurdish minorities in both Iraq, and Iran  and the unending agony of the Shia minority in the marshes of  southern Iraq. At present, Afghanistan is easily the worst case  of an entire country having become a virtual hell for its  population. The ICO has done precious little to rectify matters.  Has it bothered at least to mount a humanitarian effort on the  requisite scale to send succour to the Afghans? Dr Al Gabid and  his friends in the ICO secretariat are apparently far too busy  in political intrigues in Geneva on behalf of Pakistan to devote  time and energy to all trivial pursuits.  *</p>

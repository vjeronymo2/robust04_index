			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee consolidates gains as metals and oil slide Robusta coffee futures prices rose again in London yesterday after Monday's 40 per cent leap on news of severe frost damage to next year's Brazilian crop. Despite fears of a further frost next weekend, the lack of firm details of the damage kept the rise to 5.5 per cent and the September contract failed to regain Monday's intra-day high of Dollars 3,150 a tonne. It closed Dollars 157 higher at Dollars 3,005. New York remained at boiling point, however. In afternoon trading, the second position arabica contract was at Monday's high of 170 cents a pound, up 8.40 cents. 'It's going to take quite a while for people to find out the extent of the damage,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at London brokers GNI. 'One Brazilian source told me it was nigh on impossible to hire a private plane because everyone is out flying over the coffee-growing areas.' Early estimates of the damage suggest anything between 1m and 9m bags of Brazilian output next year could be lost. But figures vary according to whether the comparison is with this year's estimated crop of 24m bags, or the output of up to 30m bags which had been predicted for next year. Brazil, Colombia and Central America have temporarily suspended export registrations and Brazil may hold a meeting with other producers in the region next week to discuss coffee supply. On the London Metal Exchange meanwhile, base metals prices dropped sharply before some late bargain-hunting eased the downward pressure late in the day. Even so, nickel for delivery in three months fell 3.5 per cent on the day to Dollars 6,045 a tonne; zinc 2.8 per cent to Dollars 945.50; copper 2 per cent to Dollars 2,380.50; and aluminium 1.35 per cent to Dollars 1,457.50. Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the downward moves were sparked off by profit-taking by US funds and some traders. 'They have built up some big profits in the commodities markets in the past few weeks,' he pointed out. 'This is not the end of the metals' bull run', he insisted. The nickel market was affected by a surprise statement from Mr Sergei Korneyev, sales manager of Norilsk Nickel in Russia, the biggest producer. He told a Metal Bulletin conference in Moscow that output was holding up reasonably well and exports could rise by 13 per cent in 1994 compared with last year's 83,000 tonnes. Crude oil prices weakened amid expectations that the weekly report from the American Petroleum Institute would show a marked increase in US stocks. The price of the benchmark Brent Blend slipped below Dollars 17 a barrel in late London trading. Supply bottlenecks in the US at a time of particularly high oil have underpinned a rise in US crude prices in recent weeks; and that has influenced the London markets. But traders said the API report was likely to show that European and west African producers had reacted to the wide spread between the price of West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, and Brent by sending a large number of cargoes to the US.  ---------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------------------- Aluminium           -6,375  to  2,628,375 Aluminium alloy       -360  to  29,920 Copper              -1,250  to  355,650 Lead                  -650  to  359,700 Nickel                +426  to  132,498 Zinc                  -275  to  1,196,850 Tin                    +80  to  30,885  ----------------------------------------------</p>

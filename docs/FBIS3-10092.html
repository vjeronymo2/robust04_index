He went on to say that this product is not included in  the trade embargo imposed by the UN and the Organization of  American States on the Haitian military regime which overthrew  Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 1991. Every month, the  Dominican Republic sends (?650,000) pounds of beef, pork,  chicken, rice, and other food products to Haiti, as well as  gasoline, a fuel (?denied) by the embargo. Herrera stated that  it was in the best interest of the Dominican Republic to  attenuate [atenuar] the embargo because the worsening situation  in Haiti is one of the factors that causes Haitians to seek  refuge in the Dominican Republic. He warned of a possible social  eruption [estallido].</p>

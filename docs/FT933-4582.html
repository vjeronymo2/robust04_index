			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Phoenix Timber progress halted LOSSES before tax at Phoenix Timber Group were little changed at Pounds 1.94m for the year to March 31, against Pounds 1.96m. However, the directors said the improved trend noted in the opening half had not been maintained and, in fact, 'was reversed in the second half'. They added that the withdrawal from the ERM created 'renewed uncertainty'. It was pointed out that the deepening recession in the building industry had led to increasing pressure on margins and a worsening in the level of bad debts. Substantial costs were incurred in the transfer and start-up costs of production of Redmon Modular Systems. Furthermore, a review of accounting procedures at Durabella had disclosed bad debts that, in part, had arisen in earlier periods. The group is withdrawing from the window making and timber engineering businesses and extraordinary costs relating to this decision amounted to Pounds 900,000. There was a further charge of Pounds 600,000 in respect of timber importing businesses previously closed. The combined effect of trading losses, extraordinary charges and a property revaluation reduced shareholders' funds to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 9m). The continued level of borrowings compared with the fall in shareholders' funds has left the group in breach of its borrowing powers. A resolution at a forthcoming EGM will propose to ratify and approve this breach and establish a new borrowing limit. The level of borrowings also puts the group in breach of certain banking covenants. However, as announced in August, arrangements have been made for the provision of new capital. Turnover for the year slipped to Pounds 21.57m (Pounds 23.12m). Losses per share emerged at 13.5p (13.6p).</p>

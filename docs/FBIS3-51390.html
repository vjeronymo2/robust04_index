			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Patricia Spadaro G.] </F>   [Text] During the past four months relations between  Colombia and Venezuela have been marked by developments and  statements which, taken one by one, have led the respective  governments to set out their official positions, with the tone  of the language rising at times. During this period bilateral  relations have reflected a novel feature. What was previously  resolved directly is now handled through the formality of  diplomatic notes, which takes flexibility out of relations and  creates an atmosphere of tension, even when government officials  have stated that relations are good.     -  9 June: Andres Pastrana, a candidate for president of  Colombia, proposed that his country and Venezuela approve an  "agreed pause" in polemics until after the elections in both  countries, later resuming negotiations on the border dispute in  the Gulf of Venezuela.    -  8 July: Ramon Escovar Salom, the attorney  general of Venezuela, asked for the cancellation of Decree 1911,  signed by [former] President Carlos Andres Perez, which  authorizes the registration of the birth of children of  undocumented persons in Venezuela.    -  30 August: Foreign Minister  Fernando Ochoa Antich began an official visit to Bogota, during  which he stated that "the demarcation of maritime and underwater  areas touches the most sensitive fibers of Venezuelan  nationalist feeling. If the Colombian people do not understand  that, the process of integration between the two countries will  be harmed."    Asked about the complaint made by a Colombian Catholic  organization, according to which Venezuela is violating the  human rights of undocumented residents of Venezuela, Ochoa  pointed out that "illegal immigrants are those who violate  Venezuelan laws."%1 September: At a joint press conference held  at the end of Venezuelan Foreign Minister Ochoa's visit to  Bogota, the Colombian and Venezuelan ministers of foreign  affairs maintained their "contrasting points of view" regarding  their differing views on the boundaries in the Gulf of  Venezuela.%1 September: Colombia deported 10 Venezuelan citizens  who were living illegally in Colombia. According to the DAS  [Colombian Administrative Department of Security], the  Venezuelans were involved in promoting and selling American  [sic; as printed] products in Colombia.%15 September: The  Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a diplomatic note to  Caracas in which it repeated the Colombian position on the  demarcation of maritime and underwater boundaries in the Gulf of  Venezuela, in reply to statements made by Venezuelan Foreign  Minister Ochoa at the joint press conference held in Bogota on 1  September. The text of the note leaked out in Caracas on 17  December, three months after it was sent.    On 15 September Colombia sent another note of protest,  complaining about the violation of the human rights of Colombian  citizens resident in Venezuela by the National Guard.%8 October:  Alberto Casas Santamaria presented his credentials at Miraflores  Palace as the new ambassador of Colombia in Caracas.%15  November: Venezuela sent two notes of protest to Colombia. One  of the notes rejected Colombian accusations about violations of  human rights in Venezuela, and the other note referred to the  holding of the "Primer Encuentro de Colombianos en Venezuela"  [First Meeting of Colombians in Venezuela], which took place in  Caracas between 9 and 12 October and at which the Venezuelan  authorities were accused of violating human rights. These  conclusions were presented for the consideration of the  Venezuelan Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The contents of the  document caused annoyance to the Venezuelan authorities. In his  note Venezuelan Foreign Minister Ochoa termed the conclusions of  the above-mentioned meeting unacceptable and criticized the fact  that such a meeting was used "to perform political acts, in  violation of the express provisions of existing legislation  regarding foreign nationals."%20 November: Antonio Navarro  Wolff, the Colombian presidential candidate of the "Alianza  Democratica M-19" [Democratic Alliance/19 April Movement],  stated that the Venezuelan National Guard was taking bribes from  undocumented Colombians to nationalize them as Venezuelan  citizens.%20 November: General Pedro Romero Farias, the  commander of the Venezuelan National Guard, called Navarro Wolff  a criminal and warned that if he entered Venezuela, he would be  arrested and tried.%20 November: Venezuelan Foreign Minister  Ochoa stated in reply to Navarro Wolff, "These are surprising  and aggressive statements which I cannot understand and which  Venezuela cannot accept."%20 November: Radames Munoz Leon,  Venezuelan defense minister, ordered an investigation by  military courts of the accusations made by Navarro Wolff.%21  November: Colombian Foreign Minister Sanin asked for "good sense  on both sides" to avoid damaging bilateral relations following  the statements made by Navarro Wolff.%24 November: Navarro Wolff  announced that he would sue the commander of the Venezuelan  National Guard "for slander and injury" to his personal  reputation.%24 November: Colombian Foreign Minister Sanin sent a  communication to Venezuelan Foreign Minister Ochoa in which she  denied that her country once considered it "inappropriate" to  sign an agreement with Venezuela for the exchange of prisoners,  as stated by Venezuelan Minister of Justice Fermin Marmol Leon  on 23 November.%27 November: The government of Venezuelan  President Ramon J. Velasquez revoked Decree 1911.</p>

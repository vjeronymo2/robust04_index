			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GIANTS COACH PARCELLS OUT OF HOSPITAL  </P> <P> New York Giants Coach Bill Parcells was released from a hospital this morning  after undergoing treatment to relieve the pain of kidney stones.  </P> <P> The 49-year-old coach was hospitalized Saturday night.  </P> <P> He was able to attend the Giants' 23-15 victory over the Minnesota Vikings only  after being given a pass by physicians.  </P> <P> "He was yelling just like always," Giants offensive coordinator Ron Erhardt  said after spending Sunday afternoon talking to Parcells over the headphones.  "He didn't let up."  </P> <P> Parcells returned to Morristown Memorial Hospital shortly after the game,  nursing supervisor Betty Mills said late Sunday night.  </P> <P> "I met him downstairs and walked him to his room," Mills said. "He's in some  pain."  </P> <P> Parcells later underwent a cystoscope, a procedure designed to temporarily  relieve the pain until an attempt is made to pulverize the stone through  ultrasound. Parcells was released from the hospital this morning and will  undergo the second procedure Tuesday at another facility.  </P> <P> Giants public relations spokesman Ed Croke said doctors found a single stone,  and if the procedure on Tuesday is successful, Parcells could return to work on  Wednesday, when the Giants have their first workout of the week.  </P> <P> "I can't say much about it," Giants quarterback Phil Simms said. "He was in a  lot of pain. He still yelled a lot today so maybe it didn't affect him that  much."  </P></p>

The UNHCR said earlier it expected the trucks to be  driven back to Banja Luka, northern Bosnia, by Bosnian Serb  soldiers.    On Wednesday [23 March], around 100 Serb soldiers stole the  trucks as they approached Maglaj carrying 94 tonnes of  foodstuffs and medicines destined for the town's beleagured  population. A 10th truck, stolen with the others, was found  shortly afterwards and returned to UNHCR control. The trucks had  been hijacked in the town of Teslic, next to Maglaj, and their  10 Danish drivers terrorized before they were released. UN  officials said at one point the Danish drivers had been lined up  against a wall for what they feared was execution. The drivers  were taken by truck to a Serb-Croat front line, from where they  had to walk to a Bosnian Croat army post whose soldiers  transferred them to a British UN base.    Aid convoys started reaching Maglaj last Sunday [20 March]  after a five-month seige by Bosnian Serb forces. In October two  Danish drivers of a UNHCR convoy were shot and killed as they  entered Maglaj. UN Special Representative to the Former  Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi protested to the authorities in Pale,  the Bosnian Serb stronghold, after the convoy was taken. Radovan  Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said the colonel in charge of  the soldiers had been stripped of his command, adding that an  inquiry had been launched.</p>

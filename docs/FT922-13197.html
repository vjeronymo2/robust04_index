			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Technical analysis passes the bard test POSSIBLY the worst forecast I ever made was that Japanese equities might fall as much as 60 per cent from their peak. Not so bad, you may think? Only if you ignore the timing. This was in a speech to the American business economists in September 1987. How is it possible to get the timing so wrong, yet the scale so nearly right? Amateur chartism, that's how. Once the current euphoria is over, the great market debate of 1992 will resume: is this a stale bull market, or is it just tensing its muscles for a new rush? This column is about the kind of logic which is appropriate in forming your own view. Should it be based on the economic future - the fundamentals  - or simply on a study of market behaviour, like my bad guess in 1987? And if behaviour is the best guide, should we try to understand markets, or simply to forecast them? Technical analysis, to give chartists the term they prefer, is a bit like medieval science. It describes things in great detail, but does not attempt to to explain them. Market theoreticians find this impossibly unsatisfactory, because it gives them no evidence to support their doctrines. Despite this hostile silence, the practitioners soldier on, because their methods often work rather well. Shakespeare knew why. 'There are more things in Heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.' Forecasting can often be done with a ruler, and it is essential to theorise if we are ever to understand things. But there are times when the trends, both in the markets and in the real world, develop a kink. Bring on the antagonists. In the bear corner, the Norwich Union, which has become identified with the view that since real interest rates are so high, current equity yields look unattractive compared with bonds. In the bull corner Goldman Sachs, which has just published a short paper by Sushil Wadhwani, a financial economist at the London School of Economics, rubbishing this view. The trouble with the Norwich Union analysis is that there is a great hole in it. It does not suggest why real interest rates are so high and therefore does say not whether they are likely to stay high, or revert to a long run norm. The first question is possibly unanswerable - there seems to be no accepted explanation for the present peak; but the second is absolutely crucial. If real rates are being forced up by a shortage of capital, then the return on capital ought to rise. Further, as Wadhwani points out, if the market expects equity returns to rise, it will value bonds less highly. Round One to Goldman. But if real rates simply reflect a sluggish response by the central banks and the markets to falling inflation, then they will come down, to the profit of bondholders; and if a world recession is already brewing, they may have to come down a long way - a muted replay of Tokyo. Possible KO to East Anglia. Turn to the Goldman case. It tries to apply to markets the same methods of statistical fit that produced all the dud economic forecasts last year. This implies a much bigger black hole than the Norwich analysis, for it leaves out market cycles. Wadhwani tries to measure the 'revealed preferences' of investors, without mentioning that these preferences change rather drastically at times. His methods, which rely on logical stability over time, rule out the crowd psychology aspect - another thing that Shakespeare understood. Norwich is Hamlet without the quotes; but Goldman leaves out the Prince. Technical KO.</p>

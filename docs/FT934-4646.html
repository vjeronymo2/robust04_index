			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (4): Private banking provides fuel - Finance: Managing the private fortunes of the rich is the sector's speciality Zurich is synonymous with finance in most people's minds, yet an uninformed visitor would be surprised to hear that this is Europe's second most important financial centre after London. The city is not dominated by grand banking halls, either new or old, and the average banker walking along the Bahnhofstrasse is more likely to be wearing flannels and a sports jacket than the sober dark suit that prevails in the City of London. As for pinstripes and bowler hats, a gnome who was so attired would be laughed out of Paradeplatz. Secondly, for the non-German-speaking visitor, the names on the big Swiss banks that have their headquarters in Zurich bear no relation to their international brand names, and are somewhat intimidating as well. The well-known Credit Suisse, for example, becomes transformed into Schweizerische Kreditanstalt, or SKA, as it is known locally. Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation have confusingly exchanged names, UBS becoming Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft while SBC, which is in fact based in Basle, calls itself Schweizerischer Bankverein. Most financial centres are known for being compact, enabling participants to walk to all their deal-making meetings. Zurich's is especially so, with virtually every institution enclosed in the triangle formed by the rivers Limmat and Sihl and the Lake of Zurich. For most visitors, nothing more exotic than a currency conversion will be required, and most downtown bank branches are ever ready to do this - usually in a number of languages - with a minimum of fuss. The main attractions of Zurich's financial centre are its private banking services. The city is host to dozens of banks that specialise in managing the private fortunes of the rich. Private banking has been a speciality of the Swiss for nearly a century, the country having initially been a safe haven from the wars and bouts of wild inflation that ravaged Europe in the first half of the century. In the post-war period, Switzerland's role became more that of a haven for rich people seeking to avoid paying taxes in their home countries and, in some instances, seeking to hide funds gained from criminal activities. Also, until the 1980s, Switzerland was nearly unique among European countries in allowing total freedom of capital movement. In recent years, with the rising concern about drug money laundering, the Swiss have tightened their banking laws and regulations so that it is no longer possible for criminals to hide their money in anonymous accounts or to insulate themselves from international criminal investigations. This, together with the development of other havens and an increasing demand from clients for good investment performance, has made life tougher for the Swiss private banks. But they have managed to retain a leading market share in this very attractive business. According to various recent studies, they still look after about a third of all funds placed by rich individuals outside their home countries. Zurich is just one of four centres of private banking in Switzerland. Geneva is probably slightly larger in this sector, appealing more naturally to clients from the Middle East, the Mediterranean countries and Latin America than Zurich. Lugano is the centre used by Italians, while Zurich and Basle appeal mainly to Germans, east Europeans and, to some extent, clients from North America. The Zurich scene is particularly competitive. The big Swiss universal banks are leading players in their own right as well as through subsidiaries such as Bank Leu, Bank Hofmann and Clariden Bank in the case of Credit Suisse, or Bank Cantrade and Hyposwiss in the case of UBS. Then there are the Swiss specialists, such as Bank Julius Baer and Bank J. Vontobel, and a long list of outlets of foreign banks, including Barclays, National Westminster (Coutts), Midland (Guyerzeller) and Rothschild from the UK. Private banking throughout Switzerland provides much of the fuel that drives other aspects of the Zurich financial centre. For example, it gives the banks huge placing power, enabling them to absorb much larger bond issues than would normally be expected in a country of this size - and financial prudence. That has attracted a large number of foreign investment banks, especially from Japan, to the city. Starting in the mid-1980s, several Japanese companies used the Swiss franc market to float bonds, largely because the rules were then simpler than those prevailing at home. Since then, borrowers from other countries have joined in and the business has ebbed and flowed, depending on the competitiveness of swap rates from Swiss francs into other currencies. In the late 1980s, the main Swiss financial markets - in foreign currencies and equities - lost considerable ground to London and other centres, mainly because of the government's refusal to remove transaction taxes, but also because of the lack of liquidity. In the past few years, the Swiss have fought back gamely and with considerable success to revitalise their markets. Four of the seven regional stock exchanges have been closed and Zurich's dominates. By early 1995, a national electronic exchange will replace all the remaining open-outcry exchanges, a move which could win back a lot of activity from London. The Zurich exchange moved into a new building only last year, and it is well worth a visit before the electronic exchange turns it into a white elephant. For its part, the government has removed or reduced many of the transaction taxes, although bankers still grumble that they are at a disadvantage to other financial centres that do not impose such taxes. The government has also significantly eased the conditions on granting work permits to foreigners, a move that has contributed significantly, along with the improved liquidity, to the rapid development of lively derivatives markets in Zurich. The Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Soffex), now just over five years old, is the third-largest option exchange in Europe and has the second most successful product, an option on the Swiss stock market's SMI index. Both the quoted and over-the-counter derivative markets have also become extremely active, with foreign as well as local banks bringing out new issues regularly. It all means that Zurich is not likely to be easily displaced as Europe's second-largest international financial centre.</p>

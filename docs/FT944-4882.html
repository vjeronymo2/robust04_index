			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (3): Laying the groundwork - Multimedia Ever since US vice-president Al Gore began his highly public campaign for a national information superhighway, the Japanese authorities, private business and media have been obsessed by the idea that the country may be left behind in the race to connect the population with an advanced communications network. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) has come out with a master plan for Japan's information age that reflects the authorities' concern with catching up with the US in laying the groundwork for multimedia services. In its plan, the MPT calls for the building of Japan's information superhighway infrastructure by the year 2010, five years earlier than planned by NTT, the former public utility which is probably the only telecommunications company today with the ability to build a nationwide network. Meanwhile, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which has competed with the MPT for the leadership role in nurturing Japan's multimedia industry, has also published a report calling for increased government efforts to pave the way for an advanced information society. In its report, Miti notes that Japan has been a laggard in the development and use of information networks. The spread of local area networks and multi-channel broadcasting, two important steps along the information highway, is much further advanced in the US than in Japan, Miti points out. Yet beneath the ostensible panic, views are divided over whether Japan really needs to catch up with the US in laying the groundwork for advanced communications services. There is general acknowledgement that when it comes to the spread of many of the key elements in the information superhighway, the US has a considerable lead over Japan. For example, computer networks which will link businesses, academic institutions, public facilities such as hospitals and libraries, and homes to each other to provide services ranging from health care and banking to home shopping and interactive video games, are already in much wider use in the US than in Japan. According to IDC, a high technology consultancy, penetration of PCs in the US is 42 per cent against just 10 per cent in Japan and 56 per cent of PC users in the US are connected by local area networks compared with just 13 per cent in Japan. Cable TV, which is expected to be another key channel for multimedia services, is also far more widely used in the US than in Japan. Jardine Fleming, the securities company, estimates in a recent study that cable TV reaches 70 per cent of US homes compared with just 2.9 per cent in Japan. The US is also the recognised leader in developing services which take advantage of the enhanced powers of communication provided by sophisticated networks. Video-on-demand and home shopping services are about to be commercialised and several companies are experimenting with a variety of interactive services. 'Japan lags far behind the US when it comes to the utilisation of networks,' admits Mr Masashi Kojima, president of NTT. At the same time, however, some Japanese business executives have taken comfort from the fact that this apparent delay in Japan's move towards the multimedia age may not really be a serious cause for concern. 'I don't agree that the US is ahead of Japan,' asserts Mr Nobuyuki Idei, managing director of Sony. 'They may end up being the last of the pack because they have very old cables and there is the possibility that this will be an obstacle to advanced multimedia,' he points out. Many Japanese industrialists point to the failed multimedia alliances in the US and the delays in multimedia experiments as evidence that the promise of vastly enhanced communications and media services has run far ahead of the reality. 'Not very many people in the US are talking as loudly any more about multimedia as they use to a while ago,' says one Japanese electronics executive. Furthermore, Japanese companies are leaders in many of the technologies that will be central to the development of information superhighways. For example, companies such as Sony and Toshiba are leading manufacturers of CD-ROMs, which are likely to become a key recording device for information captured through computer networks. JVC is a leader in digital compression technology while Pioneer has expertise in interactive cable systems. With their existing strengths and the lead they maintain in many key technologies, the optimists believe Japanese companies have plenty of time before the infrastructure is ready and the regulatory environment is sorted out to make up lost ground in preparing for the advanced information age. 'Worrying about multimedia is like worrying about which university to send your son to when he is just born,' Sony's Mr Idei asserts. 'The first five years will be just a small part of the big (multimedia) picture,' adds Mr Yoichi Morishita, president of Matsushita. Meanwhile, Japanese companies will be able to focus their energies on developing those technologies which they believe have the greatest market potential in the information age. To complement areas where they have recognised weaknesses, particularly software, they can form links with the many innovative software companies that exist in the US. That is precisely what companies from Matsushita, the consumer electronics giant, to Toshiba and NTT, have done. Matsushita, Sony, Toshiba and NTT are among a growing list of Japanese investors in General Magic, a US start-up company which is developing an operating system and communication software for personal digital assistants. NTT has linked up with Microsoft, the US software giant, and Silicon Graphics as well. The availability of interesting contents is one of the keys to success in multimedia, notes NTT's Mr Kojima. 'We hope to build bold alliances with the US in the field of network utilisation and contents,' he says. The alliances reflect a recognition that the building of a wide-ranging information infrastructure that is capable of changing the whole structure of society is a massive undertaking involving many industries, advanced technologies that are still to be developed, and huge sums of money. As such, the march to multimedia is likely to be less a contest in which either the US or Japan will emerge victorious than a three-legged race in which each side needs the other to reach their common goal.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. SANTA LEAVES TROOPS PERPLEXED  </P> <P> Los Angeles executives playing Santa Claus sent a jet Tuesday to Saudi Arabia  carrying gifts they thought U.S. troops need in the desert: designer  sunglasses, expensive cologne, toy cars and moisturizer.  </P> <P> Troops watching the products being loaded onto trucks from a cargo plane seemed  a bit perplexed.  </P> <P> Gucci sunglasses?  </P> <P> "That's outta there. Pilots wear Ray-Bans," said Capt. Rick Allison, 29, of Ft.  Walton Beach, Fla., who is with the 50th Tactical Airlift Squadron.  </P> <P> "Operation Desert Cheer" was part of an effort by employees of MGM Grand Air,  who figured executives willing to pay $1,200 to fly from Los Angeles to New  York might donate some nifty gifts for American troops.  </P> <P> A two-week gift drive netted 15 tons of goods.  </P> <P> Items on the plane's manifest included Frisbees, footballs, 2,000 music  cassettes, 20,000 cookies and 15,300 bottles of moisturizer.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Lakers sent hundreds of jerseys and an autographed basketball.  One toy manufacturer sent 7,200 Hot Wheels toy cars, saying it had received  requests from soldiers.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 5 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister Yi  Hoe-chang apologized to the nation Tuesday over the controversy  surrounding the modification of Seoul's country schedule for the  Uruguay Round (UR) agreement.    "I am truly sorry for the failure of the government to let  the people know the correct contents (of the modification),  giving rise to misgivings," Yi said.    In a statement, the premier said he had to acknowledge a  loophole that existed in the government's initial negotiations  with UR authorities.    The government ought to have included supplemented and  corrected items in its initial schedule during the UR  negotiations last December, he said.    It also was a mistake, Yi said, to not have given a clear  explanation of a supplemented and corrected final UR schedule,  thus making the final schedule look as if it ran counter to the  government's earlier statement that "the established UR schedule  cannot be modified through renegotiation."    The prime minister said, however, that the UR schedule was  supplemented due to the efforts of working-level officials from  the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry seeking to  obtain a better deal for Korean farmers.    "In fact, we have been able to secure a substantially better  outcome than the original agreement of last Dec. 15," he said.    Yi said it was not that the Ministry had changed the  original  agreement: All it did was simply supplement or correct those  clauses which needed to be supplemented in terms of  interpretation, he said.    Therefore, he said, the supplements and corrections cannot  be  taken as a change made through renegotiation of the existing  agreement.    Saying that the government would strive to develop rural  areas with the UR accord serving as an impetus, Yi asked the  people to understand the government and help it surmount rural  problems.</p>

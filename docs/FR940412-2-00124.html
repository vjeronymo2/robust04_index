State-Coordinated Approach <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _This approach would have the same design and purpose as described for the community initiated approach, except that the State would be the applicant and would serve as the coordinating body in the formation of the broader coalition. A State-coordinated approach could serve a particular region within the State or encompass the entire State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In particular, the State would bring together at least two (2) existing substance abuse prevention partnerships, allow for a broad array of prevention activities such as those relating to the ones described above, provide for the addition of at least one new community-based partnership, and establish the requisite coordinating and streamlining activities. Thus, a State initiated approach would have no fewer than two (2) existing partnerships and one (1) new partnership in the CPCD coalition. Several States have already made progress in developing regional and State-wide networks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CSAP substance abuse partnership/coalition model may serve in bridging a variety of broad-based prevention efforts, including violence and crime reduction, adolescent pregnancy, the spread of sexually transmitted disease, including HIV/AIDS, and school dropout prevention. It allows existing community-based partnerships and programs that currently address substance abuse to demonstrate the effectiveness of expanding their base and their efforts to address related health, social and safety issues through further interaction and linkages with other local coalitions and partnerships. This type of expansion can have a positive impact on preventing substance abuse through new or stronger prevention service systems both within the community itself and among affiliated communities. For example, and to the extent appropriate, partnership substance abuse prevention strategies and services may include the following areas of concern: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Reducing violence, crime and gang activity related to and/or aggravated by alcohol and other drug problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Reducing/preventing the spread of sexually transmitted disease, including HIV/AIDS, with respect to alcohol and other drug use and abuse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Addressing the special needs of rural, wilderness, and frontier communities with alcohol, tobacco, and other drug problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Addressing special needs in areas with high rates of immigration, poverty, disaster, and unemployment_aggravated by alcohol, tobacco, and other drug problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Reducing substance abuse and related problems in the workforce_including collaborative labor/management efforts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program encourages that approximately 50 percent of Federal funds be used for the provision of prevention services and approximately 15&hyph;25 percent for evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the CPCD Program provides the opportunity for community resources such as local coalitions, partnerships, service providers, and programs to formally collaborate, applicants are required to include a description of agreements, commitments and processes to be used in developing and implementing the proposed project. (This documentation must be provided in Appendix 4 of the application entitled, ``Letters of Commitment from Collaborating Organizations/Agencies/Individuals.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing partnerships are expected to have conducted needs assessments and are to use their needs assessment to: determine gaps in prevention services; identify any inefficiencies in the delivery of these services; and to begin work towards changing formerly established priorities to meet current needs. All new services proposed must be supported by the needs assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed projects submitted under this announcement must present a five (5) year comprehensive substance abuse prevention plan to demonstrate and study the development, implementation, and effectiveness of their design. The applicant's initial plan should include a discussion of all preliminary goals, objectives, and activities. These may be refined as appropriate, as the program evolves and progresses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluation must be an essential part of the plan for assessing the impact of the changes and services on the substance abuse-related problems in the community. Details are provided in the section on Evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eligibility: Applications may be submitted by public agencies, such as State, local and tribal governments, or local private (non-profit) organizations/agencies (i.e., existing partnerships, universities). In all cases, the applicant must be designated to act on behalf of the larger evolving coalition of multiple partnerships proposed in the CPCD grant application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the Community Prevention Coalitions Demonstration Grant Program is intended to build on the work of already existing prevention partnerships, by expanding both the base and the service capabilities of these partnerships into broader-based coalitions, this announcement requires that applicants be part of established community partnerships.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicant organization must be a member of the coalition (to be developed) and be supported by its (the proposed coalition) membership in receiving an award under this program activity. This agreement must be documented through a letter of support from each member of the proposed coalition. (These letters must be provided in Appendix 4 of the application entitled ``Letters of Commitment from Collaborating Organizations/Agencies/Individuals.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CSAP strongly encourages applications from tribal governments, Native American/Alaskan Native partnerships or Indian Nations. Such applicants must already be existing partnerships.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Previous or current CSAP Community Partnership Demonstration Program grantees are eligible to apply for a new grant under this announcement. Currently funded CSAP Community Partnership grantees must demonstrate their ability to fulfill the requirements of their current grant in addition to taking on the expanded tasks and responsibilities of the Community Prevention Coalitions Demonstration Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CSAP Community Partnership grantees will not be permitted to use Community Partnership project staff for full-time positions in a new CPCD project; nor will they be permitted to reduce the level of effort on the current Community Partnership project as a result of obtaining a grant award under this new program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol -- On 17 May, Crimean President Yuriy  Meshkov held a news conference on the completion of 100 days of  his presidency. He believes that, in his words, his least  successful day was when he was "stabbed in the back," i.e. when  the Ukrainian president appointed his representative to Crimea.  If Leonid Kravchuk does listen to opposition and introduce  presidential rule after all, in Yuriy Meshkov's view, he will  violate the constitution and laws of Ukraine, "Which violations  have become a tradition for the current leadership of Ukraine."    Relations between official Kiev and official Simferopol, the  Crimean president said, must be different from what they have  been up until recently. "Yukhym Zvyahilskyy's visit has changed  the climate of these mutual relations and confirmed that the  influence of the forces of reason in Ukraine is quite strong,  and it is they who will determine the state's domestic and  foreign policy."</p>

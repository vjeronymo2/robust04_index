			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Savings ratio sinks to post-war low The ratio of savings to gross domestic product last year fell to its lowest level since the second world war, threatening to undermine hopes of an investment-led recovery, an economic study warns. Written by Mr Peter Warburton and Mr Nigel Sedgley, economists with Robert Fleming Security, it calculates that the level of UK savings last year was only 15 per cent of the total GDP figure, largely because of public-sector debt. This proportion leaves the UK at the bottom of the 24-nation OECD league table for national savings ratios. With the latest public-sector borrowing requirement figures due to be released today, this debt seems set to seriously undermine the hoped-for recovery in fixed investment, the study warns. 'The national savings figure does not get a lot of attention. But such a slow national savings ratio is a big drain and big constraint,' argues Mr Warburton, who points out that the problem is almost entirely due to public-sector debt, rather than low levels of private savings, which have started to pick up in recent months. Government officials insist that a vigorous attempt is being made to reduce the public-sector debt, pointing to the recent undershoot in the PSBR as evidence. Mr Warburton argues that the weak performance of the gilt market suggests that the markets remain unconvinced by these efforts.</p>

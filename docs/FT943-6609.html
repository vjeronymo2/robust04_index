			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Restaurant heaven by the Bay - Dining in San Francisco / Nicholas Lander travels to northern California and is excited by what he finds there Nancy Cosgrove, a greeter and seater at Boulevard, one of San Francisco's newest restaurants, described her job succinctly: 'It's as though I'd died and gone to restaurant heaven.' I could just as easily have used the same phrase to describe my fortnight's stay in the Bay Area. Even for those who simply enjoy eating out, but do not share my fascination with the restaurant industry, what is happening today in and around San Francisco is exciting - perhaps more so than in any other large city. It is not just the quality of the raw ingredients - the wonderful salads, fruit and vegetables, an increasingly high proportion of which are organically grown; the vast array of breads; and the excellent meat, poultry and fish - but also the cooking techniques, which are innovative and varied. They include wood-burning ovens, grilling over mesquite, spit roasting, and the latest craze among American chefs - using stacked napoleons to present food in layered mini-towers. Spectacular locations for restaurants in and around the city, with views over the bay and across the Golden Gate bridge to Marin County, are an obvious attraction, while some spectacular modern design helps, too. It all adds up to a package to convince even the most hardened sceptic. Indeed, after dinner at Elka's, in San Francisco's Japanese district, Jean Francois - who travels the world's wine regions selling the finest oak barrels - admitted that the city's food was now better, in terms of interest and value, than that of his native Burgundy. There are, however, two economic factors which further benefit today's diner in northern California and may set standards for restaurateurs elsewhere. The first is the extraordinary growth in what Americans refer to as the hospitality industry. The US Bureau of Labour Statistics considers food service to be one of the fastest growing segments of the economy - it estimates that jobs in this sector will increase 30 per cent overall, and chef positions by 42 per cent, by 2005. According to the California Restaurant Association, businesses which serve food are the state's second largest tax source and in 1992 the industry generated Dollars 24bn (Pounds 15.4bn) in sales and employed 780,000 workers. The number of American cooking schools to train future chefs has increased from a handful in the mid-1970s to more than 500 today. The most ambitious yet is due to open in 1995 in the former Christian Brothers winery in the Napa Valley. I had been told on a previous visit that San Francisco had so many restaurants that if all its inhabitants were to go out to eat on the same night there would be enough restaurant chairs to accommodate them. Since then, San Francisco has lured chefs from Los Angeles where the economy is less robust, enticed plutocrat Gordon Getty, the oil tycoon and son of Paul Getty, to open Plump Jack's, initially a wine shop, now with a restaurant attached - one restaurant, local wits observe, that may not have to struggle quite as hard as its competitors to make a profit. All this has given a second career opportunity to many chefs and restaurateurs whose initial career ended in the recession. As a result prices remain reasonable, menus and wine lists sparkle and customers are solicitously looked after - if not they walk. The established restaurateur's dilemma was poignantly voiced by Joyce Goldstein, whose restaurant, Square One, has been winning plaudits for more than a decade. 'Every time a new restaurant opens we see our regular customers slightly less often.' A striking example of the American 'can-do' philosophy is the recent opening of the Rutherford Grill, Napa Valley which has achieved a daily turnover of more than Dollars 10,000 after just two months' trading. This, comfortable, wood framed, roadhouse diner, which seats 120, is owned by Houston Restaurants, based in Phoenix, Arizona and is the company's 27th restaurant. Building began last January and doors opened on June 8. Corporate policy with any new restaurant is to fly in their best staff from across America - manager, barman or short order cook - for the first three weeks to train their local staff. The management realised that not only is the local competition intense from such nearby restaurants as Tra Vigne, Stars Cafe, Mustard's Grill and Don Giovanni's but that a sense of belonging to, and working with, the local community is crucial for any new business's survival. So for the first two days, for two hours at lunch and dinner, the Rutherford Grill serves food free. Instead, every diner was asked to make a voluntary Dollars 5 donation to two local charities and raised several thousand dollars. Business is booming. The queue of diners waiting for a table - the restaurant operates a 'no booking' policy to promote what it calls 'the spontaneous dining decision' - bears testimony to its reasonable prices, efficient service and well prepared food; the spit-roasted chicken is particularly good. The Rutherford Grill will hold its customers until a new restaurant manages to make them a gastronomic offer they cannot refuse. Restaurant heaven has no place for smokers. Most California restaurants operate a no-smoking policy throughout to protect their staff from the dangers of passive smoking. On August 1, Oakland passed an ordinance banning smoking in all its restaurants. Naturally, this is being opposed by tobacco company Philip Morris, but Californians will be able to vote on the measure during the elections in November.</p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THRIFT'S CAMPAIGN TO RELY ON (FREE) FLIGHTS OF FANCY  </P> <P> American Savings Bank started its most ambitious sales campaign ever Friday by  offering free and discounted flights on Continental Airlines to destinations in  Europe, Asia, Mexico, Hawaii and 87 U.S. cities.  </P> <P> In a bid to drum up more deposits and loans, the thrift will begin advertising  the program Sunday with a TV ad showing a silhouetted couple "Dancing the  Continental."  </P> <P> Banks and thrifts have long enticed customers with giveaways -- usually  toasters and other small appliances. American's offer of plane trips is an  unusually extensive promotion.  </P> <P> "This is the most aggressive campaign we've ever sponsored," American  spokeswoman Casey MacKenzie said.  </P> <P> The thrift, which has $16.5 billion in assets and earned $214.2 million last  year, would not disclose how much the promotion is costing.  </P> <P> Depositors who open certificates of deposit with $2,500, annuities, checking  accounts and charge card accounts can get discounts on travel. A $20,000  certificate of deposit earns a customer a free round-trip companion ticket to  France, England, Japan, Hawaii or any of Continental's 87 U.S. destinations.  </P> <P> An adjustable-rate mortgage for $50,000 or more brings two free round-trip  tickets to anywhere Continental flies in Mexico, Hawaii or the United States.  </P></p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Barclays considers default provisions to limit profit swings Barclays, the largest UK bank, is working on plans to even out cyclical swings in its profits by making a small provision for default each time it lends money. It hopes this will prevent large rises in loan provisions during recessions. Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' new chief executive, is backing the initiative although it was discussed before he took up his post full-time in January. Barclays announces its 1993 profits today, after a Pounds 242m loss in 1992. Banks suffered from an unprecedented swing in their profits in the five years from 1987 because they boosted earnings by increasing loans rapidly in the late 1980s. They were then hit by a wave of bad debt provisions in the recession. Banks carry general provisions against losses they expect from loans which appear to be sound, but Barclays wants to make this more exact. It would book a small loss against each loan, set according to the chance of it not being repaid. The bank is trying to analyse the risks over full economic cycles of particular types of lending, such as small corporate loans or those to particular industries. Mr Taylor is thought to be keen to implement the new approach next year. Barclays' directors believe that by making loans carry a small provision based on risk, they could discourage branch managers both from lending too much during economic booms and refusing loans during recession. However, the initiative could be hard to implement because of the difficulty of assessing risk accurately. The move could also be opposed by bank auditors, who might regard it as an attempt to smooth profits by mis-stating earnings. The bank could also increase its tax liability by making general provisions. Specific provisions against loans clearly in danger of default are tax deductible, but general provisions against expected loss are not. Barclays signalled a move towards evening out volatility in profits when it increased its general provisions by Pounds 118m in the first half of 1993. It holds general provisions worth about 0.6 per cent of its loans and advances. Mr Taylor is thought to be keen to implement the idea in full. If Barclays cannot gain approval from auditors, it might bring in the change internally in separate management accounts. Mr Taylor is thought to be keen to implement the idea in full.

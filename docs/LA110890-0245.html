			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> ALBANIAN LEADER URGES REFORMS  </P> <P> Albanian President Ramiz Alia has called for radical constitutional reform that  would curb his party's power in Europe's last orthodox Communist state and  could reopen mosques and churches shut for two decades.  </P> <P> In a blunt speech that also painted a picture of economic woes, public  disaffection and hard-line opposition to change, Alia warned a Communist  Central Committee plenum in Tirana that the party must become more democratic  to survive.  </P> <P> His speech, carried in full by the official news agency ATA today, gave no hint  that Albania will legalize opposition political parties and was tempered by a  warning that reform has to be cautious to avoid "haste, passions, anarchy."  </P> <P> But Alia's call for constitutional change that would redefine the party's  leading role and scrap bans on religious worship and foreign investment marked  his boldest departure yet from the rigid legacy of his Stalinist predecessor  Enver Hoxha.  </P></p>

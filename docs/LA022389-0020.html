			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRAMMYS '89;  </P> <P> A SHOW SHORT ON TALK AND LONG ON SONG  </P> <P> It's name was Grammy, three-plus hours of whammy.  </P> <P> So from this critic, there'll be no slammy.  </P> <P> Apologies to rappers. But Wednesday night's Grammy telecast on CBS was, well, a  fast car, a speeding, careening, rocking, fast-clocking, racing, bracing sprint  down a mostly smooth track that overshot its scheduled time slot by a mere 20  minutes. Who cared?  </P> <P> Bobby McFerrin's acceptance speech alone (when his "Don't Worry, Be Happy" was  named song of the year) was probably more musical than two-thirds of this  year's record releases.  </P> <P> If past Grammycasts were sometimes on the cutting edge of ho-hum, this one took  a hairpin turn toward the exciting and eclectic.  </P> <P> Music purists may disagree. But as entertainment for the broad mass of viewers,  the evening was a comparative festival of diversity that had just about  everything. That included a range from Leontyne Price to rocking Metallica,  whose robust number "One" may have provided a preview of World War III.  </P> <P> Cracked host Billy Crystal: "That song was written by Steve Allen."  </P> <P> The night had other funny lines from Crystal. It had funny looks, from Sinead  O'Connor, who seemed to fuse images of boot camp and concentration camp, and  from Michael Hutchence, who had that wet,  throw-something-on-when-the-doorbell-rings-and-you're-in-the-shower appearance.  </P> <P> It had vibrant, splashy production numbers with Luther Vandross and Linda  Ronstadt, even if there wasn't a show-breaker like Michael Jackson to bring  down the house inside Shrine Auditorium.  </P> <P> It had a smashing gospel ensemble, a booming Toni Childs and a socially  conscious Tracy Chapman, who fulfilled the promise of her own lyrics to "be  somebody."  </P> <P> It had standing ovations, but also groans of disappointment in response to some  of the winners.  </P> <P> And, as usual with awards programs, there was at least one small moment that  loomed big, this one McFerrin and Crystal's inspired bit reliving musical  history.  </P> <P> Of all major awards shows, it's the musical ones that are usually most tailored  to TV, because they're performance-oriented and celebrate song, not chit-chat.  </P> <P> The Grammycast, for example, was happily devoid of the awkward and vacuous  scripted chatter by presenters that so often epitomizes awards shows. Nor were  acceptance speeches long and windy. Instead, this was a night at the office.  Everyone got down to business, and the show ran so smoothly that even its few  fluffs were hardly noticed.  </P> <P> Said McFerrin: "Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.  </P></p>

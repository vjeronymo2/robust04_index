			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Arts: Twyla Tharp and Dancers - City Center, New York / The latest Tharp company and works Even if Twyla Tharp were never to make another great dance, she would have already long been a symbol, an American success story and an icon of crossover. She is the 1960s experimentalist who in the 1970s choreographed for the Joffrey Ballet (Deuce Coupe, to Beach Boys music), for Baryshnikov and American Ballet Theatre (Push Comes To Shove) and for John Curry (After All); and who in the 1980s choreographed for the movie of Amadeus, for New York City Ballet and the Paris Opera. For many of us, though, she made her very best work on her own dance company. When that folded in the 1987-88 season, Baryshnikov took Tharp, those dancers who chose to follow, her repertory (and, it was said, her debts) into American Ballet Theatre, which he then directed. But only a season later Baryshnikov left ABT; and when her three-year contract there ended, Tharp left too, taking her dancers and most of her repertory with her. Now (like Baryshnikov and his White Oak Project) Tharp is working with a pick-up group: ie a company that is hand-picked, rehearsed, sent out to perform on tour, and then disbanded. Twyla Tharp and Dancers (her old company used to be called Twyla Tharp Dance) was formed last autumn for an Ohio State University residency, where it rehearsed at length, learnt two new works (Octet and Men's Piece), several old ones, and then performed. On January 28 the troupe opened a two-week New York season at City Center; it has now gone on to Japan for three weeks, and there is talk of a European tour in the summer. For the New York season, Tharp presented another new work, Sextet, and also Grand Pas: Rhythm of the Saints, a pas de deux she had made for the Paris Opera last autumn. All four new works were warmly acclaimed by audiences; and, unlike many of Tharp's 1980s productions, all were economically produced and unobtrusively lit. Three of them were definitely ballet, with women on pointe and with turned-out legs; and they raise the questions that has kept growing larger ever since Tharp began choreographing for ballet companies: is she really classical? Can she, the great crossover choreographer, cross over the whole way? If you can accept that there is much that is ballet that is not classical and - more important - much that is classical that is not ballet, then you can accept that Tharp was a classical choreographer before she ever came to ballet. She says that Men's Piece is about the twist: which, she reminds us, in the late 1950s and the '60s tore men and women from each other's embrace. Will a man and woman be able to dance together again? She tries various solutions. The most exciting is a march for Tharp and all four guys, working together on equal terms, filling the stage with one great dance arc after another; and the most touching is an Astaire-type ballroom duet to Gershwin's 'He Loves And She Loves', because Tharp shows not only the romance of bygone convention but also her mixed feelings about committing herself to that. The point of Men's Piece was to let us know that she is going to go on experimenting. It was pleasingly unfinished, un-slick. A lecture-demo, a collection of sketches in progress, a life-in-the-day-of-the choreographer, it is a real grabbag work. No scenery; dancers in rehearsal kit. Tharp - baggy overalls over her dance gear, her mop of hair now elegantly grey - dances with her old lithe authority; and she talks - to her dancers, to the sound technician and to us. Septet and Octet reaffirm my belief that no choreographer today is working in ballet with Tharp's command of the form's dance potential. (But then, these are bleak days for ballet.) Sextet, a Latin ballet for three couples, is set to a commissioned score by Bob Telson that mixes various Latin dance rhythms with a basic bubble-rock beat. Tharp's choreography, masterfully arranged round this, is a frothy carnival of steps, an audience pleaser, but strangely anonymous. Octet, to a new rock-cum-classical music by Edgar Meyer, is more tentative, less amiable, more rewarding and more Tharpian. Its four couples - women in black leotards and shorts, men in black vests and trousers, all against a black backdrop - fuse ballet vocab. with streetwise, rock-related characteristics. The mood keeps changing - aggressive, floating, sportive, tense, ebullient - and one level of your mind floods with admiration just as another thinks 'So what?' It is a remarkable work, but it is also Tharp saying 'See what I can do.' (Her Opera pas de deux, Grand Pas: Rhythm of the Saints, is something one wishes she could not do: a smug Parisian joke about the standard classical ballet gala item.) The season also featured five older Tharp works. The Little Ballet is one she made in 1983 for Baryshnikov to Glazounov music. Not even Balanchine made Glazounov sound so American and contemporary as Tharp does here; and she makes her hero look not princely but modern. I have never known a Tharp dance more limpid and open-hearted. Another '80s dance, The Golden Section (from The Catherine Wheel, 1981), was under-rehearsed, but Nine Sinatra Songs (1982), with its seven contrasting dance/love duets, was as overwhelming as when the Tharp company danced it at Sadler's Wells in 1983. From the 1970s came the revivals of two pop pieces - Ocean's Motion (1975), a light bubblegum work to Chuck Berry songs, and Deuce Coupe - or, as Tharp calls her latest version, Deuce Coupe IV. The characters here are just kids, too; alongside the ballerina in white who, central to proceedings but removed from them, goes through her lexicon of steps. Everyone else is pop, swinging, rippling. The beauty - you can't miss it - is that she's Tharpian too. Pop and classical meet as equals. Tharp's illustrious array of dancers gives new significance to the word 'pick-up.' They come from New York City Ballet, from downtown New York modern dance troupes, from the Paris Opera, from Tharp's own former company; and several of them reached new highs in their careers. Here are just three: the exquisite Delphine Moussin, on leave from the Paris Opera (she danced the Deuce Coupe ballerina with ravishing stretch and delicacy); Robert LaFosse, on leave from New York City Ballet (giving The Little Ballet his own boyish sweetness); and Jamie Bishton, virile and spontaneous, a true Tharpian who followed Tharp into American Ballet Theatre and, three years later, out of it again. But the great wonder was to see them and their colleagues together on the same stage in the same choreography. True, this company will fold; true, these dancers will go their several ways. And yet this season was a happy one. It brought back something into the air that so many bygone Tharp seasons used to bring and that had been missing: optimism.</p>

			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THREE FIELD GOALS BY LOHMILLER GIVE WASHINGTON A WIN  </P> <P> Washington kicker Chip Lohmiller enjoyed one of his best performances Sunday  while Morten Andersen struggled through one of his worst.  </P> <P> Lohmiller kicked three field goals and Gerald Riggs scored a touchdown on a  nine-yard run as the Washington Redskins rallied for a 16-14 victory Sunday  over the New Orleans Saints.  </P> <P> Andersen, the most accurate kicker in NFL history, missed two field goals,  including a 36-yarder with 2:34 left to play. He also missed 52-yard kick in  the third quarter, giving him a 3-7 mark for the season, well off his 78%  career mark.  </P> <P> "Andersen is too good a kicker for that to happen," Lohmiller said. "He'll  bounce back. It felt good to come in and kick against him. It felt real good to  have a game like this and help the team."  </P> <P> Two of Lohmiller's field goals came after Saint turnovers -- a fumble by Eric  Martin recovered by A.J. Johnson at the New Orleans 29-yard line on the second  play of the game and a muffed punt by Derrick Shepard in the fourth quarter  recovered by Dave Harbour on the Saints 18.  </P> <P> Washington (2-2) lost a yard on three tries on the first possession, and  Lohmiller kicked a 48-yard field goal. The Redskins drove to a first-and-goal  at the four-yard line after the recovery of Shepard's fumble, but three rushes  gained three yards, and Lohmiller kicked the winning field goal from 18 yards.  </P> <P> He also hit a 19-yarder in the third quarter when Washington could get only  nine yards after a first-and-goal from the 10-yard line.  </P> <P> Riggs' touchdown capped a four-play, 66-yard drive in a 10-point third quarter  for the Redskins.  </P> <P> The Saints' touchdowns were an 11-yard pass from Bobby Hebert to Lonzell Hill  in the first quarter and a three-yard run by Dalton Hilliard in the second  quarter.  </P> <P> Riggs, averaging almost six yards a carry and just under 120 yards a game, was  held to 50 yards in 18 rushes. He had only 11 yards in 10 carries at halftime  as New Orleans built a 14-3 lead.  </P></p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Books: Investigations into the nature of cruelty SACRED HUNGER by Barry Unsworth Hamish Hamilton Pounds 14.99, 630 pages MOTHER COUNTRY by Elisabeth Russell Taylor Peter Owen Pounds 14.95, 167 pages SEPARATION by Sally Emerson Scribners Pounds 14.99, 248 pages THERE IS a good story at the centre of Sacred Hunger about a spontaneous mutiny aboard a slave trader in 1752. The mutiny is led by the ship's doctor and a French passenger, who run the ship aground on the Florida coast and set up a utopian community in which black and white live together in freedom and equality. Running concurrently is a duller-than-ditchwater account of the tribulations of the shipowner's son, Erasmus Kemp, whose prospects are ruined by the apparent loss of the ship. His father commits suicide, Kemp is forced to break off his engagement and spend the next 12 years recouping his fortune in the sugar trade. When he hears rumour of the colony it is no surprise that he sets out to destroy it. Rousseau triumphed over Hobbes shortly after the events described here, and nowadays we all believe that the slave trade was an abomination and that the profit motive must be tempered by humanity. Profit, says the Frenchman, playing devil's advocate, is 'that sacred hunger which justifies everything, sanctifies all purposes'. Kemp is so obviously a prig and moral coward from the very start that the attempt to make him represent that argument, which is the interesting one from our point of view, is doomed to failure. It does not help that the author chose to write the Kemp chapters in a strange pastiche of 18th-century prose, complete with circumlocutions and lengthy generalisations. This is a pity because the shipboard sequences contain vivid vignettes of the resilience of the press-ganged crew and their daily struggle with brutality and humiliation. Neither Kemp nor his adversaries, the ship's doctor and the Frenchman, ever come to life in the same way. These gentlemen are merely mouthpieces for familiar arguments about the nature of greed, corruption and cruelty. As an investigation of the nature of cruelty, Elisabeth Russell Taylor's novel is altogether more effective. The term 'child abuse' takes on a whole new meaning after reading this account of one such victim. One of the terrible things about cruelty is its unpredictability, as we see here. Antonia is born in 1930 to a wealthy aristocratic Englishman and a German-Jewish mother. Their reasons for tormenting her are complex, so much so that she spends the rest of her life trying to understand them. Only their friend, Walter, makes her childhood bearable, and at 21 she leaves home and becomes his lover. After Walter's death, the novel, along with his heroine, turns decidedly weird. It comes as a shock that Antonia, who has never shown any interest in her Jewishness, should suddenly decide to emigrate to Israel. 'I have discovered my identity: I am a microcosm of my race.' Less than 20 pages later Antonia is dead, but those 20 pages leave the reader reeling, from a combination of admiration and outrage and perplexity that only a very fine quality of writing can provoke. After that it was hard to take Sally Emerson's story of nanny-trouble among the chattering-classes seriously, but I must admit I could not put it down, partly from wide-eyed wonder at the total awfulness of all its characters. Can people really be this self-centred and superficial? Is anyone really supposed to believe in the outrageous coincidences that propel the so-called plot?</p>

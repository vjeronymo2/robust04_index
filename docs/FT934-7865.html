			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Arts: Catch the magic carpet - Cinema ALADDIN (U) John Musker, Ron Clements THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE (12) Mel Gibson THE STRANGER (U) Satyajit Ray SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER (12) Thomas Schlamme POSSE (15) Mario Van Peebles THE STOLEN CHILDREN (15) Gianni Amelio The Disney company may be in trouble in Europe, where the once-roaring mouse now squeaks in terror at its quarterly bank statements. But in America, corporation and rodent have ridden high throughout 1993, mostly on the back of a single film Aladdin. Disney's new animated feature has outperformed last year's Beauty And The Beast to become the highest-grossing cartoon feature of all time. Why? How? What is happening? Ten years ago paint-and-brush animation was pronounced dead or dying by many observers, including, I regret to say, me. The art had been hounded to an early grave - we all said - by such new pretenders as modelwork, animatronics and computer graphics. Now look at the blushes on our faces. Aladdin has been the year's second favourite film after That Dinosaur Movie and a mere five minutes in your seat will tell you why. Having seduced us with romantic traditionalism in Beauty And The Beast, Disney now turn 180 degrees and go for comedy mixed with high kitsch. The decor in Aladdin is out of Kismet via The Thief Of Baghdad. The characters are spoofy and (post)modern: led by a Tom Cruise-like Aladdin and a Robin Williams-voiced genie with a genius for mimicry. And the pace is so fast, so sure, that British Rail should take a look at Disney's Advanced Passenger Carpet as a serious potential design model for 2002. The story, we know, is simple enough to suit the breakneck pace. Boy meets lamp; boy rubs lamp; boy, after minor setbacks, is helped by lamp to girl of his dreams. All the film's directors John Musker and Ron Clements need do is follow the narrative arrows. We begin with melodrama, mugged with a marvellous opening conceit: the 'cave' is the mouth of a giant sand monster and Aladdin is chased from its innards by a roaring, bilious spume of lava. Further metamorphic fun is sketched in by the villain Jafar and his staff that becomes a cobra. Then Robin Williams's genie arrives, seizing the spotlight, the microphone and the movie's transformation franchise. Williams's performance is less a star turn, more a one-man galaxy expounding its chaos theory of comedy. When one inspired routine burns out, another flames up to take its place; all in nanoseconds rather than light years. The demented tinkling of an air stewardess's voice; Peter Lorre's feline murmur for a line of necromantic apology ('I can't bring people back from the dead]'); here some Robert De Niro, there some Bette Midler, there again some Jack Nicholson. And the vocal gymnastics are matched by visual. The Disney artists swish their scene-stealer through all the lighting likenesses his voice invokes, calling on the latest computer technology to do so. At times the movie's modernist attack can feel like assault and battery. The princess, in keeping with feminist writ, is less a shrinking violet than a ballbreaking career girl: I have met her kind behind many a Hollywood executive desk. And as for Jafar's parrot Iago - need it be quite so deafeningly vaudevillian in its locutions? 'Oh dat's a big surprise] I tink I'm gonna die of surprise]' etc. But why are we complaining of too much energy from a studio that not long ago, after Walt's death, seemed to be slipping into irreversible coma? Aladdin and Beauty And The Beast prove there is undreamt-of life both in Disney and in the art of feature animation. And we we have not even mentioned the songs. Music by Alan Mencken; lyrics by Howard Ashman and Tim Rice; and my favourite was not the Oscar-winning 'A Whole New World' but the preposterous, elephant-swaying, over-the-top, out-Intolerancing-Intolerance 'Prince Ali.' Take the children, buy a sack of popcorn, enjoy. Half a Mel Gibson is better than no Mel Gibson. But The Man Without A Face, directed by Mr G, shows how stars do like to put their own charisma through the mincer whenever they get behind the camera. 'Pizza face]', 'Hamburger head]' - these are among the friendly sobriquets lobbed by local children at the reclusive ex-schoolteacher with the burn-ravaged features (Gibson) who lives in a sea-washed mansion in Maine. Turn our hero to the right and we get a perfect Mel profile. Turn him to the left and we get Elm Street squishiness. Ergo: it takes no small act of courage for fatherless young Chuck (Nick Stahl) to approach old pizza-face and request some tuition for his military school entrance exam. He does not tell mother (Margaret Whitton); for, good heavens, what would she think? Especially since the man is suspected of having molested a boy years before, just prior to his scarring car crash. Can you think of an odder choice for a movie star's directing debut? Then you have not followed the fashion in these things. Film idols, when they become film makers, love to deface or deprecate their own glamour. (See Eastwood giving us wrinkles-and-all in Unforgiven). It shows that they are serious artists not just pin-ups. Gibson's film, though, never feels focused enough to offer either serious art or serious image-critique. Apart from some vague tut-tutting at small-town gossip and vaguer support for persecuted sexual minorities - Mel's mystery-man may be gay, even if he is unjustly suspected of abuse - the movie swills around in a soft stew of buddyism and surrogate-parent sentimentality, varied by the odd morsel of red-herring Gothicism. How we distrust those we do not know. This is the theme for the week's live-action movies. The Stranger is Satyajit Ray's last film: sedentary, even sciatic in its staging, but grace-touched in its mastery of faces and feelings. Is the long-lost uncle (Utpal Dutt) who hoves in view to reclaim a long-waiting bequest an impostor or not? And how can Mr and Mrs Middle-Class Calcutta Couple, the supposed relatives with whom he stays, find out without being rude? Like all Ray's late films, this one features characters stuck as if by superglue to the ancestral armchairs. Occasionally, stiffly, they rise to walk about the room. And always they talk. But do not expect songs, knees-ups or Aladdin-ish pacing. What you get is a subtler dance of bewilderment: a soft-shoe shuffle of the soul, a grand old image-choreographer laying out steps to prove that in this world Nobody Really Knows Anybody. Can you even know that your newly-wedded bride is not a serial killer? Mike Myers, aka Wayne of Wayne's World, has this problem in So I Married An Axe Murderer. High-street butcher Nancy Travis seems so pretty, so nice . . . Yet her CV does seem to correspond with that of the multiple murderer headlined on the front page of the tabloid rag Myers glimpses in his scandal-hungry parents' kitchen. This is Hitchcock's Suspicion with swapped sexes and often very funny, not least when it allows an irrelevant riff to get going. I loved Alan Arkin's cameo as a kindly police chief begged by his officers to be louder and more brutal. (They have seen too many TV cop shows.) As for Myers, his moon-faced sincerity and permanent state of attentive wonder  - the candour of the apprentice lunatic - suggests there is mileage in this actor's mock-innocence even after he has finished with Wayne's Worlds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 . . . Oh that Myers had wandered debunkingly, a Candide for our age, into the cumbrous landscapes of Posse and The Stolen Children. The first is a black Western spurred towards pretension by director-star Mario Van Peebles (of New Jack City): much racial sermonising, much sculptural posturing in the mise-en-scene. Gianni Amelio's The Stolen Children is a sentimental, prize-laden Italian film about two siblings orphaned by the law. Carted off towards a care home from delinquent Momma - she had put the 11-year-old girl into prostitution - they pal up with their young escorting officer. Result: tender, truant wanderings across Italy as humanity begins to glow through the trio's sullen armour. The idea intrigues; the execution is a touch maudlin and more than a touch longwinded.</p>

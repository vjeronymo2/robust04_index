			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanjing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Economic co-operation  among cities in the valley of the Chang Jiang, China's longest,  is paying off.    With a sound economic foundation, the Chang Jiang Delta  generates 40 percent of the nation's industrial and agricultural  output value and 50 percent of the state revenue each year.    In December 1985 the governments of Shanghai, China's  largest  economic center; Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu  Province; Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province; and  Chongqing, a populous city in southwest China, sponsored a Chang  Jiang Valley economic coordination association.    The association, with 23 member cities, has been playing a  big role in opening further to the outside world, with  Shanghai's Pudong new area, China's largest economic and  technological development zone, as the leader since 1992.    In line with its geographical conditions, the valley has  formed five economically coordinated zones: the Chang Jiang  Delta economic co-operation zone headed by Shanghai, the lower  reaches economic co-operation zone with Nanjing as the leader,  the middle reaches economic co-operation zone with Wuhan as the  center, the upper reaches economic co-operation zone led by  Chongqing, and the Panxi-Liupanshui development zone at the  juncture of the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang and the Jinsha  Jiang.    The 23 major cities in the valley have set up 10 special  co-operation groups in the fields of science, funding,  navigation, tourism, posts and telecommunications, material  supply, trade, environmental protection and social science.    Last year saw these cities lend and borrow a total of 231  billion yuan among themselves.    The special co-operation group for environmental protection  has set up a monitoring network consisting of 150 stations along  the Chang Jiang to protect the local ecological conditions.    The gross domestic product of Pudong increased by 30 percent  last year, thanks to the accessibility of funds, materials,  talented people and information from the Chang Jiang Valley's  Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan and Sichuan  Provinces.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / People: Finance moves The Colloque Franco-Britannique, a select forum set up three years ago by Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, and Gerard Worms, chairman of Suez, has been described rather unkindly by some observers as 'a group of serious people shooting the breeze'. But the annual meeting of leading industrialists, journalists and academics does have some practical uses, too. It was at one such gathering that a senior member of SG Warburg met Yves Cannac, the president of Cegos, a French consultancy specialising in professional and management training. He was so impressed with the 59-year-old Frenchman, who was also executive chairman of Havas, the French media group, from 1978 to 1981, that he has been hired to advise Warburg on how to develop its business in France. Warburg clearly believes that retaining senior figures with good local knowledge and contacts is a winning strategy. It has similar advisers in Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Australia and Canada and two in Japan.</p>

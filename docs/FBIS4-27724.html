			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] It was reported that Nhoek Bunchhai, the  self-appointed general, the highest ranking commander of the  FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral,  Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] group, and Prince  Ranariddh's most able man, died in Samraong District of Oddar  Meanchey Province on 31 May.    What was the cause of Nhoek Bunchhai's death, which members  of the group have tried hard to hide?    The people who often travel in and out of Samraong District  said that there are two stories concerning Nhoek Bunchhai's  death.    1. As Nhoek Bunchhai went from Samraong to inspect the  battlefield at Tonle Sar on Route 69, his armored personnel  carrier ran over a land mine near Tonle Sar. He was killed in  the explosion.    2. When Nhoek Bunchhai was on his way to inspect the  battlefield along Route 69 west of Samraong, some forcibly  recruited Para [former non-communist forces] soldiers from  Prince Ranariddh's group lobbed a grenade into his armored car.  Nhoek Bunchhai was then killed at the same time as five other  colonels were killed or wounded.    These Para soldiers lobbed the grenade because, on the one  hand, they were angry with Nhoek Bunchhai and other commanders  who had sent their subordinates to forcibly recruit them and  send them out to fight on the battlefield while they were busily  striving to grow rice to be ready for the coming rainy season.  This has caused them and their families to face famine and  untold misery. Moreover, when these soldiers were sent to the  battlefield, their commanders took liberties with their wives  and children at home.    To the Para soldiers, this is a matter of life and death.

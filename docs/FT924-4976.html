			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Arts: Birtwistle's bloody ballad BOWDOWN is one of the those rare pieces of music theatre that manages to extend and revitalise an age-old tradition while remaining absolutely true to its contemporary self. It was the first collaboration between Harrison Birtwistle and Tony Harrison, born out of workshops at the National Theatre in 1977 where Birtwistle had just been appointed the first Music Director and Harrison had been working on his Phaedra Britannica, well before poet and composer were involved on the National's Oresteia and their 'mechanical pastoral' Yan Tan Tethera. It is a ballad, based upon the legend of the Two Sisters, a violent story of family murder which appears in folk lores throughout northern Europe and America. Harrison's text for Bowdown intertwines conflicting versions of the tale, moving between English, regional dialects and Danish, constantly breaking the thread and rejoining it so that the speech rhythms are varied, the perspective changes, and the listener is moved between frames of reference and narrative styles. Birtwistle's music does the bare minimum (though he has added some new material for the new staging): the text is underpinned with pulses, primeval interludes are based upon the slenderest scraps of melody, piercing drones pick out the bloody climaxes. Yet the cumulative effect is monumental; the dramatic world created by both music and text is totally absorbing and consistent, and quite unlike anything in the repertory. The new production by Graham Devlin's Major Truck Theatre Company is touring the country under the auspices of the Arts Council's Contemporary Music Network; it reached the Queen Elizabeth Hall (and a disappointingly small audience) on Thursday. Devlin's approach retains the essential ritualised aspect of the original; one of Bowdown's most extraordinary characteristics is its invented sense of communal story-telling, of a drama pieced together from shards of collective memory, in which the actor-musicians pool their resources and seemingly invent their roles as necessary. There is more extraneous movement in this production than in previous versions I've seen, and perhaps a little less cumulative energy too; something tighter and more controlled might give the action a greater tension and impact, but this remains a finely wrought realisation of an extraordinary piece, which continues to defy categorisation. It's arguably both Birtwistle's and Harrison's most perfectly achieved stage work to date, a genuine alliance of equal partners wonderfully matched in their sensibility. Queen Elizabeth Hall; touring next week to Southampton, Sheffield and Lancaster</p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FOES OF MIRALESTE CLOSURE HAIL RULING;  </P> <P> APPEALS COURT SAYS DISTRICT MUST WEIGH ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS  </P> <P> An appeals court has ruled that the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School  District must consider the potential environmental effects before it can close  Miraleste High School.  </P> <P> The decision, issued Tuesday by the 2nd District Court of Appeal in Los  Angeles, upholds a May, 1988, ruling by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Miriam  Vogel. The appellate ruling was hailed by a parents group as an important  victory in their efforts to prevent the school board from closing the  under-enrolled campus on the east side of the peninsula.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Detrimental Effect'  </P> <P> "We are elated that the appeal court understood and agreed . . . that closing  Miraleste would have a highly detrimental effect on the safety and education of  the children involved," Donna Perrin, president of the East Peninsula Education  Council, said Wednesday.  </P> <P> However, the parents group, which has been fighting for more than two years to  preserve the neighborhood high school, faces another hurdle. While waiting for  the results of the appeal, the school board has been preparing an environmental  impact report that could meet the requirements set by Vogel's order.  </P> <P> Supt. Jack Price said Wednesday that "it is unlikely but possible" that  Miraleste will be closed this fall. He said "a lot depends" on when the  environmental review process is completed.  </P> <P> Vogel ruled that despite a 1983 law that generally exempts school districts  from filing environmental reports when they close schools, the peninsula  district must consider the potential cumulative effect of multiple school  closings on the east side.  </P> <P> Her ruling barred the school board from carrying out its November, 1987,  decision to close Miraleste as part of a money-saving plan to consolidate the  district's 9,800 students on campuses in the central and west side of the  peninsula. Five other campuses on the east side have been closed in recent  years.  </P> <P> Nancy Mahr, a spokeswoman for the peninsula school system, said the district  based its appeal on the 1983 legislation that exempted school districts from  requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act. She said it appeared  unlikely that the peninsula board would carry its appeal to the state Supreme  Court.  </P> <P> The clear purpose of the 1983 law, she said, was to allow districts with  declining enrollments to close surplus schools without going through the  lengthy and costly process of preparing environmental reports.  </P> <P> However, in a unanimous decision, the three-member panel of appellate judges  focused on a related law that deals with the environmental consequences of  transferring substantial numbers of students within a school district.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Safety Issue Cited  </P> <P> About a thousand intermediate and high school students would be reassigned to  campuses in the central and western parts of the peninsula if Miraleste closes.  The parents group has contended that the safety and quality of education of  east-side students would be endangered by daily commuting over the peninsula's  rough terrain on winding roads.  </P> <P> The group has rejected several compromise proposals by the school board,  including a plan to preserve the Miraleste campus by converting it to a middle  school.  </P> <P> "Now that the appeal process is over, we're hopeful that the school board will  work with us in maintaining a quality, K-12 education program on the east  side," said Ted Gibbs, a spokesman for the Miraleste parents group. "If they  are not, then we will continue our efforts to form our own school district."  </P> <P> Those efforts are stalled in Sacramento until the State Board of Education  rules on the group's petition to secede. The agency was scheduled to take up  the issue earlier this year but decided to wait until Gov. George Deukmejian  fills four vacancies on the 11-member board.  </P> <P> Mahr said a consultant is expected to present an environmental impact report to  the peninsula school board at its June 5 meeting. That will be followed by a  45-day period for public hearings, then two weeks more for the consultant to  prepare the final report, she said.  </P> <P> The school board could then declare that it has met the requirements set by  Vogel and proceed with its plans to close Miraleste.  </P></p>

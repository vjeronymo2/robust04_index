In his toast he stressed the  shared responsibility of the international community for  resolving the problems of the former Yugoslavia and expressed  appreciation for Croatia's way of resolving humanitarian  problems. He also offered further humanitarian aid and accepted  with pleasure the Croatian minister's invitation to visit our  country.    Speaking about the agreement reached in Washington, he said  that it was very good and that it would receive positive  reactions in Norway. Croatian Minister Mate Granic then held a  news conference at which he explained the importance of the  Washington agreement. He added that within the next 10 to 15  days negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina's organization will also  start with the Bosnian Serbs. At this news conference, which  attracted a great deal of attention among Norwegian media,  Minister Granic also explained Croatia's standpoints regarding  the resolution of occupied areas in the Republic of Croatia. He  stressed that the Croatian authorities are willing to give local  autonomy to the Serbs in the protected areas as well as all  rights in keeping with international laws.    Granic stressed the importance of normalization of relations  between Zagreb and Belgrade and mutual recognition among all the  states of the former Yugoslavia. He added that this would be  impossible without the reintegration of the protected areas into  Croatia. [passage omitted]</p>

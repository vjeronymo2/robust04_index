Chugunov: "Unemployment Will Grow"] </F>   [Text] A rapid increase in unemployment is reported  by the oblast committee on labor after analyzing last year's  figures.    For the oblast as a whole, unemployment increased by a  factor  of more than 1.5 as compared with 1992. The oblast's eighteen  employment offices registered a total of 27,400 unemployed  during the year. In January, as compared with December, the  number almost doubled.    As for the rayons specifically, the ones that proved to be  in  the most alarming situation were the most industrially developed  ones. In Podporozhskiy Rayon the unemployment level passed the  10-percent mark, reaching 11.5 percent; in Tikhvinskiy Rayon it  came to 6.6 percent; in Kirishskiy Rayon, 5 percent; and in  Priozerskiy Rayon, almost 4 percent.    The rayons that proved to be in the best situation in this  regard were Luzhskoy Rayon, where 473 unemployed were  registered; and Lodeynopolskiy Rayon, 553.    Last year almost 25,000 unemployed received unemployment  benefits throughout the entire period and were unable to find  suitable work. A total of 480 persons took the risk and  underwent training or retraining in areas suggested by the  employment service, thus increasing their competitive capability  in the job market. But, unfortunately, it must be admitted that  currently there are few people like this, who are capable of  adapting to the new conditions and want to do so. A very large  number of people do not want to change their occupation, even if  the employment service pays for their retraining and gives them  a stipend during the entire training period.    Among the reasons for being unemployed, the predominant one  is "personal reasons," 44 persons. Only 24 percent are people  who were laid off from enterprises or organizations as a result  of reduction in forces, reorganization, or the elimination of  the enterprise. Sixty-two percent of the unemployed in the  oblast are women,and in Luzhskoy and Tosnenskiy rayons and in  Sosnovyy Bor, the figure is as high as 90 percent. As for age,  almost every third unemployed person is a young person between  the age of 16 and 30 years. With regard to social makeup, the  predominant group is people with working occupations (as many as  66 percent), and only 34 percent are white-collar workers.    In 1994 it is expected that the number of unemployed will  increase in most of the rayons in the oblast. And, for the labor  market as a whole, there may prove to be 37,000-57,000 persons  seeking work.    [Editorial note] At the same time the city's labor and  employment committee reports that, during the first month of  1994 (from 1 January through 4 February), 26,509 persons applied  to the rayon offices in St. Petersburg, with 10,784 doing so in  order to find a job. Only 1640 persons were deemed to be  unemployed. But, since the beginning of the year, jobs were  found for 3224 persons.</p>

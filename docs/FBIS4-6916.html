			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "First Attempt at Multilateral </F> Prescription for Employment Summit; Sense of Crisis Shared, But  Thoughts Differ"]    [Text] A meeting on employment problems (an employment  summit) was held in Detroit on 14 and 15 March and was attended  by the economic ministers of the seven leading industrial  nations. This was the first attempt to try to find a  multilateral prescription to solve the unemployment problem.  Nevertheless, it is true that "concrete policy solutions are not  easy to come up with" (Treasury Secretary Bentsen). An agreement  was made at the meeting that the employment problem will be an  important conference topic at July's leading industrial nations  meeting (the Naples summit). Japan, being criticized as  "exporting unemployment," will therefore experience even greater  pressure to open its market and to expand domestic demand.    Summarizing the two days of discussions, Treasury Secretary  Bentsen made a closing statement to the summit attendees. In it  he brought out clearly the difficulties of creating substantive  policy while there is a sense of crisis over the problems of  employment and unemployment that are common to the nations  represented.    In his introduction Bentsen pointed out that, "Creating  high-quality jobs and lowering unemployment is a common task of  (the seven leading industrial nations)." He emphasized the  importance of the seven leading industrial nations discussing  solutions to the unemployment problem on the same table. In the  background of this seems to be the frustration that, although  global economic conditions show signs of improvement, the  "unemployment rate shows no improvement at all" (Ministry of  Labor).    As for Europe, the unemployment rate exceeds 10 percent in  France, England, and Italy; the long-term unemployment among the  youth in particular is a severe problem. In the United States  the unemployment rate is above 6 percent, with the disparity in  wages widening between those at the top and those at the bottom.  Although the unemployment rate in Japan is low compared to the  other leading industrial nations, the prolonged economic slump  has made it worse.    Former Labor Minister Kondo, who advocated an employment  summit, reflected that with the nations discussing a common  topic in this fashion at a Group of Seven meeting, the finance  ministers and the governors of their central banks "tend to  focus on monetary and fiscal policies." Labor Minister  Sakaguchi, who attended the employment summit, emphasized the  significance: "It's important that there be a multilateral  position regarding employment policies based on focused  discussions."    But even with a common sense of crisis, once concrete  policymaking is underway, accommodating each leading industrial  nation's viewpoint will complicate matters, which will then get  out of control.    While noting in his closing statement that "macroeconomic  policy for changing job structures brings major results,"  Bentsen also refers to the importance of microeconomic policy,  such as "the importance of retraining workers within  enterprises," "technological innovation creates jobs," etc. His  statement is all-inclusive and that is because it is "an  amalgamation of the assertions made by each country" (Labor  Department).    In the United States, where the government traditionally  adheres to market principles and does not intervene in  employment problems, "the thinking is strong that the approach  is to create jobs and eliminate unemployment through  macroeconomic policies" (Chairman Nagano of Nikkeiren [Japan  Federation of Employers' Associations]) such as interest rate  inducements and public investment. President Clinton at the  employment summit urged "Japan to expand domestic demand and  Europe to lower interest rates." That Bentsen's statement  incorporated the importance of macroeconomic policy and the  opening of markets may be taken to show the strong disposition  of the United States at work.    On the other hand, in Europe, "Governments have a tendency  to  formulate policies that interfere excessively with business in  order to maintain current employment levels" (Ministry of  Labor). In Japan, too, because there is the issue of maintaining  the lifetime employment system, "microeconomic policy is being  given relatively serious consideration in employment  policymaking" (Labor Minister Sakaguchi).    The incorporation by Bentsen in his statement of the need  for  "the exchange of employment specialists" and "mutual research on  the employment systems of each leading industrial nation"  included the contentions of both the European Union and Japan.  "First we will need to study each country's microeconomic policy  and then learn together from the examples of successes and  failures" (Labor Minister Sakaguchi).    However, in the final analysis, they did not arrive at a  substantive plan of action just by collecting the assertions of  each nation at the summit. Of necessity, in order to continue  discussion, it was specified in Bentsen's statement that, "The  employment problem will be on the agenda at the Naples summit."    Some people indicate that "there are pitfalls." The general  view is that Detroit, the Mecca of the U.S. automobile industry,  was chosen for the employment summit "to show the people in the  United States that the U.S. administration is earnest in trying  to solve the employment problem and, at the same time, to  pressure Japan to open its markets" (MITI).    As a result, a sense of crisis has surfaced in Kasumigaseki  "Japan is made to pledge publicly to formulate effective  economic policy to expand domestic demand, deregulation, and the  opening of its markets by the time of the Naples summit."    "We were able to avoid emotional Japan-bashing and the  criticism that Japan is exporting unemployment," which was  anticipated at the beginning of the employment summit" (MITI and  the Labor Ministry). However, it was furthermore made clear that  it will not be easy to find solutions to problems of employment  and unemployment where business practices vary from country to  country. It can be anticipated that "outside pressure" on Japan  will strengthen ever more and that in preparation the government  is tasked with the heavy homework assignment of effective  macroeconomic policymaking.</p>

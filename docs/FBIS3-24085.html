			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Kovalev, under the "Municipality" </F> rubric: "The Return of People's Patrols"]    [Text] Deputy Mayor Vladimir Yakovlev proposed yesterday at  the conference in Smolnyy to transfer to businessmen free of  charge for the period of five to 10 years all flooded and  semiflooded basements in the center of the city, of which there  are currently about 1,200.    Vladimir Yakovlev also intends to attract investors from the  business community to restoration of 180,000 square meters of  city-owned condemned residential space on the terms of giving  them 20 percent of the restored residential space. The mayoralty  currently is preparing a directive on investor support for the  reconstruction of 51 houses. The mayoralty also had plans to  direct 56 billion rubles into reconstruction of 46 more  buildings. No money has yet been appropriated from the budget,  however.    The next urgent topic that has brought about a lively  discussion among heads of administrations was the problem of  property registration in the residential sphere. (According to  information received from competent sources, 13 murders have  been recorded in Petersburg stemming from disputes that have  emerged during registration.) On 1 March a directive was issued  liquidating design and inventory bureaus (DIB), which until then  had been in charge of these matters. Anatoliy Sobchak did not  like the fact that DIB's were commercial organizations,  joint-stock companies, and state enterprises all at the same  time. The mayor intends to transfer the registration function to  the mayoralty's residential housing committee.    Another subject discussed at the conference in Smolnyy was  the crime situation. A decision was made to resurrect people's  patrols. There are currently 397 people's patrol detachments  [PND] in the city. The mayoralty's administrative organs  department will conduct the people's patrols training through  its rayon branches. Meanwhile, the Smolnyy is drafting the  procedures for remuneration of PND members.    Representatives of the Petersburg City Administration of  Internal Affairs presented at the conference a report on  combating illegal production of alcoholic beverages; they  reported that on 27 February they uncovered at the medical  preparations plant a "factory" that replaced the labels on Iskra  glass cleaner with those of the Zvezda Rossii vodka trademark.</p>

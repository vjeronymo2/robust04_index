			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> LAX GIRDS FOR HOLIDAY GRIDLOCK  </P> <P> Police at Los Angeles International Airport today braced for late-afternoon and  evening gridlock at the huge facility, as the Thanksgiving holiday period moves  into full swing.  </P> <P> An estimated 681,000 passengers are expected to pass through LAX during the  five-day period, which began today.  </P> <P> "(But) traffic has been moving smoothly all morning, and we've had no  problems," said airport police Sgt. Vince Garcia.  </P> <P> "We have a maximum turnout of traffic officers and we have at least three  officers directing movement of vehicles in front of each terminal," he said.  </P> <P> Airport Manager Stephen Yee said the estimated holiday crowd represents a 4%  increase over the 1989 five-day period.  </P> <P> Officials urged travelers to allow twice the usual amount of time just to get  to the airport and to set aside extra time for long baggage and check-in  counter lines and at passenger screening points.  </P></p>

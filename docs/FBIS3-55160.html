			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From ELTA "NEWS BULLETIN" No. 408] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, Jan 5 -- The right-wing opposition leader  Vytautas Landsbergis made a statement concerning the official  request for the membership in NATO:    "I hope that the West will notice the letter and request by  Lithuanian president and Lithuania will stand next to Poland not  only in the map, but in the list of candidates for NATO as well.  Nobody can protest against that. We are striving for stability  and security and this causes neither danger nor humiliation for  anybody.    I also see that Lithuania's wish to become a member of NATO  and its request do not contradict the agreement on Partnership  For Peace. But the agreement on partnership will not serve as a  substitute for conditions which should be fulfilled by Lithuania  in order to become a member of NATO. This complies with the  agreement on European security initiated by France and  maintained by European Union.    It is very important that the process of peace and European  consolidation in the Baltic region should not be disturbed by  any non-democratic imperialistic forces".</p>

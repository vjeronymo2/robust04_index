			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ulrich Rosenbaum: "British Veto Triggers Severe </F> Crisis in EU"]    [Excerpts] Bonn -- Following the failed attempt to appoint  a new European Commission president at the summit on the Greek  island of Corfu due to the British Government's stubbornness,  government circles in Bonn are preparing to have to find a  completely new candidate to succeed outgoing Jacques Delors.  [passage omitted]    Bonn says that Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl wants to stick  to the candidate of his choice for the time being; but as yet,  Kohl has not found a solution for the special summit either.  Bonn circles regard former Belgian Prime Minister Wifried  Martens as a "hot tip." The 58-year-old Flemish Christian  Democrat is chairman of the European People's Party.    Members of the delegation accompanying Kohl to the Corfu  summit say that Major probably rejected Dehaene mainly because  he fears he might promote European integration too much for  Britain's liking. Following the devastating defeat Major's  Conservative Party suffered in the European elections, the prime  minister's statement that he will not change his mind over the  next four weeks is considered credible. Kohl, therefore, does  not want to provoke the British Government, but rather to try to  have intensive talks with London in order to find a joint  solution.</p>

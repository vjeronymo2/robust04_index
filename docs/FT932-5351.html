			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Peace plan may stop BA strike early A PEACE plan may end today's strike at British Airways a few hours after it has begun. The plan was negotiated last night between British Airways and the TGWU transport union to guarantee the future security of cabin crews and ground staff who were called out on a 24-hour strike for today. Mr George Wright, the union's civil aviation negotiator, said that it was too late to call off the strike, but today at 10am the peace formula would be recommended to a meeting of union shop stewards at BA. He said the proposals, reached after long negotiations, would provide a 'new relationship between BA and the TGWU'. Union officials said they hoped disruption to flights today would be 'minimal'. The strike was called over alleged cuts in pay and fringe benefits in BA's subsidiaries. The airline's 250 white-collar supervisory, clerical and passenger service staff are also due to strike at Gatwick airport today. In a separate development, pilots at BA have voted by a five-to-one majority in a secret postal ballot to take strike action. In a 92 per cent turnout, the pilots voted 2,152 in favour with only 402 against. If the pilots strike all BA's 207 long-and short-haul craft would be grounded. Balpa, the pilots' union, estimates that BA would suffer Pounds 16m in lost fares for each strike day. Mr Chris Darke, the union's general secretary, said last night the ballot result showed 'the depth of ill-feeling among our members'. Mr Darke added: 'The massive response and overwhelming majority for strike action indicates pilots are deeply dissatisfaction with the way BA are seeking to impose changes without agreement.' Mr Darke said he had written to Mr Robert Ayling, BA's chief executive, demanding an immediate resumption of talks. The union is concerned at what it sees as the company's attempt to divide pilots by introducing separate contracts of employment in its Gatwick subsidiary, which was set up last November after BA's takeover of Dan Air. Pilots in the subsidiary are paid 30 per cent less than those elsewhere in the airline.</p>

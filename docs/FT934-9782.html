			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Angry Ferranti holders form group DISGRUNTLED Ferranti shareholders, concerned about GEC's proposed 1p a share bid for the troubled defence electronics group, plan to form a shareholders' association to obtain independent professional advice on the offer and to represent their views. The association is being formed by Mr John Katz, an investment consultant who has emerged as the central figure in the discontented Ferranti ranks. He has also gained support among other shareholders. 'Following newspaper comment that I was looking at the proposed GEC offer for certain shareholders, I have been besieged by shareholders wanting to be part of a concerted group,' Mr Katz said. More than 400 shareholders, representing about 20m shares, had contacted him so far. Mr Katz, who runs the investment research consultancy John Katz &amp; Associates, said yesterday that the planned Ferranti shareholders' association would have a number of objectives including obtaining all necessary information on the merits of GEC's Pounds 10.1m offer. This would involve establishing independent values for Ferranti's fixed and intangible assets, including its Pounds 172m order book, putting a value on the group's operating subsidiaries and obtaining commercial valuations for other intangible assets including the group's unutilised tax losses. The association would also deal with the Ferranti directors and their advisers as a group representing a significant stake in the company 'with a view to coming into an active negotiating position to achieve a 'stay in' position with a chance of recovery for all or part of members holdings'.</p>

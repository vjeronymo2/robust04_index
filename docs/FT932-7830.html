			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Spending choices TO PARAPHRASE one of its ministers, Mr John Major's cabinet should come clean about just how deep a hole it is in. The government is heading for the largest primary budget deficit in peacetime. Its commendable target is to cut the borrowing requirement, expected to reach Pounds 50bn this year, from 8 per cent of gross domestic product to 3.75 per cent in 1997-98. If the rate of economic recovery is rapid, some of this may be achieved without pain. Revenue from taxation would then rise sharply while the demand for social security payments fell. Some of the shortfall in revenue could be met by further increases in taxation, but this the government is understandably anxious to avoid. The remaining option is deep cuts in spending. A strong government would set out its stall thus, and invite the public to accept the consequences. The administration moves from flap to exasperation, as it did yesterday over suggestions that the Treasury was pressing for the withdrawal of the National Health Service from dental care and the scrapping of free prescriptions for all but the poorest. To his credit, Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has been graphic in his delineation of the problem, but necessarily cagey about possible solutions. The trouble arose when talk of NHS cuts stole headlines from a prime minister who had spent a day working on restoring his authority after Maastricht. On Wednesday Mr Portillo said that something would have to give. At question time yesterday Mr Major read out a long prepared answer which suggested that, while everything remained open, the idea of making worse-off pensioners and parents of sick children pay for their prescriptions could not have been further from his thoughts. Fine, but he should have explained that the deficit could not be tackled without some inroads being made into previously sacrosanct areas, although he could not yet say which ones. That would be a reasonable if tough line to take. Mr Portillo has been given until next March or April to find and negotiate long-term reductions in public spending. There will be plenty of interdepartmental infighting between now and then. An interim result can be expected in the autumn, when the expenditure limits for 1994-95 are announced. Genuine reductions should at that time be demanded of most departments. Will the government be able to make them stick? In the present climate there can be little confidence that it will. A government reversal of policy is no longer a surprise. The Conservatives are divided; their majority is small; the house is fractious. The cabinet cannot always have its way; any rebellious dozen of its supposed supporters can prevent it from doing almost anything. The budget deficit is too serious a matter to be left to these parliamentary high-jinks. Mr Major must spell this out, and thereby reassert his leadership.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME says goodbye to sterling THE LONDON Metal Exchange today ends a tradition dating back 110 years. Copper, its 'flagship' contract, which since 1883 has been quoted in sterling during the twice-daily open outcry sessions in the 'ring' and in kerb (after hours) trading, will instead be quoted in US dollars. Lead, quoted in sterling since the contract was launched in 1903, is also switched to dollars. Mr David King, LME chief executive, said yesterday the changes 'reflect the needs and wishes of our industrial clients and our members.' All other long-running LME contracts - for primary aluminium, nickel, tin and zinc - have been changed in recent years for the same reasons and the latest, for aluminium alloy, was launched as a dollar contract. However, LME members previously had resolutely stood out against changing the copper and lead contracts even though most physical transactions as well as pre-market and inter-office business was conducted in dollars. Some traders claimed trading in sterling often provided opportunities to make extra profit from arbitrage and foreign exchange transactions. Minds were changed during last November's turmoil in currency markets, which resulted in the UK's withdrawal from the European Community's exchange rate mechanism. Dealers complained that trading virtually ground to a halt at that time because it was impossible to convert sterling prices into dollars on forward contracts. When the LME held a poll, 70 per cent voted in favour of switching copper and lead to dollars. Mr King said that the exchange had made arrangements to provide a daily sterling quote for copper and lead contracts that still had some time to run. The London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) today changes its name back to London Commodities Exchange (LCE).</p>

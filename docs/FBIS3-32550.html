			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colombian Senator Enrique Gomez Hurtado, of </F> the National Salvation Movement, by unidentified reporter; place  not given; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast--live]    [Text] [Reporter] We greet Senator Enrique Gomez Hurtado  this morning. Mr. Gomez, what is your opinion of the  explanation given by President Cesar Gaviria yesterday regarding  the presence of U.S. troops in Junachaco, Valle Department?    [Gomez] Undoubtedly, once again we have not been given an  explanation. What the president said yesterday is that he is  unwilling to tell us what the hell the Americans are doing in  Juanchaco. As you know, the Presidency's Legal Secretariat has  sent me....    [Reporter, interrupting] A letter.    [Gomez] A very strange letter, in which one paragraph  explicitly states the members of Congress have no right to  question the truth of government statements. I believe this  letter is unique in the democratic world. This totally rules  out the possibility that the delegates of public opinion have  knowledge of what the government is doing.    In my opinion, those very recent agreements signed by the  defense minister clearly violate the Constitution, because these  matters are clearly the responsibility of the congressional  Second Commission and plenum. Here, we are dealing with  clandestine treaties. As you well know, international treaties  are above the Constitution, but for their approval and  signature, the Constitution establishes certain requirements.  These treaties were signed in secret; besides, they took  advantage of the fact that the congressional plenum was not  assembled to do what they are doing over there; of course, this  is not a matter of the building of little schools. Not one  Colombian has believed that story [words indistinct].    [Reporter] If they are not building little schools, what are  they doing?    [Gomez] This is what we all are asking; besides, we are also  asking what right do the Presidency of the Republic, the Defense  Ministry, and the Military High Command have to systematically  lie to us? They are throwing a smoke screen. Just because we  are now in preelection times we cannot criticize the government.  We are then accused of demagoguery. They are using a  circumstance as an election issue. The problem is the  circumstance is very serious.    [Reporter] If the congressmen and reporters cannot go over  there and see what they are doing, question, investigate what is  going on, then who in Colombia can?    [Gomez] That is precisely the question we are all asking. I  believe as soon as the congressional sessions open, this will be  the first debate that must be broached. They are also telling  us it was wrong to criticize the use of the presidential plane  for a party, that we are using this as an election tool. Now,  what else can we expect? Just because we are in the midst of a  preelection period, we have no right to criticize anything;  therefore, the government has the right to do everything it  pleases.    I believe we are completely distorting political actions,  and  above all we are seriously trampling Congress' jurisdiction.  This is a situation of, shall we say, information dictatorship  similar to Finance Minister Hommes' fiscal dictatorship. The  situation is very touchy.    [Reporter] President Gaviria says he does not understand why  everyone is surprised by the U.S. forces' presence here, as this  has been going on for the past 50 years.    [Gomez] Look, I am not one to shield myself behind the flag  to say: Gringo go home! Not at all. The matter is that one  cannot lie. President Nixon lost the Presidency for a much less  serious lie than the one they are perpetually telling us. It  does not bother me that they are there, but we should be told  what they are doing.    One cannot authorize the passing of troops with all the  elements of the passing of troops based on agreements that grant  everything described, from a military point of view, as the  passing of foreign troops [sentence as heard]. All of this was  done behind Congress' back; furthermore, the goals of those  passing troops are systematically denied. If they had told us,  we probably would have approved their presence. I am not saying  this is good or bad. What is [word indistinct] is clandestine.  Clandestine matters allow public opinion to imagine whatever it  wants. Usually, whatever is hidden is bad.</p>

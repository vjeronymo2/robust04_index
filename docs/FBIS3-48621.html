			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Frank Longid Jr.] </F>   [Excerpt] Heavily armed communist rebels raided a police  detachment in Tarlac Saturday morning, capturing several assault  rifles and assorted firearms, according to reports reaching the  National Police operations center. A policeman, Police Officer  3 Leody Ray Lumibao, and a militia man, Alfredo Lorenzo, were  seriously wounded in the attack.    Political analysts considered the attack as significant  since  it was the first time that communist rebels mounted such an  operation after their retreat to their mountain sanctuaries  years ago. The communist-led New People's Army (NPA) was  founded in Cepa, Tarlac, in March 1969 and it opted to use the  Central Plains as a support base rather than a target for rebel  attacks.    The reports said the rebels, numbering about 35, attacked  the  police detachment in Iba, San Jose, Tarlac, at about 7:45 A.M.  At least four of the raiders were believed wounded in the  exchange of fire. The rebels raided the detachment using two  passenger jeepneys commandeered in San Jose, Tarlac, the reports  said. The drivers, Nicolas Apan and Pedro Balagtas, have been  held for "tactical interrogation" at the Tarlac PNP [Philippine  National Police] headquarters. Four M-14 assault rifles, one  M-16, four M-1 Garand rifles and one carbine were taken by the  rebels from the policemen.    The PNP's 181st Mobile Force Company (MFC) is pursuing the  withdrawing rebels, while the 185th MFC has set up a blocking  force at the Capas-San Jose and the San Jose-Mayantoc boundaries.    Earlier, defense and military officials said that the  government can achieve "strategic victory" within this year,  claiming that the military has already regained control over  several barangays [villages] formerly controlled by the CPP  [Communist Party of the Philippines]-NPA.    The communist movement has suffered major setbacks after the  popular revolt against the Marcos regime. It is currently being  wracked by a major internal crisis.

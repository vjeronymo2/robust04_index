			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Belfast Europa closes THE Belfast Europa, one of the world's most bombed hotels, closed yesterday after being in receivership for more than two years, Jimmy Burns writes. In its 22-year history the Europa (pictured as it is now and, inset, after the last IRA bombing, in May this year) has suffered more than 30 terrorist attacks. Stoy Hayward, the receivers, said the hotel had been bought for about Pounds 7m by a local hotel chain, the Hastings Group. It was hoped that it would be reopened in about six months' time. However, its future remains in the balance. The receivers, the hotel chain and the government are apparently still haggling over the amount of bomb-damage compensation to be included in the sale price. Hotel staff are awaiting information on redundancy terms. The receivers have been running the hotel at a considerable loss since the last bomb attack forced the closure of over half its rooms. Several international hotel chains including Forte, Hilton International and Holiday Inn had expressed an interest at an early stage but subsequently lost interest.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading ANOTHER busy day in stock index futures saw a strong opening peter out into retreat as the market turned its attention back to the worries over the economy, writes Christopher Price. After Wednesday's good performance and a sharply higher Wall Street overnight, the September FT-SE contract started brightly at 2,447 and rose to reach 2,454. However, this proved to be the high point of the day as BZW, which had been a big buyer over the past two days, resorted to profit-taking. September went into retreat as the market returned to its gloomy prognosis on the economic outlook, with comments from the Bundesbank chairman that German interest rate cuts are unlikely in the foreseeable future dominating sentiment. With gilts and short sterling both weak, September's slow decline, albeit punctuated by technical rallies, continued throughout the afternoon. The contract closed at 2,425, down 20 points from Wednesday, and at only a one-point premium to estimated fair value. Turnover was a steady 9,226 lots. ICI dominated traded options in an otherwise quiet day. The chemicals group recorded 4,486 contracts out of a day's total of 20,783.</p>

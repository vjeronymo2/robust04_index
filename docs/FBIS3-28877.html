			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 12 (KCNA) -- The North side  headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for  the Country's Reunification Friday made public a statement today  condemning the South Korean puppet clique for suppressing the  patriotic turnout of peasants and students against rice market  opening.    The powerful massive struggle of South Korean peasants and  students, largest in scale after the appearance of the "civilian  government", was an explosion of the indignation and grievances  against the group of Kim Yong-sam, the traitor for all ages,  which is trying to extend its power by selling off the vital  rights of the people and a just patriotic action for defending  the dignity and interests of the nation, the statement said, and  went on:    The Kim Yong-sam group of anti-national hooligans is heading  for more grave crimes by resorting to a sanguinary repression  against innocent peasants and students who have risen up against  the treacherous opening of the rice market.    And the traitor Kim Yong-sam, in conspiracy with the United  States, is going to raise all over South Korea a row of  deployment of "Patriot" missiles. This is an extension of the  move to open the rice market and its enlarged version.    All the facts show that, with the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique  left in power, the lives of the South Korean people, let alone  their vital rights, cannot be preserved and no one can vouch  that the whole nation may not suffer a horrible disaster.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam must settle his crimes against the  nation and face a stern judgement by history as demanded by the  people.</p>

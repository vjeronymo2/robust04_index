			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Tambrands takes Dollars 20m restructure charge TAMBRANDS, the troubled US tampons manufacturer which earlier this month ousted its chief executive, said yesterday it would take a Dollars 20m charge against second-quarter earnings to cover cost-cutting and restructuring moves. The company also confirmed it had called in Russell Reynolds Associates, the recruitment consultants, to search for a new chief executive. The former incumbent, Mr Martin Emmett, was ousted by Tambrands' directors at the beginning of June, as the company announced second-quarter earnings would be 'significantly below' last time's 72 cents a share. Tambrands also said that full-year profits would fall short of 1992's Dollars 3.06 a share. It blamed competitive pressures, increased marketing costs, and a reduction and liquidation of stores' stocks. However, Tambrands said yesterday that directors had made no decision to sell the company. There has been speculation in the US that the board was considering seeking a buyer, and Johnson &amp; Johnson, the drugs and healthcare products group, has been named as a possible suitor. 'The steps we are taking reflect our determination to address operational issues and to improve the company's ongoing profitability,' said Mr Howard Wentz, Tambrands' chairman. Shares in Tambrands fell Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 45 3/8 in New York yesterday. The shares have slumped from around Dollars 65 at the beginning of the year, and, although they rallied slightly on rumours of the acquisition possibility, they are still close to the 52-week low of Dollars 39 1/2.</p>

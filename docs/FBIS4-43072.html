			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Daniel Vernet: "Russia at the Borders of the </F> European Union"]    [Text] Finland's entry in the European Community presents  new strategic problems for the West.    With the affiliation of Central and East European countries  with the Western European Union (WEU), agreed upon on Monday, 9  May, in Brussels, West Europe is widening its sphere of  responsibility in terms of security. But there is no need to  wait for the possible expansion of the European Union [EU] to  the east to take into account a new strategic deal. The  expansion now proceeding with Austria, Finland, Norway, and  Sweden is already introducing a profound change. In fact, the  EU, for the first time in its history, will have an extended  common border with Russia when Finland becomes a full-fledged  member. To be sure, there is yet another possible contact point  between these two great entities of the Old Continent, it is on  the Kola Peninsula, where NATO -- through the intermediary of  Norway -- and the former USSR challenged one another for a long  time. But the likelihood of membership in the EU is greater for  Finland than Norway, and the hundreds of kilometers that run  from the Nordkyn Cape to Vyborg represent an unprecedented  geopolitical reality. Having an extended common border with  Russia should lead the EU to think differently about its  security policy.    To begin with, this reality greatly weakens the argument of  those who, in the name of a pan-European vision including  Russia, object to expansion of the Community to the east;  according to them, a new demarcation line should not be drawn in  Europe following the disappearance of the Iron Curtain. This  refusal would be a new exclusion line leaving Russia -- and  Russia alone -- outside the integration process. Would what is  valid for Poland not be therefore valid for Finland? Why would a  border between the Union and the Russian world passing over the  Bug River be more discriminatory than the Finnish-Russian  border? Would it not be due to Warsaw's former membership in the  socialist camp? Which would be the equivalent of recognizing a  special Russian right of inspection over its former satellites,  and therefore of acknowledging a rather sweeping concept of what  Moscow calls the "nearby foreigner." The fact remains that the  idea of a "gray zone," belonging to neither East nor West, a  sort of buffer zone between Europe and Russia that the Kremlin  is sometimes tempted to maintain, has no longer the same power  with the entry of Helsinki in the European Community.  Undoubtedly, during the Cold War, Finland also held a position  all its own. Often, the term "Finlandization" was used wrongly  with a disparaging connotation to convey the neutrality of a  country with a market economy having good neighbor relations  with the USSR. It might have been interpreted differently:  Without belonging to NATO, which would then have been contrary  to that neutrality and seen as a provocation by its powerful  neighbor, Finland benefited in a way from an unspoken guarantee  of security on the part of the West.    Finland was not in the zone covered by NATO, but the latter  would not have accepted the application of the Brezhnev doctrine  to the former.    Membership in the Union is going to transform this  guarantee;  from unexpressed, it will become specific, and there lies the  great geostrategic novelty linked to the existence of a common  European-Russian border. The change will not occur in one day.  Finland will have to reconcile its tradition of neutrality with  its integration into West Europe. By applying for membership in  the Union, Finland, pending a positive referendum outcome, has  accepted all rights and duties, including the Maastricht  Treaty's commitments pertaining to foreign policy and joint  security.    But the opposite is also true. The EU makes a commitment to  Finland by accepting its candidacy; the former offers the latter  the same protection that is offered all its members. The joint  defense policy ultimately implies a participation in the WEU,  therefore the security guarantee and the aid of the other  members as called for in Article 5 of its charter in case of  aggression. But this guarantee itself is valid only insofar as  it is strengthened by NATO reassurance, that is to say, in the  final analysis, by the United States. This aspect of European  defense policy worries Washington. Last January, the Americans  rejected the expansion of NATO to the east and proposed instead  the Partnership for Peace [PFP], in order, to be sure, not to  offend the Russians, but above all, so as not to have to give  the new states the security guarantees available to the 16 NATO  members (Finland and Sweden signed the outline agreement  pertaining to the PFP on 9 May).    As it stands, the Americans feel that the expansion of the  EU  and the Central European countries' plans for association with  the WEU, launched by the French and German foreign ministers and  implemented early this week, are equivalent to secretly creating  new pretenders to the NATO umbrella. The Americans also feel  that these projects are liable to ultimately leave them with a  fait accompli. It is a difficult dilemma, for the United States  can no more accept being forced indirectly by Europe to  guarantee the security of new countries through an association  with or a membership in the WEU than the Europeans can give the  Americans a right of veto over candidates for Community  membership. To insist on the significance of this  European-Russian "new border" is neither to fear nor, all the  more so, to predict troubles between Finland and Russia, that is  to say, border incidents challenging the security of a (future)  EU member and forcing its partners to fly to its aid.    Nothing can be excluded in a Europe where all the borders  have started shifting again. There were many territorial  conflicts between Finland and Russia prior to 1945. Yet, during  the process of dissolution of the USSR, and despite the  centrifugal forces working within Russia itself, the formerly  Finnish Karelia has remained remarkably calm.    Everything seems to indicate that these Scandinavian borders  should not be the first objective of a Eurocorps in the making.  Therefore, it is less a question of existing fears than of  questions about an important upheaval on the European scene. We  have barely begun to measure the consequences of such an  upheaval on a European Community built patiently over a 30-year  period and sheltered by the Berlin Wall. It involves a new  geography of the continent. Without waiting for the next stages,  the current expansion shifts Europe's center of gravity toward  the East and its zones of violence. For Helsinki is not the only  one involved: Vienna -- another newcomer to the Union -- is  closer to Ukraine than to the western border of Austria.</p>

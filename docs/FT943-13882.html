			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / UK trade with Malaysia grows Trade between Britain and Malaysia grew in the first quarter of this year despite a Malaysian government ban on British companies. Malaysia's exports to Britain rose to 1.26bn ringgit (Pounds 315m) in the first quarter of the year from 1.08bn ringgit for the same period last year. Mr Rafidah Aziz, Malaysian trade and industry minister, told parliament that both countries were taking steps to enhance bilateral trade. The Malaysian government banned British companies from government contracts in February in reaction to what it saw as negative press reports in Britain. Mr Rafidah said that during the first quarter of the year, nine projects involving joint ventures with British companies were approved.</p>

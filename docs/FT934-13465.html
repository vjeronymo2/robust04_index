			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Metsa-Serla in the black with FM112m METSA-SERLA, one of Finland's leading forestry groups, swung to a FM112m (Dollars 19.7m) profit in the first eight months from a FM169m loss in the same 1992 period despite persistent overcapacity in many of its markets, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. The group is confident of 'a clear profit' for the full year, after 1992's FM290m deficit, although market conditions are forecast to remain difficult. Sales rose 7.2 per cent to FM5.34bn from FM5.03bn in the first eight months, leading the group to predict full-year sales of more than FM8bn. Operating profit was FM616m, or 11.4 per cent of net sales, compared with FM345m, or 6.9 per cent of sales, last time.</p>

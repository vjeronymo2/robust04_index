			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian tomato experiment ready to bear fruit - Shiraz Sidhva on a PepsiCo project that is helping Punjabi growers to produce more At Zahura, a village in Punjab's Hoshiarpur district, PepsiCo fully-automated tomato processing plant is a riot of red as lorry loads of luscious fruit are pulverised into paste. This is not only Asia's biggest food processing plant - with a capacity of 650 tonnes a day - but also a test case for the potential of India's nascent food processing industry, which has attracted domestic and foreign investment worth over Rs300bn (Pounds 6.35bn) in the past two years, more than any other sector except power. Pepsi, which started operations in India two years before the country embarked on its liberalisation programme in July 1991, was forced to meet a large export obligation; and the American multinational turned that obligation into an interesting agricultural experiment that the company hopes will yield profits soon. Never having built a processing plant on such a large scale before, the company had to devise it from scratch. 'We went through a very expensive and long learning curve, with no validated data to help us,' explains Mr RPS Dhaliwal, plant manager of Pepsi Foods, the company's Indian subsidiary. That was five years ago. Today, the plant exports 80 per cent of its 40,000 tonnes-a-year production. It also supplies the Indian subsidiaries of Nestle and Unilever, for their domestic ketchup brands. When Pepsi started its Indian operations it faced tremendous hostility from politicians and farmers alike, especially when the company chose to build the plant in the Punjab, India's most prosperous agricultural state. Critics felt strongly that the multinational would exploit farmers in the region for its own commercial gain. Today, however, those farmers are very happy to sell their tomatoes to the factory. Mr Hoshiar Singh, who farms nearby in Tanda, says tomato growers in Sirsa and Tohana who supply Pepsi are pleased with the way the company deals with them. According to him, the region has benefitted from better farming techniques introduced by the company. 'It may be true that a big company makes a lot more money than we do,' he says. 'But they have taught us how to increase our yield and the commercial gain is bound to benefit us all.' The plant, which was built quite cheaply, at a cost of Rs220m, buzzes with activity during the 65-day season beginning at the end of April, when it runs to full capacity. Pepsi's biggest challenge at the moment is to make use of the plant's capacity outside this short season. It is trying to add ten days to the season by getting supplies from the mountainous Himachal Pradesh state bordering Punjab and hopes to develop new techniques to extend it to 110 days. Recently it has diversified into red chilli paste, producing 2,000 tonnes a year for export. The Pepsi Agro Food Processing Research Institute has taught its suppliers new cultivation and disease-prevention techniques, helping them to increase yields from 25 to 30 tonnes a hectare and ensuring that the tomatoes conform to international standards of colour, texture and flavour. Two years ago, Pepsi, to use a senior manager's words, 'went berserk' trying to work out a system whereby farmers would bring only as many tomatoes as could be processed each day. 'They would land up at the factory with far more tomatoes than we needed on a particular day and insist we bought them,' says Mr Muktesh Pant, executive director, exports, now in charge of Pepsi's Season's Harvest fruit juice venture. But Mr Dhaliwal says that the problems have been overcome. An in-house nursery provides control over the phasing of tomatoes. 'We have fine-tuned ourselves to such an extent, that we now issue quota slips specifying quantities and dates of supply. Our payment system ensures that farmers get paid at their homes on every 10th day.' The company says it is not yet making profits. 'But we have maintained our tomato prices over the last two years,' says Mr Dhaliwal. Pepsi's plans include using the plant to produce apple and pear puree when the tomato season is over. It has spent Rs15m to upgrade its facilities, introducing a small dehydration unit for apples and mushrooms. The fully-automated plant, imported mostly from Italy, needs not more than three to four people to operate it. And increased utilisation remains Pepsi's top priority.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Thatcher bows out to a kiss and Tory cheers MRS Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, received a salvo of cheers from ministers and Tory backbenchers, and a kiss on the hand from Mr Bernard Weatherill, the Speaker, when she bowed out of the Commons yesterday. She took her seat at 9.30am, when MPs assembled for the last time before the general election, and kept in touch with developments over the next six hours as the timetable for the final ceremony was repeatedly rearranged. MPs dispatched five bills in as many minutes, in the process giving blanket approval to 126 clauses and 22 schedules of the Friendly Societies Bill, and disregarding - after momentarily overlooking  - an infringement of the Commons' privileges by the Lords. Peers were in less haste to clear the legislative decks. To the irritation of MPs, debates on the Finance Bill, the Army Bill, the Friendly Societies Bill and the Museums and Galleries Bill took far longer than expected. MPs twice assembled, expecting to be summoned to the Lords for the prorogation ceremony - the preliminary process before the dissolution of parliament - only to be told that the Upper House was not yet ready to receive them. An exasperated Mr Tony Banks, the Labour MP for Newham north-west, bellowed: 'Thank God we are going to abolish them.' When Admiral Sir Richard Thomas, the gentleman usher of the Black Rod, finally arrived to summon the Commons to the Lords, Mr Ron Brown, the Labour MP for Leith, made a vain attempt to impose a further delay on the proceedings. Ministers paid their own special tribute to Mrs Thatcher by allowing her to take precedence over the other occupants of the government front bench and follow Mr John MacGregor, the leader of the House, as he led MPs in bidding farewell to the speaker, to the cheers of Tories. There were further cheers for the Father of the House, Sir Bernard Braine, who is also standing down. Mr Banks, a wildlife campaigner, presented the Speaker with a toy badger, which Mr Weatherill lifted towards the galleries before leaving the chamber for the last time.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Leather under strain in a bitter tug-of-war: The fight for control of Gucci The battle for Gucci, the Italian luxury goods group, is like two shoppers fighting over an expensive bag at a Knightsbridge sale. Although outwardly genteel, they soon cast good manners aside as determination to prevent the other getting the prize overtakes any interest in the article itself. That is the tug-of-war now taking place between Mr Maurizio Gucci, grandson of the man who founded the company in 1922, and Investcorp, the Bahrain-based merchant bank, with which he shares control. In the middle is the famous brand, best known for its hand-crafted bags, shoes and leatherware. As the battle enters its second week and writs and counter-actions start to fly, it looks increasingly as if Gucci itself, like the squabbled-over sale item, will come out worse for wear. The company is no stranger to controversy. In the mid-1980s, Mr Gucci fought a bitter battle with some of his cousins, sons of the founder's three heirs, to streamline control. 'At the time, Gucci was a loosely run empire, in which ownership of many operations was fragmented between family fiefdoms, although my father owned 50 per cent stakes in everything,' he said in an interview with the FT last week. In October 1990, the campaign was finally concluded when Maurizio Gucci won a high court injunction in London against his cousin Paolo, preventing him from using the Gucci name commercially. The latest battle looks more serious. First, the stakes are much higher. Investcorp, which has started legal action in New York to force Mr Gucci out of office, paid an estimated Dollars 170m to build up its 50 per cent holding - at the height of the luxury goods market. Gucci has turned out to be a poor investment. Although classic products such as its famous loafers continue to sell well, group turnover dropped from a peak of L299bn (Pounds 125m) in the year to January 31 1991 to L225bn in each of the last two years. This year, sales are expected to recover marginally to L256bn. Net losses deteriorated to L38bn in 1991-92. Last year the deficit was cut, but still totalled L25bn. The picture is clouded by trading difficulties in the US, Gucci's biggest market outside Italy. Earnings at Gucci America have plunged because of recession and the shift away from ostentatious consumption. Losses rose to L29bn last year and no turnround is expected this year. The second reason for acrimony is that Gucci, like some of the special skins from which its shoes and bags are made, is one of a increasingly rare breed of independent luxury goods marques. Unlike others, such as Dunhill or Louis Vuitton, it is not part of a big conglomerate. Although no longer entirely in the hands of a single founding family, as in the case of its rivals Prada and Ferragamo, ownership of the Gucci name is a prize worth fighting for. Mr Beppe Modenese, an Italian fashion guru, says he has never known a crisis as severe as that now facing famous manufacturers. Some smaller names may even go under. But provided the marques cut costs and reorganise, they should weather the storm. Such strong action could be impossible given Gucci's present ownership structure, which splits power evenly between Mr Gucci and Investcorp. Mr Gucci says the gap between them is unbridgeable because of different views of what Gucci represents. He presents himself as a businessman, dedicated to upholding the company's traditional values, versus the cold-blooded financiers, who would sell their stake tomorrow for a turn. 'Just look what they did with Tiffany,' the US luxury goods brand bought and subsequently floated by the merchant bank. Mr Gucci claims his ability to initiate a streamlining plan for the group is proof of his managerial skills. He says the reversal of the financial slide indicates his strategy of trimming the product lines, concentrating on higher margin items and reducing the number of outlets to restore the brand's lustre. 'The number of items and stores has fallen, but Gucci has regained the up-market image that was in danger of being lost.' He warns that a lengthy battle with Investcorp could return Gucci to the destructive state of the late 1980s, when, blocked by family wranglings, it failed to note warning signals in the market. Mr Gucci's critics, who include not just Investcorp but Italian and Swiss bankers concerned about the group's financial position, see things differently. Investcorp says Mr Gucci is highly mercurial and has little business sense. They argue that he has failed to act on the business plan hammered out four years ago when Investcorp first became his partner. For example, they say, Mr Gucci has consistently failed 'to present a budget which makes any sense or which could be passed by the board'. While he might make an ideal titular chairman or marketing chief, he is not the right man to run the company, especially in a deep recession. The bank's most serious accusation is that he contravened the complex shareholding agreements between them. Typically, given Gucci's litigious history, the issue of the shareholding pact is highly complex and arcane. Broadly speaking, the pact gives either side the right of first refusal to its partner's shares. Earlier this year, Mr Gucci faced unspecified financial problems, which required him to obtain a loan, thought to be of SFr25m (Pounds 11m). A technical dispute over whether Mr Gucci pledged some or all of his shares in return for the money, since repaid, is at the heart of Investcorp's legal action. It claims it had the right to buy the shares from Mr Gucci before they were given as collateral. Mr Gucci denies the shares were ever pledged to the bank. 'I made use of all my resources' as collateral, he says. 'But control of the shares was never given up, even for a second.' Mr Gucci has now offered to resolve the dispute by either buying out Investcorp's stake, or selling it his own holding. 'Let's put our offers in two sealed envelopes. Whoever makes the higher offer wins.' However, the proposal is disingenuous. Within seconds of the proposal, he added: 'But they can't expect me to pay the sort of price they want, and they can't imagine I'd be prepared to give all this up for the much smaller amount of money they think they can get it for.' In the meantime, decision-making at the group is paralysed as the battle shifts from the boardroom to the courts.</p>

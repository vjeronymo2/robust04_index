			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Istanbul JAMANAK and MARMARA in Armenian  report on their front pages on 11 November that a year-old  dispute between Armenian schools and the Turkish Ministry of  Education ended with a final decision from the Ministry of  Education (Decree No. 434 dated 23 September 1993) declaring  that "all subjects, except Armenian language, will be taught in  Turkish" in Armenian schools. The papers report that Armenian  parents, upset with the latest decision, urged the Armenian  Patriarchate in Istanbul to appeal the decision.    The two dailies publish on their front pages on 23 November  the text of an appeal, in Turkish, by the boards of trustees of  Armenian schools in Istanbul to the Ministry of Education.  Copies of the appeal were sent to Turkey's president, the  speaker of the Turkish parliament and the Turkish Ministry of  Foreign Affairs. The appeal states that the right of private  Armenian schools in Turkey to teach in Armenian stems from the  Treaty of Lausanne which Turkey signed in 1923 with Allied  Powers ending all hostilities. The appeal quotes the relevant  articles of the treaty guaranteeing the right of the use of  Armenian in private Armenian schools and adds that this right  was codified by Law No. 625 on Private Educational Institutions  and that it is also enshrined in the 1982 Constitution. The  appeal concludes that, as a result, "the administrative measure  dispatched to our schools by the Training and Education Council  [of the Ministry of Education] has no legal or judicial basis."    The appeal adds: "We request respectfully that, in view of  the reasons enumerated above, this administrative measure which  has caused great distress to our schools, students, their  parents and our community be reviewed and repealed."    A front-page editorial in MARMARA by the paper's publisher  Robert Haddeciyan on 26 November says that the controversial  decision by the Ministry of Education jeopardizes the mission of  the Armenian schools in Turkey and notes that no Turkish  government, even during the "darkest days for democracy,"  repressed the right of Armenian schools to teach in Armenian.  The editorial says: "We do not wish to mention the Treaty of  Lausanne here, because even if there was no Treaty of Lausanne,  today's democratic Turkey would gladly permit our schools to use  Armenian as their language of instruction without hindrance  because this is what the doctrine of this era requires even in  the case of groups which are not considered minorities. In any  event Turkey did not wait for the democratic ideas of today to  bloom to respect the principle of permitting Armenian  instruction for 70 years. However, today, with an unexpected and  astounding step and an approach that contravenes principles of  the modern era, our schools have been instructed to stop  teaching in Armenian, except for the Armenian language. It is  very odd."    The editorial questions the motives for such a decision  saying that the use of Armenian in Armenian schools has not in  any way harmed Turkey or instilled disloyalty among Turkish  citizens of Armenian ancestry. The editorial concludes:    "We would like to hope that the appeal of His Holiness the  Patriarch to the Governor [of Istanbul] will have a favorable  outcome, although we believe that the Governor's Office is not  the correct authority to which such appeal should be addressed  because the issue arises at the level of the Ministry of  Education. However, if the said appeal does not produce the  desired outcome, His Holiness the Patriarch must think about  other appeals and measures."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] President Rauf Denktas has declared that it is  the content, and not the number of items on the agenda, for the  indirect talks scheduled to begin on 17 February that is  important. Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's  assistant special envoy for Cyprus, who is holding preparatory  talks for the implementation of the confidence-building  measures, met at 1645 today for his second meeting with Denktas.    In a statement to reporters after the three-hour meeting,  Denktas remarked that the talks are continuing and the sides are  trying to understand one another within this framework. He  pointed out that important issues face the two sides. Noting  that there is no cause for concern, Denktas explained that  attempts are under way to determine the agenda. Agreement was  reached on several matters and conciliation is sought on the  remaining issues, he added. The president said that he will  meet with Feissel again if necessary. We tried to reach full  agreement on the topics discussed during today's meeting,  Denktas announced, adding that he conveyed the issues that are  important for the Turkish Cypriot side to the UN officials.  Pointing out that he also supplied answers for the questions  put to the Turkish Cypriot side, Denktas said that he may hold  another meeting with Feissel in order to understand the real  content of the proposals submitted to the Turkish Cypriot side.  I do not believe that there are differences of opinion between  the two sides on the main issues, Denktas stated and expressed  the conviction that everything is in order with regard to the  indirect talks to begin on 17 February. He said that there are  still one or two small outstanding points on which the two sides  are yet to agree and expressed the belief that conciliation will  be reached on these points as well.    In reaction to a Greek Cypriot radio report that the agenda  for the indirect talks is comprised of six items, Denktas said  there is no fait accompli on this matter and many aspects  requested by the Turkish Cypriot side are also included in these  six items. The six items are derived from the UN secretary  general's report, Denktas noted, adding that Feissel and his  colleagues summarized these principles under six items, whereas  the Turkish Cypriot side expanded them into 12 separate items.  Denktas remarked that the Turkish Cypriot side is trying to  base the negotiating process on a solid foundation. The  president stressed that it is the content and not the number of  these items that is important. He expressed the belief that the  items on the agenda cover both the Turkish and Greek Cypriots'  demands. Denktas concluded by saying that one should not create  difficulties that do not actually exist. [passage omitted]</p>

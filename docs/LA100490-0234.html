			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> SINGERS AID ENVIRONMENTALISTS  </P> <P> Environmentalists are working with singers Carole King and John Oates to have  logging and mining outlawed on 13 million acres of Northwest wilderness.  </P> <P> The two appeared Wednesday at a news conference to push a proposal from the  Alliance for the Wild Rockies, based in Missoula, Mont.  </P> <P> "Some environmental groups are like the unpopular kids at a high school dance  who stand around in the corner because no one wants to dance with them," said  Oates, of Hall &amp; Oates.  </P> <P> "I'm here to see if I can't get someone to dance with them," he said.  </P> <P> King said taxpayer money should not be used to drill, build roads and clear-cut  trees in national forests.  </P> <P> "If we stopped spending federal money to destroy our public lands maybe we  wouldn't have to raise the taxes that President Bush talked about this  morning," she said.  </P> <P> The alliance wants to ban logging, mining and road-building on public lands in  Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Oregon and Washington.  </P></p>

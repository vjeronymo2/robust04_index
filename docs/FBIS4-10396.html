			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passage in quotation marks in Creole] </F>   [Text] The leader of the Mobilization for National  Development, Professor Hubert de Ronceray, attended the session  in the Senate and called the initiative of the second Senate  office a step in the right direction while political leader  Montalvo Despeignes wonders about the applicability of such a  resolution:    [Begin recording] [De Ronceray] "I believe a major step has  been taken, a very important step. Now other steps must be  taken. For instance, the Chamber of Deputies must also act. I  think that the effort that has just been accomplished here is a  major one, and I believe that the whole country, following this  action, must appreciate it very much. We are almost sure that in  the Chamber of Deputies there are some men, some representatives  who are more or less responsible, who understand the seriousness  of the situation. We therefore hope that good news will also  come out of the House of Deputies... If they reject it, they  will again create some serious problems in the country, and I  believe the population will finally speak its piece.    [Reporter Francois] "Will you be willing to accept the post  of prime minister if they call on you?    [De Ronceray] "If they call on me, I will consult with the  party and if the party agrees, then I have no problem."    [Francois] Mr. Despeignes, your comments.    [Despeignes] When it comes to the Constitution, there is  nothing one can do, but I question the implementation and  applicability of what has just been done because the parliament  is not the only actor in this play.    [Francois] The Senate is not the only actor....    [Despeignes] The Senate, the parliament -- it is still the  same entity -- let us say they are not the only actors despite  the principle of sovereignty in this crisis.    [Francois] Do you mean the Army?    [Despeignes] There is the Army on one side, there is the  international community, and there are the political forces.  Perhaps it will be necessary at an appropriate time to reinforce  this Article 149 with the vast possibilities offered by Article  111. Because in any case, this is already an ad hoc government.  It will therefore be necessary to broaden the operational field  of this ad hoc government in order to institutionalize the  state, the society, and to organize the nation. [end recording]</p>

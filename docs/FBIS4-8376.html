			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Eva Cobejova: "What Is Hidden Behind One Post </F> Office Box"]    [Text] The weekly ZMENA [Change] has presented to the  Slovak youth an offer to become involved in the activity of the  Slovak National Front (SNF). We do not learn from the quite  extensive article who specifically stands behind this  initiative. The address, a post office box in Trnava, does not  reveal much. What does the front actually offer us? To build  on the "traditions of healthy patriotism and Christian ethics."  The aim is to "make the political and economic leadership of  the state respect the interests of the nation and protect its  freedom.... On no account do we intend to stand idly by and  watch the cryptocommunists in parliament and in the Slovak  Government sell our homeland to the political-criminal  underworld and the international mafia." The SNF will be  against foreigners being given jobs in Slovakia and foreign-made  goods penetrating our market. The SNF calls for a "morally pure  government, supported by a potent Army, the police, and  voluntary units of armed citizens in the style of the National  Guard." Hidden behind the anonymous post office box in Trnava  are thus new armed units that want to defend this nation,  whether we want it or not. Does this not remind you by chance of  some organizations from Slovak history, about which a judge of  the Slovak Supreme Court recently said that these were "good  organizations, which were only misused by politicians"? Who  will misuse the SNF?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe, 29 Jun -- The convoy of trucks carrying  humanitarian cargo for the inhabitants of the Pamirs  successfully surmounted the Khabu-Rabot mountain pass today and  moved on toward Khorog, the administrative center of the  Gorno-Badakhshan autonomous oblast of Tajikistan. An ITAR-TASS  correspondent has learned from informed sources in the oblast  administration that the units of the Collective Peace-keeping  Forces (CPF) deployed in Tajikistan have remained on the far  side of the pass. The protection of the convoy and the safety  of the drivers was undertaken by units of the mountain rifle  battalion of the republic's Ministry of Defense which is manned  by young people from the Pamirs and also by self-defense units  of Gorno-Badakhshan oblast.    This agreement was reached during talks between  representatives of the CPF command, local authorities of  Gorno-Badakhshan oblast, representatives of the coalition  council of democratic forces, and some field commanders of  self-defense units. In the opinion of Ulfat-khanum, one of the  representatives of the coalition council of the autonomous  region, the initial decision by the CPF command to accompany the  humanitarian cargo across the territory of the oblast right to  Khorog aroused serious concern among the public of the Pamirs.  They thought there might be provocations from individual forces  interested in destabilizing the situation in the Pamirs.  Ulfat-khanum stressed that this concern had been conveyed to the  CPF command and also to the representative of the UN mission in  the oblast centre of Khorog and, as a result, a sensible  compromise had been reached.    It is expected that the convoy of trucks carrying foodstuffs  will arrive in Khorog by this evening. The aid is very timely  aince the population of Gorno-Badakhshan autonomous oblast is on  the verge of starvation. Food reserves are virtually exhausted.  The only bakery in the administrative center has been out of  action for several days because there is no flour.</p>

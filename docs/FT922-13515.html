			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Democrats losing defence budget battle DEMOCRATIC leaders in Congress appear to be losing the battle to cut defence spending in order to release more money for domestic programmes. Republican congressmen backing the Dollars 281bn (Pounds 163.30bn) defence budget proposed by President George Bush for 1993 have won support from some Democratic members, many of them driven by fear that military spending cuts could affect defence industries or army bases in their home states. Although President Bush's defence proposal already represents a cut of around 1 per cent in real terms from this year's budget authorisation, the Democratic leadership has argued for deeper cuts, particularly in major equipment programmes. But a proposal from Senator James Exon of Nebraska to cut a further Dollars 4bn from the defence budget failed in the Senate this week. Mr Exon complained that the administration and the defence industry had dishonestly exaggerated the job losses that deeper defence cuts would cause. 'The military-industrial complex is alive and well,' Mr Exon grumbled. The House of Representatives had earlier approved a budget resolution that would inflict more severe spending discipline on the Pentagon, but congressmen are finding it difficult to enact the individual cuts that would make up this overall reduction. Indeed, a House appropriations committee is ready to reverse one of the cuts President Bush has proposed, by authorising a second Seawolf submarine. At Dollars 2bn each, the Seawolf is one of the most costly pieces of military equipment in the US budget. It was also the only defence programme that the Pentagon described as specifically designed to counter the Soviet Union, and it has been hard to argue - as supporters of the B2 stealth bomber attempted to do - that it would be equally useful for the smaller regional wars which now loom largest in the US's military planning. Democratic opposition in the Senate to deeper defence cuts is led by the two senators from Connecticut, who have been desperate to preserve their constituents' jobs at the Groton yard which is building the Seawolf. The political difficulty of cutting defence programmes may increase pressure to cut the Star Wars budget.</p>

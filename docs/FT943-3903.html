			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Arts (Openings): London Coliseum The 1994/5 season opens tonight with a new production of Puccini's 'Tosca'. Rosalind Plowright returns to the London Coliseum for the title-role and the conductor is Alexander Gibson. Whatever else he may do, the producer Keith Warner is unlikely to set this 'Tosca' in fascist Italy, like its predecessor.</p>

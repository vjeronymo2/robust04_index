			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Two suspected members of the IRA have been indicted for attempted murder in two  bombing attacks against British military bases in West Germany that wounded 46  people, Kurt Rebmann, West Germany's chief federal prosecutor, said in  Frankfurt. Terence Gerard McGeough and Gerard Thomas Hanratty, both 30 and both  born in Northern Ireland, have been in prison since they were arrested, heavily  armed, near the Dutch border last August. Rebmann said that the two also are  charged with "other crimes" not specified. The IRA, fighting to end British  rule in Northern Ireland, said it had intended to "inflict a devastating blow"  on British North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces stationed in West Germany.  </P></p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome hit by R&amp;D fears Shock news over its research and development programme took any potential shine off Wellcome's interim figures and saw the shares slide 51 to 550p the biggest drop in the Footsie, on turnover of 12m. The fall continues a depressing trend for the hard hit pharmaceuticals group  -last year's interim figures were accompanied by a 72-point tumble from just under 900p. It also reinforces the gloom for investors who paid around 800p-a-share for the 290m share stake sold by Wellcome Trust more than 18 months ago. Wellcome's profits were within the range of analysts' estimates, but sales growth was significantly lower than most had anticipated. This was accompanied by news that the company had withdrawn a new anti-shingles treatment at a time when Zovirax, its headline anti-viral treatment, is coming under increasing competitive pressure. The results may have been honey for the bears but supporters such as Lehman Brothers were clearly disappointed. Analyst Ms Jo Walton of the US house argued that Wellcome still offered the best value in the sector, but conceded that: 'The risks throughout the whole pharmaceutical sector are extremely high.' She shaved her full-year forecast by Pounds 20m to Pounds 700m after exceptionals.</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Council accused of 'social cleansing' LABOUR yesterday criticised the Audit Commission for the delay in publishing its report on alleged abuses of housing policy by the Conservative-controlled Westminster City Council. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, published a report which alleged that Westminster had indulged in 'gerrymandering' and 'social cleansing'. He said it was being published now because of Labour's concern over the length of time the investigation of Westminster by the district auditor has taken. It started in 1989. Mr Andrew Foster, the controller of the Audit Commission, had told Mr Straw that the auditor's report would be published in July. It is not now due to appear until October. The auditor told Labour in a letter that his investigation had been delayed by his discovery that council documents had been shredded. Labour's report alleges that Westminster designated council houses for sale in electorally marginal wards. The report says this was done because people buying houses were more likely to vote Conservative than council tenants. It also accuses Westminster of 'social cleansing' by placing homeless people in developments outside the borough. The council says this policy was adopted to avoid Westminster's high property prices. The council asserts that it guarantees homes to residents established in the borough.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 24 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is setting up a representative  office of the Korean People's Army in Panmunjom as a replacement  for its membership of the 40-year-old Korean Military Armistice  Commission.    Yu Myong Chol, the first liaison officer of the Korean  People's Army at Panmunjom, informed the U.S. side of the  Armistice Commission today, according to a report of the  official KCNA NEWS SERVICE.    DPRK had suggested to the United States on April 27 that a  peace agreement replace the 1953 Armistice Agreement of Korea  with a new peace guaranteeing organization replacing the Korean  Military Armistice Commission.    General Li Chan Bok will be heading the representative  office, and three other officers will assist Li in the office,  said the KCNA.    Yu also lodged a protest against the recent deployment by  the  U.S. of Patriot Missiles in South Korea, and called on the U.S.  side to stop all military activities in South Korea.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / How To Spend It: A capital feast of fine reading - Book Fairs ANYONE WITH an interest in old books contrives to be in London in June. Each year an immense number of rare, antiquarian, or just second-hand, books are offered for sale at a series of fairs held in London hotels. A few fairs offering prints, maps, and ephemera are arranged to coincide. Although the fairs do about half their business within the trade, the public are welcome at all of them. This year the rival associations have cooperated to produce a useful leaflet setting out the times and locations, with an accompanying map of central London and advice on how to get there by bus or tube. Copies are available free at the fairs, and in advance at many bookshops. However, the information gives little guidance on what to expect. Like corporations, the fairs nowadays prefer to be known by their initials, the full names no longer being an adequate description. By far the biggest are the two PBFA fairs at the Russell hotel near the British Museum, at which 240 dealers offer 85,000 books. The two fairs run consecutively, with a complete change of stock. The catalogue, to be bought at the door or in advance, admits to both. PBFA concentrates on the middle price range, Pounds 20 to Pounds 100. Collectors are seldom disappointed, but they need patience in their title-hunting. The Bloomsbury at the Royal National hotel is also large and varied, more second-hand than antiquarian. The Bonnington is the cheapest. These are fairs for readers and researchers - who are not always the same as collectors - but the vigilant can sometimes intercept bargains on their way up the market. More expensive books are to be found at the International Book Fair at the Cafe Royal near Piccadilly Circus. The culmination of the week is the ABA Antiquarian Book Fair at the Park Lane hotel in Piccadilly opposite Green Park. Now in its 34th year, this is a truly international event with exhibitors from the US, Europe, the Middle East, and elsewhere. Books to the value of Pounds 15m are on offer this year. The tiny 33-page collection of poems of Wilfred Owen, which Sassoon published in 1920 and which was the start of Owen's fame, costs Pounds 335; the longer edition prepared by Blunden in 1931 costs Pounds 350 (from Marrin). As usual there is a fine selection of colour plate topographical books priced in the low thousands. A splendid letter from Mary Queen of Scots instructing the Earl of Bothwell to hunt down rebels is offered at Pounds 26,500 (Wilson) - a few months later Bothwell murdered the Queen's husband and took his place. Susan Biltcliffe offers a collection of catalogues of artists' materials of the 1890s, works of art in their own right, at Pounds 2,000. Especially appealing are two albums of songs and other music, discovered 15 years ago, transcribed in manuscript by Jane Austen and other members of her family for Pounds 21,000 from Finch.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BOOK FAIRS IN LONDON IN JUNE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Date         Name           Hotel              Time      Entrance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Friday 18    PBFA 1         Russell           2-7pm      Pounds 2 for                                                           catalogue Saturday 19  PBFA 1         Russell          10.30-7pm   Catalogue              Bloomsbury     Royal National   10.30-7pm   Free Sunday 20    PBFA 2         Russell           2-7pm      Catalogue              Bonnington     Bonnington        9.30-7pm   Free              Bloomsbury     Royal National   10.30-7pm   Free Monday 21    International  Cafe Royal        2-7pm      Pounds 5                                                           preview              Bonnington     Bonnington        9.30-7pm   Free              PBFA 2         Russell          10.30-7pm   Catalogue Tuesday 22   ABA            Park Lane         5-9pm      Pounds 15                                                           preview              Bonnington     Bonnington        9.30-4pm   Free              International  Cafe Royal       10-7pm      Pounds 1 Wednesday 23 ABA            Park Lane        11-8pm      Pounds 6 for                                                           catalogue              International  Cafe Royal       10-5pm      Pounds 1 Thursday 24  ABA            Park Lane        11-6pm      Catalogue  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

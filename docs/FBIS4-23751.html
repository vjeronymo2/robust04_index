			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By David Greybe] </F>   [Text] Cape Town -- The new provinces were expected to get  some of their powers only at the end of next week, after central  government delayed last Friday's planned implementation, the  Office of the Public Service Commission said yesterday. But  they would have to wait even longer before they got some of the  more substantial powers listed in the interim constitution,  commission deputy director-general Johan Grabe said.    "The first batch of provincial powers will comprise all the  powers and functions contained in the ordinances and statutes of  the four old provinces, plus those of the former TBVC [Transkei,  Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states and self-governing  territories," he said.    Specific powers listed in the constitution, but excluded at  this stage, included housing, agriculture, trade and industry,  financial borrowing, land affairs, education, and provincial  service commissions.    Grabe said the enormous workload encountered in preparing  the  first batch of legislation, particularly the need to get the  technical details correct, had been the main reason for the  delay. Government departments, assisted by state law advisers,  had begun work on the second batch.    Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi warned at the  weekend that the success of the government of national unity  could be in jeopardy if the constitutional deadlock with the  Inkatha Freedom Party over provincial powers, particularly in  KwaZulu/Natal, was not resolved soon.    He said Inkatha's qualified support for the reconstruction  and development programme [RDP] was contingent on the autonomous  implementation by provinces of RDP chapters in their  jurisdiction.    After meeting provincial leaders last week, Deputy  Provincial  Affairs Minister Valli Moosa said a proclamation returning about  half the provincial powers to the regions would be published in  last Friday's GOVERNMENT GAZETTE. He said provincial powers  would be phased in, but there would be provincial differences as  each province had its own peculiarities.    Grabe said the desire to proceed in an "orderly manner" had  also slowed down proceedings. "It has been a hell of a  process." However, the first batch of "quite substantial"  legislation would be ready for signing by President Nelson  Mandela on his return from the OAU summit in Tunis. It would  then take a few days to prepare for publication in the GAZETTE.    Grabe said a "realistic" publication date was Friday next  week. If government wanted it published earlier, a special  GAZETTE would have to be prepared.    Nearly two weeks ago provincial powers were temporarily  transferred to central government, which said they would be  passed back once provinces demonstrated their ability to  administer them.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Management: A dressing down - SBC's approach to business attire Traders and other employees at Swiss Bank Corporation's London office have been actively encouraged to dress 'smart casual' if they prefer it to business attire. The relaxation of the dress code was spelt out in a memorandum to certain staff last month. The new rules only apply within the office; suits are still de rigueur for meetings with clients. The relaxed look is intended to signal change at SBC, albeit surreptitiously  -there was no public announcement. 'It was an attempt to give visibility to deeper cultural changes,' explains Rudi Bogni, SBC's London chief executive. 'It's predominantly for internal purposes, but it's not a secret. 'We do want to project an image that we are sound but open to innovation.' While the move raises the intriguing question of whether other formerly staid City employers will follow its lead, it should be stressed that SBC's shift arose from a unique set of 'corporate culture' circumstances. It was stimulated by SBC's phased acquisition of derivatives broker O'Connor Partnership of Chicago where jeans and trainers have been the norm among a staff influenced as much by Silicon Valley as Wall Street. O'Connor staff have close links with the academic world. The relaxed dress code might not have come if O'Connor had been a buttoned-up New York company, nor if it had been a British or German firm making the acquisition. 'The main trigger is our multi-cultural manpower,' says Bogni, an Italian. 'We have to try to create a culture of our own which blends the values. Dress code is not the major component, but it is a visible one that people identify with.' One influence is the growing number of graduates with degrees in mathematics and physics being attracted to the financial sector. Their role models are the software geniuses of California, not 1980s sharp suits and braces. This fashion is drifting eastwards across the US. Many US offices now have 'casual Fridays'. Europe has yet to catch the trend. SBC claims it is the first City bank to unbutton, although ABN Amro Bank in Amsterdam has a similarly casual attitude. The principal underlying change that SBC aims to make, and which the new dress is intended to signify, is to integrate its cash and derivatives sides more closely, fusing greater communications between the two activities and encouraging a greater exchange of ideas. At a more subliminal level, it is about being seen to be different by competitors, clients and potential employees. The internal memorandum spoke of the move to 'smart casual wear at the discretion of the individual' as one ingredient of a 'redefinition intended to strengthen our positive image and to distinguish us from other houses'. Meanwhile, there are some unexpected benefits of the new policy. Those who used to preen in expensive tailored suits now look most casual, while some of those who never appeared comfortable in a business suit now appear smarter than ever.</p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> HAVEL PAYS HOMAGE TO SAKHAROV  </P> <P> Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel today paid homage to the late human rights  activist Andrei D. Sakharov, one of the few Soviets who openly welcomed the  1968 Prague Spring reforms and denounced the Soviet-led invasion of  Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> Havel visited the grave with Sakharov's widow, Yelena Bonner, and Czechoslovak  Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier.  </P> <P> They placed flowers among the many bouquets that are constantly replenished by  mourners.  </P> <P> Havel, Czechoslovakia's first non-Communist leader in 41 years, also met with  Soviet legislators and suggested an exchange of parliamentary delegations, with  the Czechoslovak side led by Alexander Dubcek, the former Communist Party chief  who authored the 1968 reforms.  </P> <P> Dubcek's last two official visits to Moscow were humiliating. In the first,  days after the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion, he was under arrest. In the  second, two months later, he signed an agreement allowing Soviet troops to stay  on Czechoslovak soil indefinitely and promising the country would return to  Soviet-style, hard-line rule.  </P></p>

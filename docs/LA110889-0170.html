			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WOLFSHEIMER, BERNHARDT S.D. COUNCIL VICTORS  </P> <P> In a dramatic victory for environmentalists that will reshape the San Diego  City Council's philosophical balance, Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer retained  her seat Tuesday while land-use planner Linda Bernhardt unseated Councilman Ed  Struiksma in the city's first district-only elections since early this century.  </P> <P> Breaking conservatives' longtime dominance of the council and shifting power to  a pro-environmental majority, Wolfsheimer narrowly defeated former county  supervisorial aide Bob Trettin in the 1st District, while her former City Hall  aide, Bernhardt, trounced Struiksma by a convincing 3-to-2 ratio in the 5th  District contest.  </P> <P> The victories by Wolfsheimer and Bernhardt, both of whom drew strong backing  from environmental groups as they faced opponents closely linked to the  development industry, completed the ideological transformation of the council  begun in last September's primary by John Hartley's upset of Councilwoman  Gloria McColl.  </P> <P> Struiksma's and McColl's defeat, combined with Wolfsheimer's narrow victory,  also vividly demonstrated incumbents' diminished political security, as the  city's first district-only races since the City Charter was approved in 1931  produced the bleakest electoral performance by sitting council members in more  than a decade. Before Tuesday, only one other council incumbent -- Trettin's  former boss, Bill Mitchell -- had lost a reelection campaign in the 1980s.  </P> <P> "The No. 1 thing that won this election -- and none of us should ever forget it  -- is the people of the neighborhoods," Bernhardt said. "District elections  finally gives the power back to the people."  </P> <P> Conceding the defeat that even many of his closest backers regarded as  inevitable after his dismal primary performance, Struiksma said: "When I get up  in the morning, I'm going to be able to look myself in the mirror and know I  did a good job for the people of the city of San Diego."  </P> <P> The opening chapter in Tuesday's election was written last November, when San  Diego voters narrowly approved a ballot proposition replacing the city's  two-tiered electoral format -- district primaries followed by citywide runoffs  between the top two vote-getters -- with district-only contests.  </P> <P> The move transformed the way the San Diego City Council had been elected for  the past half century. It prompted candidates to rethink traditional  strategies, added weight to neighborhood-oriented issues, affected fund-raising  and left other indelible marks on the campaigns for the four council seats at  stake this year.  </P> <P> Beyond allowing candidates to win outright in the primary -- as Councilwoman  Judy McCarty did against token opposition and as Hartley did by upsetting  McColl -- the other major structural change imposed by passage of Proposition E  is that runoffs now are confined to districts. By virtue of the runoffs'  smaller geographic area, challengers are better able to neutralize incumbents'  financial and name-recognition advantages -- which often proved insurmountable  in citywide races -- through their own door-to-door politicking and grass-roots  organization.  </P> <P> Another factor that made this fall's election especially compelling was its  potential to alter the council's philosophical balance on growth-management and  other sensitive issues.  </P> <P> With Hartley's 3rd District upset setting the stage, the runoff campaign began  with the knowledge that victories by Wolfsheimer and Bernhardt, both of whom  were endorsed by the Sierra Club, would create a solid managed-growth majority  on a council that in recent years has been dominated by a conservative "Gang of  Five." A Struiksma-Trettin tandem win, meanwhile, would preserve the  conservative coalition's domination, while a split between the environmental  and pro-development camps would leave the council nearly evenly balanced.  </P> <P> In the 1st District race, Wolfsheimer -- viewing her pro-environmental record  as her strongest asset in her northern San Diego district -- sought to keep the  campaign dialogue focused on the politically volatile growth issue. The  district stretches along the coast from La Jolla to North City West, extending  inland to Rancho Bernardo and the San Pasqual Valley.  </P> <P> Dismissing her opponent as "Bulldozer Bob" because of his strong financial  backing from development interests, the 50-year-old former law professor often  told campaign audiences that her election would help create a "limited-growth  coalition that will put the needs of the people . . . before the desires of  take-a-buck, make-a-buck and pass-the-buck."  </P> <P> Unwilling to, in his words, "wear the black hat" on the growth issue, the  35-year-old Trettin portrayed himself as "every bit the managed-growth  candidate (Wolfsheimer) is."  </P> <P> Though developers supplied a sizable part of the $211,851 that he had received  in campaign donations as of Oct. 21, "contributors don't dictate how you vote,"  Trettin said. Most of the money that Wolfsheimer spent came from her own  pocket, as she loaned $250,000 to her campaign -- more than three-fourths of  her overall $315,684 contributions total.  </P> <P> A former aide to county Supervisor Susan Golding and, before that, to  Councilman Bill Mitchell, who was unseated by Wolfsheimer in 1985, Trettin  stressed in his standard stump speech that the district's population grew by  35% during the past four years.  </P> <P> "If this is what Abbe calls growth management, the district and the city can't  stand four more years of it," Trettin said.  </P> <P> The 5th District contest, meanwhile, saw Struiksma attempt to turn the election  more into a referendum on Bernhardt than a judgment on his own eight-year  record -- a strategy born of necessity after his disappointing second-place  finish behind her in the five-candidate primary, 39% to 33%. Bordered on the  south by Mission Valley, the district extends from Linda Vista north to Mira  Mesa, passing through Kearny Mesa and Serra Mesa as it reaches east to Scripps  Ranch.  </P> <P> Faced with the lukewarm public reception to his "Getting Things Done" slogan,  Struiksma recognized that his best -- perhaps only -- hope of reversing the  primary's outcome was to spend more time in the runoff trying to persuade  voters not to vote for Bernhardt than explaining why they should vote for his  reelection.  </P> <P> Describing Bernhardt as "a major question mark" beyond her pro-environmental  slant, Struiksma criticized the former Wolfsheimer aide as "an inexperienced  single-issue candidate . . . who would like to keep the questions unanswered  until after the election" -- a charge he supported by pointing to her refusal  to attend several debates.  </P> <P> Seeking to raise questions about Bernhardt's character, Struiksma, a  42-year-old former police officer, also accused her of defaulting on a $4,955  student loan in New Jersey. Though Bernhardt admitted missing several payments,  she denied ever technically being in default.  </P> <P> Terming Struiksma's attacks an effort to divert attention "away from his own  build-at-any-cost record," Bernhardt argued that her election would "help  preserve the open space that's left after eight years of Ed Struiksma."  </P> <P> Emphasizing her diametrically opposed viewpoint, Bernhardt suggested a number  of growth-control measures throughout the campaign, highlighted by a proposed  ban on development along the Interstate 15 corridor until traffic is reduced  and other related problems are alleviated.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Leonard Bernstein contributed to this story.  </P> <P> * PROPOSTIONS in other San Diego County communities.

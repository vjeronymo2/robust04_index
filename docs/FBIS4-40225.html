			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev--Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk signed an  agreement on partnership and cooperation between Ukraine and the  European Union on 14 June in Luxembourg. He also signed a  provisional agreement on the enactment of the main agreement  while it awaits ratification by the parliaments of the 16 [as  received] EEC members states. In a comment on the event,  Natalya Zaruda, head of the Department for Strategic Analysis  and Prognosis of Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said  that the agreement on partnership and cooperation between  Ukraine and the EEC creates a mechanism for constant political  dialogue and periodic consultations at different levels covering  the entire range of political, economic, and cultural issues.    Ukraine and the EEC intend to cooperate in a stage-by-stage  transition to greater freedom of movement for goods, services,  and capital. In this connection, the agreement stipulates that  Ukraine and the EEC discuss before 31 December 1998 the  possibility of setting up a free trade zone between the European  Community and Ukraine. The document also contains and agreement  to hold regular meetings between top officials within the  framework of the Joint Cooperation Council and to maintain  contact within the Committee for Parliamentary Cooperation.    The agreement is also regarded as an expression of the EEC's  support for Ukraine's intention to join GATT. Ukraine and the  European Commission will soon begin negotiations on setting up a  contact group on coal and steel and on trade in nuclear  materials.</p>

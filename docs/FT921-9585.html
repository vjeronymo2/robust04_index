			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / The Barlow Clowes Trial: North relieved as a scandal becomes history THE FINANCIAL and prof-essional-services sectors of Manchester and Leeds appear to have escaped any taint from the Barlow Clowes affair, although some within their business communities had an uncomfortable brush with the scandal. In Leeds several leading professionals have made a point since the Barlow Clowes collapse of briefing existing and potential clients on the background to the affair. In Manchester, respectable professionals were so suspicious of Mr Clowes' bond-washing operations - and the high levels of commission he was understood to have offered some intermediaries - that they had nothing to do with him from the outset in the 1970s. With Manchester's finance sector mainly contained in what the city calls its 'square half-mile', professional networks consigned Mr Clowes to the fringe. When the scandal broke in 1988 many Manchester professionals could honestly claim never to have heard of him. His Manchester professional origins were as a fairly lowly life-assurance salesman. Barlow Clowes itself operated 10 miles out of the city in Poynton, Cheshire. From it Mr Clowes sold his investment schemes through the then poorly regulated financial intermediaries. But by the time Leeds professionals became involved in 1987, Barlow Clowes was a big business which Mr Clowes wanted to reverse into James Ferguson Holdings - a quoted but formerly moribund loss-maker that had started life in knitwear - in order to go public and achieve respectability. In 1985 Mr Cramer, a young Leeds market trader, had bought into Ferguson to raise capital for expansion into financial services and property. Meanwhile Mr Clowes needed to find other means to keep up the returns he had promised investors after the Inland Revenue closed the tax loophole through which Barlow Clowes made its gilts operations pay. This had worked by selling gilts just before they matured to obtain capital gains which were then taxed at a lower rate than the interest on the bonds. A quoted company offered a vehicle for building a network of investment activity. The Leeds financial community organised a rights issue so the company could expand and incorporate the Barlow Clowes businesses. The professionals involved in the local community took Mr Clowes on trust as they knew his associate, Mr Guy Cramer. Rensburg, which has since become part of the BWD Rensburg quoted financial services group, was the main underwriter to the rights issue and informed the Stock Exchange that it had been misled over the status of the sub-underwriter, which turned out to be under the control of Mr Clowes. Investigations by the Stock Exchange, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Serious Fraud Office exonerated Rensburg, which had acted in good faith. Coincidentally, the Barlow Clowes house of cards started to collapse soon after Rensburg's resignation. There was some trepidation in Leeds in case negligence claims arose against rights-issue advisers after James Ferguson's collapse. The fears proved groundless, but many in the business community of the north will be glad to see the end of the Barlow Clowes affair.</p>

Despite  the ramified talk about these services, which are numerous and  broad, AL-DA'WAH editorial staff decided to address these  questions and queries to His Highness Dr. 'Alawi Darwish Kayyal,  the minister of posts, telephones, and telegraph. The undeniable  fact is that these questions received the attention of His  Excellency, who focused light on them point by point, discussing  them frankly and explicitly, as shown by this dialogue.    His Excellency noted that there is a huge program to  modernize the kingdom's communication network technology,  stressing that portable [al-naqqal] telephone service will be  available next year, God willing. His Excellency also pointed  out that the problem of the long wait that precedes acquisition  of telephone service in some areas will disappear shortly. He  also stressed that the ministry is about to expand further the  pager and mobile [car, al-sayyar] telephone service. The  dialogue has also covered other points.    [al-Qadi] Your Excellency, some authorities have said that  there is a plan to develop the kingdom's communication means.  How will this be done?    [Kayyal] Yes, there is a program to modernize the kingdom's  communication network technology to move this network from what  is known as the analogue technology to the digital technology,  to which most countries of the world have turned. The new  technology opens broad horizons for services that can be  rendered by the network, especially high-speed information  transmission services. This is the technology that has  accompanied the world of computers, which have become a  characteristic of the age in which we live. The fact is that  this modernization program is a complete and comprehensive  program. It includes a network of telephone exchanges in all  parts of the kingdom, a microwave network, an underground cable  network, and a satellite network, as well as all the subsidiary  systems and networks connected with these four networks.  <H5>  Communication Expansion </H5>   [al-Qadi] Tell us, Your Excellency, about the ministry's  plan  to expand telephone service and about future telephone projects,  their costs, and number of lines. When will they begin, and when  will they end?    [Kayyal] Communications play an influential and effective  role in our modern life. Hardly anybody can dispense with  communications in one form or another. Rather, communications  have become a mainstay of national security, economic  development, and the social contact. This is why the demand for  communication services is rising and why the ministry has worked  to develop a major program to expand the communications utility  in a manner that enables it to meet the citizens' demand for its  services. The ministry presented this program to His Majesty  King Fahd Bin- 'Abd-al-'Aziz, the custodian of the two holy  mosques, who has given it his noble patronage. The plan has also  been approved by the Council of Ministers.    The size of this expansion amounts to nearly one-half  million  lines, and there is a strong possibility that this number will  be doubled. This program will make up for the deficit in urban  and rural telephone lines. It will also secure the service to  nearly 2,000 new villages. This expansion will coincide with the  program to modernize all components of the existing networks--a  program to which I referred in the preceding answer. It is  expected that the costs of both programs will amount to 10  billion Saudi riyals.    God willing, this program will start in 1415 of the Hegira  [1994] and it will be completed within five years. But it will  start producing fruits in the second year of the project, i.e.,  in 1416 of the Hegira [1995].  <H5>  Posts </H5>   [al-Qadi] What is new in postal services, and what are their  future projects?    [Kayyal] The postal service has the government's attention  because it is an important service sector. This is why the  government supplies it with the requirements it needs to perform  its role. We in the ministry pursue whatever is new in the  postal service world to ensure the continued improvement of our  postal service. This is being accomplished by establishing in  the various parts of the kingdom postal centers equipped with  modern postal automation equipment, such as sorting, binding,  and filling equipment. After building the three main postal  complexes in Riyadh, Jeddah, and Ad-Dammam--which are the main  terminals for mail--we proceeded to build similar complexes, but  on a smaller scale, in the venerable Mecca, the luminous Medina,  At-Ta'if, al-Qasim, and Tabuk. Postal service premises are being  now constructed in nine other cities. We will proceed along this  path gradually until all parts of the kingdom are included.    [al-Qadi] What is the mail volume received in the kingdom?  Are all letters sorted automatically; and what is the letter  loss percentage, if any?    [Kayyal] in 1413 of the Hegira [1992], the postal service  handled nearly 680 million postal items, including 375 million  outgoing items and 305 million incoming items.    Nearly 60 percent of the mail is sorted automatically. The  rest is sorted by hand, because it consists of printed  materials, newspapers, and magazines that have dimensions that  don't fit into the automatic sorting machines.    The loss rate is extremely low, almost nonexistent. If loss  exists, then it is in the single figures, and it amounts to no  percentage when compared to the mail volume.    [al-Qadi] Many people complain of the difficulty of  acquiring  a post office box. Why has this problem not been solved?    [Kayyal] Post office boxes are available and located in  quarters, but not in streets. We are eager to spread them so  they will be available to every user in the place he wants them  to be.  <H5>  Long Waits for Telephones </H5>   [al-Qadi] When, in the opinion of His Excellency the  minister, will the long wait to get a telephone line end?    [Kayyal] God willing, the wait problem in major cities will  be solved in two phases: the first during the second half of  this year and during next year through the urgent expansion  program being implemented currently. The second will begin in  1416 of the Hegira [1995] through the approved expansion program  to which I referred in a previous answer. This means that the  wait problem will disappear, God willing, within three years.  Here I would like to point out to my brother citizens that it is  not as easy as some people imagine to provide the service. Lots  of money is spent, silent efforts are exerted, and much time is  consumed to provide the service to a certain area, beginning  with the building for every telephone exchange and the external  network boxes, which extend to every street and reach every home  through trenches dug into the ground, and ending with the means  that link an exchange to the network and to other exchanges  within the same city, with exchanges in other cities, and then  with foreign exchanges. The time needed to do all this is  estimated at three to four years.  <H5>  Pager and Mobile Telephone </H5>   [al-Qadi] What is new regarding the pager and mobile [car]  telephone service? Will they undergo future expansion?    [Kayyal] Yes, they will undergo future expansion. A contract  has been concluded to expand the general wireless calling  (pager) network. This expansion will produce fruits at the  beginning of next year, God willing. A contract will also be  concluded within six months to expand the mobile [car] telephone  network capacity greatly.  <H5>  Portable Telephone </H5>   [al-Qadi] Is there a plan to introduce other services  similar  to the pager service, such as the portable [al-naqqal] telephone  service, for example?    [Kayyal] I have said in a previous answer that the ministry  seeks to pursue whatever is new in the communications world in  order to introduce any of this world's new products that befit  us. Portable telephone service will become available by the end  of next year, God willing.    [al-Qadi] How does Your Excellency view the phenomenon of  the  sale and purchase of communication services?    [Kayyal] I see it as unhealthy. However, it is a product of  the imbalance between service supply and demand. Rest assured  that this problem will disappear shortly, when the new  capabilities about which I have talked are made available.  <H5>  Overlapping of Lines </H5>   [al-Qadi] Some people complain of the overlapping and  jamming  of lines when calls are made. What is Your Excellency's opinion?    [Kayyal] The ministry is aware of this problem, and it is  exerting maximum efforts and using all the resources it can to  eliminate or reduce this problem. It hopes that the problem will  disappear completely when the modernization and expansion  programs to which I have referred previously are completed.    This problem is due to some outdated equipment in the  communication network. This equipment has reached the end of its  operational lifespan; part of it has been in operation for more  than 20 years and needs to be replaced. The problem is also due  to the extreme pressure experienced by the network as a result  of the ever-growing use of this network.  <H5>  Complaints </H5>   [al-Qadi] How does Your Excellency view the complaints  published in the press about communication services?    [Kayyal] I see them as a healthy phenomenon, even though  some  people exaggerate the matter and some superficialize it. One  finds people who say that the service standard has deteriorated  to a level that makes it impossible for one to make any call. Is  this true? One finds others who say that all that is needed to  solve the problem is to get a small part from some country and  all that it takes to get this part is the signature of an  individual who does not report to his work. This is a form of  superficiality that is devoid of the simplest rules of logic.    We at the Ministry of Posts, Telephones, and Telegraph do  not  deny that there are some negatives. But these negatives amount  to nothing when compared with the positives. If it were not for  the positives in work, any work, nobody would mention the  negatives. Anyway, it is a human tendency to talk about the  negatives. Those who do are the ones who get criticized. Those  who do not do are mentioned by nobody.    [al-Qadi] There are some base-minded people who eavesdrop on  mobile [car] telephone conversations. What has the ministry done  about this phenomenon and about protecting conversations?    [Kayyal] The current mobile [car] telephone system will be  scrambled in the near future, and then the base-minded will not  be able to engage in their disgraceful curiosity. Moreover, the  expanded mobile telephone system will be totally scrambled.</p>

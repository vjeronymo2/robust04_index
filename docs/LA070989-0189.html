			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS / THOMAS BONK;  </P> <P> SEEMINGLY READY TO RETIRE, EVERT ADMITS SHE'S PAST HER PEAK  </P> <P> For the past six months, Chris Evert has been dropping hints, but the message  she gave Thursday came through loud and clear.  </P> <P> Evert, 34, said she is 90% sure there will be no more Wimbledons for her and  indicated again that this year is probably her last.  </P> <P> Four months ago, Evert lost to 15-year-old Monica Seles in the final of the  Virginia Slims of Houston and that hastened her thoughts about retiring.  </P> <P> "That's why I'm thinking about retirement now," she said. "You know, this year.  It's always been on my mind: When is the right time to stop?  </P> <P> "You know, maybe I'm not willing to give 100% in every sense of the word,  physically and mentally and emotionally like I used to.  </P> <P> "If I don't do it and I start losing to players that I've never lost to before,  then that's the right time."  </P> <P> Evert, who lost to Steffi Graf in the Wimbledon semifinals, said she is  undecided about playing the tournaments to which she is committed -- the  Virginia Slims of Los Angeles is one of them.  </P> <P> "Obviously, I'm past my prime now, past my peak," Evert said.  </P> <P> Steve Flink of World Tennis magazine, who has covered Evert since 1972, was  surprised to hear such an admission.  </P> <P> "I've never heard her say that before," Flink said. "She's always talked like  there was a chance she could improve.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's any question that this is Chris' last year," Flink said.  "I think she'll probably play the U.S. Open and that'll be it. It's probably  100-1 she'll win the Open, but if she gets to the semifinals, I'm sure she'd be  happy."  </P> <P> If Evert does not play Wimbledon again, she will leave behind a record of  making at least the semifinals 17 times in 18 years. The exception was in 1983  when Kathy Jordan beat her in the third round.  </P> <P> In Evert's last 55 Grand Slam events, she has made it at least as far as the  semifinals 51 times.  </P> <P> Does Ralph Kiner have British relatives?  </P> <P> In the style of the New York Mets' broadcaster, who is famous for his bloopers,  the BBC's Wimbledon announcers have put their tennis shoes in their mouths  before.  </P> <P> "There is Peter Graf, Steffi's father, with his head on his chin."  </P> <P>  -- DAN MASKELL  </P> <P> "She puts her head down and bangs it straight across the line."  </P> <P>  -- ANN JONES  </P> <P> "Diane keeps her head beautifully on her shoulders."  </P> <P>  -- ANN JONES  </P> <P> "That shot knocked the stuffing out of their sails."  </P> <P>  -- FREW McMILLAN  </P> <P> "They must take their minds off their games and think what tactics to employ  next."  </P> <P>  -- ANN JONES  </P> <P> "We've had no more rain since it stopped raining."  </P> <P>  -- HARRY CARPENTER  </P> <P> "It looks as though the end is over."  </P> <P>  -- DAN MASKELL  </P> <P> Newspaper lead of the week, from the London tabloid the Sun:  </P> <P> "Count Dracula saw off Batman on Wimbledon's Centre Court.  </P> <P> "Sweden's caped crusader Ronnie Bathman (pronounced Batman) spilled some early  blood by taking in the first set against the out-of-touch world No. 1 (Ivan  Lendl).  </P> <P> "But in the end, there was only bad news to relay back to Gotham City . . . "  </P> <P> Boring quote of the week, from Sweden's Mats Wilander:  </P> <P> "I think I am playing very well. I think I am playing better than before. You  just get better. I think I am playing better than last year. I have to wait and  see what's going to happen or something."  </P> <P> Best quote of the week, from Kristine Radford.  </P> <P> The 19-year-old telephoned her mother in Australia to tell her she had won the  first set against Martina Navratilova in a match suspended by darkness:  </P> <P> "Mum was over the moon."  </P> <P> Money talks (louder): Prize money for the champion in men's singles is nearly  100 times more than it was 20 years ago.  </P> <P> The men's singles winner will receive 190,000 British pounds, which is about  $304,000.  </P> <P> In 1968, the first year of the open era, Rod Laver won 2,000 pounds, or about  $3,200.  </P> <P> Only 10 years go, the prize money for Bjorn Borg was 20,000 pounds, or $32,000.  </P> <P> Paul Chamberlin, Dan Goldie and the others who reached the quarterfinals this  year won $38,504 apiece.  </P></p>

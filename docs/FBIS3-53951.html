The Iranian ambassador in Bern, Mohammad Reza Alborzi, said  his Swiss counterpart in Tehran was summoned to the Iranian  Foreign Ministry on Wednesday [19 January] to explain  Switzerland's position.    The ambassador was speaking after the Swiss Broadcasting  Corporation suspended a cooperation agreement with Iranian  Television. The move follows reports that Iranian Television  was used as a front by people involved in the assassination  three years ago of a former Iranian prime minister, Shahpur  Bakhtiyar.</p>

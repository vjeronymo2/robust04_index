			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / The Irish Referendum: Result lifts gloom in bond markets - Markets THE gloomy mood of European bond markets was partially lifted by the Irish referendum result. However, late selling pushed bond prices lower and traders predicted months of uncertainty until the future of monetary union is determined. Yesterday, the biggest gains were posted by high-yielding government bond markets such as Spain and Italy. These have most to gain from monetary union but have fallen sharply since Denmark rejected the Maastricht treaty. Other bond markets showed strong price rises during the morning session as the result of the referendum became clear, but fell back through the afternoon. UK gilts closed almost unchanged on the day, with French and German government bonds finishing slightly lower. 'The pattern is the same in most European markets. There is selling into any rally,' commented Mr George Magnus, international bond analyst at Warburg Securities. Analysts noted the Irish vote did nothing to remove uncertainty over whether Maastricht will be ratified and on what terms monetary union might take place. 'It is going to be a long, tense summer in the run-up to the French referendum,' commented an Italian government bond trader. Spanish government bonds rose around half a point at the benchmark 10-year maturity, adding to gains made on Wednesday and Thursday. However, even after posting a 1 1/2 -point rise on the week, Spanish bonds remain well below the levels before the Danish referendum. At the close yesterday, the benchmark 10-year Spanish government bond stood at around 93.50, still 3 1/2 points below its level on June 2, before the result of the Danish vote was known. The pattern was similar in Italy, with prices rising by up to three quarters of a point in early trading but late selling eroded some gains. Italian bond trading was volatile last week, with sentiment undermined by the weakness of the lira in the European exchange rate mechanism. Traders said the rally was driven by domestic Italian investors.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By David Chazan] </F>   [Excerpts] Kigali, June 2 (AFP) -- Rwandan army and rebel  commanders failed to agree on a ceasefire at United  Nations-mediated truce talks Thursday [2 June] as the rebels  pressed their offensive in the blood-drenched capital.    "We are capable of fighting this war and winning it if that  is the option," Colonel Frank Mugambage of the rebel Rwanda  Patriotic Front (RPF) told reporters after the one-day talks  broke up with an agreement to meet again at an unspecified date.    The mainly Tutsi RPF is demanding an end to massacres of  Tutsis in territory held by the Hutu-led government. Up to half  a million people have been hacked, bludgeoned, burned or  machine-gunned to death since the April 6 death of president  Juvenal Habyarimana in an alleged rocket attack on his plane  pitched the small central African country into frenzied ethnic  bloodletting.    Mugambage, the RPF's deputy commander, and Brigadier General  Marcel Gatsinzi, the army's number two man, promised to  cooperate with the UN in resuming the evacuation of civilians  trapped behind battle lines, and distributing food to millions  of Rwandans threatened by starvation. Evacuations were suspended  Monday because of heavy fighting in Kigali and the failure of  the two sides to guarantee security.    "The ceasefire was briefly addressed, but the evacuation of  civilians and the safety of displaced persons was discussed at  length," UN military spokesman Major Jean-Guy Plante said. "We  have definitely made progress on the safety of our evacuation  procedures and we plan to resume evacuations on Friday," he said.    Deputy UN force commander Brigadier Henry Anyidoho, who  chaired talks between the two sides Monday and Thursday, said  the main obstacles to agreement on a ceasefire were rebel  demands for an end to massacres in government-held territory and  an end to pro- government radio broadcasts inciting violence.    "Our aim was to go into ceasefire talks but then these  obstacles came up," Anyidoho told a news conference after the  talks ended.    Gatsinzi said he would convey the rebel conditions to the  government. [passage omitted]    UN troops have rescued hundreds of Tutsis and Hutu  opposition  supporters stranded behind government lines in Kigali's Mille  Collines hotel, and Hutus holed up in rebel territory in the  Amahoro Stadium.    Kigali has become a ghost town as almost all its 500,000  inhabitants have fled southwards in a perilous search for  safety. The estimated 40,000 who remain rarely venture out into  streets littered with spent shells. Dogs feed on dismembered  bodies from recent massacres in some neighbourhoods.    The mainly Tutsi rebels have surrounded one of the army's  last strongholds in the embattled capital, Camp Kigali, which  they are shelling relentlessly. They are also closing in on the  seat of the self-proclaimed all-Hutu interim government at  Gitarama, 40 kiLometres (25 miles) southwest of the capital.    "The government has pulled most its big guns out of Kigali  and put them in Gitarama," said a UN military observer who  visited the town Wednesday.    With an estimated 20,000 fighters, the rebels are still  heavily outnumbered by an army of well over 30,000 men despite a  wave of desertions in the past two weeks. But the government's  bedraggled, beer-swilling soldiers are demoralised and taking a  pounding from rebel artillery, UN military sources said.    UN commander General Romeo Dallaire meanwhile expressed  frustration that there was still no sign of a promised new  5,500- strong UN force, leaving his 470 men powerless to end  killings at a displaced people's camp at the southern monastery  of Kabgayi.    A military reconnaissance team arrived here Thursday from  Canada, which has pledged 300 soldiers, as Deputy Defence  Minister Robert Fowler flew out after a two-day fact-finding  visit.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> PROSTITUTION RULED TAXABLE  </P> <P> The oldest profession is a taxable profession, the Court of Appeal ruled today,  rejecting a woman's argument that the government was not entitled to share her  immoral earnings.  </P> <P> "The tax man is a pimp and the government is a pimp," Marion Aken, also known  as Miss Whiplash or Lindi St. Claire, said outside court.  </P> <P> Not so, the judges held.  </P> <P> "As regards the propriety of the Inland Revenue seeking to recover the proceeds  by tax of prostitution, the revenue authorities are merely looking at the  accomplished fact of profits from trade," Lord Justice Fox said in giving the  court's opinion.  </P> <P> Lord Justice Parker added: "There is no doubt that prostitution is a trade."  </P> <P> Aken was ordered to pay $99,340, plus the government's legal costs in  responding to her appeal.  </P></p>

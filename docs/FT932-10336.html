			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Old guard gathers to praise God and Stalin: Celebrations marking the Soviet defeat of Germany A DEMONSTRATION by 30,000-40,000 nationalists and communists in central Moscow yesterday was anti-climactically peaceful compared with the May Day gathering of 5,000 in Gagarin Square, where one person was killed and some 500 injured. Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Terekhov, leader of the Union of Officers, had agreed with the Moscow City council that the march on the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany would be peaceful, and it was. It was even moving, as old soldiers, medals tinkling, stepped down the broad streets while patriotic hymns belted out. Symbols which have been at conflict for decades were much in evidence. Orthodox crosses, Russian imperial flags and the hammer and sickle all vied for attention. On the front of the rocket transporter carrying some of the main representatives in the parade were two portraits of Stalin and, on the side, an icon of the Virgin. In Triumfalnaya Square, Col Terekhov introduced a bevy of speakers, whose normal garrulity he strictly controlled. The nationalists and communists pose no great threat to President Boris Yeltsin, but yesterday they delivered a string of nationalist-Stalinist obsequies to the Soviet Union, to God and to the victory won under Stalin. Mr Sergei Baburin, Mephistophelean leader of Russian Unity, said: 'Yes, the French (Yeltsin have again occupied the Kremlin but they will soon be on the road to Smolensk.' General Albert Makashov, the Stalinist who challenged Mr Yeltsin for the presidency two years ago, claimed Russia was a holy land. He ended his speech by seizing an old priest who was blessing everyone, kissing him three times on the cheeks - to his obvious surprise - and shouting 'Hurrah'. In two incidents the anti-semitism displayed on many of the signs was brought to life. In one, two elderly men commented with approval on placards calling for the 'cleansing' of Jews from the media. A woman in her 70s, a row of medals on her chest, turned and said loudly: 'We don't need this. We were all together at the front - Russians Jews, Georgians, Ukrainians. It's true some Jews shout too much now but they fought fascism.' The old men said no more. The second was nastier. In Red Square - to which the demonstration ultimately marched - a beggar was kneeling on the cobbles, his hand out. In front of him half a dozen western photographers were snapping the image of impoverished contemporary Russia, and giving him more money than he would normally clear in a month. Some communists, seeing this, came over and began nudging the beggar with their feet and chasing away the photographers. One man, seeing me taking notes, came over and yelled: 'Make sure you write that all the Jews should end up in Babi Yar' - site of the mass grave in Kiev where a large number of the city's Jews were thrown afer being shot in 1942. A former officer came up, expressed disapproval of his comrade and said: 'That's not necessary. We were together in the war.' And now? 'Now things are pretty rough. But still, we have a lot of nationalities here who lived well together in the Soviet days.' Those bearing the pictures of Stalin and the Jew-baiting banners bobbing about in Red Square looked for a call to arms and, hearing none, dispersed into groups of passionate argument. Before the Bolshoi Theatre across the way Mrs Anna Lichinski held a picture of a young man; the wording below it said that this was her father, Vladimir, missing from the front from November 1942. 'If anyone has information, please address themselves to his daughter.' She had been coming here, she said, for 40 years.</p>

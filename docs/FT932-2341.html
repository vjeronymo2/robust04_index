			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: Indian cement group falls ASSOCIATED Cement Companies, India's largest cement group, reported a sharp fall in profits last year as demand for cement slowed, writes RC Murthy in Bombay. ACC failed to recover fully from cost increases fuelled by double-digit inflation. Sales rose by 7 per cent to Rs15.62bn (Dollars 502.2m) in the year ended March 1993, but gross profits fell by 38 per cent to Rs1.8bn. After provisions, net profit was Rs695m, down from Rs1.1bn the previous year. ACC is the third large company within India's Tata group to report a fall in profits in the year to March. Dividends remained unchanged at Rs3 per share, but the payout of Rs235m was higher than the Rs167.9m paid out in 1991-92 because of a rights issue.</p>

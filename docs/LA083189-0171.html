			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOST IN THE HIMALAYAS;  </P> <P> FAMILY WAITS FOR WORD ON TEACHER IN MISSING PLANE  </P> <P> Nighttime is the worst for Jonas and Judy Sidrys.  </P> <P> That's when the visions come hardest, the haunting images of Jonas' sister,  Vida, stranded or even dead in the brutal Himalaya Mountains where a Pakistani  airliner carrying her and 53 others vanished last week.  </P> <P> "That's when it's daytime over there, and they're conducting the search," said  Jonas, a doctor from Santa Monica who, with his wife, anxiously awaits word of  his sister's status. "That's when you could get a call saying she's dead. It's  almost impossible to sleep."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Massive Search  </P> <P> But despite the fears, the telephone call has yet to come. Vida Sidrys, 35, a  Santa Monica teacher, remains one of the 54 targets of a massive search in the  northern mountain ranges of Pakistan.  </P> <P> She has been missing since the Friday morning, when the twin-engine passenger  plane that was to carry her from the Himalayan tourism hub of Gilgit to a  vacation spot in Islamabad, Pakistan, disappeared from radar screens.  </P> <P> The Pakistani government immediately launched a search for the aging Pakistan  International Airlines plane and its passengers, which included five infants,  but has thus far failed to find any traces.  </P> <P> Authorities said they have no idea why the plane went down.  </P> <P> Heavy rains have slowed the search parties, which are using two large air force  planes, helicopters and a small search plane to scan the Himalayan and  Karakoram ranges.  </P> <P> "We know they are doing what they can," said Judy Sidrys on Wednesday, "but  it's just so frustrating. It's been six days now, and we still have not heard  anything."  </P> <P> Still, hope persists.  </P> <P> "She might have survived," said Jonas, who lives in an apartment downstairs  from Vida's. "Vida is very athletic, very healthy. She also has some experience  in backpacking. She would be able to survive in the outdoors."  </P> <P> Judy said her sister-in-law is also an avid cyclist who rode her bicycle to  Marymont High School, where she teaches Western civilization classes.  </P> <P> "She didn't even own a car," Judy said. "She just rode every day, and that's a  pretty long way from here."  </P> <P> The couple also described Vida as a seasoned globe-trotter.  </P> <P> "She is really interested in exotic places and cultures and she likes to go to  them," Judy said. "Each summer she plans trips to places like Bali, Nepal or  India. That's why she wanted to go to Pakistan."  </P> <P> Judy said she last talked to her sister-in-law about two days before she was to  fly from Los Angeles to Gilgit.  </P> <P> She said the teacher had just returned from visiting family members in Michigan  and was packing for her vacation overseas as they talked.  </P> <P> "She was really excited about this trip," she said. "At first, she didn't think  she'd have the money for it, but she came up with it. She couldn't wait to go."  </P> <P> But Jonas was wary of the trip.  </P> <P> "When I saw her itinerary, I was concerned because there was so much flight  time, so much time . . . in the air," Jonas said. "She was flying over the  Himalayas and that's a dangerous part of the world. There was just too much of  an opportunity for something to go wrong."  </P> <P> Obviously, something did go wrong. But government officials from both the  United States and Pakistan have yet to figure out what.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Find Aircraft  </P> <P> "Right now the Pakistani government is just trying to find the plane and hope  they are alive," said Philip Covington, a spokesman for the U.S. State  Department. "I don't think they are operating under the premise that anyone is  dead.  </P> <P> "Of course, the terrain is brutal, and it would be difficult to survive."  </P> <P> Although they acknowledge that the Pakistanis are doing all they can to find  the aircraft, the Sidrys family still wants the hunt intensified.  </P> <P> "I don't know what's happening," Paul Sidrys, 26, another of Vida's brothers,  said from the family home in Streator, Ill. "But it's hard to judge when you  are halfway around the world."  </P> <P> Judy said her father-in-law has hinted at obtaining a visa to visit Pakistan  just to be close to the search.  </P> <P> "And a friend of (Vida) offered to go over there and help," she said. "But  there's not a whole lot more that can be done. We just wish there were."  </P> <P> Jonas said he also voiced his concern to the office of Rep. Henry A. Waxman  (D-Los Angeles) in an effort to expedite the search.  </P> <P> But for now, the family concedes, there is little they can do to bring Vida  home. They have resigned themselves to spending each day waiting pensively.  </P> <P> And each night in fear.  </P></p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Japanese manufacturers fuel surge in car output UK CAR production jumped by 23.8 per cent last month to reach the highest total for May in 16 years. Output rose to 130,374, from 105,234 in the same month a year ago, helped by the rapid increase in output by Nissan, Toyota and Honda, the three Japanese carmakers that have located their first European car plants in the UK. The scale of the increase stems in part from the weak level of output in May last year, but UK car production has risen strongly in the first five months of this year with an increase of 9.1 per cent to 608,169. The jump in output, which is both for export markets and for the domestic market, is in stark contrast to the steep decline in car output in continental Europe. German car production fell by 23.5 per cent in the first four months of the year to 1.34m, while output in France in the same period fell year-on-year by 13.6 per cent to 1.06m. In the first quarter output in Spain was 29.9 per cent lower than in the same period a year ago, and production in Italy fell by 19.5 per cent. Output in the UK for export markets in the first five months rose by 8.5 per cent to 247,438, while output for the domestic market increased by 9.5 per cent to 360,731, according to figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the Central Statistical Office. The UK - with Ireland - is the only new-car market in western Europe where sales are growing, with an increase of 8.9 per cent in the first five months. Overall new-car sales in western Europe fell year-on-year by about 17.3 per cent. UK output has been boosted by the start-up of plants by Honda and Toyota since late last year. In the first three months of this year Japanese car manufacturers accounted for more than a fifth of UK car production. The optimism generated by the car sector's performance has been tempered by the continuing fall in commercial vehicle production, which fell year-on-year by 32.5 per cent in May and by 20.2 per cent in the first five months to 89,032.</p>

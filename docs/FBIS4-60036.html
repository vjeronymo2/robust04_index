			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Shirin Dahruj from Port Said] </F>   [Text] Dr. Usamah al-Baz, first Foreign Ministry under  secretary and director of the President's Office for Political  Affairs, has denied that the Gulf states are helping the  extremist groups in Egypt. He stressed that the Gulf countries  know that any harm to Egypt's security will bring harm to them.    Speaking at a seminar at the Education College in Port Said,  al-Baz noted that any outside military intervention in Yemen  will further complicate the crisis. He stressed that Egypt will  not intervene militarily in Yemen but will hold intensive  political and diplomatic contacts to end the conflict. Al-Baz  cautioned against conflicts among Arab states. He noted that  such conflicts would give a bad impression of the Arab nation  worldwide.    Al-Baz pointed out that the notion of a Middle East market  was first raised by Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. He  pointed out that before establishing a Middle East market, an  Arab world must be established first.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Alexey Bukalov] </F>   [Text] Rome January 27 TASS--First Deputy Foreign Minister  of Russia Anatoliy Adamishin, who arrived here to prepare the  ground for Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin's official visit  to Italy, has met Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta  to discuss key political, financial and economic problems  included in the agenda of the forthcoming talks. The sides also  exchanged views on several international problems, including the  settlement of conflicts in different parts of the world.    Adamishin told ITAR-TASS that the Russian prime minister's  visit to Italy was initiated by the Italian side and constituted  an important stage in the development of bilateral relations  between the two countries. "1994 promises to be a rather  intensive year in Russo-Italian relations. A G-7 meeting is to  be held at Naples in July. The Italian side, as regular G-7  chairman, has reaffirmed the invitation extended to President  Boris Yeltsin to attend the meeting," Adamishin said.    "Our countries are closely cooperating within the frameworks  of multilateral diplomacy. Russia is ready to help Italy in its  efforts as chairman of the CSCE. There are many points of  contact in the policies of the two countries," he added.    Adamishin said that the policies of the two countries in  such  a painful matter as the Yugoslavian conflict had much in common.  "The Italians, like ourselves, approach very guardedly the ideas  of resorting to forcible actions in this neighbouring region,"  Adamishin stated.    "Political cooperation is being continued in bilateral  relations, too. Italy is our important partner and a treaty on  friendship and cooperation is now in the making. It will be  signed soon. Many agreements, signed between Italy and the  Soviet Union, have been reconcluded.    "The sides have discussed their economic relations. Italy  has granted Russia second largest credits after the German  loans. This 'generosity' of our Italian partners, frankly  speaking, has created definite difficulties in servicing the  credits. After all, they have to be repaid. But even in this  delicate sphere we were able to find mutual understanding and  common language," Adamishin noted. "The level of cooperation in  the economic sphere is very high. For instance, the recently  signed agreement between 'Gazprom' and the Eni group is a vivid  example of the common effort to help improve the trade balance  between the two countries, to develop industrial and  technological cooperation.    "The Russian side expects Chernomyrdin's official visit to  Italy to be successful and to serve the interests of the peoples  of both countries," Adamishin stressed.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY BOARD OKS STUDIES OF 2 MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS  </P> <P> By a narrow margin, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors has decided that  developers who have proposed building two large subdivisions in eastern Ventura  County may proceed with environmental impact reports that will cost a total of  $450,000.  </P> <P> The board voted 3 to 2 this week to allow the studies for the Ahmanson Ranch  and Jordan Ranch subdivisions. Together, the projects would bring 12,000 new  residents and 240 acres of commercial, office and retail space into the rolling  hills near Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> The reports, funded by developers, will be completed by McClelland Consultants,  of Ventura.  </P> <P> Supervisors Susan K. Lacey and John K. Flynn voted against the proposal, saying  they were concerned that the projects would generate air pollution and traffic  and eliminate green space.  </P> <P> "These issues just aren't going to be mitigated in a satisfactory way, no  matter how many environmental impact reports you do," Flynn said. "For me to  vote on the EIR was just another vote for the commitment of the project. It  would be hard for me to face the developer down the road when the EIR comes  back, when I already have these questions in my mind."  </P> <P> Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, who represents Thousand Oaks and the surrounding  area, referred to Tuesday's action as housekeeping and said it would not affect  the county's decisions on the subdivisions.  </P> <P> "This is a perfunctory action which just says, 'Give us more information,' "  Schaefer said.  </P> <P> The vote followed a preliminary report that indicated that county staff members  were concerned that the projects would worsen air pollution, benefit affluent  instead of middle-income buyers and set a precedent in using green space.  </P> <P> The projects are far from approved. Although the board approved the  commissioning of the reports, it must hold public hearings on them before  deciding whether to allow the projects.  </P> <P> But county planners say the subdivisions would deviate from longstanding county  guidelines that attempt to keep development within city limits.  </P> <P> It could also set a dangerous precedent for other developers who want to  proceed with their own plans in land zoned for open space, some planners said.  </P> <P> Ahmanson Land Co. of Irwindale has proposed building 3,000 homes and apartments  and two golf courses on 5,477 acres north of Agoura Hills.  </P> <P> The firm would build offices, high-tech industries, retail businesses and  hotels on 240 acres. It would leave 3,018 acres for open space and 196 acres  for parks.  </P> <P> Potomac Investment Associates of Gaithersburg, Md., has proposed 1,152 houses  and apartments and a PGA Tournament golf course on a 2,308-acre tract west of  the Jordan Ranch project.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Krasimir Tomov: "Corridor of War"] </F>   [Text] The spectacle of government and parliament that was  staged over the UN corridor for transporting military equipment  for the U.S. "Blue Helmets" in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] was as touching as a soap opera.  For all more or less informed observers it was clear that U.S.  Ambassador William Montgomery did not waste his time during the  days preceding the decision, and that the decision to allow the  armored carriers to cross Bulgaria has practically been made.  Certain sums of U.S. dollars, no more than pennies compared  with what we lose from the Yugoslav embargo, entered the safes  of the Bulgarian National Bank in the last two days.  Apparently, this golden dew was a weighty argument for some  people, even though very soon this miserable pittance will be  returned to its original owners, without leaving a trace in the  Bulgarian economy and finances.    Our multicolored parliament made an effort to utilize the  case that it was served by the UN general secretary and his  tacit representative in Bulgaria, Mr. Montgomery, to stage a new  exercise in political demagogy. All the tales were told on the  morning of 16 April. Even Mr. Savov [chairman of the Union of  Democratic Forces parliamentary faction] was defending from the  rostrum of parliament an employee of the U.S. Embassy. Only one  thing remained unsaid: From where and through what channels did  Butrus-Ghali's request for the transportation corridor come to  Bulgaria? Through our representative at the United Nations?  Through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? Was the request sent  straight to the government, or was it really conveyed only  through the U.S. ambassador?    This directly returns us to a statement that a Russian  politician made some 10 days ago that the international  organization has become a branch of the U.S. State Department.    Indeed, Montgomery came to our country with a clearly  announced agenda. Usually the heads of sovereign states refuse  to accept the credentials of diplomats who come with such an  agenda. When this did not happen to the gentleman in question,  he obviously began to expand the range of his activity. He is  no longer working to found ethnic parties and to pass the  relevant constitutional amendments, (such parties exist despite  what our Constitution says about it), but rather directly to  turn Bulgaria into a side to the existing conflict and budding  conflicts.    This is actually what Montgomery is being paid for.    However, it is not clear what the Bulgarian National  Assembly  are being paid for by the taxpayers. They are so carried away  in their efforts to turn our country's face toward Europe, which  they have actually replaced with the United States, that they  forgot our country's other end.    Of course, there always is the possibility that they could  not care less. In this case we recommend that they read "The  Life and Suffering of Sinner Sofroniy" by Sofroniy Vrachanski  [describing the plight of the Bulgarian people under Turkish  rule in the second half of the 18th century].    To return to the UN request. The basic argument is that  Bulgaria is the only state that has a border with Macedonia that  is convenient for the transportation of military equipment for  the U.S. "Blue Helmets" in Macedonia. A brief glance at the map  shows that the Greek-Macedonian border is no less convenient,  and that the military equipment could be transported to Greece  by sea. However, even though the Greeks are NATO members, they  refuse to do this. They suspect that behind the armored carriers  of the UN convoy there is Antalya smoke and also that particular  article of the Macedonian Constitution that claims territories  now outside Macedonia's borders. Perhaps the Greeks crossed the  borders of prudence with their rallies and economic blockades,  but the Bulgarian politicians must be aware of our history and  remember how in 1912-13 (after the victory over Turkey) that  particular territory [Macedonia], created by the Berlin  Congress, was divided among Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria.  Whether it was just or not is another question, but even if we  start singing again "Allies-Robbers" [patriotic song of the  Balkan wars], the banal fact remains that this particular  article of the Macedonian Constitution also applies to the Pirin  region. Let us remember that Ambassador Montgomery specifically  promised the Senate commission to work for the establishment of  a Macedonian party in Bulgaria.    All the rest -- for example, the international commitments  officially assumed by our country -- is empty talk. Nowhere in  those commitments is it said that we should allow any troops,  arms, or military equipment through Bulgarian territory.    The truth is that the UN could transport those wretched 20  or  so vehicles with a few short flights of Hercules aircraft. This  would be hardly more expensive than, for example, that senseless  military action in Somalia. And let us not forget that Bulgaria  also participates in the financing of the United Nations, in  accordance with its modest means.    The truth is that the establishment of a precedent was  sought. Now it exists. After the armored carriers of the U.S.  "Blue Helmets" there will come the tanks of the Turkish "Blue  Helmets." And afterward why not Turkish battalions? Such things  have happened in history, but apparently it does not exist for  politicians.    Thus the corridor of war already exists. May God and  Montgomery save us!</p>

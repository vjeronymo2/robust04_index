			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: MacSharry stands out against CAP compromise THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday dissociated itself from attempts by the current Portuguese presidency of the European Community to limit the cuts in subsidised cereals prices envisaged under Brussels plans to reform the common agricultural policy. Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, told farm ministers he would not let go of this central plank of his reform proposals. He took the unprecedented step of getting his opposition written in as a dissenting opinion in the presidency's latest compromise paper on CAP reform. This was presented to ministers here yesterday and confirmed Portugal's intention to try to broker agreement on a new target price for cereals of Ecu112 (Pounds 78) a tonne by the 1995-96 season, well above the Ecu105 the commission is prepared to accept. The presidency's proposal amounts to a 27 per cent cut on current price levels of around Ecu155 per tonne, against the 35 per cent cut originally sought by the commission. The commission needs a weighted majority of member states to get its proposals through, but only the unanimity of the 12 can force it to change them. The wide spread of different interests make this very unlikely, but a reform package which looked within reach could now be receding. Mr MacSharry made clear yesterday he would not move as far as the presidency. 'I've always said we are prepared to be flexible,' he said before the hard bargaining started. 'But we have to have a (cereals) price which is competitive.' He later told ministers that 'Ecu105 is the limit of competitiveness. . . it is not a question of bargaining around an arbitrary price. At Ecu112 the surplus in cereals is some 8m tonnes greater than at Ecu105, in which case the set-aside requirement would increase to 22 per cent,' he warned. The 'set-aside' requirement now envisages taking 15 per cent of land out of production as a condition for receiving compensation for the cuts. Presidency officials argued yesterday that their softening of the reform proposals was what now made an agreement likely. The commission retorted that there was no point in a reform which failed to address the fundamental problems of oversupply and would require remedial action later. Cheaper cereals for feedstock, moreover, are meant to offset cuts in the dairy and meat sectors, and commission officials expect that ministers will therefore seek to limit these cuts too if the Portuguese price targets for grains are accepted. The presidency compromise makes other controversial changes in: Compensation: which it wants for all land set-aside, whereas Brussels had excluded larger-scale farmers. This was partly to address British protests that their big farms were being discriminated against. 'There is no doubt that in the major areas (the presidency paper) is moving in our direction,' said Mr John Gummer, UK farm minister. Livestock: where limits on the number of cattle per hectare the EC would finance have been loosened, in a way the commission believes will encourage production and increase surpluses. The commission has had no constant allies on reform, but it is not without fellow-travellers on cereals. The UK, Netherlands and Denmark want deeper cuts; crucially, so does France, which fears that the alternative would be administrative restraints on production that would cripple its huge and competitive grains sector.</p>

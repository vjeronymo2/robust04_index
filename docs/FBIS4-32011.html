			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 15 (CTK) -- Bilingual road signs  in towns and villages inhabited by ethnic minority populations  are part of the European standard which should be reached by  Slovakia before the autumn elections, Pal Farkas, deputy  chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH),  today told CTK. "If a new government bill on place names, to be  submitted on Friday [17 June], is acceptable for us and the  coalition I see no reason why it should not be discussed at the  next parliamentary session," he said.    He admitted that he told the Coalition Council today that  the  government should not necessarily be supported by Hungarian  deputies who secure its majority in parliament. "It was  necessary to recall that our agreement with the coalition as  well as the recommendations by the Council of Europe are in  effect. According to the agreement we support the government  provided it solves this problem also. If the coalition is  unwilling to do so nobody can expect blind support from us," he  said. "We are flexible to a certain extent. If a new bill  allows for a referendum to decide on bilingual road signs then  we would be able to back it," Farkas said.    He said that aggravation of the problems surrounding the  place names law can indisputably be ascribed to the election  campaign in which the national feelings of voters are exploited,  he said. "For us, however, it is a question of our identity.  We live here, and have our own language so why should not we  name our villages and towns in our native language as it is  generally accepted everywhere in Europe," Farkas said.</p>

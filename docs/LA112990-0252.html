			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> TENNESSEE ERNIE STILL 'THRILLED'  </P> <P> It's been a few weeks since Tennessee Ernie Ford was elected to the Country  Music Hall of Fame, but he says he still hasn't come out of the clouds.  </P> <P> "I've got the gear down, but I'm not quite on the ground," Ford said.  </P> <P> "It was totally a surprise because I had some pretty stiff competition.  Needless to say, I'm thrilled."  </P> <P> Ford received the prestigious award during the Country Music Assn.'s Awards  show telecast here Oct. 8.  </P> <P> "It means that over the years, you have accomplished something in your career,"  Ford said. "It meant so much to me, and it gave me a very nice warm feeling,  with the people, the way they reacted, the way they stood up that night."  </P> <P> "The nicest thing that people say to me now wherever I go is 'I feel like I  know you.' That's before they say anything about the show or about my singing.  'I feel like I know you.' "  </P></p>

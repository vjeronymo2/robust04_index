They are a mighty people, they are  a mighty people, yes, they are a mighty people.    When these bullets were fired to announce a rebirth of this  people, they were telling the Zionist and imperialist plot that  it could not remove this people from the annals of history as  international Zionism and imperialism had tried to do, as the  Zionists and imperialists had tried to do. They had tried to  erase this people from the annals of history. Let us remember  what the Zionists and imperialists said: A land without people  [Palestine] for a people without a homeland [the Jews].    [Passage omitted] O my brothers, my beloved, we are now in  the midst of a political battle of negotiations. It is  ruthless, ruthless. However, at the same time it crowns the  blessed intifadah, which is still burning over our Palestinian  land.    I am telling you that together we will confront all these  attempts and all these plots. Let Rabin and Peres be aware that  no one among the Palestinian people will kneel down or submit.  They may be able to continue occupying this land but no one can  humiliate or dishonor the Palestinian people; they are a great  people, a great people.    Therefore, brothers, the pledge remains the same. Honorable  martyrs, the pledge remains the same and the oath remains the  same. We will continue on this path until the Palestinian flag  is hoisted; until the Palestinian flag is hoisted by our new  generals, the children of the stones, over the walls of  Jerusalem, the mosques of Jerusalem, and the churches of  Jerusalem. They see it as distant but we see it as close. We  are sincere. [passage omitted]    O brothers, beloved, beloved, O beloved martyrs, O martyrs  who are more honorable than us, the pledge, yet again, the  pledge, the pledge remains the same and the oath lremains the  same. Together and side by side until we reach Palestine  [repeats], until we reach Jerusalem [repeats four time].  Together until victory, victory, victory.</p>

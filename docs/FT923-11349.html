			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / A testing dilemma The citizens of Illinois have recently ended a well-meaning but ultimately vain attempt to combat Aids. For nearly two years, all couples planning to marry had to be tested for HIV. In theory, it was a good idea - but the people of Illinois did not agree. Loving couples either postponed marriage, or got married in another state. In the first 12 months, only 159,000 people were tested, at a cost of Dollars 5.6m (Pounds 2.9m). Of those tested, a mere 23 were HIV positive. Faced with this great cost, the state caved in: the world's most ambitious experiment in compulsory mass HIV testing collapsed. In Cuba, people found to be HIV positive are forcibly quarantined. Quarantining is also legal in Norway, but has not been put into practice for political reasons. Nevertheless, experts at this week's Amsterdam conference warned that 'criminalisation' of HIV not only does not work; it is also ethically objectionable. In Sweden, however, 98 per cent of pregnant women are tested for HIV voluntarily. Norway also tests pregnant women. So mass testing, on a voluntary basis, can work. But with ever more gloomy forecasts about the global spread of HIV, the issue of compulsory HIV testing remains. Ericsson, the Swedish electrical multinational, tests managers about to go abroad to high risk areas, simply because HIV infection impairs resistance to other diseases. In the UK, companies such as Unilever test managers recruited in high risk areas, on the grounds that they may travel to countries which require a negative HIV test before a work permit is granted. The US Army screens recruits and rejects those who are HIV-positive, and tests all servicemen and women about every 18 months. The policy seems to have worked. The rate of HIV infection has been dropping; in fact, the US Air Force is making tests less frequent, because its rate has dropped so low. So mass screening can work, at least in certain circumstances. The fear is the stigmatisation and ostracism that often follows revelation of HIV positive status. Whether or not there is also a new rare undetectable strain of immune deficiency virus, we will soon have to think hard about where and when to test our citizens for HIV. We shall need to learn the lessons from Illinois, confront the issues of civil liberties and stigma, but be sturdily aware that, in a matter of such consequence, the ultimate justification may lie not in the private indulgence of the individual but in the public health of the nation.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Gabriel Larios Ochaita took office as  Constitutionality Court (CC) president in a ceremony at the  court's hearing room at 1900 last night.    The ceremony began with the singing of the national anthem  followed by a minute of silence in memory of Epaminondas  Gonzalez Dubon who was CC president until Good Friday [1 April),  when he was assassinated.    In his speech, President Ramiro de Leon Carpio said his mind  and heart were filled with two conflicting feelings regarding  memories of Gonzalez: The first memory is his participation as  president of the Commission of 30, which drafted the  Constitution, and his role as alternate president of the  National Constituent Assembly, which issued the current  Constitution; and the second memory is his regrettable and  painful death.</p>

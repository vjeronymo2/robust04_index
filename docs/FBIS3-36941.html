			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>   [Text] Reliable sources in the Russian Foreign Ministry  have told Interfax that the Russian president's special envoy,  deputy Russian Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, leaves  Wednesday for Geneva to take part in the Thursday round of talks  on settlement of the Bosnian crisis.    Under consideration in Geneva will be the Russian proposal  on  demilitarization of the area around Sarajevo and its transfer  under UN authority for a transitional period, a senior diplomat  has told Interfax.    He believes under present conditions the Russian initiative  has a good chance of being approved by the conflicting Bosnian  factions. In addition to the representatives of the warring  sides, taking part in the talks will be co-chairmen of the  international conference on settlement in the former Yugoslavia  Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, as well as special envoys of  the Russian and U.S. presidents, Vitaliy Churkin and Charles  Redman.    The diplomat said that the Russian initiative opens the way  for a peaceful settlement of the Bosnian crisis. "We believe  that the proposal on air strikes to support UN forces in the  former Yugoslavia is the worst of all possible options," he  said. The implementation of the Russian initiative would solve  the problem, said the diplomat.    He said that most European countries believe that there are  enough UN Security Council resolutions to allow NATO air strikes  in Bosnia-Herzegovina if the Secretary-General asks for them.  Russia does not share such an approach because it believes the  decision on air strikes should be taken by the UN Security  Council, he said.    The diplomat said that the NATO countries would advance a  sort of ultimatum to the conflicting sides. Judging by  everything, he said, they will be demanded to stop shelling of  Sarajevo, withdraw within seven days all heavy weaponry from the  adjacent region, and hand it over under UN control. If the  demands are not met, NATO planes will be ready to make air  strikes on the violating party, he said.</p>

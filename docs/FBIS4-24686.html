			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, June 1 (XINHUA) -- Foreign-funded  enterprises are taking an increasingly important role in the  economy of this north China port city, according to the  foreign-funded enterprises list for 1993 released by the Tianjin  Statistics Bureau Tuesday [31 May].    According to the list, there were 56 foreign-funded  enterprises last year with sales value of over 50 million yuan  (about 5.7 million U.S. dollars) each. Their total sales value  reached 11 billion yuan (about 1.26 billion U.S. dollars).    A Sino-American joint venture, the Tianjin Otis Elevator Co.  Ltd, is at the top of the list, with over one billion U.S.  dollars-worth of annual sales.    Many of the listed enterprises are world-famous  transnational  companies like America's Motorola, Philip Morris and Coca-Cola,  Japan's NEC, Honda and Yamaha, France's Hennessy and Italy's  Zanussi.    The products of these foreign-funded enterprises vary from  food, machinery and medicines to clothes, with most of them  becoming hot sellers in Mainland China.    In the first four months of this year foreign-funded  enterprises in Tianjin continued to boom, with sales income  increasing 1.17 times over the same period of last year.    So far, the number of contracted foreign-funded enterprises  has reached 7,000.</p>

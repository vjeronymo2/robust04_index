			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Sandoz shows 'solid' growth Sandoz, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals company, yesterday reported first-half sales up 2 per cent to SFr8.22bn (Dollars 6bn). The figures suffered from the weakness of the US dollar and strength of the Swiss franc. In local currencies, growth was described by the company as 'solid' at 8 per cent. The turnover was at the low end of expectations, although Sandoz registered shares increased SFr11 to SFr659. No profits figures were disclosed. First-half trading figures will be released at the end of August. Sales at the pharmaceuticals division fell 1 per cent to SFr3.59bn. In local currency they increased 4 per cent if divestments by Biochemie, a wholly-owned subsidiary, were excluded. Biochemie sold a Spanish antibiotics plant at Santa Perpetua de Mogoda to Gist Brocades in July last year. The nutrition division reported sales up 29 per cent to SFr1.15bn, an increase of 38 per cent in local currencies. Sandoz said the strong increase was mostly the result of acquisitions. Sales of Gerber Products, the US baby-food manufacturer Sandoz is buying for Dollars 3.7bn, were not included. The chemicals operations reported sales down 8 per cent from SFr1.31bn to SFr1.21bn, a fall of 2 per cent in local currencies. Excluding the divestment of Alphen, the plastics additives company sold to Schenectady International of New York in December, sales increased 1 per cent.</p>

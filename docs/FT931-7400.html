			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Pre-budget blues vanish in Bombay equity rally - But political worries remain Each February, pre-budget blues grip Indian equity markets as investors fret over possible increases in excise duties and taxes. Share prices tend to drift in a narrow range and trading contracts as traders refrain from committing themselves. However, this year, things are different - and anything but dull. The month started with shares rising sharply in the hope that the budget for the fiscal year from April 1 will boost the market, rather than deflate it. Far from worrying about possible tax increases, traders talked excitedly of tax cuts, and growth-promoting measures. The violence, and the political crisis following the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque almost slipped from investors' minds. But in the past two weeks, politics has come back to the fore, putting equities into some confusion with a fall, and a subsequent recovery. The mood now is finely balanced between worries about politics - including the stability of the government at New Delhi. There are also hopes that, after two years of stagnation, the economy is set for sustained growth. Speculation has intensified on stock exchange floors about the tax cuts and incentives which the PV Narasimha Rao administration plans to introduce in the budget to be presented on February 27. Import tariffs are expected to be cut on a wide front and the finance minister has before him an expert committee suggestion that corporate tax should be lowered to 30 per cent, from 42.5 per cent at present. Fertiliser shares and scrips of a dozen export-oriented companies led the rally earlier this month on the Bombay stock exchange, India's largest, accounting for two-thirds of national trading. The BSE 30-share index jumped by more than 160 points to a three-month peak of 2,812. The market had been subdued for the previous six months, as a parliamentary committee probed the Rs35bn securities scandal involving Mr Harshad Mehta, the ultra-bullish broker who helped to lift share values to an all-time peak of 4,500 last April. In the recent short bull run, Zuari Agrochemicals jumped by 10 per cent while Gujarat State Fertilisers and Gujarat Narmada Fertilisers were up by 8 per cent on reports of budget incentives to boost fertiliser production. Bombay Dyeing and the Birla-owned Century Textiles posted a 7 per cent increase. Textiles, and other exporting companies wallowed on expectations of the rupee being made fully convertible for trade transactions. The Indian currency has shown weakness against the US dollar on foreign exchange markets recently, and a switch from the present dual exchange rate, if announced in the budget, would give a bonanza to exporters. But the market was jolted and the rally aborted some two weeks ago by three major political events. First, the Bharatiya Janata party, which was responsible for the destruction of Babri Mosque at Ayodhya in December, expressed its determination to press ahead with a banned meeting in New Delhi tomorrow, triggering apprehension about renewed violence. Secondly, demands for the removal of the chief minister of Maharashtra province, Mr SA Naik, a protege of Mr Narasimha Rao, have been intensified. And, finally, relations between Congress and the local party which rules the southern state of Tamil Nadu, whose support is vital for the survival of the prime minister, have soured. Share prices tumbled 140 points early this week but recovered some ground on Wednesday as the political situation thawed. 'The (stock) market is poised for a rise,' says Mr MR Mayya, BSE executive director. 'It all depends on political developments.'</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 9 FOR THE '90S;  </P> <P> BE THEY 9 OR 89, INDIVIDUALS HARBOR STRONG IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS;  </P> <P> ZIGS AND ZAGS  </P> <P> Artie Shaw, at 79, describes himself as "getting to a nice curmudgeonly state.  I was a young fogie. Now I'm a good old one."  </P> <P> At his most curmudgeonly, the legendary bandleader-clarinetist, who lives  quietly in Newbury Park and is writing his fourth book, says of the coming  decade: "I'm delighted to see we're going to get into the '90s. For a long time  I've been doubting that. And I have a strong doubt we'll get into the next  century."  </P> <P> Progress zigs and zags, Shaw observes, "and we're on a big zag right now."  </P> <P> He despairs of a human race intent on "covering (the earth) with cement,"  "cutting the horns off rhinos" and "screwing ourselves up" through technology.  </P> <P> He considers himself "as close to being sane as I know of." He lectures often,  helping people make sense of the information overload. "Everybody's up to his  nostrils in ignorance," he says. "I'm a professional confusion defuser."  </P> <P> Although acknowledged as one of the world's greatest living clarinetists, he  dismisses that superlative, saying, "What are the criteria? It's all in the ear  of the beholder."  </P> <P> He hasn't touched the clarinet since 1954. No, not even for his own amusement.  "How can it be amusing?" he asks. "It's like asking a fighter if he goes into  the ring for his own amusement. It's very hard work. You're always trying to do  what you did better."  </P> <P> But even today, he says, "my fingers are playing music. I wake up with dreams  of looking for the concert hall, the theater. . . . " Still, he "hated,  loathed" being a celebrity and the price it exacted.  </P> <P> In the '30s and '40s, that meant endless one-night-stands. He says, "My  definition of hell is to have to play 'Begin the Beguine' (his 1938 classic)  the rest of my life. Now, Cole Porter wrote a damned good piece of music, but.  . . . "  </P> <P> There's still an Artie Shaw band on the road, but Shaw himself is a homebody  who believes "the best trip is the one where you can be home by noon."  </P> <P> Wed eight times -- his wives included Lana Turner and Ava Gardner -- he says he  and companion Midge Hayes, a former librarian, have no plans to marry: "We both  did that."  </P> <P> People send him records, most of which he considers "a lot of noise and a lot  of anger . . . most of the so-called music, rock and all that, it's glitz . . .  show business."  </P> <P> Back to the future -- "I hope we make it," Shaw says, adding, "whatever  happens, I'm going to be doing what I like when it does."

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Soap success for Brazil's Globo THERE are few countries in the world which have not shown a Brazilian television soap opera or do not have one on its screens. The popularity of these novelas has made TV Globo, the main Brazilian channel, a leading exporter of programmes, with overseas sales of Dollars 25m last year. Globo novelas have been bought by 120 countries and are showing in 67, says Mr Jorge Adib, head of overseas sales and marketing. Of last year's Globo overseas sales, all but Dollars 1.5m came from novelas. The company now has a new success with a format already sold for Dollars 3m to 21 countries, including the US, Germany and France. Called Voce Decide (You Decide), it consists of a 40-minute drama interrupted at the crucial moment by a presenter asking viewers to call in and vote for one of two possible endings, both ready for transmission. This caused controversy in Brazil, where viewers' tendency to vote for the less ethical end has led to talk of a collapse of the moral fabric of society. Globo's copyright enables it to sell the idea rather than ready-made programmes. Some countries have bought the format, but others also buy the dramas and use their own presenters. The fee depends on audience size, so Germany pays Dollars 12,000-15,000 per episode, Paraguay just Dollars 300. Mr Adib is delighted: 'Soaps everyone does - but, for the first time, we are selling a genuinely Brazilian creation.' In 1975, when Globo began to sell abroad, 'we were very third world and mostly just sold goals from football matches,' says Mr Adib. The big breakthrough came in the early 1980s with its costume drama Isaura, Slave-girl, a Brazilian variation on Gone with the Wind. This was even sold behind the iron curtain, which then never bought from the west. The leading actress was mobbed in the streets of Beijing. Soon Globo became known to the world's main TV buyers and is now accepted as a top producer. The biggest market for the four novelas it makes a year is Portugal (Brazil's language is Portuguese), where two Globo productions on rival channels are vying for top of the ratings.</p>

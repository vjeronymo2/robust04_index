			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Wine levy row leads France to block EC VAT plan FRANCE is to block adoption of this week's provisional accord on European Community value added tax and excise duties rather than upset its farmers before the September referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The British presidency of the EC had hoped to break down outstanding French objections to Monday's deal by midnight last night. But France said yesterday it would not abandon its demand that EC members should impose a tiny 'control levy' on their wine producers and needed more time to discuss the issue. According to French officials in Brussels, France's nominal duty of Ecu3 - about Pounds 2.15 - per 100 litres of wine helps it monitor the quality of wine production. The small amount of administration involved means wine-growers have to operate in a reasonably business-like way. France is alone in wanting the same system to apply to countries such as Germany and Italy, which under EC proposals could continue to exempt their wine from duty. The French stand appears to be based on a point of principle and on a desire to avoid aggravating tense relations with its farmers before the September 20 referendum. French wine-growers are said to be worried about imports of low-quality 'unmonitored' wine from Italy, for example. Monday's late-night meeting of EC finance ministers came within a hair's breadth of the required unanimous agreement on a complex package of eight indirect tax directives. The French stand will delay formal adoption of Monday's breakthrough deal until the next meeting on September 28. A legally binding agreement on indirect tax - including a minimum standard VAT rate - is regarded as a prerequisite for the barrier-free single market. Although British officials said they were disappointed and 'flummoxed' by France's intransigence, they do not believe it will put the whole package at risk or delay the lifting of frontier controls on January 1 1993. 'I think we would all look a bit foolish if the whole deal were to break down over Ecu3 per hectolitre of wine,' said one UK official. France also has reservations about the proposed minimum duty on mineral oils, which it believes is too low, and about plans to allow Germany and the Netherlands to maintain reduced rates of VAT for flowers and other agricultural products. Reduced rates were lifted in France last year on the understanding that other EC member states would have to follow suit. French objections on these points are less fundamental than its call for an EC-wide wine levy. The dispute between Britain and Spain over the taxing of sherry is also unresolved, despite further bilateral talks yesterday. Spain wants Britain to bring the duty on British sherry in line with that on the Spanish product, which is taxed more heavily.</p>

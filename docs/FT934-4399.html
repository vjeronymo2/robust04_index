			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Profits rise at NZ electricity company New Zealand's state-owned Electricity Corporation yesterday announced a profit of NZDollars 256m (USDollars 140m) for the six months to September 30, almost NZDollars 100m more than in the comparable period last year, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. The government is under pressure from the business community to privatise the company, its most valuable remaining unsold state asset. However, this week the new finance minister Mr Bill Birch repeated the prime minister's pre-election promise that it would not be sold. Revenue rose by NZDollars 22m to NZDollars 899m, helped by a 6.2 per cent rise in volumes. Price rises were limited to 2 per cent, which the company said meant real prices for electricity had fallen 15 per cent since 1987. The company had a 12 per cent return on shareholders' funds.</p>

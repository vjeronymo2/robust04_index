So  says a study by the Bilbao Vizcaya Bank [BBV] Foundation titled  "Tendencias sociales en Espana (1960-1990)" that was released  yesterday in Madrid. Increased identification of Spaniards with  their region or hometown (rather than the nation) and greater  awareness of inequalities are two more new tendencies engendered  by the [democratic] transition, the study says.    Unemployment is the country's biggest problem, according to  58 percent of Spaniards. This is one of the conclusions of  "Tendencias sociales en Espana," in which 34 Spanish researchers  participated. The three volume study coordinated by sociologist  Salustiano del Campo forms part of an international project,  "Cartography of Social Change," which is designed to produce a  comparative analysis of social structures of the most advanced  countries.    The Spanish study emphasizes that whereas the process of  dramatic change was effected in European societies in the 19th  century, it did not come to Spain until the years 1960-1975. Key  factors in its evolution have been the constant growth  experienced by the Spanish economy since 1961--GDP increased 65  percent between 1975 and 1991--and securities exchange  modernizations engendered by the transition process.    Despite these transformations, "Spain's four horsemen of the  apocalypse" continue to be--as they have been for the last 20  years--unemployment, drugs, crime, and terrorism, although their  relative importance has shifted. Terrorism, which in the early  1980's was described by half of all Spaniards as one of the  country's three biggest problems, is now of urgent concern to  only one out of four Spaniards surveyed. The fading concern  about terrorism is counterbalanced by increasing alarm about  crime. Whereas in the early 1980's crime was considered cause  for concern by only 15 percent of Spaniards, it was cited by  34.4 percent of those queried in the most recent survey. The  study also notes the growing importance of a "fifth horseman,"  economic recession.    "The idea that people have about these problems is that each  time resolving them is more difficult than it was the time  before," says the study, noting that this "high degree of  pessimism" is of "critical importance for creating mechanisms to  stimulate the changes Spanish society needs" to facilitate a  solution.    Moreover, Spaniards are showing confidence in the future and  "moderate optimism with respect to their personal prospects."  This attitude, apparently contradictory to the former, is  explained by the study as a possible "defense mechanism against  pessimistic visions of the country's future." "Well,  expectations now are significantly lower than they were in  buoyant times, when general conditions were less alarming."    Among trends introduced by the democratic transition, the  study highlighted an increase in feelings of belonging at the  local level, to the detriment of identification with wider  geographical spheres such as the national or supranational. In  1981, 40 percent said they most strongly identified with their  home locality, 17 percent with their region, and 34 percent with  Spain. A decade later, only 21 percent felt their Spanish  nationality was most important, compared to 45 percent who  identified at the local level, and 16 percent who identified  with their region.    Examining the economic factors, the study emphasized the  existence of developmental inequalities among the autonomous  communities. Social solidarity mechanisms and migratory  movements have prevented these disequilibria from being  translated into inequalities in personal income. In the 1980's  Madrid, the Basque Country, Cantabria, and Asturias grew less  rapidly than the rest of the communities. Madrid's regression  was explained by the "greater tax burden or exceptional  efficiency of tax collection."</p>

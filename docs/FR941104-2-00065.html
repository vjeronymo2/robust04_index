However, human intervention in the form of restoration projects can promote the recovery of resources impacted by oil spills. Therefore, the Trustees concentrated their damage assessment and restoration efforts on the recovery of seabird populations, especially alcids, impacted by the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Apex Houston <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  oil spill. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatives considered for seabird restoration included active recolonization/restoration projects and habitat acquisition projects. Alternatives were compared based on their monetary costs, benefits to local populations of the impacted species, and location relative to impacted areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recolonization/restoration efforts were considered for common murres and rhinoceros auklets, two seabird species that suffered high mortality as a result of the spill. The rhinoceros auklet project involved use of artificial nest sites to enhance breeding populations along the central California coast. The common murre recolonization project (described herein for public comment) was given higher priority because its potential benefits were linked more closely to the injuries caused by the spill. Most of the impacted common murres came from local colonies, whereas many of the dead auklets were wintering birds that nest north of the impacted area. A third restoration project involving construction of a seabird breeding and rehabilitation facility was rejected because its cost was prohibitive relative to settlement funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four habitat acquisition projects were considered: purchase of Cape Vizcaino in northern Mendocino County to protect nesting seabirds, purchase of coastal land near Castle Rock to protect a mainland colony of common murres, purchase of lands within San Francisco Bay, and purchase of marbled murrelet nesting habitat along the central California coast. The first three projects were given lower priorities because they were outside of the area impacted by the spill (Cape Vizcaino), were too costly (mainland site near Castle Rock), or were beneficial primarily to species that were not affected by the spill (sites in San Francisco Bay). A restoration plan describing the marbled murrelet habitat acquisition project will be made public at a later date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Preferred Alternative: Recolonization of Impacted Common Murre Colonies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The project the Trustee's prefer and on which public comment is invited is the recolonization of common murre colonies at Devil's Slide and San Pedro rocks in San Mateo County and Castle and Hurricane Point Rocks in Monterey County. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A.

This population sustained severe losses from commercial and subsistence egging in the 1800's and early 1900's, from chronic oil pollution and spills in the early to mid 1900's, and from chronic oil spills and gill-netting in the 1980's and 1990's. Common murres were last recorded breeding at San Pedro Rock in 1909, when the colony was in the process of being extirpated by egg collectors (Ray 1909). The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Apex Houston <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  spill in 1986 contributed significantly to the loss of the Devil's Slide Rock colony near San Francisco. The San Pedro and Devil's Slide Rocks colonies are in close proximity and constitute the only common murre colonies between San Francisco and Monterey. This is a large portion of the range of the central California common murre population. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

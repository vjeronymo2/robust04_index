			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / France and Germany back EC expansion FRANCE and Germany yesterday supported the early enlargement of the European Community to include members of the European Free Trade Association, and urged that membership negotiations should start as soon as possible. At the end of a two-day summit in La Rochelle, President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl said their two governments welcomed the candidacies of those Efta countries - Austria, Sweden and Finland - which have applied to join the Community. They said these countries had shown they were willing to accept the Community as it is and to join member states in their progress towards the European union, as set out in the Treaty of Maastricht. They were convinced that the membership of these countries would reinforce the European Union, economically and politically. The two leaders also formalised their decision to set up a joint Franco-German corps of some 35,000 men, which would be operational in 1995. They said the new unit would contribute to giving the European Union its own military capacity, and called on the other members of the nine-nation Western European Union defence grouping to join the new European corps. Mr Mitterrand said Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain had shown interest in taking part in the corps. French officials expect an early decision by Belgium and Luxembourg, but say the Spanish military are more cautious. The two leaders rejected criticisms from some US officials that the new corps would undermine the Atlantic Alliance. 'No one who follows the question seriously can have any worries,' said Mr Kohl. 'The Americans have been telling us for years that we should build Europe, including defence and security. It is clear that the new corps is an addition to the alliance.' The French and German leaders also made clear that they were determined to press ahead with the Maastricht blueprint for European union, regardless of the result of the Danish referendum on June 2. Some recent opinion polls have suggested that the Danish electorate could reject the Maastricht Treaty, which could create a legal problem. The two governments also agreed to undertake a joint high-speed rail network which would link Paris to Berlin and beyond, eventually reaching Vienna, Budapest and Moscow. French ministers hope the link will be built around 2000.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 16 (CNA) -- Acting to respond to the  government's efforts to correct the nation's chronic towering  trade deficit with Japan, business figures on Monday [16 May]  echoed and endorsed a government plan to set up a privately  owned holding company.    At a meeting with Board of Foreign Trade officials and  private sector representatives Monday, Kao Ching-yuan, chairman  of the Chinese National Federation of Industries, gave his  backing to the proposed company, and suggested that the  government finance the company's research and development  projects after its establishment.    A follow-up meeting scheduled for June 9 by the Ministry of  Economic Affairs is set to make further plans regarding the  company's proposed opening date and what products it will make  in trying to replace Japanese imports, the board said.    The board said the holding company would first begin  producing key parts and components that are imported from Japan  to the tune of US$50 million each on a yearly basis.    Taiwan posted a trade surplus of US$4.96 billion in the  first  four months of the year, up 4.5 percent from the same period  last year. But its deficit with Japan was US$14.22 billion last  year, and the figure is expected to hit US$15.5 billion this  year.</p>

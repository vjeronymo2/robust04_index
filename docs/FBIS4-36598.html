			<p>BFN     [Text] A spokesman for the U.S. State Department has voiced  his government's belief that Sudan harbors members of what he  described as international terrorist organizations. It is well  known that Western countries -- foremost among them the United  States -- are the ones who harbor terrorist organizations,  provide them with weapons, and allow them to train on their  territory. The United States and other Western countries are  the ones who abet the leaders of these terrorist organizations  and send them to carry out assassinations, acts of subversion,  and destabilization plots in many parts of the world.</p>

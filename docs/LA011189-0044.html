			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REPORT CALLS FAIRGROUNDS AN ECONOMIC BOON TO AREA  </P> <P> Hoping to increase their stock as good neighbors, officials at the Del Mar  Fairgrounds released a report Tuesday indicating that the facility pumped more  than $74.5 million into the regional economy during 1988.  </P> <P> The study, conducted for the fair board by Economics Research Associates, also  suggests that visitors to the fairground spent $12 million in the neighboring  city of Del Mar.  </P> <P> Solana Beach also benefited from economic activity generated by the  fairgrounds, the report contends, reaping an estimated $4.6 million during the  year. All the estimates were based on exit interviews with visitors to horse  racing and other activities at the fairgrounds.  </P> <P> Although fair board officials said the report demonstrates the positive impact  of the fairgrounds, at least one Del Mar official expressed a cautionary note.  </P> <P> "I don't blame any organization for wanting good PR, but I want to look at the  figures," said Del Mar Councilwoman Brooke Eisenberg.  </P> <P> Fair officials, however, gushed about the the report, which detailed money  spent in the region and neighboring cities by visitors drawn to the  fairgrounds.  </P> <P> "I think these figures show the positive impact and good the fair does do for  the community," said Robert Spanjian, fair board president. "I think it will  help improve our image in the community."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Quarreled With Leaders  </P> <P> In years past, the fair board has quarreled with leaders of neighboring  communities over traffic, noise, pollution and other factors. Most recently,  the board tussled with city officials in Del Mar and Solana Beach over  automobile racing that was held in 1987 and '88.  </P> <P> Aside from benefiting the private sector in the local communities, the  fairgrounds helped the municipal governments, pumping more than $1.3 million in  tax revenues into Del Mar coffers and $425,000 to Solana Beach, the report  maintained.  </P> <P> The report indicates that the fairground also created the equivalent of 1,674  full-time jobs, making it one of the largest employers in the region. The  equivalent of 220 full-time jobs were held by Del Mar residents, while people  from Solana Beach held down the equivalent of 88 full-time positions, the  report said.  </P> <P> Results of the $16,000 study are the feature item in a new fair board  newsletter that was unveiled at the Tuesday press conference. Officials said  the four-page, quarterly newsletter will be mailed to 9,000 Del Mar and Solana  Beach residents at an annual cost of $25,000.  </P></p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Dunkel argues environmental gains of trade GROWING world trade is not ruinous to the environment: on the contrary, an efficient trading system is likely to provide a 'vital ingredient' in generating resources needed to ensure a cleaner environment, Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), told a conference in Bangkok yesterday. Mr Dunkel's address, which at the same time warned of possible trade clashes resulting from a proliferation of different national environmental standards, sets the scene for debate this year on trade and the environment. At the end of February, Gatt plans to publish a long-awaited report on the subject. The World Bank has also commissioned a study that may be drafted by April. Debate will focus on the 'earth summit' being convened by the United Nations in Brazil in June. Mr Dunkel rebutted complaints that the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade reform did not address environmental issues, insisting that successful completion of the round 'was the single most important contribution that Gatt could make in the fields of sustainable development and the environment'. He argued that Gatt's efforts to attack protectionism in agriculture and reduce farm subsidies would not simply correct price distortions, but would produce significant environmental gains by cutting the intensive use of pesticides and chemical fertilisers that underpinned excessive farm production in Europe and the US. The Uruguay Round would also bring the economies of eastern and central Europe into the world trading system, 'giving them access to modern technology and less environmentally-damaging methods of production', Mr Dunkel said. Mr Dunkel insisted that 'a healthy environment and a healthy economy go hand-in-hand'. He nevertheless sympathised with concerns that industries would suffer competitively if they incurred the cost of enforcing strict environmental standards: 'The danger is for one country's environmental programme to become another country's trade distortion,' he said. He called on advanced countries to share environmentally sound technology.</p>

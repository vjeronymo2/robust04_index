			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / US election is Clinton's to lose: Jurek Martin assesses the first week of the presidential campaign proper A SENIOR adviser to Mr Bill Clinton, speaking delicately off the record this week, said: 'I'm sure George Bush can't win this election now, but we can still lose it.' This assessment would probably find agreement, also unattributably, in the Bush campaign. The first week of what might be described as the home stretch of the campaign, beginning on Labour Day last Monday, offered plenty of hints as to the tactics of both sides. Two issues dominated the week - the economy and the truthfulness of both candidates. On the first, there is a universal assumption that the economy itself cannot come to Mr Bush's rescue. If the third quarter GNP returns, to be announced a week before election day, show growth at less than 1 per cent, as may happen and as the Clinton camp, looking for last-minute ammunition, not so secretly hopes, then that will put the seal on what is already evident. It explains why the thrust of President Bush's economic address in Detroit on Thursday was all about the future. It was also couched in general terms except for its explicit linkage of US performance to the growth of the global economy and free trade. Mr Bush said afterwards this was the most important aspect of his speech. It was, in essence, an attempt to turn weakness into strength. Never mind the present, Mr Bush was saying, your future is in better hands with a man who understands the global picture than with one who would merely impose bigger domestic government and higher taxes. It did not exactly help the presentation that the White House made an awful hash of clarifying one of the president's more strident promises on Wednesday - not to raise taxes 'ever, ever', a phrase that will surely haunt him in the weeks ahead as much as his 1988 'read my lips, no new taxes'. But at least Mr Bush was saying something positive about the economy. His surrogates were also saying a lot of negative things about Mr Clinton's character, specifically his not always consistent explanations of how he avoided military service, and this, in turn, puts the Democratic candidate's team on the spot. It wants the debate to remain firmly focused on the economy. This is what Mr Clinton spent a lot of the week doing, talking about how 'to end welfare as we know it' - through a Dollars 24bn four-year programme of tax credits and private and community sector employment - and about retraining, particularly in the defence industry. His campaign is convinced the electorate wants to hear what precise policies are in store, always a Clinton strength. Some advisers think that to counter Mr Bush's incessant labelling of their candidate as a man who enjoys increasing taxes, much more should be heard of his proposals to lower them on the middle classes and about how he would reduce the federal deficit, on which he is said privately to be an economic hawk. But that is not their great fear. Their fear is that he will be sidetracked, as he was briefly this week, into a slanging match, fending off charges about the draft with counterblasts at Mr Bush's alleged involvement in Iran-Contra and the re-arming of Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The concern here is twofold: that to engage in such exchanges will only highlight Mr Clinton's character and the suspicion that past foreign entanglements by the president do not really interest the public. Absent a smoking gun, neither Iraq nor Iran-gate yet equals Watergate; lying to Congress is widely seen as routine. The Bush week, in both its positive and negative respects and excepting the tax pledge mess, bore all the hallmarks of Mr James Baker, now in full control of the campaign. Mr David Broder, austere political columnist of the Washington Post, complained bitterly that it was typically Bakeresque that 'the public must lose its chance to hear a serious discussion about the nation's future'. Mr Baker certainly seemed to have put an end to a lot of presidential talk about traditional family values, a non-winner according to all the polls. It was surprising, therefore, that Mr Bush took himself off to Virginia last night for a speech to the Rev Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition, which thinks that gays of both sexes are conspiring with liberal perverts to undermine the nation's moral fibre. Mr Robertson, however, might be good at getting out the conservative vote. The final Baker touch, so irksome to Mr Broder, was his prevarication over the format of the upcoming presidential debates. The suspicion is that he does not want Mr Bush exposed to a one-on-one with Mr Clinton in the presence of a single self-effacing moderator but would prefer the presence of grandstanding journalists asking outlandish 'character' questions because they pose a greater potential threat to Mr Clinton. There will be two or three debates in the end, because Mr Bush needs them. Ms Elaine Kamarck, who advises Mr Clinton, probably got it right when she said the announcement of debates tended to turn the public off the campaign in the days before they take place. Mr Baker, she pointed out, needed to keep Mr Bush moving, and on the offensive, all the time. Freezing opinion with him ten points behind did not make sense. Such was not the characteristic of the first week. With both candidates invoking President Harry Truman at every turn, it hardly could have been.</p>

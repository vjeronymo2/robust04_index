			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Spain - Banking, Finance and Investment (1): Uncertainty a threat to recovery / Recent corruption scandals and the risk of political instability are unsettling investors and could undermine economic confidence If there is ever a good time for a political crisis, it is not at the beginning of a tentative economic recovery. But, as Felipe Gonzalez's Spanish government has found out, arguing the need for stability in order to rebuild economic confidence does not necessarily work on voters. After almost 12 years of Socialist administration, political uncertainty now has to be factored into the Spanish equation. The risks of instability are of a different order from those experienced in the early 1980s when the Socialists came to power, not long after an attempted military coup and at a time when Spain was not yet anchored in the European Community. However, events that have taken place over the past two months have left the outlook unclear. After a series of resignations from the government and parliament over corruption affairs involving former top officials, the discredit to the government was reflected in a resounding defeat in this month's European elections. Mr Gonzalez, who since last year no longer has an outright majority in parliament, has been left to depend on a precarious arrangement with Catalan nationalists, who are willing to support him subject to certain conditions. When it comes to drawing up the 1995 budget, these conditions may prove difficult to meet. Spain could, therefore, face a new election period at any time from now. The prospect has unsettled investors. The probable outcome - the advent of a conservative Popular Party government determined to take a tougher line on curbing the public sector deficit and to move faster on privatisation - is one they would welcome. However, the Popular Party has yet to clarify its economic programme. There is also a danger that it could fall short of a governing majority and have to rely - as do the Socialists but possibly with even more difficulty - on alliances made with regionalist parties. These jitters have magnified the impact in Spain of recent international turbulence in the bond markets. The government's worry is that political nervousness will interfere with the restoration of business confidence in the aftermath of last year's recession, the worst Spain has experienced for more than 30 years. Expectations of a recovery led by exports and tourism - both benefitting from a threefold devaluation of the peseta in 1992-93 - have been confirmed by figures so far this year. Holidaymakers are flocking back to Spain. The country is heavily booked for what is expected to be a record year bringing foreign exchange revenues of about Dollars 22bn. Exports rose by a third in real terms in the first four months of the year compared with the same period of 1993. However, imports have also started rising more strongly than expected. The most recent figures, for April, brought a setback to the improvement in the country's balance of payments current account. However, some analysts still expect the current account to come out of deficit this year for the first time since 1986. According to Bank of Spain estimates, gross domestic product rose 0.5 per cent in the first quarter compared with a year previously, following negative figures for the five previous quarters. The OECD recently revised its annual growth forecast for Spain upwards from 0.9 to 1.2 per cent. Government planners expect that the rate will be closer to 1.5 per cent, following negative growth of 1 per cent last year. However, even the more optimistic forecasts are below the average growth predicted for the rest of Europe. It is not clear how soon Spain can reverse the rise in its jobless rate, which reached 24.6 per cent in the first quarter, more than in any other European country. The government believes that measures which came into force this month introducing more flexibility in the labour market - although not as much flexibility as industrialists would like - will help bring about an early recovery in employment. Industrial production figures have been improving since last November. However, in spite of lower borrowing costs, investment is still slack. The picture for foreign industrial investment, which accounts for about half of Spanish manufacturing, has been overshadowed by recent problems at companies such as Volkswagen's Seat subsidiary - which is due to receive government aid - and Suzuki's offshoot Santana Motor. Wage costs, which in the last few years have risen by about two points above the annual rate of inflation, have eroded Spain's competitiveness as a manufacturing base. Pay increases this year, however, have been more modest, with settlements averaging less than the government's 3.5 per cent inflation target. Although this target looks unlikely to be met - given that consumer prices have so far stubbornly refused to fall below a 12-month rate of 4.9 per cent  -inflation is expected to ease off later in the year. One of the more dramatic and potentially damaging side-products of recession  -the crisis at Banesto, one of the country's leading banks - has been successfully and swiftly dealt with. From the Bank of Spain's summary intervention in late December to the sale of a restructured Banesto took less than four months, with minimal consequences for confidence in the banking system as a whole. Banesto was the biggest bank to have run aground in a long series of Spanish banking crises. Its rescue, a Dollars 4bn repair job to its balance sheet, was one of the biggest operations of its kind mounted anywhere. And its eventual sale by auction to Banco Santander for more than Dollars 2bn was Spain's biggest takeover. The result is that Banco Santander - formerly a middle-ranker among the main Spanish banks - has taken over as the country's top banking group. Nothing has changed more in Spain since the mid-1980s than the banking and financial system. Instead of seven 'big banks' there are now four. Two big private-sector bank mergers have taken place. State banking interests have been brought together into the partially-privatised Argentaria. And savings banks have undertaken a series of mergers, expanded outside their regional fiefdoms, and taken over commercial banks. A generational change has taken place among the leading bank chairmen. Financial markets have been reformed, exchange controls lifted, restrictions eased, the last fixed interest rates abandoned, barriers to foreign banks removed, competition opened up. Banks no longer have to keep a large proportion of their deposits in compulsory reserves and low-yield state-directed investments. What has not changed is the unmissable physical presence of banks on Spanish streets. Spain still has more bank branches than France or Britain, and more per head of population than anywhere else in Europe except Denmark and Luxembourg. The tradition whereby there is a church, a bar and a bank on every block seems to die hard. On the other hand, more than a third of the bank branches carry names that are different from those of five or six years ago, such has been the reorganisation of the sector. It is a bitter irony that one of the main figures who oversaw the modernisation of the sector, and one of the main standard-bearers of economic orthodoxy during the Socialist party's period in government - Mariano Rubio, for eight years governor of the Bank of Spain - should also be one of the chief protagonists of the corruption scandals that have brought the government and some of the country's leading institutions into disrepute. It may well be, as some bankers argue, that Mr Rubio's alleged misdemeanours, such as insider dealing, were 'no more than everybody else was doing' in the 1980s. His disgrace, then, is a sign of another important change, to stricter rules and standards.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               TOP BANK GROUPS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bank                    Assets   Customer funds    Employees   Branches                         (Ptabn)     (Ptabn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Santander/Banesto        15,366      7,429           45,500      4,000 Banco Cntral Hispano     12,950      6,504           34,400      3,450 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya     11,635      6.879           28,700      2,900 Argentaria               11,192      5,054           17,600      1,500 Banco Popular Espanol     2,865      2,173           12,000      1,800  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: banks' own 1993 figures  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

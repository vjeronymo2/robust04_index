			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'JAPAN SEEKS WORLD INFLUENCE'  </P> <P> So Japan has told the U.S. that it wants a greater say in global political and  economic affairs. Well, isn't that special?  </P> <P> I hope President Bush lets them know quite clearly that we will be willing to  share a more equal role with them when they are willing to take a more equal  role in the tasks and costs of defending the Pacific. When they do, I'll be  glad to see us engage in power-sharing!  </P> <P> BRYAN D. Le BLANC  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

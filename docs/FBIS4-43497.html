			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Alto Adige's Self-Determination </F> Urged"]    [Text] (ANSA) Vienna, June 10 -- Italy's German-speakers in  the Alto Adige region will demand their right to  "self-determination" if fascism advances in the country, "even  if in a new guise and with new methods," according to the leader  of the Suedtiroler Volkspartei (SVP) Siegfried Brugger.    Brugger, whose party has been the middle-of-the-road  political vehicle representing a majority of the Alto Adige's  German speakers in the Rome parliament since World War II, told  a dinner in his honour here yesterday evening that the people of  the South Tyrol had already experienced "what fascism was on  their own skin."    The South Tyrol question is one of the older ones in  contemporary European history. The seeds were sown at the end  of World War I when Italy was handed an almost entirely  German-speaking area strongly linked to the Tyrol and Austria.  Under fascist rule, radical Italianisation brought the  replacement of German education and place names, and major  industries were also created in Bolzano and its environs to  encourage immigration there by Italians.    The fascist regime's forced Italianisation plan failed  however and, in 1939, Hitler and Mussolini decided to solve the  dispute with an iron fist. German-speaking inhabitants of the  region were required to choose between being German and Italian.  If they chose the former, they were forced to emigrate to the  Third Reich, if the latter they lost their cultural identity.    The history of self-determination for Alto Adige-South Tyrol  has been spattered with extremist violence, and bomb attacks  began again in the early 1980's after a lull lasting from 1972,  when a long-negotiated autonomy statute went into effect, until  1979.    The most hotly disputed part of the package, mostly by the  Italian speakers who rewarded the neofascist Italian Social  Movement, now forming the bulk of the National Alliance, in  terms of votes for its pro-Rome stance, is obligatory  bilingualism and the division of public employment, social  welfare contributions and housing on an ethnic basis.    As the Berlusconi government was being formed, Brugger  warned  that the "dangerousness of the neofascists" had been shown once  more by their electoral and postelectoral demands for a revision  of post-World War II treaties.    Now, saying that the Berlusconi government includes five  ministers and 11 deputy ministers who are "neofascists," Brugger  warned that Italy is going to the right. If new elections are  held in the near future as some people are speculating, Brugger  said the right would advance again and the Northern League's  decline would continue.    Brugger also voiced concern over the concentration of the  means of information in Berlusconi's hands and his apparent  attempt, together with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini  to get the public broadcasting corporation, RAI, under his  control, too.    Last year, an SVP congress in Bolzano, or Bozen as the  German  speakers call it, reasserted the demand for self-determination.    In the run-up to the March 27-28 general elections, the SVP  filed suit against Italy's new electoral law. The argument was  that the 4-percent threshold set nationwide for access to seats  in the proportional section of the ballot would automatically  rule it out because of its support is only local.    The constitutional court rejected the case, but said the  government would have to move to ensure that the evident  disparity of treatment was corrected.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Eurocopy shares leap on OFT clearance SHARES IN Eurocopy yesterday jumped 25 per cent to 100p as the Office of Fair Trading announced that it would not revoke the photocopier distributor's 18 consumer credit licences, which allow it to arrange third-party financing. However, Sir Gordon Borrie, director general of the OFT, strongly condemned office equipment leasing documentation in general. Much of it was 'unsatisfactory', he said, and 'open to abuse . . . I will not hesitate to move against someone who uses such paperwork.' Eurocopy, which came under fierce criticism last year for the sales practices employed by some of its subsidiaries, said it was delighted with the decision. Its annual results, which have been postponed three times pending the OFT announcement, are due on Friday. Mr Cyril Gay, chairman, said the decision was 'a huge relief . . . If they had had those licences taken away, it would have been the end of the company.' Sir Gordon said he had received 10 assurances from Eurocopy and its associates regarding future business practices, including a re-casting of agreements, a seven-day cooling-off period, and a new training programme for sales staff. The OFT would also receive regular reports from the company on the level of complaints and on how the assurances were being met. The director general pointed out that the questionable practices were largely connected with companies - especially the Scottish group Purdie &amp; Kirkpatrick - acquired from Sketchley in 1989. The companies had been criticised for misleading lessees into signing contracts by understating the minimum volume of copies or the length of the lease they contracted to pay for, and for getting junior staff to sign contracts. 'I am now satisfied that before I told them in August I was minded to revoke their licences, Eurocopy had already taken steps to overhaul their selling practices,' Sir Gordon said. Eurocopy said it introduced contracts with larger print, on which the terms of the agreement are more clearly set out, as early as October 1990. Mr Michael Armitage, finance director, claimed that the group had had no serious complaints since the new documentation was introduced. Not surprisingly, the uncertainty surrounding the issue has given Eurocopy's competitors a field day and depressed its share price which reached a peak of 256p on August 7 1990. Mr Armitage said that competitors had used the adverse publicity to take business from Eurocopy. In August the company claimed that publicity surrounding the investigation had cost the company about Pounds 4.5m in lost profits. Analysts are expecting at least a 33 per cent drop in Eurocopy's profits to Pounds 7.5m. Nevertheless, the consensus in the City is that, questionable sales practices apart, Eurocopy still has a solid business. Before the announcement, Mr Andrew Yeo at Hoare Govett valued the shares at 60p on the basis of the cash generated by existing contracts alone. However, yesterday's decision has taken them closer to the underlying value of between 120p to 130p, he said.</p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Management: Down in the dirt to clean up IBM / Louise Kehoe offers a contrasting view of business process re-engineering Anybody who says they enjoy business process re-engineering is either crazy or they have never done it,' says Bob LaBant, IBM senior vice-president and one of eight executives in charge of revamping every aspect of IBM's worldwide operations to make them more efficient and competitive. Re-engineering is tough, painstaking work that involves re-examining every detail of how a business operates, the IBM executive says. 'You have to really get down in the dirt.' For IBM, company-wide re-engineering efforts began in earnest with the arrival 18 months ago of Lou Gerstner, IBM's chairman and chief executive, who established it as a priority across the company's operations. Each of the company's top executives has responsibility for re-engineering part of IBM's business on a worldwide basis. LaBant, general manager of IBM North America, is in charge of re-engineering marketing, sales, customer support and service activities, or what he calls 'customer relationships'. In the past, individual IBM product divisions have undertaken re-engineering projects, but never before has there been such a large-scale, co-ordinated effort across all of the company's activities. One of the biggest challenges facing IBM is to transform a sales and marketing organisation geared to mainframe computers into a 'solutions provider' of complete information technology systems, while also creating a low-cost distribution channel for 'commodity' products such as personal computers. To improve its ability to serve customers seeking 'complete solutions', IBM earlier this year restructured its worldwide sales effort into 14 groups focused on a specific industry such as finance, health, insurance and manufacturing. With the new management structure in place, LaBant is now focusing on business processes - the way in which IBM performs myriad tasks involved in forming and maintaining customer relationships. The guiding principle behind the re-engineering is to meet customers' needs more effectively. The process began about two years ago with surveys, interviews and studies of customers. The results were boiled down to seven requirements. Customers told IBM: Understand me, the way my organisation works; fulfil your commitments; be easy to do business with; be responsive and accessible; communicate in my terms, not in IBM-ese; have competent people; and give me competitive prices. The next task, says LaBant, was to analyse to what extent IBM was meeting these requirements. 'We had so many different ways of doing things, mapping the sub-processes was very difficult.' The result, however, is a list of 12 customer relationship processes each of which is being changed to match more closely customer needs and increase efficiency by eliminating duplication of work. 'Solution delivery' is one example. A critical element of this is pricing. When a customer signs a contract with IBM to provide a complete information technology system, it typically involves computer equipment, software, technical support and consulting services as well as products from third parties. 'Somebody has to put a price on all of this. It used to have to go through several staff levels and then be referred to White Plains (IBM US headquarters) for approval,' says LaBant. 'It would take six to eight weeks to get a price back to the customer.' Now pricing is delegated to the local 'client team' which arrives at a figure with the help of a software program called a 'pricing tool'. In other instances, work is being centralised. Finance and planning functions, for example, are being managed on a national level. 'The things that get in the way of local teams have been consolidated on a national basis. Those things that are directly related to dealing with customers have been delegated to the field staff,' LaBant explains. Not surprisingly, information technology is playing a vital role in IBM's customer-relationship re-engineering. IBM has updated its use of IT to include computer systems that support functions such as contract management, opportunities management and skills management. The re-engineering is also leading to job cuts. However, unlike past workforce reductions at IBM, in which employees were offered incentives to leave the company regardless of their role, experience or talents, the latest cuts have been carefully targeted. Earlier this autumn 3,000 support staff jobs were eliminated, reducing the IBM US marketing and sales workforce to about 40,000, down from 71,500 in 1991. 'We made these (recent) decisions based on the affordability and benefits of the work being performed, not a headcount objective,' LaBant stresses. Reducing costs is crucial as IBM struggles to boost meagre profits after a period of heavy losses. 'Sales general and administrative expenses used to represent 35 cents of every dollar of IBM US revenues. We have dropped to the low 20s over the past three years but we are going to have to drive it down into the teens - not by cutting people but by re-engineering and getting our costs out and cutting out work that we don't need.' A critical element of re-engineering is winning the support of employees. Edicts from headquarters are of little value unless the 'people in the firing line' accept them, says LaBant. He has formed a cadre of 'regular folks' as advisers. They include a sales representative, a pricer, somebody in accounts receivable and a project manager working with a customer. 'I know them well enough that they don't sweet-talk me. They know I want bone-bruising feedback.' Another technique is to hold 'town meetings'. One week each quarter, the IBM US executives take to the road. 'Last week we were in Kansas City, Tulsa, Dallas and Denver. We talked to about 2,000 IBMers.' Comparing the performance of IBM against competitors is also important. 'We are constantly benchmarking. I know the efficiencies of every one of my key competitors.' Because no other company covers IBM's broad spectrum of industry segments, LaBant has created a 'paper tiger', a mythical competitor that is the 'sum of the best' performer in each segment. Today, he acknowledges, IBM's efficiency is lagging. But he expects to be 'on the paper tiger's back in 1995'. But a re-engineer's work is never done: 'It is a continuum. When you say you are done, you are dead.'</p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> BRYANT, EICHER: EFFORTLESS SKILL  </P> <P> Hip, laid-back and gentle are words that came to mind while hearing Betty  Bryant perform at the Westwood Marquis. The singer-pianist has been a local  resident since the mid-'50s, but her visibility around town has been as  understated and low-profiled as her music.  </P> <P> For the last two or three years, Bryant has been working with bassist Greg  Eicher, and the partnership has produced a musically stimulating, almost  seamlessly creative interactivity between the two players.  </P> <P> Friday's opening set, for example, included a far-ranging, stylistically  eclectic program of tunes, ranging from the bossa nova of "Corcovado" to the  be-bop of "Jordu." Regardless of style or substance, however, Bryant's piano  and Eicher's bass came together with deceptively effortless ease.  </P> <P> While she is neither a powerful improviser nor an aggressive rhythmic player,  Bryant's Kansas City blues roots generated a brisk, floating swing that brought  buoyancy and light-heartedness to virtually everything she played. Eicher was  an ideal companion, responsive and supportive, occasionally taking off on  spirited solos of his own.  </P> <P> The high points came on those numbers in which Bryant added her attractive  contralto to the mix. A better-than-average jazz singer, with strong traces of  Sarah Vaugahn and Carmen McRae, she was particularly appealing on the  Portuguese-language bossa nova pieces, as well as a darkly whimsical original,  "Don't Fall in Love With Me."  </P> <P> The Bryant-Eicher duo's music, with its softly lyrical insinuations and bright  rhythmic energies, seems perfectly chosen for the warmly muted environs of the  Westwood Marquis Bar. They continue at the location, Tuesdays through  Saturdays, until Oct. 27. DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

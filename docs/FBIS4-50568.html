			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bian Hongwei: "State Clamps Down on Fake Products"] </F>   [Text] Foreign trademarks registered in China are  receiving protection from the country's administrative  management and judicial trial [as published], just like Chinese  trademarks.    Administrative departments for industry and commerce and  courts at all levels are authorized to investigate, handle and  hear cases of trademark counterfeiting and infringement.    Foreigners who think their trademark rights are being  infringed upon can lodge their complaints with either the court  or administrative authorities.    "The system has proven efficient in resolving trademark  disputes," Zhao Gang, an official with the trademark office  under the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC),  told CHINA DAILY.    Presently, SAIC has designated six offices to handle  complaints from foreign enterprises. These include the Patent  and Trademark Agency under the China Council for the Promotion  of International Trade, China Trademark Agency, Shanghai Patent  Agency, China Patent Agent (Hong Kong) Ltd, NOD Patent and  Trademark Agent Ltd and China Sinda Intellectual Property Agent  Corporation.  <H5>  Professionals </H5>   With professionals familiar with the country's laws and  proficient at foreign languages, these offices are believed to  save the time and energy of foreign trademark registrants.    The SAIC is now designating more "representative offices"  throughout the country, with priority given to the relatively  developed coastal regions, said Zhao.    Statistics show that administrative authorities for industry  and commerce handle some 13,000 trademark cases annually, among  which about 500 involve foreign trademarks.    The SAIC and its local branches also undertake regular  market  supervision to stop trademark infringement in its early stage,  said Zhao.    This large amount of work is being done by some 6,000  full-time employees at the SAIC head office and local divisions.    On the judicial front, the country's courts are playing an  important role in protecting intellectual property rights  including foreign trademarks. In large cities such as Beijing,  Shanghai and Guangzhou, relevant departments have been set up at  either the higher or intermediate courts for that purpose. And  more can be expected in many coastal cities.    Co-operation between the administrative authorities for  industry and commerce and procuratorial departments are  fruitful, Zhao said. Statistics from the SAIC show that in the  last two years, the authorities have handed over more than 3,000  suspects to judicial offices, where the criminals have been  sentenced.    Zhao said infringement of intellectual property rights is  almost omnipresent. In the West, many infringement cases deal  with patents and copyright. Infringement of computer software  copyright has been a decade-long headache in the United States.    "China is willing to co-operate with foreign countries in  protecting intellectual property," said the SAIC official.    By the end of last year, the country had registered a total  of 411,000 trademarks; nearly one-seventh of them belonged to  foreign companies, a 10-fold increase over 1979.    This indicates that foreign traders are confident about the  country's economy and the protection of intellectual property  rights in China, Liu Minxue, Director of SAIC, told a press  conference last month.  <H5>  Convention </H5>   Liu said his administration provides special protection to  well-known trademarks in line with the Paris Convention for  Protecting Industrial Property Rights.    China joined the Convention in 1984. It also joined the  Madrid International Registration in 1987, the Berne Convention  and Universal Copyright Convention in 1992.    At the press conference, Liu exposed 14 major cases  involving  the infringement of foreign trademarks registered in China.  Most cases have to do with enterprises from the United States,  including the Eastman Kodak Company, Levi Strauss Company and  the Coca-Cola Company.    China put into effect its first Trademark Law a decade ago.  And the State revised the law and its implementing regulations  last year to be in line with the market economy.    According to the revised law, fines on trademark infringers  have been raised from less than 20 percent to 50 percent of the  total amount of the illegal trade volume or from twice to five  times the illegal profits. The longest imprisonment term for  trademark counterfeiters has been raised from three years to  seven years.    Several criminals involved in trademark infringement have  been sentenced to death during the past few years in the country.    The Patent Law, the Copyright Law and the Anti-Unethical  Competition Law have also been promulgated during the past  decade.  <H5>  Difficulties </H5>   However, the SAIC admits to existing difficulties in  implementing the laws.    In some areas, the laws are not strictly carried out, SAIC  officials say.    They call for a unified organization to manage the  protection  of trademarks and improve work efficiency at local branches.    As China is trying to resume its status in the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) this year, its performance  in protecting intellectual property is now one of the key  focuses for GATT decision-makers.</p>

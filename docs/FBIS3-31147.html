			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, February 11 (BTA) -- National Assembly  National Security Committee Chairman Nikolay Slatinski today  sent a letter to President Zhelyu Zhelev, saying that the last  few days have seen militant statements and decisions on the war  in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Slatinski regrets that the institutions  and officials directly involved in Bulgaria's foreign policy and  national security have not shown the necessary coordination and  have created an impression that there can be changes in this  country's clear-cut and categorical policy.    Bulgaria is in favour of a peaceful settlement to the crisis  and has repeatedly declared a firm resolution for  non-intervention in any form in developments in former  Yugoslavia. It has appealed to all countries in the region to  respond in the same way, the letter stresses. Slatinski  believes that in this critical situation there can be absolutely  no change in the Bulgarian stand. In his capacity as National  Security Committee chairman, he expresses a personal negative  view of the possibility of air strikes and believes no sensible  Bulgarian politician would support such action.    Slatinski asks the president to more decisively exercise his  constitutional powers for the coordination and integration of  efforts by political leaders, legislators and the executive to  uphold the national position on the Yugo-crisis.    First Deputy Foreign Minister Valentin Gatsinski today  briefed parliament's Foreign Policy Committee on the latest  developments in former Yugoslavia and on Bulgaria's joining the  Partnership for Peace Initiative. The committee decided to ask  the President's Office to provide the text of the message by  Turkish President Suleyman Demirel to President Zhelev to  familiarize the committee members with it.</p>

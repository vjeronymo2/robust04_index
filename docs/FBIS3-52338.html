			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In a commentary today, the newspaper TISHRIN  addresses the normalization agreement signed between the Vatican  and Israel to pave the way for the establishment of full  diplomatic ties. Under the headline "The Vatican and Israel,"  TISHRIN says: The agreement has flagrantly overlooked the  sufferings of the Palestinian people living under occupation, as  well as their right to self-determination. It has also  disregarded the issue of Jerusalem. Thus, the Vatican has acted  against its declared stands since 1948 with regard to freedom  for the Palestinian people and Jerusalem, particularly since  Israel has repeatedly said that it will never return Jerusalem  to its rightful owners, and that Jerusalem will remain Israel's  eternal capital.    TISHRIN adds: It is striking that the Vatican which, like  many world states, is watching the hateful and racist operations  taking place in the occupied territories, should nullify, by  this agreement, all the sympathy it demonstrated toward the  Palestinian people's cause, and Palestinian children, who are  being killed by Israeli bullets.    The paper goes on to say: The Vatican has forgotten or  chosen to forget the ordeal of the Palestinian people, who were  displaced by Israel and whose lands were confiscated by Israel.  In Article 4 of the normalization agreement, there is a pledge  to respect the existing situation; namely, Israeli occupation.  Even more dangerous is the normalization agreement that is  meant to pave the way for a visit to occupied Jerusalem by the  Holy See. Then, new developments in the interest of Israel and  Zionism will surface. This will promote their hostile schemes  in the region.    Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN says: The agreement has  failed to note in any way whatsoever the future of the holy  city, and overlooked the fate of an entire population; namely,  the Palestinian people.</p>

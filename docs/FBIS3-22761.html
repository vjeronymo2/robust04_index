Integrated in the regiment of artillery three months ago,  the  missile was for the first time on display at the Republic Day  parade here. Operational control of the Prithvi will be shared  by the Army and the Air Force.    Developed by the Defence Research and Development  Organisation (DRDO) in the teeth of Western opposition, this  achievement is all the more striking. The United States has led  the campaign against India's missile programme and its  `concerns' on Indian missilery including the Prithvi were  clearly stated during the visit to the United States in August  by the Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit.    With accuracy being one of its key features, the Prithvi can  strike assigned targets deep inside enemy territory. The  missile's range is restricted to 150 kms while carrying a  heavier warhead. But, when the maximum load of one tonne is  halved, it can strike at 250 km.    With the minimum weight of a nuclear warhead estimated at  500  kg, India can thus, theoretically, deliver a nuclear strike. But  with a national decision not to develop nuclear weapons, the  missile is expected to be used only in a conventional conflict.  The missile's high accuracy is meant to deliver conventional  explosives effectively.    However, the country is far from obtaining a permanent  military edge over nations such as Pakistan. Without integrating  other missile systems (it is now developing the 2,000 km Agni  IRBM along with the Akash, Trishul, and Nag missiles), India  will have to contend with a formidable Pakistani missile arsenal.    Aided by China and France in the past, Pakistan is actively  developing its own missile armoury. In the Hatf series of  Pakistani missiles, the Hatf-2 is nearing completion. When  deploying a conventional warhead, the missile has the capacity  of reaching Delhi. Progress on the Hatf-3 adds to India's worry.  Capable of reaching distances up to 800 km, it can deliver a  nuclear warhead. Hatf-3 may be in Pakistani arsenals by 1995.  The transfer of Chinese M-11 missiles to Pakistan reinforces  India's apprehensions. With a range of 290 km the nuclear  missile can release a 800 kg warhead.    New technology: Developed by the Integrated Guided  Missile Development Board since 1983, the Prithvi possesses  important new technologies. The originality of the missile's  design and packages are evident for there are few similarities  with other contemporary delivery systems. Its success may help  to finetune the Agni systems.    Aimed at providing strength without making the missile  heavy, the Prithvi's frame is made from locally developed light  aluminium alloys and magnesium alloys are used for the wings.  Light aluminium alloys go into the making of the propellant  tanks. Once the propellants are filled the tanks can be sealed.    With focus initially on testing the reliability and guidance  of the missile, the first trials began in 1988. An on-board  computer carries out the task of the Prithvi's guidance and  flight control. It also checks out sequences before and after  the launch. Related to accuracy, the missiles guidance was  continuously tested.    But when the missile strayed from its flight path in one of  the tests, its aerodynamic controls were critically reviewed.  Later tests were carried out to ensure that the correction was  made fool-proof.    Powered by two rocket motors, the missile's engine also  assist providing forward, lateral and roll motion to the  missile. Hydraulic actuators provide the force to the engines  and tail fins facilitating aerodynamic control. Developed and  integrated by the Defence Research and Development Laboratory  (DRDL), the development of the software packages is considered a  major national achievement.    Proving its mobility, some of the later tests saw the  missile  being successfully fired from a eight-wheeled truck.</p>

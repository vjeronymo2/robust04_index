			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are amending &sect;&sect;404.903 and 416.1403 to explain that if we decline to make an initial determination on a claim for benefits based on an allegation of misinformation because one or more of the conditions specified above are not met, our action is not an initial determination for purposes of our administrative review process or judicial review. We also are amending &sect;&sect;404.902 and 416.1402 to make it clear that if we make a determination on a claim for benefits based on an allegation of misinformation, the determination is an initial determination subject to administrative and judicial review under &sect;404.900  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or &sect;416.1400  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We published proposed rules in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 16, 1992, 57 FR 47415. We gave interested parties 60 days to submit comments. We also published an amendment to the proposed rules on January 22, 1993, 58 FR 5687, and we gave interested parties another 60 days to submit comments on the proposed rules, as amended. We received comments from four commenters: a public policy research center concerned with child health care, a State public health agency employee, and two attorneys who represent claimants and beneficiaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supported the proposed rules without modification. Another commenter supported the proposed rules but recommended that another example of a situation involving misinformation be included in the rules. The other commenters believed that the proposed rules should be expanded to cover certain other situations in which an individual failed to file an application for benefits. In addition, while commending the proposed rules, two of the commenters recommended that SSA also take steps to ensure that Agency employees provide correct information to potential applicants when they inquire about eligibility for benefits. A summary of the comments and our responses to the comments are provided below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We considered carefully all of the substantive comments which we received on the proposed rules. However, for the reasons explained below, we did not make any changes to the proposed rules other than certain editorial changes discussed below. Therefore, except for some editorial changes, these final rules are the same as the proposed rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter recommended that the proposed rules be expanded to include an example of a situation in which an individual, such as a parent, inquires about filing an application on behalf of a child for SSI benefits based on disability or blindness and is provided misinformation by SSA about the child's eligibility for benefits which causes the individual not to file an application for the benefits. This commenter also stated that often a parent of a child who may be disabled or blind contacts SSA to inquire about SSI benefits for the child at the suggestion of a child advocate, case manager or hospital social worker. The commenter believed that these case workers can serve as sources to corroborate dates and facts of the contact in cases of alleged misinformation since parents in these situations usually recontact the case worker to advise the worker that they were dissuaded from applying for benefits because of the information which SSA provided to them about the child's eligibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The examples in &sect;416.351(a) are intended simply to illustrate situations in which misinformation provided by an SSA employee concerning a potential claimant's eligibility for SSI benefits causes an individual not to file an application for the benefits. The examples are not intended to cover all situations involving alleged misinformation or all categories of SSI benefits. Existing &sect;416.315(b) provides that an application for SSI benefits for a claimant who is under age 18 may be signed by an individual who is responsible for the care of the claimant, including a relative, or by certain other individuals described in that section. In &sect;416.351(b)(2)(i) of the final regulations, we explain that if an individual had authority under &sect;416.315 to sign an application for benefits for another person, and we determined that the individual failed to apply for SSI benefits for that person because we gave the individual misinformation about that person's eligibility for such benefits, we will deem an application for the benefits to have been filed on the date specified in &sect;416.351(b)(2)(i) (A) or (B), as appropriate. Section 416.351(b)(2)(i) makes it clear that the rules for establishing a deemed filing date of an application for benefits based on misinformation apply to cases in which a parent, or other individual authorized to sign an application for a child, failed to apply for SSI benefits for a child because we gave the parent, or such other individual, misinformation about the child's eligibility for SSI benefits. Section 404.633(b)(2)(i) of the final regulations provides similar rules with respect to claims for Social Security benefits. We do not believe that it is necessary, therefore, to add an example to the regulations to cover the specific situation in which an individual failed to apply for benefits on behalf of a child because we gave the individual misinformation about the child's eligibility for the benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We agree with the commenter that in some circumstances a child advocate, case manager or hospital social worker may be able to provide information regarding an individual's alleged contact with SSA. Under &sect;&sect;404.633(f) and 416.351(f), an individual who makes a claim for benefits based on alleged misinformation must furnish information that will enable us to determine if we did provide misinformation to the individual about his or her eligibility for benefits, or the eligibility of a person on whose behalf the individual was considering applying for benefits, which caused the individual not to file an application for the benefits. Preferred evidence of such misinformation is written evidence, such as a letter, which shows that we gave the individual misinformation which caused the individual not to file an application. In the absence of preferred evidence, we will consider other evidence, including the individual's statements about the alleged misinformation as well as ``[a]ny other information regarding [the individual's] *&blank;*&blank;* alleged contact,'' as explained in &sect;&sect;404.633(d)(2) and 416.351(d)(2). This would include statements provided by a case worker concerning the individual's alleged contact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

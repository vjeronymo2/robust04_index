			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LINES DRAWN IN 'MISS SAIGON' DISPUTE  </P> <P> It seems that in this latest affront to the Asian-American community (the  attitude of "Miss Saigon's" producer), we are again ignoring the sexism  inherent in the casting.  </P> <P> From Charlie Chan to Kurosawa's upcoming film (which is one import from Japan  we ought to ban), whenever the leading male role is an Asian character, time  and time again it is played by a white actor while Asian females have  opportunities to play not only leading roles as Asian characters, as in "Miss  Saigon," but in mainstream parts (witness Joan Chen in television's "Twin  Peaks").  </P> <P> Is this the same mentality that ensures that no Asian male can work as a news  anchor in this town?  </P> <P> I doubt that the feminists are keeping a tally on that score.  </P> <P> RICHARD A. CHUNG  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

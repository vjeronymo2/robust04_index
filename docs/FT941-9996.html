			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Observer: Surplus equipment More foreign aid going amiss? Britain's United Nations outpost in Geneva has just given away two armoured cars. Admittedly, they are going to a good cause - Geneva's police force - and they wouldn't be much use in a battle since they are Jaguar XJ6 Sovereigns, vintage 1988 and 1989. Even so they are in excellent condition. Why not sell them for the benefit of taxpayers? Observer awaits an answer.</p>

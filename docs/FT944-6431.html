			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (11): Frontier areas pose problems  -Emerging markets / The risks encountered in some countries Although the flow of funds into the world's emerging markets has eased in 1994, following a phenomenal burst of activity during 1993, their attractiveness as long-term asset investments remains undiminished. According to Standard Chartered Bank the size of emerging markets in terms of market capitalisation is set to double in five years, from its present level of around Dollars 2,000bn; while other commentators point to the fact that if the economies of the world's emerging markets continue to develop at the rate of growth witnessed recently then, in about 20 years' time, they could account for around half the world's equity market capitalisation. No wonder then that custodians have, in general, not seen a significant slowing in the generation of business, particularly as fund managers explore the possibilities of entering hitherto uncharted countries. While risks remain in many markets custodians note that in some cases settlement can actually be easier to execute than in some developed markets. For instance, says Paul Bellamy, manager in custody operations at Robert Fleming, some emerging markets are already Swift-orientated, particularly in the Middle East, and have already moved to paperless trading systems. Nevertheless, it is clear that significant problems arise when investing in such frontier markets as Russia. Citibank raises a cautionary tale regarding Russia where demand is not necessarily supported by the accessibility or availability of securities. There is no traditional equity market at present with a voucher system in operation. 'The only way of ascertaining whether an investor owns vouchers is to obtain a photocopy of the investor list from the registrar,' says the bank. 'A photocopy provides no comfort that one is actually the beneficial owner of the vouchers and the law is unclear on these issues. On the one hand, there are huge potential returns to be had, but these could prove to be worthless if the voucher is also owned by three or four other investors.' Mark Mobius, of Templeton Emerging Markets Fund, notes that the question of risk allocation and control has not been fully and completely addressed. 'In the corporate arena the challenges are great indeed. The first difficulty is identifying the existence of those corporate actions, when they are taking place and what are the 'ex dates' and 'pay dates'. Information flows about such matters are not ideal in emerging markets so that the custodian's task moves to a high level of difficulty necessitating an extra degree of care not normally associated with custodial responsibilities. 'Co-mingling of client accounts by custodial banks presents another challenge to emerging market investors. It is clear that in many accounts in emerging country sub-custody banks, assets of different investors are co-mingled so that in the event of mishap such as counterfeit securities, tracing the actual owner of the worthless securities becomes a major problem. Clients should demand separated accounts to ensure the viability of their holdings.' Another important problem is the lack of foreign exchange convertibility. Venezuela is a typical example where there is no procedure for repatriation, while in South Korea, since the currency is not traded in London, for instance, conversion can only be done in Seoul, and custodians are dependent on a sub-custodian. Karen Janes, vice-president, regional network manager at Chase Manhattan Bank, also illustrates the example of Morocco. 'Morocco is an old-fashioned physical market, and the main problem here is to do with foreign exchange. For instance, settlement on the stock exchange is T+1 but there is no way that an investor can get foreign exchange process in that time - it is more like T+4. The way round this is that people agree to trade a few days ahead, agree a price and book the trade for a few days later when the forex deal has been completed.' She remarks that growth in activity has been seen this year in eastern Europe and Africa, both north and south. In Africa the most prominent countries attracting investment have been Morocco, Egypt, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana. In eastern Europe there has been an increasing interest in Hungary and the Czech Republic. The latter has not been an easy market to open, but having managed to get into place, Ms Janes says, Chase has seen a growth of interest, even though it will be some time yet before the country is ready to open for foreign investment. Chase has been working with a local bank in the Czech Republic, although there are some basic problems in the way the market is structured. 'For example,' she notes, 'the local sub-custodians are not able to have accounts in the central depository: it has to be the investors themselves. This means that you have to set up powers of attorney allowing the sub-custodians the legal right to settle the trade when they physically go to the central depository. 'In the Czech Republic the majority of trading happens off market, with a few large trades. It is supposedly a scripless system, but to ensure that you are actually getting settlement you have to physically go to the central depository and witness the confirmation. However, this process should change over time and there will eventually be on-line settlement.' India has long been a significant problem for institutional investors. Sanjit Talukdar, head of the India desk at Foreign &amp; Colonial, observes that problems with custody have been one of the biggest obstacles to the development of the Indian markets. This year, for instance, close to Dollars 100m has been turned away because of custody problems. International fund managers cannot use local custodians because often they do not meet international regulations. With deregulation of the market, foreign institutions and private sector mutual funds have become active, largely interested in block deals off market in B shares, which have a seven-day account cycle. Since these trades are not executed through the exchange, prices are not transparent. Paradoxically, therefore, India is one market where transparency has fallen with the rise in turnover, he says. Another problem endemic to India is the sheer volume of paper work generated, the main reason why more and more trade has successfully moved off-shore into global depositary receipts GDRs, which the Indian authorities have been happy to see take place. There are vested interests against change, such as the establishment of a central depositary system. This would, in western terms, be the best solution to the current difficulties. Next best would be instead of trying to get rid of the system as it stands, trying to tweak it at the edges. An attempt to do this has been the introduction of so-called 'jumbo certificates'. Typically, Indians deal in small lots, that is 50 to 100 shares. The jumbo is a deal of at least 1,000 shares, but because the retail market is not used to dealing in such large amounts a different price is fixed. Many custodians expect to see an increase in volume, since the allocation of funds to emerging markets is rising regardless of whether the markets themselves are going up or down. Citibank, for instance, has plans to expand its custody network to include 20 more countries by 1996, including the opening of a safekeeping facility in Moscow and custody services in a number of African countries. Chase's Karen Janes suggests that investors have to be open-minded regarding investment in new emerging markets and to work with them. Chase, she says, spends a lot of its time training sub-custodians.</p>

European  companies must go and get involved in the region, according to  Sir Leon Brittan, the EC foreign trade commissioner.    Last year the EC had more trade with the countries in East  Asia (previously the Far East) than with North America. By the  turn of the century China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan will be  economically more powerful than the United States alone or  Germany and Japan together. They will also export more than  Japan and Germany do at present.    "Estimates such as these will mean that every analysis of a  threefold division of world trade between the EU, the United  States and Japan will quickly disappear into second-hand  bookshops," Sir Leon said on Thursday [17 February] evening in  London, in what he himself had announced in advance as a "major  policy speech."    Brittan also warned that the same dynamic could destabilize  East Asia with "potentially catastrophic and far-reaching  consequences." North Korea is still subject to a regime which  plays "nuclear poker" and China is facing rapidly increasing  economic diversity and "decreasing centralized power," according  to Brittan, who is to visit the People's Republic next week.    According to the British EC commissioner, Europe has much to  offer East Asia. But he warned that Asia's supposed dependence  on Europe for capital and know-how, or in order to  counterbalance Japan and the United States, would soon "be  entirely a question of historical interest." East Asia has its  own capital and developed technological resources.    One European advantage is that it has no political ambitions  in the region, Brittan said. In Asia, Europe has a lead in  sectors like transport infrastructure, telecommunications,  aviation, oil, gas and environmental technology and service  sectors such as banking and insurance.    Brittan said "the multilateral framework" for doing business  with the region was important. He hoped that China, with its  unprecedented economic perspectives, could joint GATT this year.  "If the whole of East Asia is represented in the multilateral  trade system, then economic relations would be easier because we  would all speak the same language and apply the same rules,"  Brittan said.    But he does not want to subordinate that goal to the content  of the entry negotiations. The EU is setting the following  conditions for Peking's membership of GATT: further opening of  Chinese markets, an import tariff ceiling of between 15 and 25  percent, further liberalization of exchange rates, and the right  to carry out foreign trade and invest.    Brittan also warned the East Asian community in advance that  the West was determined to "discuss" trade in relation to  environmental demands, fair competition and social conditions.  These should be "an integral part of the Community's policies  for the region," Brittan said.    He wants to give industry prime responsibility for the  relations between the EC and East Asia. The Commission will  negotiate in the GATT framework but beyond that its role will be  limited to "helping companies help themselves." That means  export support and the provision of information on a European  scale. The BBC has been asked to make recommendations on  cleaning up Europe's "poor image" in Asia.</p>

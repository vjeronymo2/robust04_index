			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- A large benefit  performance was held here today in support of the "Hope Project".    This is a program on the Chinese mainland aimed to help  drop-outs in poor areas resume their school studies.    Together with Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, more than 10,000  people watched the performance at the Great Hall of the People,  which was relayed live by China Central Television all over the  country.    China has about a million children who drop out from school  each year because of poverty. Since the "Hope Project" was  launched by the China Youth Development Foundation in 1989, it  has received more than 200 million yuan in donations from home  and abroad and helped 540,000 drop-outs return to school.    In the benefit show, artists presented songs, dances and  other forms of art to express people's concerns about drop-outs  and China's primary education.    All the performers gave their services free, and each of  them  also donated money to help at least one drop-out return to  school.    Sponsored jointly by the Central Committee of the Chinese  Communist Youth League, Ministry of Culture and Ministry of  Radio, Film and Television, the benefit performance was expected  to further publicize the "Hope Project" and enlarge its funds so  as to help more drop-outs resume their schooling, said the  organizers.</p>

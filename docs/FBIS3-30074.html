			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar yesterday  said the country was interested in supplying arms to Thailand  through a barter deal.    "Slovakia ranks among the largest arms producers in the  world  and we have tanks, artillery, missiles and ammunition," he told  a press conference.    Meciar stopped over in Bangkok for about twelve hours as a  guest of the Thai government to discuss bilateral relations. He  had spent five days in China discussing trade. This is the  first visit to Asia by a Slovakian prime minister since the  republic officially seperated from Czechoslovakia in January  1993.    According to Meciar, Slovakia's international trade volume  has grown considerably. He said he was interested in signing  two agreements with Thailand -- to avoid double taxation and to  protect investments. "We welcome Thai investors," he said.    Slovakia exports steel and chemicals and is in need of  consumer products like canned food, he said. Opportunities also  exist for foreign investors in the hotel and tourism sectors.</p>

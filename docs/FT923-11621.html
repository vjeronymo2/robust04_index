			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Intel delays launch of advanced chip INTEL, the leading manufacturer of microprocessor chips, said that it would delay the introduction of its next-generation product, code-named P5, until the first quarter of 1993 to allow more time for testing. The P5, which will be renamed before its official launch, is the latest version of Intel's widely used microprocessor family, which includes the 386 and 486 devices that power most personal computers. Intel had planned to launch the P5 during the fourth quarter of 1992. Mr Paul Otellini, vice-president in charge of Intel's microprocessors, said the delay did not mean that there are problems with the P5. 'We have (prototype) parts running in multiple systems at Intel and with key customers. Sampling to a broader range of customers will not be delayed,' he said. However, by delaying full- scale production of the P5, Intel will allow more time to refine its manufacturing process, improve yields and avoid the bugs that have plagued new microprocessors in the past. Despite Intel's statements, analysts suspect that Intel has encountered technical problems, forcing it to delay full-scale production. Intel is facing rising competition in the high-performance end of the microprocessor market from makers of Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC ) microprocessors. The P5 is Intel's response to this competition. Intel won some breathing space after Advanced Micro Devices was forced to delay its plans to clone Intel's 486 by a court ruling on a copyright dispute. One benefit of the delay, Intel said, was that it would be able to increase production of the latest versions of the 486 to meet unexpectedly high demand.</p>

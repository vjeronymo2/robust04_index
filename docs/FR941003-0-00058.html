			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 84. FDA received five comments regarding the interpretation of ``the court'' and court judgments in proposed &sect;314.107(e)(1). Proposed &sect;314.107(e)(1) stated that ``the court'' in &sect;314.107(b) and (c) referred to ``the court that enters final judgment from which no appeal can be or has been taken.'' Three comments supported the proposal, but two comments argued that FDA had misconstrued the 1984 amendments. One comment argued that the court finding a patent to be invalid or not infringed should be ``the court of first instance'' or district court because a decision that a patent was invalid or not infringed or a decision to issue an injunction would be done by a district court. Another comment argued that interpreting ``the court'' to mean the court that enters final judgment ``effectively gives a patent owner an additional extension of the patent *&blank;*&blank;* for the duration of the appeal'' and delay generic competition. The comment would revise the rule to permit an ANDA applicant to market its drug product after it had prevailed at the trial court level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA declines to amend &sect;314.107(e)(1) as suggested by the comments. To construe ``the court'' as a district court, regardless of any appeal of the district court decision, would deny the benefits of exclusivity to a prudent applicant that delayed marketing its product until resolution of an appeal by the patent holder (see 54 FR 28872 at 28894). Moreover,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the patent holder appealed the district court decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and were able to obtain a stay or an injunction against the marketing of the applicant's product, the applicant could lose the entire 180-day exclusivity period before the stay or injunction were lifted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given these considerations, FDA believes that any reference to ``the court'' must be the court that enters final judgment from which no appeal can be or has been taken. (The reference to ``appeals'' does not include the certiorari process. The likelihood of an appellate court decision being heard and overruled by the Supreme Court is too remote to warrant delaying marketing and exclusivity pending resolution of a petition for writ of certiorari.) This interpretation avoids potentially premature decisions on the effective date of ANDA approval and the loss of 180-day exclusivity. FDA has, however, also revised &sect;314.107(e)(2) to clarify which court decisions will represent the ``final'' judgment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 85. One comment would revise proposed &sect;314.107(e)(2) to refer to a court order or judgment rather than simply a court judgment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As amended, &sect;314.107(e)(2) refers to a court ``decision,'' which could be in the form of either an order or a judgment. The agency has also made minor changes to &sect;314.107(e)(2) to clarify that the court decisions involve patent issues and that a higher court can hold or affirm a lower court decision that a patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 86. A second comment would revise proposed &sect;314.107(e)(2) to require applicants to submit copies of a court order or judgment to the Division of Generic Drugs or ``New Drug Evaluation Division (where applicable).''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA agrees with the comment, and has added &sect;314.107(e)(2)(iv) to require applicants to send a copy of a final decision to the Office of Generic Drugs, or to the appropriate division in the Office of Drug Evaluation I or the Office of Drug Evaluation II, whichever is applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 87. Proposed &sect;314.107(f) described how the 45-day period for filing a patent infringement suit would be determined. In brief, under proposed &sect;314.107(f)(1), the 45-day period would begin on the day after the date the patent owner or approved application holder, if an exclusive patent licensee, received a notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of the patent. Proposed &sect;314.107(f)(2) would require the 505(b)(2) applicant or ANDA applicant to notify FDA whether an action for patent infringement had been filed. Several comments objected to language in proposed &sect;314.107(f) that would consider notice to or actions by exclusive licensees to be equivalent to notice to or actions by a patent owner. The comments said that exclusive licensees do not always share the patent owner's interests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA agrees and has revised the rule to remove language that would consider exclusive licensees to be equivalent to patent owners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

He said that on Wednesday  evening, at the closed consultations of the Security Council,  the UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali told the members of  the Security Council that the Georgian-Abkhaz negotiations which  had been under way at the UN headquarters since 7 March ended  due to unavailability of good prospects for reaching an  agreement. There is not a single agreement signing which could  be possible, said de Soto. According to him, Georgian-Abkhaz  negotiations would probably resume in Geneva next month.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Newly elected Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata early Tuesday regretted the decision by  the Social Democratic Party (SDP) to leave the governing  coalition and appealed to the party to give up the decision.    However, Hata defended the formation of the 130-legislator  parliamentary group which excludes the SDP, the largest party in  the coalition, drawing the latter's ire, saying, "The formation  does not constitute any betrayal" of the socialists.    In a press interview at the prime minister's official  residence, Hata said such a parliamentary convergence is  necessary to enable Japan to deal with the difficult times  ahead, explaining, "unless we have such a group, coalition  parties will not be able to cope with the difficult problems and  act in solidarity."</p>

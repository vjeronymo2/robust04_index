			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Britannia Building Society 64% rise Britannia Building Society, the UK's ninth largest, yesterday reported a 64 per cent increase in first half pre-tax profits, from Pounds 28.5m to Pounds 46.8m. Mortgage lenders across the sector have benefited from falls in provisions for bad and doubtful debts; Britannia also attributed the rise to better management of interest margins and an increase in non-interest income. Net interest receivable for the six months to June 30 rose to Pounds 88.2m - some 16 per cent higher than in the first half of last year. Other income and charges, including those from insurance sales, rose by Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 27.2m (Pounds 24.1m). The society's estate agency subsidiary is just below break-even point. Provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell 22 per cent to Pounds 17m (Pounds 21.8m) - less than the falls experienced by some other societies. Mr Trevor Bayley, finance director, said that Britannia's provisions had not had as far to fall as those of some societies, and that it had also taken a relatively cautious view of property prices. The society's administrative expenses rose to Pounds 51.6m (Pounds 49.9m), part of which was attributable to the cost of closing 25 branches earlier this year. Mr Bayley said that this closure programme, which leaves the society with 201 branches, was now broadly complete. Group assets rose by about 2 per cent to total Pounds 13.4bn. Mr Bayley said that historically the society's interest margins had been slim for the sector, but that this had been improving over the last 18 months. One example of this had been the society's very selective approach to the prices at which it was prepared to offer fixed-rate mortgages. At 7.75 per cent, its standard variable rate is just over 0.1 percentage point above the lowest headline variable rates offered by any of the 10 largest societies.</p>

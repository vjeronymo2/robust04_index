			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / People: Telspec Septuagenarians need not fear that their chances of landing directorships are going to diminish purely as a result of age. Telephone equipment company Telspec has just added its second venerable non-executive director, 70-year-old Paul Skey, having turned to the services of ex Cable &amp; Wireless chairman Lord Sharp, 77, just before the December flotation. Skey, also an old C &amp; W hand, has been a member of the board of Telspec Europe for some while. Chief executive Garth Riley said that at the time of the listing he didn't want to upset BT, one of its principal customers, by having two C &amp; W types on the main board. 'They were proof-reading the prospectus and it would have made their hair stand on end.' Now the company is safely public, he reckons he has more room for manoeuvre. What does BT say now? 'I haven't asked them,' says Riley.</p>

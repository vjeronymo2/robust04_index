			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by B.I.W.: "Manifestation Monday of Solidarity; </F> Until the Talks"]    [Text] On the eighth day of its protest, Solidarity ["S"]  organized three demonstrations in front of voivodship offices in  Opole, Wroclaw, and Walbrzych. A few hundred people took part  in each of them. Twelve miners in Andaluzja in Piekary Slaskie  started an underground occupational strike; however, the strike  has nothing to do with the nationwide "S" action. Today, among  others, a few dozen plants of the Bydgoszcz Region will go on  strike. In the morning, "S" Head Marian Krzaklewski will meet  with Senate Speaker Adam Struzik of the Polish Peasant Party  [SLD]. They will discuss, among other topics, the budget and  possible changes that the Senate may introduce. Struzik told  RZECZPOSPOLITA that he will try to "reconcile positions." He  may play the role of a mediator in the talks between "S" and the  government.  <H5>  The Prime Minister Invites Unclearly </H5>   According to "S" National Committee [KK] Spokesman Piotr  Zak,  the prime minister's invitation to talks has been worded so  unclearly that it is not known whether this is an invitation to  the negotiations on the trade union's demands. They wanted to  advance the date of the meeting between Waldemar Pawlak and  Marian Krzaklewski by one day because, as Zak put it, "let us  not waste time." After consultations at the Office of the  Council of Ministers, it turned out, however, that the prime  minister had reserved Thursday [17 March] for other activities.  It seems that "S" did not like the fact that the prime minister  had invited not only this trade union but also "Solidarity '80,"  All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement, and Trade Union of Miners in  Poland [ZZGwP] (the heads of the two latter unions are deputies  of the Democratic Left Alliance). Because only "S" is right now  involved in the dispute and is conducting the protest action, it  would indicate that the prime minister wants to discuss not only  their demands or even that he does not want to negotiate.    At 1100 today, a meeting will be held between Chairman  Krzaklewski and Speaker Struzik (PSL senator, member of "S"),  who himself invited him to talk. Some "S" activists say that  the union would already like to stop or at least to soften the  protest action and finally begin talks. This is also suggested  by the fact that "S" very seriously treated Leszek Miller's  invitation to talks as well as by the fast response of "S."  Such a possibility may arise after the meeting with the Senate  speaker. Struzik told RZECZPOSPOLITA that he and Krzaklewski  intend, among other things, to evaluate the current situation  and to discuss the socioeconomic situation in the country, and  so "a talk about the budget will probably be unavoidable." Much  earlier, before the budget discussion and the voting, Struzik  forwarded a letter to the KK, in which he wrote about possible  changes in the budget. They were supposed to take that into  consideration when planning their activities--right now, because  there is a majority in the Senate (after amendments are  proposed, the budget must return to the Sejm anyway) and as a  representative of this chamber of the parliament, he will want  to "reconcile positions." Asked whether he will fulfill the  role of a mediator in the talks with the government, Struzik  replied that he certainly would like this problem to be resolved  favorably, but he does not know whether a mediator is needed  because it was the government that launched the talks  initiative. "The fact that the prime minister forwarded such an  invitation indicates that we are all looking for solutions."    Marian Krzaklewski said on Gdansk television that he expects  the meeting with the prime minister to be long and tough. He  believes that a brief talk would mean rejection of "S" demands,  and then the union's KK would immediately convene to make  decisions concerning means of increasing pressure on the  government. "The effect of our activities will depend on the  force of the pressure," stated Krzaklewski.    ZZGwP Head Jan Kisielinski told the Polish Press Agency PAP  that he does not think that meeting with the prime minister will  be the result, among other things, of the "S" action: "Pawlak,  at a time when he was not the head of the government, used to  say that he attaches great importance to meetings with trade  unions."  <H5>  Weaker Impact </H5>   Twelve miners in "Andaluzja" started an underground  occupational strike on Monday; they demand immediate talks with  the board of the Bytom Coal Partnership on a wage agreement.  PAP reports that the mine's directors say that all of the  strikers are miners from the partnership's 12 mines; they went  underground "without the knowledge and consent of the directors,  who are responsible for security."    Piotr Zak told RZECZPOSPOLITA that the protest has nothing  to  do with the KK action. At the last session of the Protest  Headquarters, "miners did not rule out the possibility that  there may be individual protests because there are wage  problems."    Yesterday's demonstrators handed in petitions and "S"  demands  to voivodes.    Today, from 1000 to 1200, there will be a strike through the  Bydgoszcz Region; however, excluded from the action are the  Municipal Transportation Establishments, State Motor Transport,  health service, education, etc. The heat energy plant in Elblag  has not yet resumed supplying heat to the municipal and  voivodship office in Elblag. In addition, one plant in Pila  voivodship and several in Konskie, in the Swietokrzyski Region,  will go on strike.</p>

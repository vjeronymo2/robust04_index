			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Acts of Aggravating Northeast Asian Situation" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today  comments on the tightened tieup between Japan and the United  States.    Recalling that U.S. Forces are planning to stage a joint  commanding exercise with the "Self-Defence" Airforce of Japan at  the airforce base in Florida, the analyst says: All the  military moves are grave acts of carrying the situation of the  Northeast Asian region including the Korean peninsula to the  extreme pitch of strain.    The analyst notes:    It must not go unnoticed that the military collusion between  Japan and the United States is being tightened when the United  States and its followers are intensifying as never before their  hostile moves to stifle the DPRK over its "nuclear issue".    The United States is advertising that the survey and  selection of the bases of the Japanese "Self-Defence Forces"  were "merely selection of shelters." But, in actuality, it is  related to the preparations for a new war in Korea.    As everyone knows, the United States is massing its forces  around the Korean peninsula, and Japan is frequently staging  joint military exercises with the United States. These are very  dangerous acts driving the situation in the Northeast Asian  region to the brink of war.    The Korean people and other Northeast Asian peoples will not  remain an onlooker to the acts of the United States and Japan  aggravating the situation in this region.    The U.S. and Japanese authorities must renounce their  military collusion and wild ambition for domination of Asia, as  demanded by the Asian people.</p>

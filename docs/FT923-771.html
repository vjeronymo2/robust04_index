			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Computers that can do it by the book: Electronic wizardry is helping literary research THE SUCCESS of Cambridge mathematician Alan Turing as a code-breaker is one of the legends of the second world war. Around 1944, when the German naval codes had all been cracked decisively by the government code and cypher school at Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, Turing had (in the words of his biographer, Andrew Hodges) 'learned how to build a brain - not an electric brain, as he might possibly have imagined before the war, but an electronic brain.' If Turing were alive today - the harsh English law against homosexual men led to his untimely death in 1954 - he would surely take a well-deserved pride in the universal labour-saving which the electronic brain he and other pioneers conceived plays in all our lives. He might have foreseen that it would revolutionise business and industrial practices, and that it would take over much of the ground-work in applied mathematics, the engineering sciences, physics and astronomy; but could he have imagined the inroads it has now begun to make into the area known traditionally as the humanities? Some of the most hitherto insoluble problems of authorship have begun to yield to scrutiny by Turing's electronic brain. The identity of the acidulous Whig activist who contributed letters to the public prints, attacking George III and other 18th century worthies under the pseudonym 'Junius,' was one of the earliest pieces of successful, computer-based research analysing an author's style. Swedish scholar Alvar Ellgard published his conclusions in A Statistical Method for Determining Authorship (1962), where he established the overwhelming probability that the scurrilous letters were written by Sir Philip Francis, Gibbon's schoolmaster and later a civil servant. Work of this kind where each word and punctuation mark in a text is computed into lists, charts and graphs designed to show the number of times it is used in a given type of sentence-formation - plotted against a putative norm  -once required the resource of a mainframe computer, the kind of machine available only to a scholar working in some handsomely endowed university research centre. Now, though, the equipment to undertake such a project is coming within the reach of anyone with a reasonably efficient modern home computer. Many of the Oxford dictionaries are now on computer disc and available commercially to the ordinary 'user'; so are several of the standard texts of the Oxford English School. The Oxford University Press has in train an extensive programme of electronic publishing, as I discovered on a visit to its headquarters at Walton Street, Oxford. 'Look here upon this picture, and on this . . .' as Hamlet says. In this instance, Picture One depicts 20 heavy, large, dark-blue volumes occupying 4.5 ft of shelf space and costing around Pounds 1,500 for the set (according to the bargain you strike with your supplier). Picture Two shows what author Anthony Burgess calls a 'silver beer mat'; in other words, a compact disc. This particular one costs Pounds 495.00. Both accommodate exactly the same amount of information - the entire contents of the Oxford English Dictionary 2nd edition (1989). In the first instance, all you need is a strong pair of arms and reasonably good eyesight;. in the second, a personal computer (PC) fitted with a CD-ROM drive. This is a gadget that extends a computer's memory vastly, necessary when the machine has to take on board the OED's 500,000 head words, their definitions, pronunciation, etymology, and the 24m quotations that illustrate their use in texts since the beginning of English. Many libraries and institutions have such a drive but most private PC owners do not (although it is becoming less expensive and is likely to become a standard option for them fairly soon). To run the OED electronically, you also need to have the Microsoft system known as Windows (version 3 or above); a Macintosh version of the OED 2nd edition will be available next spring. In this form, the OED has become a lexical database. Its users are able to look up English words in a variety of different ways, not just alphabetically as before. The entire dictionary may be scanned in less than a minute to give the answer to abstruse searches. Colonel Pickering in Pygmalion was an authority on spoken Sanskrit and was working with Professor Higgins on Indian dialect words in English. He would have been overjoyed at being able to 'wild card' - that is, put an asterisk against typical end-formations in English of the kind of words in which he was interested and, within 40 seconds, to have on screen a complete list of all such words in the dictionary. At a more frivolous level, crossword addicts may use the wild card command to find words of which they know only certain letters. There is an obvious benefit in having the OED available in this electronic form for its editors and compilers; it releases them from an incalculable amount of donkey work. Looking to the future, the editors now have the task of preparing the 3rd edition of the OED, scheduled for publication in 2005. Will there need to be a printed version of the 3rd edition at all or will by then everyone be using it electronically? That is a question to which the OUP does not yet know the answer. What is becoming clear is that the old system of issuing supplements between editions in order to keep up to date with new words and fresh shades of meaning can now be abandoned because these neologisms can, as soon as they are identified, be added to the database. It is not only lexicography that it is being given a new lease of life by the computer but classical and literary scholarship as well. Computers have been aiding scholars in deciphering early languages like Ancient Egyptian for many years, but now they are moving in force into the study of literature. The Americans have a project to put the whole of English poetry, from Langland to Larkin, on to computer disc, and some classical texts studied in the Oxford Greats School are available as software. The Bodleian Library in Oxford has a terminal in the reading room and classics dons at work on Virgil or Horace can be seen operating it. The OUP has just launched its Oxford Electronic Texts Library for English literature. This consists of The Complete Works of Jane Austen (Pounds 60), The Riverside Chaucer (Pounds 75), The Poetical Works of Samuel Coleridge (Pounds 60), and The Poetical Works of William Wordsworth (Pounds 60). These are all out now, and coming next Spring will be electronic versions of Hardy, Milton, Mary Shelley and Mary Wollstonecraft. The controversial modern spelling edition of William Shakespeare: The Complete Works, edited by Wells and Taylor and published in 1986, is now available to PC users at Pounds 95. None of these electronic texts has the search functions that are built into the electronic OED. They offer the standard Oxford texts on diskettes of regular size in which each line, as well as each page of the text, is enumerated. Used in combination with a text-analysis software package such as Micro-OCP (Oxford Pounds 175.00), however, you can very easily get your computer to make searches, word lists, concordances and indexes from them. What use, though, is it for the person who does not happen to be studying for a BA in English or a B Litt to have such a resource? Clearly, no use at all. If you just want to sit by the swimming pool and read Northanger Abbey for fun, you would be much better off with the Worlds Classics paperback. But it is important, even to such a reader, to have a text as close as possible to the one approved by the author. Computers can play an important role in establishing an authentic text and, in some cases, establishing authorship as well. A new computer-based literary discipline called Stylology has begun to emerge in which texts are submitted to computational tests not merely as part of textual scholarship but also in the hope of arriving at new critical insights. An outstanding example of this is the book Computation into Criticsm: A Study of Jane Austen's Novels and An Experiment in Method by JF Burrows (Oxford, Pounds 25.00). The author, an Australian professor of English, checked the speech habits of all the main characters in Jane Austen through an extended series of computer tests and collated them, using methods borrowed from statistics, to determine variations from normal or average usage. Burrows' findings inevitably are the source of much debate in English faculties. They have been welcomed warmly in an appreciative review by at least one prominent member of the Oxbridge establishment: Marilyn Butler, the Cambridge professor of English Literature. His charts and graphs of pronoun usage by Elizabeth Bennett, Mr D'Arcy and the rest prove beyond any doubt (if they prove nothing else) that, in a novel, the distinction made up to now between the 'grammatical' words said to be inert, and the 'lexical' words said to be the source of energy, no longer holds. Burrows shows in innumerable ways how grammatical words are as great a source of fictional energy as the lexical ones in character building, narrative development etc. Move over, Dr Leavis, you have had your byte at the cherry. Now let the computer have its turn.</p>

Our exporters lost at least $200 million last year because  of  tough restrictions on the export of Russian uranium to the  United States. A number of U.S. uranium extracting enterprises,  supported by the Department of Commerce, have accused Russia of  dumping and virtually forced the signing of a discriminatory  agreement whose terms reduced to a minimum the sale of natural  and slightly enriched uranium on the U.S. market.    Our experts believe that this is only the first eruption of  the trade war between the two largest producers of this output.  It looks as though Russia has little chance of victory despite  the fact that it may gain some indulgences in the next few days  for the import of its uranium to the United States.    In late January the agreement initialed during U.S. Vice  President Albert Gore's visit to Moscow should enter into force.  Russia will be able to dispatch to the U.S. market up to 3,000  tonnes of natural uranium and 1,000 tonnes of slightly enriched  uranium. It will be used as fuel for U.S. nuclear electric  power stations. Supplies to a total sum of $200 million are  planned for two years. In the opinion of THE WALL STREET  JOURNAL the agreement pursues a purely political aim -- helping  Russia financially.    But Russian exporters expect that the opponents of the  uranium contract will be able to block it. IZVESTIYA was told  by Aleksey Grigoryev, director of the Russian "Uranservis" firm,  who has had gruelling talks on the subject for two years, that  the Americans are prepared to stand to the death to bar Russian  competitors from their market. The head of our firm is very  skeptical about the indulgences which we have now managed to  achieve. The new agreement, in his opinion, is still  discriminatory. The United States will buy from Russia just as  much uranium as U.S. producers can sell of this energy carrier  on the domestic market. The "linkage" principle makes talk on  free trade an empty sound, Aleksey Grigoryev believes.    The "Uranservis" director said it was unfair to accuse  Russia  of dumping. He said that our raw material has never been sold  in the United States at prices below prime cost. But the U.S.  Department of Commerce, which spent a year carrying out an  antidumping study, has refused to recognize the Russian side's  information as authentic, on the grounds that it comes from a  country with a nonmarket economy.    The uranium extracting sector remains a top secret one in  Russia and U.S. experts believe that the labor of prisoners is  still used at the mines. That is how the low cost of mining is  ensured.    The "Uranservis" director does not have information about  the  annual extraction volume of this strategic raw material but he  announced that stocks in Russia are sufficient for many years.  Storehouses have been full since 1989 when the sector stopped  working for defense needs, Aleksey Grigoryev said.    According to unconfirmed Western assessments total stocks of  enriched uranium alone in Russia are 50-70 percent more than the  total stocks of all other countries. With this resource Russia  has nonetheless been deprived of selling even a small proportion  because of tough competition, primarily from the United States  which, according to THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, controls half the  world market in uranium products. Russia controls only 5  percent.</p>

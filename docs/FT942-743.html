			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Gummer pressed on nature quango Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, is under pressure to disclose whether directors of English Nature, the government's nature conservation watchdog, face potential conflicts of interest with posts that they hold in the private sector. Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment secretary, yesterday confirmed that he had tabled a written parliamentary question to Mr Gummer, asking him to outline the guidelines that exist for appointments to English Nature and other Department of Environment quangos. Mr Smith is raising the issue amid concern over the role of Lord Cranbrook, a Conservative peer, who has been chairman of English Nature since 1991. Lord Cranbrook is chairman of the environmental advisory board of Shanks and McEwan, the waste disposal company, and has been a non-executive director of Anglia Water since 1989. Mr Smith said yesterday: 'I am sure there has been no specific conflict of interest that has affected any decision at English Nature. But I want to assure the public that this is the case. 'If it turns out that there are guidelines for such an appointment, I would be interested to know what they are. If not, then that may be a cause of concern.' The government will shortly be putting fresh proposals to Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the gas industry regulator, to fund the Energy Savings Trust, Mr Gummer said yesterday. He told the environment select committee that the proposals would be 'very detailed', and would be based on recommendations from a group he had set up to look at the options. Last spring, Ms Spottiswoode startled the committee by saying she did not think it was her role to impose a levy on gas consumers to fund the trust, which is central to the government's strategy to conserve energy and reduce harmful emissions. He also said the UK would be able to exceed the target it has set itself to return carbon dioxide emissions to their 1990 level by the year 2000.</p>

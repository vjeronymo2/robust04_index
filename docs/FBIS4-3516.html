			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Uruguayan Vice  President Gonzalo Aguirre Ramirez met with the visiting Chinese  Communist Party delegation at the Parliament building here on  Monday [18 April].    The delegation, headed by Hu Jintao, member of the Standing  Committee of the party's politburo, arrived here Monday at the  invitation of Uruguay's ruling Blanco Party.    Aguirre, who is also president of the National Congress,  extended his warm welcome to the delegation, saying that  bilateral ties have seen smooth development since the  establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.    Hu, the highest-ranking Chinese Communist Party official  ever  visited a Latin American nation, said the purpose of his visit  is to promote friendship, cooperation, peace and development.    At the meeting, the Chinese official also hoped to further  strengthen the friendly relations between the Chinese Communist  Party and Uruguayan political parties and between the  parliaments of the two countries.    Meanwhile, Hu had a meeting with Uruguay's former president  Julio Maria Sanguinetti Monday and they exchanged views over  both national and international issues of mutual concern.    Uruguay is the first leg of Hu's three-nation tour, which  will also take him to Argentina and Brazil.</p>

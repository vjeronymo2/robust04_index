			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Business Travel (Update): Allergy sufferers The Basle Hilton, which has just been renovated, has designed seven of its 214 rooms to meet the special needs of allergy sufferers, the tall, the blind, the deaf, the elderly and other handicapped people, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. This laudable effort is not believed to be related to the fact that the hotel is frequently used by central bankers attending meetings of the Bank for International Settlements next door. In the four rooms for allergy sufferers, parquet floors replace rugs, special varnishes have been used, and non-allergenic wallpapers, wallpaper pastes and bedding have been chosen. Additional air filters minimise dust. For the blind, there are braille newspapers and menus. For those with weak sight or hearing, an under-pillow vibrator serves as an alarm clock. The tall can find extra long beds (2.3m) and high desks. These services come at no premium to the double-room rates of SFr270 to SFr390 (Pounds 130 to Pounds 188) a night, and the hotel undertakes to give SFr5 to charity for each night the rooms are occupied by a handicapped person.</p>

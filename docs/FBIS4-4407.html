In the telephone conversation that lasted 14 minutes  beginning 4:30 P.M., President Kim explained about his recent  visit to China and exchanged views on the U.N.

Chongwadae [presidential office] spokesman Chu Ton-sik said  the president stressed during the call that there is no change  in his conviction that there absolutely needs joint efforts  among South Korea, United States and Japan to resolve the  nuclear issue.    Kim expressed satisfaction at the U.N. Security Council  president's statement, saying that since the statement reflected  opinions of China. China is expected to make closer cooperation  in getting the nuclear issue settled.    The president also said that during his recent visit to  China, he made it clear that South Korea does not want to see  North Korea isolated from the rest of the world nor is Seoul  interested in achieving unification by absorbing North Korea.    Hosokawa said in the telephone talks that Japan, too,  supports the U.N. Security Council president's statement  because he said it calls for what North Korea ought to do.    The Japanese premier said he expects there will be full  exchange of opinions when South Korean Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu visits Japan on April 3, the Chongwadae spokesman said.</p>

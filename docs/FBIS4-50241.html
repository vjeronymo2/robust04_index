General Principles </H5>   Chapter II. Basic Requirements and Training of  Active Duty Officers    Chapter III. Evaluation and Job Appointment and  Removal of Active Duty Officers    Chapter IV. Reward and Punishment for Active Duty  Officers    Chapter V. Remuneration for Active Duty Officers    Chapter VI. Officers' Retiring From Active Duty    Chapter VII. Supplementary Articles  <H5>  Chapter I. General Principles </H5>   Article 1. These regulations are established to build a  corps of military officers who are more revolutionary, younger  in average age, better educated, and professionally more  competent, in order to help the People's Liberation Army [PLA]  accomplish the mission entrusted by the state.    Article 2. PLA active duty officers are active duty service  members who have been appointed to a post at or above the  platoon level or to a professional technical post at or above  the junior level, and on whom a commensurate military rank has  been conferred.    According to the nature of their jobs, officers are of four  categories -- military officers, political officers, logistics  officers, and professional technical officers.    Article 3. In selecting and using officers, we must adhere  to the principle of appointing people on their merits; ensure  those selected have both political integrity and ability, and  have performed well; exchange officers in a timely manner; and  adopt a democratic supervision system.    Article 4. The state decides various remuneration for  officers according to the principle of giving preferential  treatment to active duty service members.    Article 5. Officers who meet the requirements stipulated in  these regulations concerning retiring from active duty should  retire from active duty.    Article 6. The PLA General Political Headquarters is in  charge of the management of all officers; political organs of  units at or above the regiment level are in charge of the  management of officers of their respective units.  <H5>  Chapter II. Basic Requirements and Training of Active Duty </H5> Officers    Article 7. Officers must meet the following basic  requirements:    (1) Be loyal to the motherland; willing to wholeheartedly  serve the people; and able to self-consciously dedicate  themselves to national defense work.    (2) They must abide by the constitution, law, and relevant  regulations; carry out the state's principles and policies, and  abide by military regulations and system; and obey order and  command.    (3) They must have the theoretical level, ability to  understand policy, scientific knowledge, educational level,  professional knowledge, and organizing and command ability  required to carry out their assigned job; and have good health.    (4) They must cherish soldiers, be fair and upright, be  honest in performing official duties, and be willing to work  hard and to sacrifice themselves.    Article 8. The PLA adopts the system in which officers are  selected after receiving training at a military academy.    Military, political, and logistics officers who are at a  command post below the battalion level should have been trained  at a junior-level command academy; those who are at a command  post at the regimental and division level should have been  trained at an intermediate-level command academy; and those who  are at a command post at or above the army level should have  been trained at a high- level command academy.    Officers who are office workers should have been trained at  a  pertinent military academy.    Professional technical officers should have been trained at  a  special technical school at a level commensurate to their job.    Outstanding soldiers may be promoted as officers after  receiving training at a military academy.    Article 9. If officers trained by military academies cannot  meet demand, outstanding soldiers may be selected for training  at other training organs designated by PLA general departments  and may be promoted as officers after they successfully complete  the training courses. Or, graduates of institutes of higher  learning other than military academies, and professional  technical personnel may be recruited and appointed officers.  During wartime, soldiers, drafted reserve service officers, and  personnel of non-military departments may also be directly  appointed officers.    Chapter III. Evaluation, Appointment and Removal of  Active Service Officers    Article 10. The principal leading officers and political  organs at various levels should evaluate officers under their  jurisdiction according to the principle of division of work with  individual responsibility.    The method of integrating the evaluation of officers by both  leading officers and the masses should be adopted in  evaluations. It is necessary to evaluate officers in an  all-around way in accordance with the basic conditions for  officers and the criteria for evaluating officers set by the  Central Military Commission, with their actual work performances  as the main basis for evaluation. The results of evaluations  shall be used as the main basis for appointing or removing  officers.    The appointment and removal of officers must be done  following the evaluation of officers in question, and must not  be done without due evaluation.    Article 11. The authorization and limit of power in  appointing or removing officers:    (1) The chief of General Staff, director of the General  Political Department down to principal division level officers  shall be appointed or removed by the chairman of the Central  Military Commission [CMC].

The principal battalion level officers of independent  divisions shall be appointed or removed by commanders and  political commissars of concerned independent divisions.    (4) Deputy battalion level officers and other officers of  lower levels and junior specialized technical officers shall be  appointed or removed by division commanders (brigade commanders)  and political commissars or by the principal officers of units  at division (brigade) level with the power to appoint and remove  officers.    The appointment and removal of officers listed in the above  categories shall be made according to the procedures set by the  CMC.    Article 12. In battles or in performing rescue activities  and other emergency tasks, the leading officer at the higher  level shall have the power to temporarily remove officers under  his command if they reject orders, do not carry out duties, or  are unfit for the assigned tasks; and the leading officer may  also temporarily assign other officers to fill the vacated  posts. When there are vacant posts due to other reasons, the  leading officers at the higher level may also temporarily assign  other officers to fill the vacant posts.    The temporary removal or assignment of officers due to the  above conditions should be reported to the higher level units  with the power of appointing or removing officers, which will  review and make a decision in order to complete the procedures  for appointment or removal of officers.

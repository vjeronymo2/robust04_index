			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: French request on air routes rejected  -European Court The president of the European Court of Justice has rejected France's application for suspension of the European Commission's April 1994 decision on access to the Paris (Orly)-Marseille and Paris (Orly)-Toulouse air routes. He said the alleged damage to Air Inter, the French regional airline, and French air transport had not been established. The Commission's decision said France could not rely on the exclusivity provisions of the 1992 council regulation (2408/92) on access to Community air routes to refuse Community airlines access to the contested routes, in favour of Air Inter. In June 1993, TAT European Airlines had applied to the French authorities for a licence to operate on the contested routes. The application was rejected on the basis of the 1992 regulation which permitted exclusive concessions on internal routes for a transitional period, when service could not be assured by other forms of transport. The French authorities claimed Air Inter, part of the Air France group, enjoyed exclusivity under a 1985 agreement. In September 1993, TAT complained to the Commission, relying on a number of grounds including breach of the 1992 regulation. It argued France had agreed in October 1990 to terminate the Air France monopoly over the contested Orly routes by March 1 1992. Since TAT served the same routes from Paris Charles de Gaulle, Air Inter did not have exclusivity as envisaged by the regulation. TAT claimed the consequent discrimination between TAT and Air Inter in the allocation of routes infringed the 1992 regulation. TAT asked the Commission to adopt a decision under the 1992 regulation, saying France could not continue to apply the measure in issue. The contested decision was adopted on April 27, giving France until October 27 to comply. In dismissing the French application for suspension of the Commission decision, the ECJ president said the rules of procedure required two conditions to be satisfied: urgency and prima facie grounds for interim measures. To be urgent, it must be necessary for the Court to adopt interim measures to prevent serious and irreparable harm resulting from the immediate application of the challenged decision. The president rejected France's arguments that serious and irreparable harm would result. France claimed that Air Inter would lose 35 per cent market share within one year. This would prevent its operation of allegedly unprofitable services on the contested routes. Consequently, it would have to grant state aids to Air Inter to maintain that service, but would not be able to adopt the necessary measures before the end of 1995. France also maintained the immediate application of the decision would cause serious harm to the organisation of French air transport and the policy of territorial management. And since the exclusivity provisions of the regulation would expire on January 1 1996, the main appeal would be without purpose and the alleged damage irreparable. The Commission's response was that the evidence on the market evolution and profitability of Air Inter, which was unchallenged, revealed that it was unprofitable on international routes and not Orly routes. Even if specific regional routes were to be given up by Air Inter, which was unlikely, it said there were other airlines with lower costs which could enter the market and maintain French air transport policy. The president concluded the predicted losses were uncertain. Even if French estimates were correct, the risk that Air Inter would abandon certain loss-making regional routes was a hypothesis subject to innumerable unpredictabilities. And if that did happen, there was no reason to believe the French authorities would be unable to ensure continuity of those routes by inviting other airlines to service them or by imposing public interest obligations in accordance with the 1992 regulation. Since the harm alleged was not established, it was not necessary to decide if prima facie grounds for interim measures existed.

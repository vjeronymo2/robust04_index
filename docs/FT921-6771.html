			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Israel demands permanent right of settlement: Confidential plan for occupied territories dismays Arab delegates ISRAEL has presented the Arab delegations at the Middle East peace talks with a plan for Palestinian self-rule under which Israelis would have the right to live and settle in the occupied territories indefinitely. The hard-line Israeli proposal, understood to have been put forward in Washington on Monday, falls far short of the arrangements that Israel agreed to 10 years ago. Arab delegates said yesterday they were dismayed both by the content and the tone of the document. They said it indicated that Israel, far from wishing to allow genuine Palestinian self-rule, was determined to tighten its control over the occupied territories. While they recognise that the latest plan is part of a tough Israeli negotiating stance, some Arab delegates question how much longer they can remain involved in the Middle East peace process. Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi said the Israeli ideas were 'an insult to our intelligence' because they perpetuate the Israeli occupation and endorse continued Jewish settlements. She said the Palestinian negotiators would refuse to take up self-rule until the issues of settlements and human rights in lands the Arabs lost in the 1967 Six-Day War are resolved. The US has avoided commenting on the details of the negotiations, but Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, will take little comfort from the Israeli proposals. Mr Baker announced on Monday that Israel would only be granted the Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.7bn) in loan guarantees it has requested if it agrees to stop building new settlements in the West Bank, Gaza and Golan Heights. Under agreements negotiated between Israel, the US and Egypt at Camp David in 1978, and at subsequent meetings up to mid-1981, it was agreed that the Palestinians should enjoy 'full autonomy' for a five-year period before the final status of the territories was negotiated. Israel also proposed at Camp David to end its military government and withdraw its forces to specified security zones following free elections for a self-governing Palestinian authority. The Palestinians were to be given a large measure of responsibility for managing their own affairs. In the latest, confidential Israeli proposals outlined to the US and the Arab delegations, Israel: Has dropped any suggestion of a redeployment of the army. Makes no mention of an elected authority. Insists that it will have sole responsibility for security in all its aspects. In addition, Israel stresses that self-rule will apply only to people, not to land; that all existing links between Israel and the occupied territories will remain; and that there will be full 'co-operation and co-ordination' between the interim self-governing authority and the Israeli government. The Palestinian body would not have any authority over Israelis living in the occupied territories or for Arabs in east Jerusalem. The Palestinians and other Arab delegations have demanded the withdrawal of Israeli forces and the right to self-determination. In a meeting with Palestinian delegation leaders last week Mr Baker had urged them to be patient and await his announcement on loan guarantees, to remain within the peace process and to concentrate on making positive proposals for self-rule. Mr Benyamin Netanyahu, a senior aid to Israeli prime minister Yitzak Shamir, took a combative stance last night to the US demand for a halt to new Jewish settlements on occupied Arab lands. He warned in a television interview that Israel would take its case to the American people.</p>

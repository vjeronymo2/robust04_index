			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Howard warns water bosses over pay CHAIRMEN of water companies should set an example in pay restraint, Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said yesterday. 'I know that many people share my concern at the very large pay rises for senior management in the water industry over the last two years,' he said. Since the 10 water and sewerage companies in England and Wales were privatised late in 1989, their top executives' salaries, bonuses and share option allocations have risen sharply and the companies' twice-yearly publication of profits has often provoked public criticism of pay levels. Mr Howard added that the government wanted public sector pay rises next year to be below 1.5 per cent. 'We are entitled to look to the leaders of utility companies to set an example,' he said. Speaking at Thames Water's opening of a new water treatment plant, he emphasised that his remarks were not directed at Sir Roy Watts, Thames' chairman, who saw his pay cut in the last financial year from Pounds 160,000 to Pounds 145,000 because of a fall in bonuses. Mr Howard's remarks drew a sharp rebuttal from some companies. Mr Dennis Grove, chairman of North West Water, who received a 15 per cent increase in the year to March 1992 to Pounds 166,000, said: 'We have to pay the market rates to get and keep the good people. These jobs are very demanding.' He added that only part of a director's pay was charged to the water company's core, regulated business. However Mr Andrew Horne, corporate affairs manager of Northumbrian Water, said: 'I don't think in the future that you will see anything like the past few years' increases.' In the year to March 1992 the salary of Northumbrian's chairman Sir Michael Straker rose by 51 per cent to Pounds 77,000 - one of the highest rises although one of the smallest total amounts.

			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DETECTIVE'S DEATH AND GUN CONTROL  </P> <P> In response to "Veteran L.A. Detective Dies in Restaurant Shoot-Out," Part A,  Oct. 11:  </P> <P> Russell Kuster was a casualty of war. Anyone who crossed his path, as I did on  a newspaper story back in 1979, quickly recognized that he was devoted to his  job and, more than many, he loved being alive.  </P> <P> Flying the city's flags at half-staff for 30 days is an appropriate reminder of  his passing, but a more fitting memorial would be a genuinely tough handgun  control law, a swifter, surer criminal justice system (six weeks from arrest to  jail in England!) and a national computer to keep track of career criminals  such as Kuster's assailant. Kuster will be remembered as long as there are  police and people who care about them.  </P> <P> RODERICK THORP, Duarte  </P></p>

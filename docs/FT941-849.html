			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: London Gilts will struggle to find support this week after another battering from investors. Last week's inflation figures, while not disastrous, failed to provide the boost the market desperately needed. While Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, is holding his monthly monetary meeting with Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, on Wednesday, hopes are fading that they will agree to a rate cut. The inflation figures were simply not good enough, especially as the authorities were perceived to have lost credibility with the timing of their February cut. Furthermore, sterling has been extremely weak, and a rate cut, which might easily be perceived as political, would be poorly received by currency traders. Following the example of the US, the markets are already looking ahead to the time when the authorities will have to increase rates. Prices in the futures market imply higher rates by June. Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International (Europe), thinks this pessimism on rates is overdone. 'The gilt market is fundamentally good value but in technical terms it is looking pretty awful,' he says. With no economic statistics of note, and with Easter approaching, the market is unlikely to find it easy to rally this week.</p>

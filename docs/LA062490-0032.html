			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> GOING IN STYLE: Dead Boys' lead singer Stiv Bators, who was hit by a car and  killed recently, was always a Doors fan. So much so, says I.R.S. Records  (Bators' label), that Stiv, according to his wishes, was cremated and had his  ashes spread on Jim Morrison's grave in Paris. . . . When Slaughter (who is  currently on a nationwide tour with Kiss) hits Philadelphia for several dates  beginning Tuesday, the band will skip the local hotel circuit -- and stay at  the home of a die-hard fan, Dan Zimmerman, who invited the group to hang with  him (at his parents' house, of course).  </P> <P> When the group heard that the 19-year-old fan's house had a huge back yard,  swimming pool and live-in gourmet cook, they said: 'Later, Holiday Inn!'  Actually, the band members warned the family that they'd have a huge tour bus  parked in front of the house, with five raucous roadies on board -- but the  invitation stood. "It's gonna be great," said bassist Dana Strum. "The parents  said they were looking forward to our visit."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 13 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs and  Moslems have agreed to a ceasefire around the Moslem enclave of  Gorazde, Russian special envoy Vitaliy Churkin said Wednesday  [13 April].    According to the Bosnian Serb SRNA news agency, Churkin said  after a meeting with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic at his  Pale headquarters that the "accord should help lead to a general  ceasefire between Moslems and Serbs."    "I received assurances from the Serb and Moslem parties that  they did not intend to engage in offensive acts in the Gorazde  region, where the situation seems to be calm at the moment," he  said.    "I think what we have achieved in Sarajevo and what we hope  to achieve in Gorazde must be applied across the whole of  Bosnia," he said, declining to say whether an actual ceasefire  document had been signed.    Churkin, the personal envoy of Russian President Boris  Yeltsin, has been mediating between the Bosnian Serb and Moslem  factions and the UN Protection Force since Tuesday [12 April].  He had earlier met Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic.    The latest crisis in Bosnia, sparked by a Bosnian Serb  offensive on Gorazde, was heightened at the weekend when North  Atlantic Treaty Organization aircraft launched two air strikes  against the besieging forces.    Churkin added: "All the parties to the conflict must  understand that political accords about Gorazde cannot be  implemented without their cooperation with the international  community and among themselves."</p>

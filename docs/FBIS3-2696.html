			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hefei, March 8 (XINHUA) -- Anhui Province, in east  China, with a population of 59 million, has become one of the  provinces with the fastest economic growth speed.    According to the latest statistics, the province's gross  domestic product last year amounted to 94 billion yuan, and the  rate of growth was the third highest in the country.    Its gross industrial output value last year was the seventh  greatest in the country, and its agricultural output value fifth.    Anhui, whose rate of growth of foreign trade ranks sixth in  the country, has caught national attention, a provincial  official in charge of economic development said.    The official attributed the good result to the hard efforts  of its citizens who have taken an active part in the reforms, in  a down-to-earth manner.    Last year saw Anhui's state-owned enterprises spend 17.17  billion yuan on fixed assets, an increase of 42.6 percent over  the previous year, and 6.26 billion on technical transformation,  also up 42.6 percent.    Infrastructure facilities which were completed last year  included a railway running from Hefei, capital of the province,  to Anqing, an ancient city on the bank of the Chang Jiang River;  a furnace with a capacity of 2,500 cubic meters in the Ma'anshan  Iron and Steel Complex; and advanced program control telephone  exchanges in every county town in the province.    Construction of a number of key national capital projects is  in full swing. Included are a Chang Jiang River highway bridge  in Tongling City and the Tongling Cement Plant.    Anhui, which took the lead in China's rural economic reform,  has paid attention to developing quality and efficient  agriculture, and encouraged the surplus rural labor force to set  up more rural industrial enterprises or go to cities to contract  for construction and other work.    Anhui's agricultural output value last year totalled 41.7  billion yuan, an increase of 8.5 percent over the previous year,  exceeding the average annual increase rate of 2.8 percent in the  1986-90 period. Its gross output value generated by rural  industrial enterprises last year also set a record.    By carrying out the enterprise reform, a number of key state  enterprises have rejuvenated themselves.    At present, 15 prefectural centers and cities have opened  securities markets, paving the way for enterprises to collect  funds for modernization.    In addition, Anhui is building an economic belt from Wuhu  City on the banks of the Chang Jiang River to Hefei and  Huangshan, one of China's tourist attractions, while improving  transport facilities to link the province to other parts of the  country as well as the outside world.    The improved investment conditions have helped the province  to boost its foreign trade and attract more foreign investment.    Anhui's import and export volume topped 1.2 billion U.S.  dollars last year, an increase of 15 percent over the previous  year.    Included were exports totalling 960 million U.S. dollars, up  16 percent.    The official said: "With abundant natural resources and  convenient transport facilities, Anhui has become a favored  place for overseas investment."    Business people from Taiwan and Japan and elsewhere are  streaming into the province, which has concluded dozens of  contracts on the technical transformation of old enterprises and  improvement of urban infrastructure facilities.    A survey shows that the provincial government approved the  establishment of 1,040 overseas-funded enterprises last year.</p>

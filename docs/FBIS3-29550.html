			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Appeal by Generals, Officers, and Troops of FUNCINPEC and </F> all types of Para Soldiers To Oppose Their Chiefs;" dated 19  February -- read by announcer]    [Text] 1. On 18 February Tea Chamrat, Yu Hokkri, and Khan  Savoeun -- Army offciers of FUNCINPEC [National United Front for  an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and  co-ministers of national defense and security of the two-headed  government -- led hundreds of soldiers and policemen with many  tanks and armored vehicles and many large and small weapons to  attack and burn 400 houses of other FUNCINPEC soldiers and their  families and of other Para [troops of the Khmer People's  National Liberation Front] soldiers in Stoeng Meanchey,  Chaomchau [Phnom Penh suburb]. Fifteeen soldiers and their  families died and over 30 were wounded; 60 were arrested.    2. The above savage and brutal act has caused all FUNCINPEC  and other Para [Khmer People's National Liberation Front]  soldiers to go through the roof with their anger. This  represents FUNCINPEC Army officers and officials killing their  men with their own hands. None of us ever thought this would  happen.    What is the status of our chiefs now? Are they betraying  their men? Are they colluding with the Hun Sen-Chea Sim group,  lackeys of communist Vietnam? Can we remain with these chiefs?  What should we do to stay alive? FUNCINPEC chiefs rounded us  up to fight with no salary. Many of us died with no one caring  for us. We starved and were very poor to the point of almost  begging to stay alive. Our wives and children have been raped,  oppressed, and exploited like animals. Land and houses have  been plundered by our chiefs and we have practically nothing  left. Our lives are constantly in the death pit. We asked for  a salary, but were refused. We asked for a plot of land, but  were also refused. They instead forced us to fight and die in  great numbers, leaving our wives and children behind. There is  no justice. They have been killing us. If puppets of communist  Vietnam kill the nation and the people and plunder land and  other property of the nation and people, they voice their  support for this.    What should we do? We should fight back. We should flee and  return to the farms, till the land, and grow crops to live as  dignified persons. We should not be lackeys and allow ourselves  to be killed at will.    For the commands of Divisions 9, 3, 11, 7, 8, 12, and 5 of  ANKI [National Army of Independent Camabodia -- FUNCINPEC  troops].    [Dated] 19 February 1994</p>

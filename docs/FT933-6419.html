			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Expanding Wolseley in Pounds 51m US buy WOLSELEY, the heating and plumbing distributor, has turned its sights back to the US after several continental European acquisitions. It is paying up to Pounds 51.5m for Erb Lumber, a distributor of lumber and associated products with 47 leased branches in Michigan, Indiana and Ohio. With Wolseley raising more than Pounds 100m through share placings with a wide range of institutions yesterday, further acquisitions are expected soon. The group is financing the Erb acquisition through a vendor placing of 8.1m new ordinary shares at 632p each. The shares closed yesterday unchanged at 654p. At the same time Wolseley placed another 8.7m shares raising a further Pounds 55m. The 16.8m shares represent about 6.8 per cent of the equity. The placings were separated to comply with Stock Exchange requirements. Mr Richard Ireland, finance director, said yesterday that it seemed sensible to make a cash placing at the same time as the Erb placing as discussions were under way on further possible purchases. He declined, however, to give any details. Erb Lumber, an 80 year old company, returned pre-tax profits of Dollars 12.1m (Pounds 8m) last year on turnover of Dollars 271.3m. Wolseley said the acquisition would substantially boost its US lumber business and more than double annual sales of Carolina Builders Corporation of Raleigh, North Carolina, a wholly owned subsidiary. Total US turnover for Wolseley last year was Pounds 997m. The group will pay Pounds 46.3m, about 90 per cent of the total price, on completion. The balance will be paid in two further instalments based on Erb's net asset value on August 31. In March, Wolseley reported a 41 per cent increase in pre-tax profits of Pounds 47.6m for the six months to end-January on turnover of Pounds 1.1bn. Analysts are looking for a full-year outcome of Pounds 110m or more when the results appear in October.</p>

Her move comes as the future of her agency and others is uncertain because of budgetary pressures and shifting political priorities. The secret services are to have their spending, administration and policies scrutinised by a parliamentary committee for the first time later this year. Mrs Rimington said that while the Ulster ceasefires were welcome 'after so many years of violence we must remain cautious'.

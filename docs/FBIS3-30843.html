"Mr. Berov's cabinet is about to finally ruin your country's  reputation by its inadequate policy and the continual  Yugo-embargo busting," representatives of UN Sanctions  Assistance Mission told DEMOKRATSIYA in an informal talk.  Reportedly, they were categorical that evidence of sanctions  busting could be found at all state administration levels. "The  silence and inaction of the government implies blending of  organized economic crime and government officials," the daily  writes. According to the paper, at least four trains crossed  the border with Serbia at Kalotina-Dragoman on Saturday and  Sunday (February 5-6), one of them carrying 53 tanks of aviation  petrol.    Answering some accusations in an interview for OTECHESTVEN  VESTNIK, the chief of the Central Service for Organized Crime  Control, Col. Fedor Vladimirov, points out that "nobody has  tried to misuse the information the Organized Crime Control  Service has in its possession." Saying that the service he  heads has "ample" information about attempted embargo busting  and that investigative proceedings have also been initiated,  Col. Vladimirov refuses to give further details because the  information is top secret.</p>

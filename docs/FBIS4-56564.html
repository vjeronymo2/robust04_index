			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks recorded] </F>   [Text] Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin concluded an  official and intense visit to Cuba, which included with a  meeting with Cuban President Fidel Castro. Sanin described the  meeting as frank, profound, and enriching for increased mutual  understanding.    [Sanin] "President Fidel Castro's appearance was the same as  always, because I have always seen him as dynamic, energetic,  and in perfect health. We also had a long conversation and I  believe that after we finished, he went on to other matters.  Therefore, his health is perfect. I bear a message of friendship  from President Castro to President Gaviria, which was the same  message I delivered, as two countries that have full diplomatic  relations."    During the news conference Minister Sanin responded to  questions referring to the sale of Colombian oil to Cuba.    [Sanin] "This is merely a commercial issue, and it is being  treated in that manner by Colombia and Cuba. We are discussing  methods of payment, guarantees, and the time period."    Noemi Sanin spoke to reporters about her visit to Cuba  during  the news conference.    [Sanin] "It has been a very successful visit because we have  completed the entire agenda. We have exchanged opinions, and we  reviewed our new relations because it has only been seven months  since they were reestablished. Nevertheless, we must stress that  the relations are dynamic."    Minister Sanin also met with Revolutionary Armed Forces  Minister Army General Raul Castro; Carlos Lage, vice president  of Council State; Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National  Assembly of the People's Government; and other governmental  officials. Foreign Ministers Sanin and Robaina signed an  agreement in the area of education that standardizes higher  education diplomas and titles. Furthermore, they exchanged the  instruments of ratification for the cultural cooperation  agreement signed in 1978 between the two nations.    Early, this morning, Sanin inaugurated the Colombian Hall at  the National Library, which received a large donation of books  on different topics. At the inauguration of the display, Sanin  said: We want Cubans to get to know us better. She also took  advantage of the opportunity to announce the creation of chairs  on Cuba in several Colombian universities.    Noemi Sanin also visited the House of the Americas, which  received a donation of Colombian art. During a meeting she held  there with Cuban writers and artists, she recognized Cuba's  achievements in the cultural and educational fields and called  for greater bilateral exchanges in those spheres.    Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin departed for Caracas  earlier this evening, where she will participate in a summit  between the presidents of Venezuela and Colombia.</p>

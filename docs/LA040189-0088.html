			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIDER WRONGLY BLAMES BICYCLE FEDERATION  </P> <P> As I read Shav Glick's (March 25) article on Barbara Buchan and was cheered by  the story of one woman's triumph over adversity, I found myself suddenly jolted  by a few paragraphs at the end of the article.  </P> <P> It's not pleasant to write hard words about someone who has had their fill of  hardship. But having read Buchan's comments on her suit against the U.S.  Cycling Federation, I have to say something.  </P> <P> I also suffered a head injury in a sanctioned race. I also was wearing a  leather helmet. I was lucky, my skull (and other bones) healed. I knew, going  in, that cycling could be a dangerous sport. I knew that I should have been  wearing a hard-shell helmet (in 1975), and today I wear one every time I get on  my bike.  </P> <P> I am appalled that Buchan blames the organizers for not forcing her to wear a  hard-shell helmet. The helmets were widely available in 1982. She had a choice  to make. She made the wrong one, and she is paying for that choice.  </P> <P> Her story is one of perseverance and hope triumphing over that tragedy.  Unfortunately, it's also a commentary on our times. The Sierra Club can no  longer sponsor climbs. Perhaps soon the USCF will be unable to sponsor amateur  races.  </P> <P> Buchan's story is a tragedy, brought on by bad bike handling and chance; I'm  saddened that she chose to attack the rest of us who love the sport to satisfy  her sense of justice.  </P> <P> MARC DANZIGER  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON WHITE HOUSE IMAGES  </P> <P> There are photographs of all but the first seven men to hold the office of  President. But not until 1860 did photography helped a candidate get elected to  the White House.  </P> <P> On Feb. 27, 1860, a little-known Illinois lawyer walked into Mathew Brady's New  York studio to have his portrait shot before he spoke at Cooper Union. Copies  of that photograph of Abraham Lincoln were widely distributed on baseball  card-sized boards; Lincoln later credited Brady and his Cooper Union speech  with playing crucial roles in getting him elected to the presidency.  </P> <P> Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first President to keep a military photographer  around to shore up his public image; staff photographers and photojournalists  through the days of President John F. Kennedy kept the public in touch with the  magic of the office.  </P> <P> George Tames, a New York Timesman and the 71-year-old dean of the White House  photography corps, recalled taking pictures of the crippled Roosevelt after he  had hoisted himself up by a crossbar installed in the back seat of his campaign  car.  </P> <P> "Roosevelt knew the value photography had in perpetuating the (presidential)  myth," Tames said. "Every appearance was contrived to give the illusion that he  could walk."  </P> <P> Such a ruse held for Kennedy, too, Tames said, noting there were rarely  pictures of the young President grimacing from back pain. Kennedy's clever  press aides gave exclusives to magazine photographers to spend a day with the  President. They produced cozy portraits -- the image of a demigod and his young  family.  </P> <P> "The White House used us all by giving us breaks," recalled Cornell Capra,  director of the International Center of Photography. "They created a great  amount of excitement, and some of us were dazzled from our ringside seat."  GERALDINE BAUM  </P></p>

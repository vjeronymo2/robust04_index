			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian oil demand threatens to exceed production by 1993 RUSSIA'S OIL industry faces critical problems in supply and distribution - while the opening of new fields has slowed down to the extent that future production in 1993 or 1994 now threatens to run below the domestic needs of the former Soviet Union. At the same time, the determination of the government to keep prices to the consumers low through subsidies has stimulated hoarding by the producers in the expectation of rises, and extensive shortages, especially to motorists. Oil workers, many of whom have not received pay for a month or more, still threaten strikes. Total Russian production - which is 92 per cent of former Soviet output - was at 202m tonnes down just over 13 per cent in the first six months of this year compared to the same period in 1991, according to the news agency Interfax. Mr Lev Churilov, chairman of Rosneftegaz - which groups most of the large oil enterprises in Russia - said in a recent speech to the board of his corporation that drilling of new wells had fallen sharply, with 10.2m metres drilled instead of a planned 13m metres in the first half of 1992. He said that if the trend were not turned round, average daily oil production would fall by 10,000 tonnes a day. At the same time, only two new fields out of 19 planned for 1992 have so far come on stream - both were planned for 1991. Extraction yields have also continued to worsen, with the number of non-producing wells increasing in the first five months of this year by 3,761 to a total of 27,252 - 18.7 per cent of the total number of Russian wells. In the main oil producing region of Tyumen, 27.6 per cent of the wells are idle. The oil sector, like the rest of Russian industry, is deep in debt - with most of the large producing combines reporting debts of over Rbs300m, and the corporations which control the pipelines reporting debts of over Rbs3.5bn. Western companies have the capital and technology which the Russian corporations lack - but agreements are few, the uncertainties on the part of the Western companies are many and there is heavy resistance among the Russian managers to sharing output with foreigners. Mr David Roche, head of Morgan Stanley International, says that 'the involvement of Western companies is growing rapidly, but their participation is unlikely to affect total production for some time to come'.</p>

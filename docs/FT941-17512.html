			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / The Business Traveller: BA long-haul smoking ban - Travel Update Smokers travelling on British Airways' longest-haul flights now face up to 24 hours without a cigarette. The airline is introducing a smoking ban for a trial period on flights to and from Australia and New Zealand and says it will become permanent if passengers are happy with it. It will apply to all BA services operating to Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Auckland, via both Singapore and Bangkok. The airline's domestic UK flights and European flights of less than 90 minutes are already non-smoking.</p>

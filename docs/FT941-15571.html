			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Generator re-ignites row over coal policy National Power, the electricity generator, yesterday re-ignited the controversy over coal policy. It said the cost of producing power from combined-cycle gas stations was nearly 30 per cent higher per unit than from coal-fired plants which they are replacing. The company's breakdown of costs, which it had kept confidential until yesterday, will provide ammunition for the coal lobby as it prepares to fight a new round of expected pit closures. Coal industry supporters have argued that distortions in the market rather than the economics of producing power from different sources are responsible for the contraction of the coal industry and the so-called dash for gas. Separately, the government's pollution inspectorate indicated that it expected PowerGen, the other large generator in England and Wales, to proceed with fitting 2,000MW of flue-gas desulphurisation equipment in addition to the 2,000MW it is already building. In its flotation document three years ago PowerGen indicated plans for building 4,000MW of FGD equipment. The coal lobby regards this as a commitment but PowerGen has held back from ordering the second 2,000MW. The inspectorate said it looked forward to the 'satisfactory completion' of 8,000MW in the generators' gas desulphurisation programme. This implies an expectation that PowerGen would complete 4,000MW. The inspectorate's statement came as National Power marked the opening of the first phase of its 4,000MW FGD project at its Drax station in North Yorkshire. Mr Roger Witcomb, National Power's UK director of business planning, said the cost of electricity from combined-cycle gas turbines running flat out was about 2.7p per kilowatt hour, compared with 2.1p from older plants they are replacing. The 0.6p difference was the same as the cost of fitting and running FGDs at Drax. The coal lobby will see the figures as strengthening their argument that the UK should invest more in FGDs rather than retire coal-generation plants early. Drax Survey, Pages 11-15</p>

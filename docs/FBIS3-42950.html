			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marat Salimov and Konstantin Smirnov: "The </F> Ministry Has Prepared a Trade Code"]    [Text] The former union republics are still Russia's  main partners in trade and in cooperative production, but the  mechanisms and instruments for the regulation of economic  relations between the CIS countries are still not securing their  completely effective development. According to the heads of  Minsotrudnichestvo [Ministry of Economic Cooperation with  Commonwealth States], the improvement of the laws and treaties  serving as the basis of interstate trade and financial relations  will be fostered by "The Rules of Trade Operations with  Commonwealth States and the Baltic Countries," a report which  was prepared by the ministry and was sent to embassies in the  CIS states yesterday. It defines the present conditions and  procedures of trade and settlements within the CIS  framework.    The report the specialists from the Russian  Minsotrudnichestvo prepared at the beginning of 1994 is an  analytical resource document and is intended fueaprimarily to  notify businessmen in the CIS countries of the procedure for  carrying out trade operations and mutual settlements. In  addition, the report provides a complete description of the  present mechanism for the regulation of foreign trade,  cooperative, and financial relations in the CIS and the Baltic  countries. Throughout 1993 the Russian Minsotrudnichestvo  repeatedly had to carry out the functions of the Commonwealth's  interstate economic agencies and took on virtually all of the  responsibility for drafting multilateral agreements. The report  not only sums up the results of the efforts of government  agencies in the CIS countries to establish the necessary  conditions for the development of integration, but also points  out ways of improving the laws and treaties lying at the basis  of these processes in 1994.    The report consists of 10 main sections, which cover all of  the main areas and objectives of economic relations between the  CIS countries. The most highly developed mechanism is the one  regulating trade between Russia and the Commonwealth countries.  In 1994, however, it will undergo some adjustments. The changes  are intended mainly to establish stricter control over exports  of Russian goods to CIS countries for the purpose of preventing  their re-export. Besides this, there will be stricter control  over Russian imports of goods from the former republics of the  USSR. The purpose of these changes is stringent control over the  origin of imported goods. It is no secret that some goods from  Western Europe and the United States are now being brought into  Russia through the CIS countries, which can allow for the  avoidance of customs duties in the absence of strict controls  over the country of origin.    The terms of foreign trade operations with the CIS countries  will become more inflexible in some respects (by means of  stricter control), but the changes will also result in their  comparative liberalization. The list of goods requiring quotas  and licenses for shipment from Russia to the Commonwealth  countries will be reduced to 14 categories in 1994.    In contrast to the present procedure, all settlements  between  Russia and the Commonwealth countries will be made through the  payment and credit center of the Russian Central Bank and  through commercial banks. Funds transferred to the payee,  however, will have to come from a correspondent account in a  bank in the paying country. With this mechanism, which does not  envisage mutual currency conversion, mutual settlements between  enterprises in the CIS countries will be much more complicated  and will take longer. The report says that some positive changes  in this area could result from the establishment of the  Interstate Bank, which should begin conducting settlement  operations in a multilateral clearing network in the second half  of 1994. If this bank is entrusted with the necessary powers, it  could serve as an instrument to control the circulation of money  and securities throughout the CIS. The Interstate Bank's ability  to perform its functions will depend, however, on the creation  of a CIS payment union, based on a single mechanism for  coordinated national currency exchange rate quotations.    [Box]  <H3>  Forms of Settlement and Terms of Payment Between Russia and  CIS Countries </H3>   All settlements will be made through the settlement and  credit center of the Russian Central Bank and through commercial  banks.    Transfers of payments will be limited to the funds available  in a correspondent account in a bank in the paying country.    Settlements will be made in accordance with international  and  banking practice (payment authorizations, payment demands, and  letters of credit).    [Box]  <H5>  Terms of Russia's Trade with CIS Countries </H5>   Shipments of goods from CIS countries to Russia will be  exempt from import duties, value-added tax, and excise tax.    Russian exports of goods originating in CIS countries will  also be exempt from all types of taxes and duties, with the  exception of a few types of commodities (mainly strategic raw  materials).    Russia's trade with CIS countries on a mutual noncash  settlement basis in 1994 will be regulated by bilateral  intergovernmental agreements.    Quotas and licenses for Russian exports to Commonwealth  countries will apply to only 14 of the most vital crude  resources and materials in 1994.    Starting on 1 January 1994 the exporter of Russian goods  shipped to CIS countries will be obligated to submit a  "transaction passport" to customs agencies for the export of  critical raw materials, and starting on 1 March this passport  will be required for all goods exported from the territory of  the Russian customs zone.</p>

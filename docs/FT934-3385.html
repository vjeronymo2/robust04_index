			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Talks on Ulster inch forward The British and Irish governments yesterday voiced growing confidence that they would agree before Christmas a joint declaration designed to persuade the IRA to give up its campaign of violence. But on the eve of the second meeting within a week between Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, officials conceded that Dublin's demand for a new all-Ireland convention was a crucial stumbling block. In London officials said they were confident that the proposed declaration - likely to be finalised at a third meeting between the two leaders next week  -would include firm guarantees for the unionist majority in Northern Ireland. Those guarantees would centre on Dublin's recognition that any change in the province's status could be achieved only by consent and a commitment to drop its constitutional claim to the north. It is understood that Britain has agreed to recognise the legitimacy and validity of the nationalist aspiration of Irish unity and to repeat publicly the offer to Sinn Fein of a place in negotiations if they end violence. Mr Major may also reaffirm that he has no strategic interest in maintaining Northern Ireland as part of the union, and signal a willingness to accept separate referenda in the north and south on any political settlement. But the British side has rejected as unacceptable to unionists the establishment of an all-Ireland convention. Yesterday Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, defined the key issues for a total cessation of violence as 'sovereignty, self-determination for the people of Ireland, and the role of the British government in assisting in a process of national reconciliation'.</p>

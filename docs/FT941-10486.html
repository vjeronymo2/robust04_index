			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Granada lifts hostile bid for LWT City sentiment appeared to be moving in favour of Granada Group last night as the rental, television and leisure group increased its offer for London Weekend Television to around Pounds 776m, or 750p a share. Granada's final offer in the hostile takeover battle came after talks between the two sides broke down. The new offer of 13 new Granada shares and 100p cash for every 10 LWT shares represents a near 10 per cent improvement over the original six-for-five paper bid. The cash alternative has been increased from 528p to 686p. Granada shares closed 2p down at 569p yesterday, while LWT rose 35p to 737p. Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada's chief executive, said he would have liked to get agreement but the two sides had been 'miles apart' on price, with LWT talking about 860p a share. He said the increase 'recognises that people have high expectations in this sector'. The offer would not dilute earnings in the first full year, he added. Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT, said the revised offer was still inadequate. He emphasised that LWT's published estimate of 1993 earnings per share at 28.4p was 25.7 per cent higher than the figure Granada used for its original offer. 'And yet the number of Granada shares on offer has gone up by only 8.3 per cent. LWT shareholders will also suffer an 18.7 per cent decrease in dividend income if they accept. What sort of increase is this?' he asked. The view among City analysts last night was that the Granada offer was likely to be accepted. Ms Katherine Pelly, media analyst at Kleinwort Benson, who last month advocated that the Granada offer be rejected, said of the improved bid: 'It's only just there. It's hardly generous and it's still hostile.' Privately senior LWT executives admitted yesterday the outcome would be close but they expressed confidence that they would retain the support of their main institutional shareholders. The Granada offer, which represents 26.4 times LWT's estimated 1993 pre-tax earnings of Pounds 43.8m, closes at 3pm on Friday February 25. If LWT retains its independence it might look again at Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, a company in which it already has a 20 per cent stake. The problem of Yorkshire's two broadcasting licences - when LWT would only be allowed to add one - would still have to be sorted out. Lex, Page 22</p>

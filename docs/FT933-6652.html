			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: James Wilkes back in black with Pounds 1m JAMES WILKES, the specialist engineer, returned to profits in the first half of the year reflecting its cost-cutting programme and a strong performance by the Floform and Peter Stubs subsidiaries. On turnover down to Pounds 20.8m (Pounds 28.5m restated for FRS 3 including Pounds 7.2m for discontinued operations) and after interest charges reduced from Pounds 1.89m to Pounds 826,000, pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 1.12m against losses last time of Pounds 5.67m. Exceptional charges were just Pounds 73,000, compared with an FRS 3 figure of Pounds 6.74m. Mr Douglas Rogers, chairman, said the reduction of borrowings remained a key objective and gearing should be cut from the period end level of 92 per cent in the second half. Floform, which manufactures components for the automotive and aerospace industries, and Peter Stubs, the high speed steel wire and silver steel maker, performed particularly well in the US, drawing benefit from the weakness of sterling. Trading at other group businesses, however, remained patchy. Earnings per share were 4p against restated losses of 31.2p. To conserve cash, the interim dividend is cut from 3.25p to 1.5p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 1 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican President  Rafael Angel Calderon today emphasized his country's high  economic growth rate, low inflation rate, and reduced poverty  and described the Free Trade Agreement [TLC] with Mexico as one  of the greatest achievements of his foreign policy.    In a report to the country entitled "Roads of Prosperity"  read during a solemn session of the Legislative Assembly, the  president said: "Our economic strategy allowed us to defeat  inflation and the high cost of living."    To illustrate the apparent success of his administration,  Calderon cited figures such as an increase in GNP from 6.5  percent in 1992 to 7.7 percent in 1993 following a severe  adjustment at the beginning of his government.    Calderon, who will turn over the presidency to Jose Maria  Figueres of the Social Democratic Party next Sunday, said in  this, his last report to the nation, that during his four-year  term exports increased by 60 percent and reached $2.667 billion  last year. He also said that the fiscal deficit, which stood at  7.5 percent when he took office, was reduced to less than 1  percent last year and inflation was reduced to 9 percent, the  lowest in the past 15 years.    Calderon said that, contrary to what several sectors say  about the country's alleged impoverishment, unemployment was  reduced to 4 percent -- one of the lowest unemployment rates on  the continent -- and poverty to less than 17 percent, three  points less than when he assumed office. He also emphasized  the growth of tourism, which is expected to become the primary  source of foreign exchange this year, and housing programs,  which led to the construction of 96,000 homes in four years.  "The economic reform sponsored by this administration made it  possible to release resources that were used in social programs.  Thanks to this, Costa Rica remains an example of social and  human development in Latin America," he said.    Regarding criticism for an alleged disregard of foreign  policy, Calderon stressed "an active diplomacy" in favor of  democracy and respect for human rights. In this connection, he  recalled Costa Rica's participation in the crises in Haiti,  Peru, and Guatemala. "Throughout these years, we contributed to  the reaffirmation of processes for peace, democratization, and  integration in Central America," he said, adding that the  signing of the TLC between Costa Rica and Mexico is one of his  administration's greatest achievements in the international  field.    This commercial treaty, which will go into effect in January  after it is ratified by the legislatures of the two countries,  will permit the trade of 12,000 products. Costa Rica will be  able to triple its exports to Mexico in the next two years.  Such exports now reach barely $60 million, according to  government and private enterprise calculations.    "Whatsoever a man soweth he shall also reap. Costa Rica has  sown and is now reaping," the president said. Calderon will  become part of the opposition on 8 May with one of the highest  popularity levels a president has ever attained at the time of  his departure from office.    During the early months of his government, Calderon  implemented a severe economic adjustment program that led to  higher public services rates, higher staple prices, a higher  inflation rate, and low economic growth, a little over 2  percent, in 1990. In this last report, however, he said: "We  are enjoying the first fruits of a time of prosperity. We  turned obstacles into solutions, obstructions into channels, and  setbacks into victories. But we are just at the beginning of  the road."</p>

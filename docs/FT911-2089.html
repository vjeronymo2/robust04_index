			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: De Havilland bid awaiting approval THE JOINT Franco-Italian bid for de Havilland, the Canadian aircraft maker owned by Boeing of the US, should be allowed to go ahead, despite strong local political and union opposition to the deal, said Mr Fausto Cereti, chairman of the Italian aerospace group Alenia. He was speaking at the first shareholders' meeting of Alenia, the company created by the merger in December of Aeritalia and Selenia, the Italian state-owned aircraft and defence electronics companies. Mr Cereti confirmed that Canadian government approval for the de Havilland acquisition was still some way off. Negotiations between Alenia and Aerospatiale, its French partner, and Investment Canada, the Canadian federal body responsible for vetting foreign investment projects, were 'in a preliminary phase', he said. Presenting Alenia's first post-merger figures, Mr Cereti announced a sharp cut in the dividend to L90 a share from the L130 paid by Aeritalia in its last full year as an independent company in 1989. Selenia was not previously quoted. Mr Cereti blamed the decline on new uncertainties in Italian and international defence spending following the collapse of the eastern bloc. Changes in Italian defence policy have already damaged Alenia's cash-flow. Working capital and net borrowing rose sharply last year after the government's decision to pay a much lower proportion of the value of its defence contracts in advance. Overall group sales amounted to L4,900bn (Dollars 3.8bn), while net profits were L101bn.</p>

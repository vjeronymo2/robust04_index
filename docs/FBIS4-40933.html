			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Russian Union of Industrialists and </F> Entrepreneurs: "Who Will Be Next?"]    [Text] Acts of armed violence against Russian  industrialists and entrepreneurs are continuing in Moscow and  other Russian cities. In terms of its scale, cynicism, and  impunity the terror imposed on society by criminal groupings is  gradually turning from a strictly criminal factor into a factor  which poses a real threat to social foundations and citizens'  safety. Committing murders, explosions, acts of arson, and  other crimes and remaining, for the most part, invulnerable to  criminal prosecution, criminal elements are destroying the  people's moral health and giving rise to fear and lack of faith  in the authorities' ability to ensure citizens' safety.    Literally every day augments the tragic list of people who  have died at the hands of hired killers and bandits. Boris  Berezovskiy, general director of the "All-Russia Automobile  Alliance," might have become their latest victim. An attempt  was made on his life in downtown Moscow 7 June. Fate proved  charitable to him, but his companion died, and several people  who happened to be at the scene of the explosion received  injuries and mutilations of varying gravity. Who will be  next?...    It must be clearly understood that the situation is already  getting out of control and, thus, requires extraordinary  measures to be taken. Otherwise the criminal degradation of the  state will occur. What is needed is not so much good intentions  as vigorous, uncompromising action to eradicate the criminal  free-for-all.    For their part Russia's industrialists and entrepreneurs are  prepared to support any resolute steps by the president, the  Federal Assembly, and the government to instill law and order  and to ensure guarantees of Russians' personal safety.    The Association of Russian Banks has issued a similar  statement.    [Signed] The Board of the Russian Union of Industrialists  and Entrepreneurs.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Karim 'Abd-al-Rahim: "Two Crimes With One </F> Aim;" from the "With the Events" column]    [Text] The Lebanese Sayyidat al-Najat Church was the target  of a horrible crime last Sunday, just 48 hours after the hideous  crime which Israeli settlers had committed in the Ibrahimi  Mosque in occupied Palestine with the cooperation of the  occupation army.    What is clear from both crimes is: First, Israel is  launching an unprecedented war of annihilation against the  Lebanese and the Palestinians aimed at sabotaging Lebanese  national unity and preventing the reconstruction of Lebanon on  the one hand, and directing a crushing blow to the peace efforts  by attacking Muslim and Christian worshippers and spreading an  atmosphere of religious hostility in the service of the  opportunist Jewish interests on the other.    Second, the crimes in Hebron and Beirut followed Israeli  threats, which were also directed by the Zionist murder organ  headed by Yitzhaq Rabin. These threats were strongly directed  at Lebanon, and the world had expected a large-scale Zionist  aggression against southern Lebanon. But Zionist militarism has  struck at an unexpected place -- the Sayyidat al-Najat Church --  with a very clear aim, which is to cover up its crime in the  Ibrahimi Mosque and to create an atmosphere of chaos in Lebanon  in order to undermine the stability and security which that  country is enjoying in the era of legitimacy and the al-Ta'if  Agreement.    On the other hand, now that secret and open talks with the  PLO have led to the Cairo agreement, which was rejected by  Palestinian popular forces and organizations, and the intifadah  has intensified in a serious, qualitative manner threatening to  end the series of concessions which are being made to Israel,  Israel has resorted as usual to a strike, which even the Nazis  would have been ashamed of, at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in order  to intimidate the Palestinians and stop their intifadah, just as  it did in Dayr Yasin during the establishment of the Zionist  entity, believing that it could achieve now what it achieved  then. Israel tried to cover up its crime by placing the  responsibility on other extremist forces. But, it seems to have  forgotten that the whole world knows that arming and training  settlers is done by the Israeli security organs and so the  Israeli war ministry cannot be entirely absolved from  encouraging the crime the murder plans.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] During a speech at a meeting this morning with  judiciary officials and judges from all over the country, His  Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the great leader of the Islamic  revolution, stressed the importance of discipline and stability  in the judiciary. [passage omitted]    Criticizing those organizations that advocate human rights,  His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i said: Those who burned alive  dozens of people last year and followed an overt racist policy  in their countries do not have the right to utter the words  human rights from their filthy mouths and expect the observance  of human rights from others.    The leader of the Islamic revolution admonished the world  forums and committees that advocate human rights for their  silence regarding one of the greatest terrorist tragedies. He  said: Those so-called human rights committees and forums, which  have brought politics into everything, have turned a blind eye  to that great terrorist tragedy at the shrine of Imam  Reza--peace be upon him--and have not said a word about it.  Those who are constantly saying that the greatest threat to the  world today is terrorism have kept silent about the 'Ashura  tragedy in Mashhad. Therefore, what right do they have to  meddle in matters relating to the observance of human rights in  other countries. [passage omitted]</p>

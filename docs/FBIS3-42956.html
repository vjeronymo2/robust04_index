			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Olga Pronina: "Why Are Crimean Tatars Alarmed?"] </F>   [Text] We are aware of how complicated relations have  become between the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people and the  present Supreme Council of Crimea. All the same, reasonable  forces on both sides have come to prevail. Sharp confrontation  has been replaced by a mutual striving to reach compromise.  Already this approach has succeeded in achieving the first  positive results. Therefore, the statement of Yu. Meshkov made  before numerous journalists, foreign journalists among them, to  the effect that he will do business with the Majlis only in the  event of "its legalization and registration as a sociopolitical  organization" has evoked entirely understandable alarm, and not  only among the Crimean Tatars.    Here is how Majlis leaders Mustafa Jemilev and Refat  Chubarov  have responded to these statements.    Mustafa Jemilev--We have already declared in an  adopted resolution that the Majlis does not recognize the  presidential authority of a person whose policies are directed  towards denial of the fundamental rights of the Crimean Tatar  people with respect to self-determination. Judging from his  program declarations and statements before journalists, Yu.  Meshkov, just now elected president, does not intend to observe  our sovereign rights. Crimean Tatars therefore do not  acknowledge him as the president.    This in no way means, however, that we will oppose all his  directives and measures. On the contrary. If the actions of the  president are directed towards restoration of the rights of a  deported people, we will only welcome this and support it.    The Majlis will convene 19 February. Over this period of  time, new events will obviously take place which will more  precisely define Yu. Meshkov's position. We will then adopt a  special declaration on the matter of the presidency and on the  president personally.    Refat Chubarov--Yu. Meshkov knows full well that  the Kurultay [Congress] and Majlis elected by it have never  claimed any kind of special status in the Crimea. The Kurultay  is the highest spokesman of the will and interests of the  Crimean Tatar people, and the Majlis is its highest  representational organ. We have never had, and do not now have  any aspirations of considering ourselves a parallel structure of  authority, as Yu. Meshkov has stated. During his tenure as  Supreme Council deputy he had the opportunity to examine all of  this. The fact that he is making such statements all the same is  astonishing to us.</p>

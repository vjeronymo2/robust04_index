			<p>BFN     [Text] Corfu, June 25 (AFP) -- European Union [EU] leaders  on Saturday [25 June] failed to reach agreement on a new EU  Commission president and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl proposed  an emergency summit to decide the matter next month, EU sources  said.    The sources said Kohl had proposed a new summit on July 15.    Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino said nomination of  the sole remaining candidate in the race, Belgian Prime Minister  Jean-Luc Dehaene, had been blocked by Britain.    He was speaking on the second day of a two-day EU summit  which was dominated by a quarrel over a replacement for  Commission President Jacques Delors, who retires on January 5 as  the EU's top civil servant.    Earlier Saturday, the two other official candidates, Dutch  Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers and the EU's British trade  commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, withdrew their names from the  race.    Martino told journalists that Major was blocking Dehaene's  nomination on the grounds that it had not been properly handled.  Expressing support for the British position, he said: "Someone  should remind us of important principles."    All 12 EU leaders must be in agreement for a candidacy to go  forward to the European Parliament for its approval.</p>

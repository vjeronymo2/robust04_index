			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / What price a corporate halo: The spread of business ethics Nearly 150 academics and executives have gathered in Norway this week to discuss developments in a subject which, in spite of the recession, is growing fast: business ethics. As a discipline, ethics has taken root in universities and business schools across the US, the UK and elsewhere. This month, Jack Mahoney, a Jesuit priest, takes up his post as professor of business ethics and corporate responsibility at the London Business School. Leeds University and Manchester Business School have made similar appointments in the past two years. Other educational centres in the UK, such as the Cranfield Institute of Technology, have followed the lead of US business schools and started courses in business ethics. The subject is not banished to the academic world. Managers and consultants almost match the number of academics at the Norway conference. Prof Mahoney's chair is funded by a Pounds 1m bequest given by Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, the high-street electrical goods retailer, from the group's charitable trust. Almost one-third of large UK companies and four-fifths of their US counterparts now have codes of ethics. Most set guiding principles for the organisation, as well as covering specific areas such as buying policies, safety and environmental responsibilities. For example, National Westminster Bank's code of conduct, published in April, sets out the proper behaviour for its 90,000 staff in cases where interests conflict and on accepting entertainment from outsiders. Mr John Drummond, director of Integrity Works, a London-based ethics consultancy, says one reason for companies to adopt ethics codes is to avoid corporate embarrassments. He says British Airways introduced a code of conduct after the bad publicity created by its 'dirty tricks' campaign against its competitor, Virgin. But he stresses that there are also positive reasons for companies to adopt codes - particularly the perception that good ethics are good business. Based on experience he gained at NatWest, he argues staff actually want to discuss how they should conduct business. 'People want to talk about ethical issues,' he says. Dixons' Mr Kalms explained his interest in business ethics in personal philosophical terms. 'Behind the bluff exterior of the practitioners of the art of business are often citizens with doubts, moral uncertainties, even spiritual black holes,' he said recently. Lord Laing, who as chairman of United Biscuits was one of the first industrialists to introduce a code of ethics into a British company, says: 'On the whole, business has a bad image. Anything we can do to improve it we should.' But the justification Lord Laing offers can only fuel the suspicion that ethics codes are more about marketing a company than altruistic or philosophical considerations. An example of the value of ethics as a marketing tool is the 12-point code launched by the Co-operative Bank last year, which stated that the bank would no longer lend to businesses or organisations involved in activities such as blood sports or environmental destruction. Whatever the bank's wider motives, Mr Terry Thomas, managing director, has spent considerable sums using the code as a way of attracting new business. The value of customer deposits at the bank was 9 per cent higher in the six months to July this year than the corresponding period in 1992. Though the example of the Co-operative Bank reinforces claims that ethics codes help boost earnings, there is a counter argument that they divert attention from what some regard as the principal task of a company - serving the interests of shareholders. Mr Ian Smedley, a member of the Institute of Directors, cites from Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations to argue that profit making should take priority and may be incompatible with the kind of business ethics being advocated by academics: 'It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, brewer or baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest.' Norman Barry, professor of political philosophy at Buckingham University, says: 'A lot of business ethics is posturing.' He sees ethics as a diversion that threatens to turn companies into 'welfare agencies', blunting their competitiveness. In defence of the explicit setting of ethical standards, Prof Mahoney, of the London Business School, admits that 'one might be ethical and end up out of business', but he says the subject cannot be dismissed easily. 'The conduct of business is a major part of human activity, so one would need a good reason to think ethics does not apply.' Mr Stanley Kiaer, of the Institute of Business Ethics in London, says there is a strong element of self-interest to embracing business ethics. 'If you want good treatment from your suppliers, employees and customers, you have got to show that you will do well by them,' he says. 'If you don't have contented employees, sooner or later you will have trouble.' One difficulty critics find in taking business ethics seriously is that its theoretical roots are still rudimentary. While ethics has long been taught in philosophy and theology departments, thinking on its more practical applications is less developed. There is also a more practical problem: the difficulty of evaluating how effective codes of ethics have been in practice. For instance, General Dynamics, the US conglomerate, introduced a code in 1985 which it has distributed to its employees and covers topics such as receiving gifts from outsiders. Between 1985 and 1991 the code and a related staff communication programme generated nearly 30,000 inquiries from staff, provoking 1,419 sanctions such as reprimands and demotions. Some 165 employees have been sacked. But Mr Kent Druyvesteyn, vice-president for business ethics and equal employment opportunities, stresses that any attempt to quantify the economic gains derived from the company's code would be 'so difficult that it would be nonsensical'. He rejects the notion that there is any simple connection between General Dynamics' stance on business ethics and profitability, and he says the code does not attempt to instil basic moral values. 'We're not in the business of replacing missing virtues in our employees, but we owe it to them to tell them about slippery spots inherent in the business process,' he says. 'In a society with a web of rules and regulations, that makes good practical sense.' Detractors of ethics as a subject worth taking seriously in a corporate environment will probably need more convincing, but General Dynamics' pragmatism seems to be shared in a growing number of companies.</p>

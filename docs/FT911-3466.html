			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Venezuela's debt reviewed by Moody's VENEZUELA'S foreign debt has been placed under review for a possible upgrade by Moody's Investor Service, the US rating agency. Venezuela has outstanding debt totalling around Dollars 1bn in the Euromarkets, according to the agency. The debt is denominated in D-Marks and yen, as well as dollars. Moody's said the review was prompted by the Venezuelan government's efforts to reduce macroeconomic imbalances and to liberalise the economy. The government has also restructured its external finances with creditor banks, Moody's noted. The move marks a further step in the increasing acceptability of Latin American borrowers in the Euromarkets. For example, Petroleos de Venezuela, the Venezuelan oil company, raised DM200m last October.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Setting the right tone Funnily enough, I like advertisements. This liking of adverts - peculiar in a journalist - stems from a fondness for advertising itself, and for the men and women, plus those in between, who work in ad agencies. What funsters they are - witty, intelligent and able to conceal, like master magicians, their suspicion, or conviction, that helping to sell dogfood or a twee brand of after-shave is a ridiculous occupation for people of talent. I used to write about the ad business for the FT, and was lucky that my four-year stint (to 1982) coincided with prodigiously gushing ad budgets. Those were the glory days. I lunched and dined with the chairmen of all the brightest agencies, and enjoyed their company greatly. They were all wealthy men; some were quite eccentric. One of them used to pretend to himself that I was a particularly callow youth. I expect it gave him a buzz. He always ordered my food, and once told the waiter to cut up my steak. If I visited him at his agency he would offer me sweet sherry. Once, in a restaurant, he decided the time had come to explain the nature of the relationship between agencies and their clients. 'What you need to know, Michael, is that in all practical respects, an agency is like a knocking-shop. Just look at an agency's clients, especially the out-of-towners - oinks in shiny suits. (I imagine he meant 'oik'; he often muddled words.) All year, these oinks make hair-gel or catfood or something else revolting. 'The only glamour in their lives is when they come to London to visit the agency to see what they are getting for these enormous sums of money that the agency is charging them. So we show them the house-reel and wine them and dine them and pander to their needs, no matter how basic. Then back they go to the provinces, to their grey little lives, to make some more catfood. We whore for them, you see.' Yes, I still enjoy advertisements. I read one the other day. It has given me an idea. It was in The New Yorker, where the ads often out-sparkle the stuff that keeps them apart. It was a house-ad for reader services offered by The New Yorker itself. 'Use our convenient touch-tone phone line,' said the ad, 'to hear special messages about the quality products and services listed below. Call toll-free from any US touch-tone phone.' One of these products was Tilley Endurables: ''The best travel and adventure clothing in the world': classically-styled, long-lasting, comfortable clothes with secret pockets . . . And, of course, the Tilley Hat. The 68-page catalogue is a hoot] For your free copy, please call: 30238.' Other products and services on offer included a sweepstake offering a trip for two to 'fascinating Malaysia and surprising Singapore'; holiday news from Remy Martin; and Loro Piana Italian fabrics. This touch-tone business is clearly intended to help foster closer ties between advertisers and their customers. Perhaps it is an old idea; if so, I haven't noticed it. But I am attracted by its niftiness. As a result, I am setting up a touch-tone phone operation of my own. Examples of services that I plan to test-market: The John Major Pre-Retirement Programme: 'Hello. This is John Major. Like me, perhaps you are anticipating sudden retirement in the not too distant future. If so, you will be cheered to know that there are numerous activities to which the retired person can devote his or her energies. I myself plan to take up train-spotting - if I can find any trains] - and possibly home baking, just to surprise Norma. I have produced a bumper leaflet which explains the full range of activities available to us once we leave the world of work. If you would like one, please speak after the tone . . .' Norman Fowler's Practical Guide to Modern-Day Morality: 'Hello. People often ask me how we in the Conservative Party can call, with a straight face, for a return to family values when many of our members, some in government, have mistresses all over the place, and other peccadilloes. I myself believe it important not to pre-judge the issue. To keep an open mind. Yet face things squarely. Not run and hide. If you would like to hear more, please speak after the tone . . .' Probably I'll make a fortune.</p>

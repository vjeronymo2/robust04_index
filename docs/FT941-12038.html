			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Rustenburg Platinum advances in half-year Rustenburg Platinum (Rusplat), the world's largest producer of platinum group metals, reported a 9.5 per cent advance in pre-tax profit to R184.7m (USDollars 54m) in the half-year to December 31 against R168.7m a year ago. The flagship of the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment group's platinum division staved off sluggish metal prices by increasing platinum output by more than 3 per cent and cutting costs, with some help from the rand's loss in value against the US dollar. However, the interim dividend is held at 62.5 cents a share. Mr Barry Davison, managing director, said the improvement in the period was off a low base and Rusplat would no more than match 1992-1993 distributable profit of R281.4m in the current year. Mr Davison said the small recovery in interim platinum and palladium prices to Dollars 379 and Dollars 129 an ounce from an average of Dollars 365 and Dollars 103 in 1992-1993 contrasted with the slide in rhodium and nickel prices. In the same periods, they averaged Dollars 929 an ounce and Dollars 2.19 a pound, against Dollars 1,807 and Dollars 2.84 respectively. He said the balance of supply and demand in the platinum market would not justify any significant improvement in prices in 1994 without solid economic recovery in Europe and Japan where demand for platinum-based catalytic converters was affected by falling car sales. Interim net sales improved to R1.37bn from R1.34bn with cost of sales higher at R1.07bn compared with R1.05bn. A rise in total on-mine costs as output rose was mostly offset by lower refining costs associated with an increase in material being toll-refined on behalf of Rusplat's sister platinum mining companies. Distributable profit stood at R133m against R110.1m after a gain in operating profit to R314.6m from R310.8m. Lebowa Platinum turned in pre-tax profit of R1.7m against a R9.4m loss.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Nigeria prepares medium-term plan NIGERIA'S military-led government hopes to finalise a medium-term economic programme with international organisations to enable it to enter talks with its creditors for debt reduction, Reuter reports from Abuja. Mr Ernest Shonekan, head of Nigeria's new Transitional Council running day-to-day government affairs, said yesterday in a budget address that Nigeria needs to finalise the programme so it can press its creditors for debt relief in 1993. He said the medium-term strategy would complement policies under an existing Structural Adjustment Programme. The SAP, including financial deregulation, was started in 1986 to mend an economy crippled by low productivity, mismanagement and lower world prices for its main export, oil. Though Mr Shonekan did not name the international bodies helping Nigeria shape its new strategy, they are likely to include the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Mr Shonekan said the three-year strategy aimed to resolve a range of macro-economic issues such as inflation, budget deficit and the debt burden between now and 1995. It aims to achieve an average 5.3 per cent real annual growth of GDP, from probably less than 4.5 per cent now. The programme will seek to push inflation down to 5 per cent from 46 per cent at the end of 1992. It is also geared towards reducing fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP from 12.4 per cent in 1991 to 3.3 per cent in 1995, Mr Shonekan said. Nigeria hopes the new programme, details of which were not made public, will help it maintain a stable foreign exchange rate and achieve a viable external balance. Mr Shonekan said Nigeria's total foreign debt stock fell to Dollars 27.56bn (Pounds 18.1bn) at the end of 1992 from Dollars 33.36bn a year earlier. The improvement was due largely to debt restructuring deals with commercial banks, which included a debt buy-back totalling Dollars 3.38bn, he said. Despite the drop in the debt stock, Nigeria is still hard- pressed to meet debt-servicing obligations. Mr Shonekan said it would need to spend Dollars 4.6bn naira to meet these in 1993.</p>

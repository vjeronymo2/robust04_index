			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: High cost of a lump sum - Company's policy demand would have cost Gary Mead Pounds 11,000 I have a small lump on the skin of my right calf muscle. It has been there more than a decade and has never caused me the slightest trouble. It has always been the same size and has been inspected and diagnosed as benign by at least four general practitioners. As lumps go, it is strictly in the minor league - so why should it cost me an additional Pounds 10,740 premium on a critical illness endowment policy, taken out to cover a mortgage on a new house? It is a question for which I still do not have a good answer. Perhaps most alarming, my experience reveals the arbitrary nature of underwriting and the lack of an agreed set of standards for insurers to operate by. In October 1993, we decided to buy a house using an endowment mortgage. Our financial adviser proposed using Scottish Amicable - on the basis of reputation, not price; in that regard, there was little to choose between several of the major companies - and, on November 4, we applied for one of its 'critical protection' policies. This pays off the loan if the borrower gets any of several potentially terminal illnesses. By late January, we had everything in place for an exchange of contracts - but there was still no word from the company. We were holding up a sizeable chain and were worried the house might be lost. So, I rang to discover the reason for the hold-up. Initially, the company blamed my former GP for failing to respond quickly to its medical questions about me. But then I found out that while my wife had been cleared for the critical protection option, I had not. Why? Because of medical privacy regulations, Scottish Amicable could not tell me. It said it would report to my GP. In the end, I learnt - from a Scottish Amicable manager - that the hold-up was related to the small growth on my right leg. I told the company I was happy to be examined by its chief medical officer, or to have the cyst removed if need be. The company told me to go back to my GP and be re-examined. Once again, he pronounced the cyst benign. I imagined our problems were over. Silly me. By now, our financial adviser had suggested applying for policies - including critical cover - to two other companies. I did so - and was then staggered to be told that Scottish Amicable would grant me critical cover, but only if I paid an additional monthly premium amounting to Pounds 10,740 over the 25 years of the policy. It had taken Scottish Amicable almost three months to arrive at this decision. Yet, within two days of receiving our application, Legal &amp; General had approved it - with no extra premium. How to explain such vastly different attitudes from superficially similar insurance companies with the same information? I can assume only that, at some level in Scottish Amicable, there is an assumption that people desperate to exchange contracts on homes will cave in easily. If so, it is not a very amicable policy at all.</p>

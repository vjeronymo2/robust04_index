			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank restructures DAI-ICHI KANGYO Bank, Japan's largest commercial bank, yesterday began a restructuring intended to show that the banking industry is worthy of the public support on offer from the Japanese government. The bank will cut directors' salaries by 5 per cent, reduce entertainment expenses by 20 per cent over the next year, and send a 66-point cost-saving checklist to each of its 400 domestic branches and 69 overseas offices. DKB insisted that the restructuring be viewed as 'positive' and not as a sign that the bank is in financial difficulty. The action is likely to be followed by other banks, whose troubles with non-performing property loans had undermined confidence in the financial system. But DKB's cuts do not go deep and may not increase community approval for plans announced by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, to provide public funds to liquidate banks' non-performing loans. The proposal has been condemned by Japanese newspaper commentators and some opposition politicians, who argue that the banks should trade their way out of trouble. Japanese banks' problems stem from the turmoil in financial and property markets, and from their own rapid expansion of branches and loans during the late 1980s. At DKB, for example, there were 26 business divisions a decade ago, compared with 46 divisions now. However, the bank will not lay off staff, although it plans to reduce the annual intake from 500 to 400 students next April. It will 'review' the performance of its branches, while not necessarily closing the unprofitable. DKB's reluctance to sack reflects both the Japanese custom of lifetime employment and the enduring belief that institutions will weather these difficult times without having to take dramatic action.</p>

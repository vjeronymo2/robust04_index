			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Caribbean alarm at plutonium shipments SEVERAL governments and environmental protection groups in the Caribbean are combining to protest against what they say is the planned use of the Caribbean Basin for shipments of plutonium from France to Japan over the next eight years. The first shipment, on the 3,800-tonne Japanese vessel, the 'Akatsuki Maru', will pass through the Caribbean 'in a few weeks', according to environmentalists. This will be followed by 38 more shipments from Cherbourg, France, to Japan, where the plutonium is to be used in fast breeder nuclear reactors. The ship has already been banned from the territorial waters of several countries, and the cargo has raised the concern of governments along likely alternative routes, including Malaysia, South Africa and Argentina. Greenpeace, the environmental group, says the 'Akatsuki Maru' will be attempting to travel in secret on a route which will take it through the Caribbean Sea. Government sources in the Caribbean say the ship will be accompanied by armed vessels. 'Sea transport of plutonium raises a number of serious problems,' said the Caribbean Conservation Association, a regional environmental protection lobby. 'Ships are particularly susceptible to on-board fires or collisions, and as the shipments will pass through the open sea as well as coastal waters, a release of plutonium could affect both the marine and terrestrial environment.' Jamaica's environment ministry said the island's government would oppose the plutonium shipment through the Caribbean. 'Jamaica's position is to keep the Caribbean free of the transport of such hazards,' according to a ministry official. There was no indication, however, as to what form the government's opposition to the shipment would take. The growing opposition to the planned shipments of plutonium is based also on fears of an adverse economic impact on the region. Many island economies are heavily dependent on tourism and hoteliers say prospective tourists might be reluctant to visit the region because of concerns over the presence of the plutonium.</p>

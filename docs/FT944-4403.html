			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Management plans Ferranti Technologies rescue with Pounds 3m bid Ferranti Technologies, which makes fuses, gyroscopes and artificial horizons for the UK and US defence industries, is expected to be rescued from receivership this week by a management buy-out. The components company, which was affected by the fraud that wrecked most of the Ferranti group, has been in receivership since December last year. It operates from the old Cairo mill in Oldham, Greater Manchester, employing 308, after shedding nearly 500 jobs to survive. The buy-out has been organised by the Manchester office of Murray Johnstone, the Glasgow-based finance house, and led by Mr Trevor Tuckley, headhunted this summer by Arthur Andersen, the receiver, to restructure the Ferranti business. The price is believed to be about Pounds 3m, of which Pounds 1m is being deferred for two years. Murray Johnstone is providing Pounds 1m of equity and the Royal Bank of Scotland a Pounds 1m term loan and a Pounds 2.8m overdraft for working capital. Mr Gary Tipper of Murray Johnstone said yesterday that Ferranti Technologies had been able to continue because of support from customers and creditors, led by GEC, the UK Ministry of Defence, the US Department of Defense, and British Aerospace. It has a Pounds 17m order book, mainly fuses for mines and warheads, gyroscopes for aircraft and missiles, cockpit equipment and computerised military electronic systems. This business is expected to continue for several years but Mr Tuckley and Mr Peter Davies, operations director, and Mr David Platt, commercial director, hope to develop some civil applications. These include sensing devices that would automatically brake a car too close to the vehicle in front, or engage safety brakes on trains if something is detected on the line. The company already does similar work for the London Underground.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Observer: Fun palace? The 'To let' signs came down last week from Rose Court, the Southwark office block built on top of the remains of the Rose Theatre, neighbour of Shakespeare's Globe. It was not, alas, because the building had found a tenant. Rather it was because a TV crew had moved into its top floor to film 'The Golden Hello', a tale about an ambitious, ruthless headhunter to be screened by the BBC next spring. Ironically, it stars James Fox, one of those who stood arm-in-arm with Dame Peggy Ashcroft and Ian McKellen three years ago to prevent bulldozers destroying the theatre's remains. This is not the first time that the empty building has been put to artistic uses. The developers' campaign to market it has included staging art and drama there, including a performance by an estate agent in sixteenth century costume of Shakespeare's words set to music. Surely, with such cultural credentials the office block should have a special appeal for the new heritage ministry? Despite a request by the local MP Simon Hughes for the ministry to consider the building, the Ministry of Fun has not yet even looked at it.</p>

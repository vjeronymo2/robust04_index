			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / 'Archaic' rules on disclosure attacked COMPANIES are required to make too many disclosures in their accounts, Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, said yesterday. The firm called on the Accounting Standards Board and the Department of Trade and Industry to simplify the rules governing disclosures. It said there were now more than 600 individual disclosure requirements in company law and accounting standards, many of which were 'archaic, obscure or otherwise redundant'. Ernst &amp; Young said simplification would provide clearer and more informative accounts for users, allow preparers to concentrate on presenting a true and fair picture of their company and help to reduce the burden of compliance on many small companies. It has published a list of nearly 50 disclosure requirements, including employment policies, that it believes should be abolished or amended. The suggestions are likely to be criticised, not least because they come when most users of accounts are calling for greater financial information on companies. Disclosures in Company Accounts. Ernst &amp; Young, Becket House, 1 Lambeth Palace Road, London SE1 7EU.</p>

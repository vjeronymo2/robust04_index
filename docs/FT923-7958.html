			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Cowie raises bid terms for rival Henlys T COWIE, the motor trader, yesterday raised its bid for rival Henlys Group. The new, and final, terms are seven Cowie shares for every 10 Henlys, an increase from the previous 1-for-2 offer. A partial cash alternative has been introduced. Henlys shareholders can opt for one Cowie share plus 40p cash for every two shares held. Cowie also forecast a dividend of 6.25p for the year, a rise of 28 per cent over 1991, to which accepting holders would be entitled. Henlys continued to oppose the offer saying it had 'no hesitation in urging shareholders to reject it'. With Cowie shares unchanged at 115p, the all-share offer is worth 80 1/2 p per Henlys share, and the partial cash bid 77 1/2 p. Total value of the paper terms is Pounds 30.5m, and the partial cash terms Pounds 29.3m. Henlys shares closed at 75p, up 6p. The offer will close on September 1, barring the appearance of a competing bid. Cowie said the new terms would give Henlys holders a 40 per cent increase in capital value and a 45 per cent lift in income for 1992. Henlys has forecast a dividend of 3p for 1992. Mr Gordon Hodgson, Cowie chief executive, said his company's share price was depressed because of the fall in the stock market and the bid. But he was confident it would return to its former levels of about 150p. He said the shares were also more marketable than Henlys'. There was 'compelling commercial logic' to the bid which would 'substantially enhance the prospects' for both companies' shareholders, Cowie claimed. The combined group would be the fourth largest motor dealer in the UK, providing economies of scale and synergies with Cowie's other activities. Mr Hodgson said analysts were expecting Cowie to make a pre-tax profit of Pounds 25m in 1992, while Henlys was forecasting a loss. He pooh-poohed orders won recently by Henlys' bus and coach division saying these were routine orders and Henlys had given no indication of likely margins or profits from them. Mr Steven Lonsdale, finance director, said Henlys had reported that its bus and coach building side had a full order book for the second half of 1992, but even so the division was forecast only to break even at the operating level.</p>

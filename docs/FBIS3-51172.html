			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 13 Jan (NA) -- Defense Minister Oscar  Camilion today admitted the existence of unconfirmed reports on  the alleged participation of Shining Path activists in the  social revolt that took place in Santiago del Estero. However,  he said, "there is no specific information" about the subject.    The presence of an unidentified activist group was detected,  Camilion said. The group took advantage of "a clear,  spontaneous, situation" staged by the people who participated in  the revolt.    In statements to Radio Continental, the minister said the  presence of Shining Path activists in Santiago del Estero has  not been confirmed and that "if there was specific information  about an identified individual he would be expelled from the  country."    He also said that another report mentioned the presence of a  police officer whose last name is Chuk in the revolt in Santiago  del Estero. The subject, however, was not mentioned during the  internal security meeting held on 12 January with President  Carlos Menem.    According to Camilion, during the meeting Menem "warned"  officials responsible for internal security to "keep their eyes  open" and asked intelligence officials to "obtain information  and investigate."    "It was a sudden meeting, not to analyze an urgent subject,  but to be alert," the defense minister said.    Camilion also said the government is investigating the  origin  of the fire in Misiones City Hall and the attacks on  installations of privatized public services.    The possibility that drug traffickers might be financing the  Zapatista guerrillas in Mexico was discussed during the meeting,  Camilion said, adding that the national government "does not  doubt they received a significant amount of money" from some  group.    Although he said the internal security meetings will  continue  to be held, Camilion denied the existence of a predetermined  agenda, adding that "in the short term no meeting will be held  to discuss so many subjects as yesterday."    Regarding the 12 January meeting, Camilion ruled out that  the  presence of the Armed Forces should have any political meaning  "other than that established by the Internal Security Law that  states the Armed Forces can be called at the last moment to  intervene in extreme cases."</p>

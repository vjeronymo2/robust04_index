They were  separated from the residual solid products by treating the  latter first with an organic solvent (saturated or aromatic  hydrocarbon) at a temperature of 400 and pressure of 250  atm and then with a mixture of concentrated  H[.sub]2[/]SO[.sub]4[/] and HNO[.sub]3[/]. In aqueous  solutions, the ultradisperse diamonds (3 to 8 x 10[.sup]-3[/]  m in diameter) thus separated formed aggregates up to 200  m in size. Externally, the ultradisperse diamonds were a  dense dark gray powder. Elemental analysis established that they  consisted of the following (percent): C, 78.6-78.8; H,  0.65-0.70; O, 16.5-17.0; N, 1.78-2.16; and ash residue,  2.47-1.34. The large amounts of oxygen found in the functional  groups on the surface of the ultradisperse diamonds were  attributed to the oxidation treatment, as well as to the  presence of oxygen (and nitrogen) in the diamonds' defect  lattices in the form of various impurity centers during the  shock-compression synthesis process. A comparison of the  infrared spectra of the ultradisperse diamonds before and after  modification confirmed the stability of the diamonds' different  functional groups and the change in the chemical state of their  surfaces. The presence of different types of nitrogen impurity  centers in the ultradisperse diamonds was also confirmed by  infrared spectroscopy. Figures 2, table 1; references 9: 7  Russian, 2 Western.</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Ukraine demand over Sevastopol Ukraine's parliament yesterday demanded Russia withdraw its claim to the Crimean port of Sevastopol, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev. MPs described the Russian parliament's claim on Sevastopol, in the Ukrainian region of Crimea, as 'an aggressive political action' and demanded that the decision be formally repealed. They said it was unacceptable for the unilateral Russian claim on part of their territory to remain on the law-books. President Boris Yeltsin has condemned his parliament's move.</p>

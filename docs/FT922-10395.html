			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Unit trusts Yesterday's news that unit trust sales in March reached a healthy Pounds 1bn might suggest that the individual punter is getting his timing right at last. But while there was obviously a rush to beat the Personal Equity Plan deadline at the financial year end, the word is that the bulk of money last month came from institutions rightly convinced that the pre-election panic had been overdone. It looks as though the poor old private investor has been trumped again. All the same, unit trust salesmen may have something to look forward to after the relatively lean years of 1990 and 1991. PEPs are not only secured under a Conservative government; also, the doubling of the unit trust limit to Pounds 6,000 came into effect from April 5. The FT-A All Share hit a new peak yesterday, and the stock market looks reasonably underpinned provided the latest stirrings of recovery do not once again prove illusory. That said, unit trust management groups are still deservedly paying the price for greedily pulling in business ahead of the October 1987 crash on the strength of absurdly short-term performance statistics. Building societies, National Savings Certificates and inflation, for example, have comfortably beaten the median UK equity fund over the last five years. Do not therefore expect a surge of unit trust sales till the late autumn, when the crash finally drops out of the comparisons.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Q&amp;A: JOEL SLUTZKY;  </P> <P> ANOTHER FUN FIRM IN ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> ODETICS 'ASSOCIATES' WHO PLAY TOGETHER STAY TOGETHER  </P> <P> In the 1984 book "The 100 Best Companies to Work For in America," two Orange  County businesses on opposite sides of Harbor Boulevard in Anaheim were among  the elite.  </P> <P> One was Disneyland. The other was Odetics.  </P> <P> Disneyland, of course, needs no introduction.  </P> <P> But most people haven't heard of Odetics Inc., a small high-technology company  founded in 1969. Nor could they probably name its co-founder and chairman, Joel  Slutzky.  </P> <P> Even among high-tech companies, which have a reputation for stressing  "quality-of-life" factors, Odetics is a bit of an oddball.  </P> <P> Odetics has a Fun Committee that meets occasionally to plan ways for employees  to, well, have fun.  </P> <P> To celebrate the Los Angeles Lakers' National Basketball Assn. title last year,  the Fun Committee planned "Lakers Day," during which anyone who came to work  dressed in the team's colors was entitled to a free lunch in the company  cafeteria. In years past, the committee also devised "Project Girth," where for  every pound lost by an employee, the company donated $1 to his or her favorite  charity.  </P> <P> Odetics also has its own repertory theater company, which stages performances  every few years. The last performance was "You Can't Take It With You" in the  spring of 1987.  </P> <P> The company's lobby is furnished with, among other things, footstools in the  shape of human feet. In 1982, the company opened its Odexercise Center, which  has an indoor heated pool and an exercise room that most health spas would be  proud of. The facility offers aerobic dance classes and a health training  program, and has a full-time fitness coordinator.  </P> <P> There is more to Odetics than just fun, however.  </P> <P> The company manufactures sophisticated space recorders that are carried on  board the space shuttle and satellites, time-lapse videocassette recorders that  are used in banks and convenience stores, and computerized cart machines used  by television stations to automate their programming. Odetics also built a  six-legged robot named Odex, which is now exhibited at the Smithsonian  Institution in Washington.  </P> <P> Odetics earned $896,938 on revenue of $49.7 million for its fiscal year ended  March 31, 1988. For the 6 months ended Sept. 30, the firm earned $633,000 on  revenue of $25.3 million.  </P> <P> Slutzky, 49, was one of six Odetics co-founders. He earned undergraduate  degrees in mechanical and electrical engineering from the University of  Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, where he also was awarded a master's degree in  mechanical engineering. He lives in Newport Beach with his wife Judy and their  three children.  </P> <P> In a recent interview with Times staff writer David Olmos, Slutzky discussed  his company, his management philosophy and other issues.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Q. One of your company slogans is: "Odetics: not just another company." What  does that slogan mean to you?  </P> <P> A. I think it reflects a philosophy that is geared to a balance between the  present and the future. We don't take the traditional price-earnings, the 'What  did you do this quarter?' approach. We try to balance our short-term  performance with where we see the long term.  </P> <P> Q. Odetics is in the business of developing intelligent machines. What is an  intelligent machine?  </P> <P> A. Intelligent machines are machines that adapt to their environment. It's  really a very broad term for the field of robotics. The original term robotics  was picked up by manufacturing industry and was used for stationary robots used  for welding or painting. In order to differentiate traditional robots from the  factory robots, the industry coined the expression intelligent machines.  Intelligent machines can run the gamut from artificial intelligence capability  to machines that have sophisticated electronics and can do tasks that simpler  machines can't do.  </P> <P> Q. What kinds of intelligent machines do you see your company making in the  future?  </P> <P> A. We've defined four market areas: space, defense, nuclear and commercial  applications. In the area of space we're very much interested in docking and  berthing of satellites. Also service and maintenance of satellites. There are a  number of applications for robots in the U.S. space station. We expect that  there will be a number of platforms in space -- with electronic packages, power  supplies and other equipment that will have to be replaced from time to time.  The ability to have a servicing vehicle that can dock with the platform and  change a bad component for a new one is important. I also think there are other  areas, such as refueling in space or space construction, that will be a natural  for robotics. In the area of defense, we've been concentrating on  logistics-handling equipment (for example, a device attached to the end of a  truck that could be used to pick up pallets of food or other military  supplies). The third area is the nuclear industry. Our interest there is  service and maintenance in nuclear power plants. We're currently building a  robot for public utilities that would be used for doing routine maintenance in  a nuclear plant, such as changing filters and turning valves. In the commercial  area, which probably is the most fertile, we manufacture cart machines for the  television industry.  </P> <P> Q. If I could ask you to do some star-gazing, what kinds of intelligent  machines are we going to be seeing 10 to 15 years from now?  </P> <P> A. I think the trend is very clear. We're getting more sophisticated and  smaller computers. These computers are allowing us to do more processing,  quicker processing with more memory capability. We're also developing better  sensors, which allows us to do many more things. In the area of defense, for  instance, many of the philosophies and the equipment are geared for a historic  perception of (combat). When you start looking at intelligent machines, you  talk about eliminating people (from the task). And when you start talking about  eliminating people, you start to rethink what that equipment should look like  in a military scenario.  </P> <P> Q. What are some examples of that?  </P> <P> A. A tank, for instance, looks like a tank because it's been designed to  protect people. If you were to design a peopleless tank, an autonomous tank, it  would look completely different. It wouldn't need the armor to protect the  people. It would be very lightweight and very fast. It would be a very  revolutionary-type thing. (Intelligent machines) are going to affect military  philosophies and strategies. In commercial use, there are many tasks that are  just impossible for human beings to do or for which they need tools that don't  exist today. Intelligent machines will allow us to do that.  </P> <P> Q. Odetics has a reputation as a unique place to work. You have been quoted as  saying that you try to create an environment of enjoyment for your employees.  How did this get started?  </P> <P> A. Well, first of all we don't call them employees. We call them associates. I  think everyone is a reflection of their experiences. When we started the  company on Day 1, we talked about trying to establish a company where there  were no "we's" and "they's," where it was more of an "us." We wanted to create  a family-type atmosphere in which the associates would be the company. And we  have found that to be very successful. We quickly realized that we weren't  getting the type of turnover that other companies were getting, that there were  real dividends in that philosophy, that we didn't have the recruiting and the  training costs. So, if anything, it was selfish motivation that kept that  philosophy alive. It just makes good sense, not only for Odetics but for any  company to do that. Because you can't replace experienced people. And there's  no substitute for people who really care about what they're doing. If they feel  like they're a part of it then they financially end up caring about it.  </P> <P> Q. What is your turnover rate?  </P> <P> A. In our space division, for instance, the average tenure of our associates is  8 1/2 years. The turnover rate has been about 5% a year, which is extremely  low.  </P> <P> Q. But the swimming pool and the recreation facility cost money. Is there a  payback?  </P> <P> A. Absolutely. The cost of the facilities is really very small compared to the  benefits. One benefit which is hard to put a dollar figure on is the  communications and feedback that goes on in that kind of environment. You know,  it's one thing to talk to somebody when you're wearing a suit and tie and  they're wearing an assembly smock. You've already got a caste difference going  in the discussion, which is going to bias some of the communication. It's  another thing when you're both in your sweats and you're talking about what's  going on in the company. It's a great reducer of barriers. So that's a benefit  that you can't put a dollar figure on. There are other benefits which are more  tangible -- the health and well-being and happiness of the people that are  using those facilities. There are some real intangibles.  </P> <P> Q. Of the tangibles, for example, do you find that people are not out sick as  much? Have you studied the relationship there?  </P> <P> A. We looked at it. And I think people are out sick less, but we might have  more sprained ankles than other places. But it's more than the gym and the  swimming pool. We have a number of tournaments. We have a Ping-Pong tournament,  volleyball tournament, basketball tournament and corporate fitness cups. One  has to appreciate how much time you spend in a company relative to the amount  of time that you spend at home. If you take away the sleeping portion of the  day, you actually spend more time at work than you do at home. So I've always  felt that work should be interesting, challenging. You should want to get up in  the morning. There's nothing worse than a static environment and a static set  of conditions in working.  </P> <P> Q. In a newspaper article a few years ago, your personnel manager at the time  said that you are "as crazy as anybody gets." What did you think of that?  </P> <P> A. My feeling about an article like that is that it's nice but that's not what  we're all about. As far as my being crazy, when I looked at the article, I  said, "I'm not crazy. If anything, I've lost too much of the child in me." But  the more I thought about it, the less I took offense at it. I think that we all  could use a little more child in us. Sometimes we get too serious and too hung  up on what we're doing. The fact that every once in awhile you'll see something  a little bit different here -- like at Easter you might see somebody running  around in a bunny suit -- I think that's good. And if crazy means fostering  that sort of thing or condoning it, then that's fine with me.  </P> <P> Q. Although Odetics has been profitable for 18 consecutive years, your profit  margins have not been as high as some other companies in your business. Is the  company too busy having fun?  </P> <P> A. The truth is that the amount of time you spend relaxing is very small and is  necessary. When you have people that work hard and come in on Saturdays and  sometimes on Sundays, they do that for a love of the company. When we make  marginal profitability, it's because we've been putting our profits back into  research and development. That has no reflection on the gym or the swimming  pool. But people can draw their conclusion, and that's always a danger.  </P> <P> Q. Has the image of Odetics as a fun place to work had any effect on how the  company is perceived on Wall Street?  </P> <P> A. No. I think we're really not a Wall Street company because we've taken a  long-term view, and Wall Street is very much quarterly conscious. We have opted  to do some things that, in the short term, don't help. For instance, we  purchased these facilities (Odetics' headquarters building in Anaheim, which  the company bought in 1984). If you were trying to placate Wall Street, you  wouldn't do that because you don't really want the depreciation on your books.  Depreciation hurts earnings, which hurts the price of the stock.  </P> <P> Q. It's been said that one of the advantages Japanese corporations have over  their American counterparts is that they're more willing to take a long-term  approach to their markets, exchanging short-term profits for market share.  Would you agree with that?  </P> <P> A. I think that kind of spirit is something we see still in the Japanese  market. I think the Japanese believe in market share and will do anything to  establish market share. When you match that kind of a philosophy against a  society that believes in earnings, then you have an imbalance. When the  competition gets tough, the person who succeeds is the one who believes in  market share, has a long-term outlook and is willing to wait out the situation.  A person who believes in earnings is likely to throw in the towel and give up  on an industry because it's not "earning enough." We've seen major American  companies get out of a market because they didn't feel there was enough  earnings.  </P> <P> Q. So you think the Japanese have the right strategy?  </P> <P> A. The Japanese have been very patient. They've come into industries and tried  to understand what is required to make them a success. And then they're willing  to invest the time and effort to do that. You have to admire that. There's an  awful lot of Japan-bashing going around. But anybody who is close to the  situation has to admire their tenacity, their persistence and their desire to  learn and succeed. We've got to do the same thing. We certainly don't want to  become the Great Britain of the 21st Century.  </P> <P> Q. What kind of future growth do you see for Odetics?  </P> <P> A. We would like to see it become a $100-million company within the next 4 to 5  years. We're taking it one objective at a time. I think we have a number of  opportunities for good growth. What we really want is . . . to let the company  grow in a logical, harmonious way. If you go too fast, it provides  dislocations. If you go too slow, you've got financial problems.  </P> <P> Q. What would you consider logical growth?  </P> <P> A. At a growth rate of 20% to 30% a year, there is still a comfort factor. If  the growth gets larger than that, you've got people coming through the front  door so quickly that there is no way you can impart philosophies -- to tell  them what we're all about or we're trying to achieve. The secret of a  successful company is getting everyone steering in the same direction. You do  that not by dictate, but through dialogue and by discussing where you're going.  </P></p>

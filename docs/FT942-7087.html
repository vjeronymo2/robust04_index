			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / HK property dealers warn on land prices Hong Kong property developers yesterday got together to arrange low bids at a public land auction, challenging the colony's government, which has pledged to intervene in the property market to bring down soaring prices. One analyst described the government auction, which saw bidders rushing around the hall to reach agreement with those proposing higher bids, as a 'blatant display' of a property developers' cartel. The inability of many families to afford their own homes prompted Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, to launch a task force in March, which has been instructed to come up with means of cooling prices. Prices of small flats have risen by 200 per cent in the past three years, but industry opposition to the government's planned intervention has coincided with growing concerns that the market has passed its peak. The government took a small step last month by slightly increasing the supply of residential land it will sell off this year. Analysts expect these measures will lead to a 10 to 20 per cent fall in prices. It is understood a consortium of up to 12 developers bought yesterday one plot, with 10 joining to purchase another lot. The companies involved included some of the colony's biggest developers, and the Hong Kong stock market reacted badly to news of the low prices. The Hang Seng index was up about 120 to 130 points in the afternoon but slipped after reports spread of the auction, ending down 39.66 points to close at 9,481.71, against the day's high of 9,656.15. The first site, of 20,780 square metres went for HKDollars 2.04bn (Pounds 171m) in spite of market expectations that the price would reach HKDollars 3bn to HKDollars 4bn. The second, smaller plot went under the hammer for HKDollars 510m, though it was expected to bring as much as HKDollars 800m. These prices were regarded more as a warning to the government than a sign that the Hong Kong market has turned, but the stock market's response was an indication of some jitteriness about the fate of the colony's property market. According to Mr Michael Green, director of SG Warburg in Hong Kong, the larger site splits into 12 plots, so each of the 12 developers will be able to assume a portion while spreading the risk. But he added: 'It is a reality that the developers formed a consortium. It clearly is a message to the government not to interfere with the free market mechanism.'</p>

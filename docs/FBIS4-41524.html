			<p>BFN     [Text] The fourth privatization auction was held today.  But one cannot see any special activity going on at privatized  enterprises. In fact, the giants of industry are never on sale,  although at this auction the caliber of enterprises varied.  Among the 45 enterprises offered for sale are those of the  light industry, fuel and gas supplying, and machine-building.    As has been expected, the least demand of the approximately  100 funds participating in the auction, was in construction  industry enterprises, because their capacity is small, the  infrastructure is not there, and the production base is weak.  But such enterprises as the Akmolinsk spinning and weaving mill  or the Karagandaodezhda joint stock company were objects of  serious battles. The outcome of the fourth auction is as  follows: 85.3 percent of stock were sold. Of 104 funds that  contested the tenders, 83 funds bought shares. The others lost  owing to deliberately low starting prices.</p>

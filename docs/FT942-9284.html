			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Armed police in Britain PC Pete Allen displays the firearms available to him as a member of an armed response vehicle crew under measures to apply in London announced by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday, Alan Pike writes. Until now officers have drawn their guns from lockers in the cars only when arriving at incidents. They must still do this with the carbine, pictured, but will be allowed to wear sidearms in holsters at all times. The number of armed response vehicles on 24-hour patrol in London is being increased from five to 12. Although critics will see the step as a further move towards the abandonment of Britain's tradition of an unarmed police service, Mr Paul Condon, Metropolitan Police commissioner, said he hoped the move would 'postpone the necessity to routinely arm police officers'. Arming the police will be an issue at the Police Federation conference, which opens today in Brighton.</p>

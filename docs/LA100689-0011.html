			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEBANON'S PEACE AND ISRAEL  </P> <P> In response to Saleh's column, I feel that it is about time that someone  finally realizes something must be done. If you scrutinize the situation in  Lebanon, you realize how excruciating life is there. I think it is an  effrontery for a country as prodigious as the United States to remain  uninvolved at such a time. Lebanon's survival relies on outside help. If we  consider ourselves wealthy, why are we not sharing our resources with Lebanon?  If we spend billions on nuclear weapons, why can't we give to those in need  instead? Is it not about time we put our tax money to good use?  </P> <P> YOUMNA CHLALA  </P> <P> Playa del Rey  </P></p>

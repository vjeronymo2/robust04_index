			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Pensioners' plea to prime minister THE BRITISH Australian Pensioner Association yesterday urged the government to pay pensions at the full UK rate to 144,000 people whose pensions were frozen when they emigrated to Australia. Mr Derrick Prance, the association's UK representative, said Mr John Major should agree to meet the Pounds 340m cost of uprating the pensions when Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, visits London this month.</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Support for Major seen at 93 per cent THE only surprise in the assessment of the relative qualities of the two party leaders is just how overwhelming is the backing for Mr John Major. The present prime minister is preferred by 93 per cent against the 1 per cent backing Mr Neil Kinnock. But there is an unwelcome message in the survey for Mr Norman Lamont. Only 39 per cent believe he is the best choice for No 11 Downing Street against the 46 per cent prepared to forgive Mr John Smith his party affiliation and say that he would make the better chancellor. Mr Smith is particularly popular among executive of companies with a turnover of between Pounds 500m and Pounds 2bn, where his rating jumps to 56 per cent, while the very biggest companies are kinder towards Mr Lamont. Elsewhere, Mr Michael Howard scores for his implacable opposition to the minimum wage and to any increase in the powers of unions by winning the preference of 69 per cent for the job of employment secretary. Mr Tony Blair, the young star of the Labour front bench gets the vote of only 14 per cent. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade and industry secretary and a strong contender for the future party leadership, does better, with 33 per cent backing him for the cabinet post. But the present incumbent at the Department of Trade and Industry, Mr Peter Lilley, is still comfortably ahead with the support of 45 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Planning Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim </F> al-Iryani by Lamis al-Barghuthi in Sanaa; date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Al-Barghuthi] Can we describe  what is taking place in Yemen as a popular civil war?    [Al-Iryani] No. A civil war means fighting in every suburb,  street, and village in Yemen. This is not the case now. The  present war is between military forces belonging to the  Socialist Party and other military forces defending the unity.    [Al-Barghuthi] Do you think the perpetuation of war and  failure to quickly settle the situation militarily may lead to a  protracted war of annihilation in which civilians will  eventually take part?    [Al-Iryani] I do not think so because the present military  situation does not suggest this possibility. The Abyan, Lahij,  and Shabwah Governorates are entirely under control. The  non-fall of Aden cannot turn into a civil war in Abyan, Shabwah,  or other governorates. People are far from the atmosphere of  war; they are leading an extremely normal life. Therefore, I  think it is impossible for matters to turn into a civil war.  Things now depend on the fall of Aden. I am confident that  once the Socialist Party's mechanism is uprooted in al-Mukalla,  it will all be over. As you know, fighting is currently taking  place only on one front, that is, the Aden front. We are not in  a hurry to enter Aden. The "legitimate forces" may enter  Hadhramaut before Aden. Our care for civilians in Aden is all  that is stopping us. Indiscriminate shelling of the city for  10-12 hours may lead to its fall. It is preferable to besiege  the city for a few days instead of bombing it indiscriminately  and harming the civilians. We will thus avoid a civil war which  the socialists tried to launch. Their indiscriminate shelling  of Sanaa with Scud missiles is meant to tell the Arabs and the  world that what is taking place in Yemen is a civil war as  proven by civilian casualties. They will then call for Arab and  international intervention in Yemen to stop the civil war.    [Al-Barghuthi] How do you view the political solution after  the cessation of battles and how will you deal with the  Socialist Party's leaders and cadres?    [Al-Iryani] This subject has been settled by two decisions.  The public prosecutor decided to take legal action against 16  Socialist Party civilian and military officials and ordered  their arrest. This was followed by the general amnesty decree.  The way the non-prosecuted Socialist Party leaders behave  toward the general amnesty decree will decide the way to deal  with them.    [Al-Barghuthi] Will power be shared equally between the two  parties as was the case before the war?    [Al-Iryani] At the end of the war, we expect to negotiate  with the Socialist Party as a partner to the coalition, but it  will not be given any other privilege. Before the war, the  socialists were given privileges they did not deserve and this  led to the present state of affairs. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Tory unrest threatens council reforms The government is facing mounting opposition from Conservative MPs opposed to plans to replace the dual structure of English local government with single tier, all-purpose councils. More than a dozen Conservative MPs - more than enough to wipe out the government's overall majority of 17 - say they are seriously concerned about proposals emerging from the local government commission, chaired by Sir John Banham. Two told the Financial Times on the record that they would vote against the government unless it dropped proposed changes or maked them more acceptable to local people. Others made the same threat privately. The strongest centres of unrest are in Yorkshire and the West Country, where the commission's proposals are most advanced. But unease is also emerging among shire MPs from the Tory heartlands in East Anglia and the south-east. The emerging divisions over local government came as a string of senior Tories yesterday called for unity behind Mr John Major's leadership. Backbench opposition is forcing the government to consider watering down plans to restrict student unions and overhaul the police in the face of opposition within its own ranks. Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs, and a Yorkshire MP, says backbenchers are 'generally very concerned'. The picture is complicated by the High Court's decision on Friday that the government cannot insist on the abolition of county councils except in exceptional cases. Tories opposing the proposals are likely to use the ruling to press the government to reconsider its plans or risk costly legal challenges. The strongest signs of rebellion are coming from Somerset. Mr Tom King (Bridgwater), a former cabinet minister, said he had 'registered deep concern' with Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary. Two MPs - Mr David Heathcoat-Amery (Wells) and Mr David Nicholson (Taunton) - said they would vote against the proposals. Mr Heathcoat-Amery said: 'The commission has not understood the complexities of our small but complex county, and we have taken the view that this cannot go ahead without the support of the public, which it is very clear it does not have.' Mr Anthony Steen (South Hams), who will meet Mr Gummer today for talks on the future of Devon's local authorities, said anxiety was widespread among West Country MPs. He said: 'I doubt that the government will be able to implement these changes because the party will never back it.' Yorkshire MPs are not yet threatening open rebellion. But Mr William Hague (Richmond), a junior social security minister, Mr Robert Banks (Harrogate) and Mr Michael Alison (Selby) all say they oppose the commission's plans to restore the ancient North Riding. 'I am not prepared to make any warlike noises yet about voting against the government,' said Mr Alison. 'But Mr Gummer is aware that there is a lot of disillusionment.' Other MPs said there was concern about the possible abolition of county councils or the proposed boundaries of unitary authorities in a number of other counties, including Lincolnshire, Hampshire, Kent, and Norfolk. The first orders for reorganisation, in Cleveland and the Isle of Wight, are due to be presented to parliament next month. They should be followed within weeks, if Mr Gummer consents to Sir John's proposals, by much more controversial plans to reorganise Avon and Somerset, and Humberside and North Yorkshire.

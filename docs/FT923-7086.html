			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Observer: Sweet smell Does your office suffer from a malodorous ambience, or to put it bluntly, stink? Good news awaits all long-term sufferers of smelly workplaces or nasally-challenging shops. The latest wunderkind of the marketing world is launching itself next week as what it claims is the world's first 'smell consultancy'. Marketing Aromatics promises corporate clients that it will first clean up the air and then add fragrances to 'create particular moods' or neutralise 'unpleasant odours, impregnating product or corporate literature or even endorsing a company's corporate identity'. Unfortunately, there is no whiff of the company being able to impart that smell sweetest to the hearts of today's hard-pressed chief executives - success.</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN;  </P> <P> ATHERTON'S LONG ARM SNAGS TALENT FOR MAINLY MOZART  </P> <P> David Atherton has an enviable reputation as a recruiter. When the former music  director of the San Diego Symphony was in the market for a new concertmaster,  he lured Andres Cardenes to San Diego from his concertmaster post at the Utah  Symphony while Atherton was guest conducting in Salt Lake City. When he needed  to staff his inaugural Mainly Mozart Festival with a concertmaster and violin  soloist, he borrowed another concertmaster he had encountered while guest  conducting stateside.  </P> <P> "I met David when he was guest conducting with the Atlanta Symphony," explained  Atlanta's concertmaster William Preucil. "We became friends -- at least as much  as you can in a week's time."  </P> <P> Since he enjoyed working with the energetic British conductor, Preucil accepted  his San Diego invitation. At Atherton's suggestion, he recruited several  Atlanta colleagues for the local festival, including Martin Chalifour, the  Atlanta Symphony's associate concertmaster. Preucil's wife, violinist Gwen  Starker Preucil, is also performing in the Mainly Mozart orchestra.  </P> <P> "She is the concertmaster of the Atlanta Ballet Orchestra," said Preucil,  "although I should put that in the past tense, since their season is finished  now, and we'll of course be moving to Rochester next month."  </P> <P> Preucil only recently decided to end his seven-year association with the  Atlanta Symphony to become the Cleveland Quartet's first violinist. In spite of  its name, that 20-year-old chamber music ensemble is in residence at the  Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y.  </P> <P> "I always wanted to play in a string quartet. My father was in a string quartet  -- actually he still is. One of the first things I did as a teen-ager was have  a string quartet. The opportunity to play in a fine string quartet doesn't come  along very often, so, although I love playing in the orchestra, opportunity  knocked now. The string quartet literature is probably some of the greatest of  all to perform. Most composers saved their most intimate expressions for the  string quartet."  </P> <P> The 31-year-old Preucil did not reject the label of chamber music addict.  </P> <P> "While I was in the (Atlanta) orchestra, I played some 110 concerts a year, but  I still managed to play at least 50 chamber music performances every year."  </P> <P> Among his chamber music associations, Preucil played four seasons with the  Minneapolis Artists Ensemble, a group that specialized in new music.  </P> <P> "Each program had one piece by a living composer, and many of them were brand  new commissions."  </P> <P> Minnesota composer Stephen Paulus has written three pieces for Preucil,  including his Violin Concerto, which Preucil premiered with the Atlanta  Symphony. The recording of the concerto is scheduled for release next year on  New World Records.  </P> <P> When Preucil was on tour in the Soviet Union with members of the Seattle  Chamber Music Festival last year, he played another Paulus composition written  for him, the Partita for Violin and Piano. Paulus is now preparing a new  chamber work for Preucil on commission from Atlanta's Emory University, where  the violinist will premiere it in the spring of 1990.  </P> <P> After he leaves San Diego, Preucil will play three more festivals on his summer  docket.  </P> <P> "At the Music Festival of Florida in Sarasota, I'll be giving some master  classes to college students, as well as playing chamber music. After three  weeks there, I go to Alaska's Sitka Music Festival and finally to the Seattle  Chamber Music Festival."  </P> <P> Magic Flutes. UC San Diego flutist Sebastian Winston is attempting to do for  the little-known bass flute what James Galway has done for the lowly penny  whistle. In a recital Saturday night at UCSD's Erickson Hall, Winston presented  an entire program of works for solo bass flute, most of them commissioned by  the performer.  </P> <P> The world premiere of resident composer Joji Yuasa's "Terms of Temporal  Detailing" was a virtual catalogue of bass flute sound effects, from buzzing  multiphonics, or singing into the flute while playing, to abundant  flutter-tonguing. Although the work's organization is supposed to be a musical  counterpart to painter David Hockney's photographic collages, it would require  repeated hearings to obtain an overall aural impression of Yuasa's tightly  telescoped thematic fragments.  </P> <P> More alluring to the ear, but no less probing, was Chaya Czernowin Shwartz's  "Ina" for bass flute and prepared tape. The composer clustered shimmering  spirals of recorded flute sounds around the angular solo line. Like other works  from this promising young composer, "Ina" invited the listener into its complex  sonic world, an atypical virtue of most new music.  </P> <P> Musical Benefits. This week offers several possibilities to combine musical  pleasure and philanthropy. On Wednesday, San Diego's Orpheus Ensemble will  present an evening of baroque vocal and instrumental music to benefit the  cancer-stricken Leucadia youngster Josh Kaplan. Soprano Kathryn Evans and tenor  David Meek will each sing a Bach solo cantata in St. James Catholic Church,  Solana Beach, to raise funds to help pay for the screening of potential  bone-marrow donors for Kaplan.  </P> <P> On Saturday, members of Del Mar's Romero family will hold forth at San Diego's  First Unitarian Church to benefit the research programs of the National Vision  Research Institute in Point Loma. Noted classical guitarist Pepe Romero will be  joined by his mother, Angelita, and his daughter, Angelina, in a concert of  traditional Spanish and South American music.  </P> <P> Each concert begins at 7:30 p.m.  </P></p>

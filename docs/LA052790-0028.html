			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SHRINKING LAKE CHAD TARGETED FOR RESCUE  </P> <P> Seen from an airplane, the only major body of water in the heart of Africa  could be mistaken for a mirage, a mirror shimmering in the desert.  </P> <P> Lake Chad, whose name in the Kanuri language means "great body of water,"  millions of years ago covered 132,000 square miles, or one-quarter of the  African nation that now bears its name.  </P> <P> But although a subject of much speculation and curiosity on the part of  European explorers, it failed to appear in detail on maps of the continent  until the late 19th Century.  </P> <P> Today, fears are growing that the changing world climate and rampant  desertification will combine to dry up the lake, leaving behind only a memory  of its outline in the Sahel region south of the great Sahara.  </P> <P> Several million fishermen and farmers in Chad and other countries depend for  their livelihood on the lake that has shrunk to about 3,200 square miles. Last  year Chadians alone pulled 100,000 tons of perch and catfish from the lake for  smoking and shipping to the rest of the country.  </P> <P> Natron, a mineral extracted from the lake for fertilizer, is sold in gunny  sacks to merchants in N'Djamena's bustling market for shipment south to Chad's  best agricultural land.  </P> <P> During the seventh summit of the 26-year-old Lake Chad Basin Commission in  Yaounde, Cameroon, earlier this year, the presidents of Chad, Cameroon and  Nigeria urged increased international aid to save the lake and the area that  depends on it.  </P> <P> Experts at the meeting suggested, however, that the governments of the  countries bordering the lake have themselves neglected its resources because of  simmering disagreements over boundaries and a civil war.  </P> <P> Jacques Lemoalle, a French government hydrobiologist, spent 1963 to 1977  studying Lake Chad and returned recently to check reports that the lake was  fading away.  </P> <P> "Since 1967, the lake has been shrinking progressively. The most remarkable  decline was at the end of the 1968-72 drought when high spots on the floor  began sticking out, effectively dividing the lake in two," he said in an  interview.  </P> <P> Lake Chad is fed from the south by the Chari River, which rises in the Central  African Republic and is then joined by the Logone.  </P> <P> The Chari is gorged with water during the rainy season, usually July to  October, but then recedes to a sluggish, meandering course that seems to take  forever to reach the marshy, reed-filled lake.  </P> <P> "The whole basin is a relatively unstable system," Lemoalle said. "This is the  third time the lake has been this small since the beginning of the century."  </P> <P> The African Development Bank is funding a 5-year, $20-million program to pump  new life into an earlier Lake Chad project. A first group of experts in  irrigation and vegetable farming arrived earlier this year to advise on more  efficient ways of growing millet, sorghum and okra, staples of the region.  </P></p>

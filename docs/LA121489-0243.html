			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOFIA DELAYS REFORMS, SPARKS STREET PROTEST  </P> <P> Parliament today postponed action on a motion to abolish the Communist Party's  43-year-old monopoly on power, provoking an outraged response from more than  20,000 pro-democracy demonstrators outside.  </P> <P> Bulgarians had widely expected the legislature to approve a request by the  Central Committee of the Communist Party to strike a clause from the  constitution guaranteeing the party's leading role.  </P> <P> After state radio announced the decision to defer discussion on the motion for  a month, the thousands of protesters outside Parliament became angry.  </P> <P> "We are here!" the demonstrators shouted in unison to the Communist deputies  inside. "Come on out!"  </P> <P> Officials justified the decision by citing a little-known law stating that any  motion to change the constitution must be acted on not less than a month after  it is made but no later than three months afterward.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the party's governing Central Committee closed a three-day  meeting by voting to propose that Parliament strike two clauses from the  constitution that enshrine the party's "leading role."  </P> <P> If the proposal had been adopted by Parliament today, Romania and the Soviet  Union would have become the only Warsaw Pact countries where the Communists'  political supremacy is legally guaranteed.  </P> <P> At a Communist-sponsored rally Wednesday evening, about 60,000 people cheered  Petar Mladenov, who heads the party, when he told them that the party had  decided to scrap its guaranteed leading role.  </P> <P> This has been a key demand of the opposition, for which thousands of people  expressed support in recent days by joining in mass rallies.  </P> <P> "Our glorious party doesn't need this (guarantee) anymore," Mladenov told the  rally outside party headquarters. "Without it we can win."  </P></p>

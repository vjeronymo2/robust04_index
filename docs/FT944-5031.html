			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Phone groups face December revolution Oftel, the UK telecommunications regulator, issues a consultative paper this week which will lead to the most far-reaching changes in industry regulations since the privatisation of British Telecommunications in 1984. Some of the changes could have profound implications for the cost of telephone services - currently on a downward trend - in both the residential and business sectors. The 'December Document' is ostensibly about the cost to the growing number of public telecommunications operators of interconnection to the BT network. Any public telephone operator in the UK has to link to BT's network at some point to deliver a service, and interconnection charges can represent between a half and two-thirds of an operator's costs. Oftel has been fielding a torrent of complaints that the regime is unfair, arbitrary and inimical to business planning. The document will tackle this problem and account separation - through which BT can be measured on the performance of each of its operations - in detail. But Mr Don Cruickshank, director-general of Oftel, is also taking the opportunity to explore a range of questions - many with no easy answer - which have been thrown up by the complex development of the telecommunications industry. These range from the 'universal service obligation' - the need to provide a service on economic terms to the isolated, disabled and infirm - to the measures which should be taken to regulate the industry's most recent entrants, the suppliers of multimedia services which are not themselves telecommunications operators. There are also suggestions that Mr Cruickshank will seek to open a debate over the future of Oftel itself, asking at what point the role of the regulator should cease to exist in a freely competitive market. Some of the more important questions to be addressed this week are: How to set interconnection charges to allow operators flexibility in pricing their own services. At present, interconnection charges paid are directly related to BT's tariff structure because BT connects its competitors' calls at commercial rates. In other words, because interconnection is such an important element of an operator's costs, its freedom for price innovation is constrained by BT's pricing strategy. One answer is to relate pricing to capacity; a fear is that many newer entrants have insufficient information to calculate their capacity requirements. How to resolve the nightmarish issue of the 'access deficit contribution' (ADC). BT, as owner of the nationwide network, is obliged to provide a universal service at reasonable cost. It is prevented by Oftel from raising line rental charges by more than the retail prices index plus 2 per cent annually. This protects vulnerable residential users but the subsequent lack of 'rebalancing' costs BT revenue. The argument is that all operators should make a contribution to these costs  -an ADC. Sir Bryan Carsberg, the previous director-general, ruled that to help entrants, operators pay no ADC until they reached a specific market share. At the moment only Mercury pays ADCs. The complexities of calculating the charges are daunting. A principal theme of the paper is expected to be the way the telecommunications market is becoming buried under a tangle of regulations, and the need to simplify matters for all competitors. How to define and calculate the universal service obligation. For such a central issue it is remarkable that no formal definition exists, nor an estimate of how much it costs to provide. Oftel will attempt a definition and look at ways of identifying costs. It is likely to make clear that it will be a cost for the operators to bear rather than a tax on the public. Responses to the paper are invited before the end of March and the new framework is expected to be published in the summer. The debate will be followed with intense interest not only in the UK but by telecommunications authorities and companies in Europe and beyond. It is asking the questions they all have to answer.</p>

Section 2607(b)(1) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8621  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> et. seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> ), as amended, requires that if the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services determines that, as of September 1 of any fiscal year, an amount allotted to a grantee for any fiscal year will not be used by that grantee during the fiscal year, the Secretary must notify the grantee and publish a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  that such funds may be reallotted. As the Secretary's designee, I have determined that a total of $22,591 of FY 1993 funds may be available for reallotment. I have based that determination on reports from the United Tribes of Kansas and Southeast Nebraska, Inc. (Kansas), Seldovia Village Tribe (Alaska) and the Aroostock Band of Micmacs (Maine) which were submitted to the Office of Community Services as required by 45 CFR 96.81. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statute allows grantees who have funds unobligated at the end of a fiscal year to request that they be allowed to carry over up to 10 percent of their allotments to the next fiscal year. Funds in excess of this amount must be returned to HHS and are subject to reallotment to other grantees under section 2607(b)(1) of the LIHEAP statute. All of the amounts described in this notice were reported as unobligated funds in excess of the amount that the three tribes named above could carry over to FY 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United Tribes of Kansas and Southeast Nebraska, Inc. were notified by certified mail that $2,384 of its FY 1993 LIHEAP funds may be reallotted. The Seldovia Village Tribe was notified by certified mail that $5,117 of their FY 1993 LIHEAP funds may be reallotted. The Aroostock Band of Micmacs was notified by certified mail that $15,090 of its FY 1993 LIHEAP funds may be reallotted. In accordance with section 2607(b)(3), the Chief Executive Officer of each of these tribes has 30 days from the date of the letters to submit comments to me. That 30 day period will expire June 16, 1994. After considering any comments submitted, I will notify the Chief Executive Officer of my decision and will publish my decision in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If funds are reallotted, they will be allocated in accordance with section 2604 and will be treated as an amount appropriated for FY 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Janet M.

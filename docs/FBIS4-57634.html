			<p>Argentina   <F P=102>   PY2005220494 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1805 GMT 20 May 94 </F> <F P=103> PY2005220494 </F> <F P=104>  Madrid EFE </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] Santiago, 20 May (EFE) -- Upon his return today  from Buenos Aires where he met his Argentine counterpart,  Fernando Petrella, Chilean Foreign Relations Under Secretary  Jose Miguel Insulza noted the number of similar viewpoints  shared by Chile and Argentina regarding bilateral and  multilateral issues.    Insulza stated that in the multilateral field the two  countries share very similar viewpoints regarding the problem in  Haiti, the hemispheric summit in Miami called by U.S. President  Bill Clinton, and the upcoming OAS meeting.    Regarding the Haitian crisis, the Chilean Foreign Ministry  stated that it recognizes the constitutional Haitian Government  headed by President Jean Bertrand Aristides and recognizes as  its representative the current charge d'affaires in Santiago,  Guy Pierre Andre, who this week publicly repudiated the new de  facto government installed by the coupist military.    In the bilateral field, Insulza said important progress was  made in this area during his visit to Buenos Aires and that the  Argentine Government has voiced its interest in Chile's  expressed desire to seek a commercial agreement with the Common  Market of the South (Mercosur).    The Chilean under secretary, who did not rule out the  possibility that Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa will  make a proposal in this regard during his visit to Buenos Aires  on 8 June, said: "The Argentine representatives expressed full  support for the Chilean desire and we hope to reach an agreement  in the next few days."    Moreover, Jose Miguel Insulza announced that in view of the  next meeting Presidents Carlos Menem and Eduardo Frei will hold  in Santiago in August, it has been agreed to establish a joint  committee that will be in charge of assessing the legal and  bureaucratic obstacles that still hinder the fulfillment of  previous agreements, especially in the commercial field.    Insulza added that the presidents believe the agreements  already signed by the two countries are enough for an important  and deep-rooted binational integration process and that the  problem boils down to bureaucratic and legal obstacles in the  two countries that prevent them from working in a more efficient  manner.</p>

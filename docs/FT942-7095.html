			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Balladur and Kohl call for wider Euro-summits Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday proposed that leaders of east European countries, once they have applied to join the European Union, should hold a joint summit with their EU counterparts once a year, writes David Buchan. The proposal, contained in a jointly signed article in yesterday's Le Monde newspaper, was timed to coincide with the opening in Paris yesterday of the French-sponsored 'conference on stability in Europe' and to identify Germany closely with it. The need for wider annual European summits and the stability conference initiative stem, according to the two men, from 'a realisation that political stability is an essential condition for economic and social progress' in eastern Europe. 'What would be the value of the free trade and association agreements with central and eastern Europe, even their future membership of the European Union, if serious political crises, notably provoked by frontier and minority problems, were to put this progress in question?' ask the two leaders.</p>

			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Mission unpopular: The performance of the agency charged with privatising east German industry Eggs have often been pelted at the Berlin headquarters of the Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising east German industry. Earlier this month angry workers from the potash mines in Thuringia arrived in Leipziger Street, where the Treuhand is based. Throughout the hot afternoon, they shouted abuse at the agency's employees, threw eggs at the windows, and scattered potash on the pavements. It was a reminder that of all the institutions set up in east Germany after unification, the Treuhand is not only one of the most well known. It is also the most hated. This is because it has completely restructured east German industry in accordance with the mandate granted by the government in 1990 after reunification. The result has been high unemployment. Of the 4m workers in the 13,000 companies placed under the Treuhand, only 1.4m now have jobs. By the end of last year, the Treuhand had started closing down 2,200 companies. Mr Hero Brahms, vice-president of the Treuhand, said there was no choice. 'I know we are a shield for the politicians in Bonn. We will be blamed for the unemployment in eastern Germany,' he said. 'But if you look at the Treuhand's role, it was set up not only to privatise. We had to find solutions for all our companies.' Nearly 11,000 of the Treuhand's 13,000 companies have been dealt with since 1991, mostly through privatisation, which has brought in a total of DM40bn (Pounds 16.2bn) - lower than expected. However, the agency has received investment commitments totalling DM170bn, which will guarantee the 1.4m jobs. Mr Brahms believes the Treuhand has accomplished the tough part of its task. Between now and the end of next year, when it is wound up, fewer than 1,000 companies, which employ 210,000, are left to be privatised. 'Eight hundred of these companies have fewer than 100 employees each. These will not be too hard to privatise,' Mr Brahms said. Among the 1,000, there will, however, be some from heavy industry, such as mining operations and engine makers, which are difficult to break up and sell as smaller units. The Treuhand has set up five management companies, run by west Germans, each of whom will supervise about 15 of these heavy industrial companies. Over the next three or four years, they will restructure them with the aim of selling them off. It is not just industrial concerns that have proved difficult to sell. The entire privatisation process has been complicated. One of the problems the Treuhand faced in the early days was that it was working in a vacuum. Germany chose not to use any of its neighbouring east European countries as a model - it ruled out the Hungarian system of small-scale privatisation, by-passed the Czech voucher scheme system of employee shares, and resisted the Polish or Russian method of leaving big enterprises intact until the end of the privatisation proceedings. Instead, it chose to privatise from 'the top down'. Having made the decision, the government simply put everything up for sale. 'It is academic whether the Treuhand could have done it differently,' said Mr Thomas Mayer, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank. 'I was highly critical of this method of privatisation in the early days. But it has done a fairly good job in a short space of time.' Mr Mayer admitted that the cost of privatising east German industry had been higher than expected. Initial estimates for taking over the bad debts of the region's enterprises totalled DM70bn. This increased to DM92bn after reunification and monetary union between the former west and east Germanys. A further DM160bn was earmarked for the Treuhand for investment and restructuring costs. Now, the total debt of the companies for sale is likely to exceed DM270bn, instead of DM252bn, because of rising labour costs. In addition, the falling value of obsolete plant has limited the receipts from privatisations. A further political development which has had a negative effect on the companies' purchase prices has been the breakdown of the Soviet and east European markets. When west German and foreign companies entered east Germany it was initially with the hope that a stepping stone would be provided to markets in the east. That hope has evaporated. 'Expectations (among investors) were high in 1991 because eastern Germany still had markets,' said Mr Brahms. Russia, for example, was absorbing about 70 per cent of east German exports. But following the collapse of Comecon, the former Soviet trading bloc, trade is down to virtually zero. 'This affected the large enterprises. Their market disappeared overnight,' said Mr Brahms. 'Investors were hit as well because some of their early concepts were clearly designed for having a new, additional export market for eastern Europe.' Despite the collapse of markets in the east, the Treuhand managed to find buyers for thousands of east German companies - mostly from west Germany. Critics of the agency accuse it of having an in-built bias towards west German industry and west German managers. There is a widespread perception that west German companies rushed in and took over the most potentially viable businesses, such as insurance companies and chemicals companies, to protect their markets and keep out foreign competitors. Mr Brahms and his colleagues dismiss such charges. 'Our foreign friends have always said: 'East Germany for the West Germans'. The real story is that not only did the west Germans know more about east Germany - and knew the langauge. But they were more prepared to cope with uncertainties, particularly property rights, which were very shaky in 1991,' he said. 'However, we were determined to attract foreign investors as a means of creating more competition. Look how the French Elf petrol stations managed to set up here.' However, by the end of this February, only 577 companies had been bought by foreigners, about 10 per cent of the total. France, which has invested DM4.8bn, headed the list, followed by the US, Canada and Britain. Mr Helmut Ballon, the director of the Treuhand responsible for mining privatisations, said he and his colleagues had not shied away from seeking foreign investors. He is active in selling east Germany's lignite mines to an Anglo-American consortium headed by Britain's PowerGen and NRG of the US. But he agreed that it was extremely difficult, in the early days, to increase the flow of foreign investment. There were no proper marketing or accounting procedures, for instance. 'We lacked basic information about what we were selling. Until about spring of 1991, we could not even describe accurately what the companies did.' Other Treuhand officials suggest that even if west German companies have acquired the largest slice of east German industry, fears that they would close factories to prevent competition have not materialised. 'We never privatised with the aim of closing down,' explained Mr Frederick Fucci, from the Treuhand's investor relations department. 'Indeed, all the contracts are anchored on three principles.' First, investors had to commit themselves to a certain level of funding over a set period; second, they must set up a regional office in eastern Germany; third, they must guarantee a fixed number of jobs for a specified periods, depending on the contract. So while short-term guarantees are in place and provide a measure of confidence, the long-term outlook is less certain. The success of the Treuhand will ultimately be gauged by the ability of the privatised companies to compete. But the collapse of their traditional east European markets together with the west European recession is likely to delay the improvement of conditions in the east German economy. According to a recent Deutsche Bank report, average operating losses last year in privatised east German enterprises amounted to 20 per cent of total turnover. But Treuhand officials remain optimistic. Mr Brahms said: 'Every investor knew they were investing in an economy with rising wages, which demanded sophisticated strategies. With such strategies, eastern Germany should reach a higher standard faster than the other east European countries. It will take time. But I am convinced there was no other solution.'</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Tabacalera considers sale of food unit to Nabisco TABACALERA, Spain's state-controlled tobacco company, is negotiating the sale of Royal Brands, its food and agribusiness division, to RJR Nabisco in a move which may foreshadow the US multinational's return to the European food sector. Tabacalera said Nabisco had made a firm offer of Pta17bn (Dollars 147m) for 50 per cent of Royal Brands. Tabacalera had suggested it buy the food division outright. Nabisco would not confirm this, though company executives were in Madrid yesterday to examine Royal Brands. But Tabacalera said there were other potential buyers for the food division. One was United Biscuits of Britain, which recently formed a joint sales company with Royal Brands in Spain anddelivered a letter of intent three months ago expressing interest in the company. UB said it had learned of Nabisco's approach on Tuesday and would be interested in buying Royal Brands' biscuit interests. These include Spain's leading biscuit brands and represent about 40 per cent of Royal Brands' sales, which also cover baking products, desserts and fruit juices. Royal Brands reported profits of Pta2.7bn last year on sales of Pta27bn. Nabisco's interest in re-entering European food manufacturing surprised industry observers. The company sold its extensive operations in the late 1980s to pay off debts used to finance a leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street investment firm. Tabacalera spent Pta53bn on some Nabisco units which now form the core of Royal Brands. Some analysts and food industry executives said buying Royal Brands would only make commercial sense if Nabisco planned to assemble a Europe-wide food business through further acquisitions. However, the cost would be high and was likely to exceed the near-term resources of Nabisco, which still has outstanding debts of about Dollars 14bn. Equally surprising is Tabacalera's decision to sell at a time when Royal Brands is becoming a steady revenue earner and emblem of the state conglomerate's attempt to diversify away from its core tobacco business. Analysts said one motive could be to build a war chest to finance a bid for Ebro, the domestic sugar and rice producer being sold by Grupo Torras, the troubled investment arm of the Kuwait Investment Office.</p>

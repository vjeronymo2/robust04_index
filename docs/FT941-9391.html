			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Time to capitalise on a classy set of connections Whom you know is very important in the French corporate scene and there can be few people better connected than Mr Jacques Friedmann. Mr Friedmann, 61, is a former chairman of Air France and a close friend of both favourites for the conservative candidacy in next year's presidential elections, Mr Jacques Chirac, mayor of Paris, and Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister. Yet he will need all his valuable contacts in his new role as chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the next company to be sold in the French privatisation drive. The completion of the sale of the government's stake in Elf Aquitaine, the oil group, clears the decks for the sale of the state's 50 per cent UAP holding, which could be worth FFr25bn-FFr28bn. Mr Friedmann, after only three months at UAP, faces the challenge of steering France's largest insurer and biggest institutional investor into the private sector. He is adamant that it is ready for sale. 'Of course we're ready,' he said in an interview with the FT at his elegant office at UAP's headquarters on Place Vendome in Paris. 'Is there any reason why we shouldn't be?' The analysts who follow UAP are less enthusiastic. Its net profits fell from a peak of FFr4.2bn in 1990 to FFr1.08bn in 1992. Mr Friedmann recently warned that it only managed a modest recovery to FFr1.5bn in 1993. Banque Worms, its troubled banking subsidiary, is still in the red. The French insurance market is still beset by recession. UAP, like other state controlled insurers, is burdened by heavy overheads. It also has to digest its latest acquisition - a controlling stake in Colonia, the big but battered German insurer. 'What we really want is firm evidence that UAP is tackling its long-term profitability problem, and that will involve some difficult decisions about costs,' said one analyst. 'It also needs a clear international strategy. It's all very well buying businesses, but it has to prove it can run them.' Mr Friedmann insists that UAP will deliver on both counts. One of his priorities is to modernise the huge domestic network. He does not, however, envisage doing so by shedding staff. Instead he hopes to improve productivity through investment in technology and by drumming up new business. Where does he expect to find new business in the intensely competitive French insurance market? 'From the reform of the state pension and health insurance systems,' he replied. 'These reforms will create huge new markets and the big insurers like UAP are best placed to benefit.' How can he hope to compete against the UK and US insurers, which have had more experience in the pensions sphere and see it as an entree into the French market? 'We have excellent contacts with large French companies. They've been coming to us for years for big commercial policies and they'll come for their employee pension plans.' On the international front Mr Friedmann plans to expand UAP's activities outside Europe, which now account for just 3 per cent of turnover. 'There are lots of markets, particularly in Asia, that are only just opening up,' said Mr Friedmann, who recently acted as Mr Balladur's intermediary in a successful effort to reopen commercial relations with China. His plans for expansion in Europe are more modest. UAP is interested in acquiring a damage insurer in the UK, although he declined to comment on speculation about talks to acquire The Provincial. In the meantime he plans to restructure UAP's European network, which includes Royal Belge in Belgium and Sun Life in the UK as well as Colonia.</p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Unit trust funds at record UNIT TRUST sales in March reached their highest level since the 1987 stock market crash with funds under management reaching a record Pounds 70.7bn. The UK's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism has led to falling interest rates and increased share prices over the past six months. That has attracted savers away from the building societies and into equity-based investments. Unit trusts have reaped the benefit. Gross sales in March were Pounds 1.75bn, the second-highest monthly total. After repurchases from investors of Pounds 1.03bn, net sales were Pounds 719m. About half of the gross sales came from private investors, the rest from institutions. Funds in the UK growth and UK equity income sectors achieved the best growth and net sales during the month.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar in Rising Sun's shadow THE YEN reached a new high against the dollar yesterday as dealers predicted that the US currency would fall to Y100 before there was any significant turnround, writes Peter John. The dollar was traded down to Y106.55 in early London trading, with the Japanese Ministry of Finance reported to be advising against any assistance, arguing that it would be ineffective. Some dealers also cited comments from a former Bank of Japan official that an interest rate shift would not be considered until the yen moved below Y100 to the dollar. Nevertheless, foreign exchange dealers reported modest intervention by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, 'not so much to stem the rise but smooth its progress'. Additionally, there was a correction as the emphasis shifted from both currencies towards the D-Mark following comments by the Bundesbank last week suggesting that German interest rates might not fall as fast as expected. Finally, the dollar received some support from the latest data published by the National Association of Purchasing Managers yesterday. The yen closed unchanged at Y107.20 against the US currency. In New York the dollar finished trading at Y107.02. Sterling also attracted attention as speculation of a reduction of  1/2 percentage point in UK interest rates returned. The belief was strongest in the short sterling market but there was a general swing to the argument that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, might demonstrate his independence by making a further cut in the next few months. The pound slid steadily throughout the day against the D-Mark, ending at DM2.4700, down from DM2.4775. It also weakened against the dollar, closing a cent lower in London at Dollars 1.5510. On the sidelines, there was some slight relief for the French franc as the market discussed the potential outcome of a two-day meeting between Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, and Chancellor Kohl, of Germany. The gains were helped by an announcement that the French intervention rate had been maintained at 7.5 per cent. But that was countered by talk that Mr Balladur was poised to make comments in the French press about the current competitiveness of the franc. The currency's very narrow room for manoeuvre with the D-Mark and consequently for an interest rate cut means that France could be forced to devalue. The franc firmed to FFr3.3760 against the D-Mark from FFr3.3770. The Spanish peseta recovered slightly, although it continued to be a nervous market ahead of Sunday's general election. The currency improved to Pta78.91 against the D-Mark from Pta79.10, but dealers believe that Spain's current interest rates are unsustainable and the currency will remain under pressure.</p>

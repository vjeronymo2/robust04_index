			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Sharelink Pounds 468,000 in the red and trading 'very poor' Sharelink Investment Services, the Birmingham-based share dealing company, continues to lose money on its current trading. For the half year to September 30, it announced yesterday a pre-tax loss of Pounds 468,000, compared with profits of Pounds 3.68m - this result was foreshadowed in the warning of late September. The shares shed 7p to close at 176p. But Sharelink also announced that it 'was trading below break even in October,' and Mr David Jones, the chief executive and biggest single shareholder, said present trading is 'very poor.' This, he added, made him 'cautious about the year end result.' First half turnover was down to Pounds 7.28m, against Pounds 11.25m last time when business was boosted by BT privatisation. Loss per share was 1.79p, against earnings of 16.07p, but Sharelink is maintaining its interim dividend at 3p. Sharelink's basic problem is the low level of dealing volume on the UK stock market. But its financial results have also been affected by investment of Pounds 700,000, during the first half, on the development of more efficient operating systems and the introduction of new financial management products. Investment spending in the second half will be Pounds 600,000. Sharelink hopes to protect itself against market fluctuations by reducing costs and bringing in a stream of fixed revenue from new products.</p>

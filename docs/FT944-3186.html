			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: Profits surge 63% at Degussa with boost from metals Degussa, the chemicals and metals group, is to raise its dividend from DM7 to DM10 following a 63 per cent surge in pre-tax profits to DM280m (Dollars 178m) in the year to the end of September, writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt. Results improved in all operational sectors, most notably in metals which benefited from the disposal of the Leybold subsidiary to Oerlikon Buhrle of Zurich, and returned to operating profit after heavy losses in the 1992-93 financial year. The sale led to a 7 per cent fall in group turnover to DM13.8bn, which, after excluding precious metals trading, translated into a 4 per cent gain on a like for like basis, the company said in a letter to shareholders.</p>

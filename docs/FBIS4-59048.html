			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by "a military spokesman" at the Ministry of </F> Defense and General Command Staff; date not given -- read by  announcer]    [Text] Subsequent to our statement yesterday, with  success granted by God, and with the courage of the brave men in  our valiant Armed Forces -- the forces of unity and  constitutional legitimacy -- our valiant Armed Forces in the  southwestern sector last night completely destroyed the units of  the (?Labudhah) Brigade camp and all of its fortifications and  seized what remained of its weapons and equipment. A tank  battalion and a BMP [Infantry Fighting Vehicle] company  surrendered and joined the forces of constitutional legitimacy  and the protection of Yemeni unity.    During the fierce battles on that axis, the aircraft of the  rebellious secessionist gang made futile suicidal raids on our  combat units and the city of al-Rahidah. The valiant  anti-aircraft units confronted them and forced them to flee  after downing two Sukhoi aircraft.    The heroic men in our glorious Armed Forces are continuing  their heroic acts and destroying the dens and fortresses of the  forces of apostasy and secession, so the homeland of September  and October will remain glorious and united with its  constitutional agencies and its legitimate leadership, and with  the cohesion of all members of the society in this glorious  trench, the trench of freedom and justice, the trench of unity,  democracy, progress, and prosperity.</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> DYAL GAMBLE COMES UP SNAKE-EYES  </P> <P> The Raiders lost a calculated gamble when they used their last free roster move  to activate tight end Mike Dyal against Denver. It was learned Monday that Dyal  had re-injured his hamstring and would be out for an extended period.  </P> <P> "It's pretty serious," Coach Art Shell said.  </P> <P> Shell said Dyal was injured on Bo Jackson's 62-yard scoring run. Until his  activation Sunday, Dyal had been on injured reserve since Week 2 with a  hamstring injury.  </P> <P> The Raiders haven't decided whether to place Dyal on injured reserve again or  wait out his injury in the chance he'll be better by the playoffs.  </P> <P> In effect, the Raiders wasted their last roster move and now cannot activate  Greg Bell from injured reserve should either Jackson or Marcus Allen be  injured.  </P> <P> The Raiders probably will re-sign tight end Rich Bartlewski to replace Dyal.  </P> <P> Nose tackle Bob Golic is apparently OK after injuring his right knee late in  Sunday's game. Golic said it was an aggravation of an old injury.  </P> <P> "Golic gets banged up quite a bit," Shell said, "but he bounces right back."  CHRIS DUFRESNE  </P></p>

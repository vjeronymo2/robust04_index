			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / The old Italian way to pacify Ireland: Max Wilkinson considers a 16th century solution to the long-running conflict I dreamed a dream of how to end the killing in Northern Ireland. No matter. John Major is also sleepwalking: uncertain from one day to the next whether he is talking to the bosses of the terrorists. And Gerry Adams is far away in the land of nod if he thinks that easy victories on American TV can sanctify murder or disguise the growing ascendancy of protestant gunmen. Let us hope that both are dancing to a tune we cannot hear and that Ireland will one day awaken to its harmony. Meanwhile, here is a different dream. It begins with the ghost of Machiavelli, asking briskly: 'Why do you English stay in Northern Ireland: for profit, sentiment, for glory or because you fear the contagion of a religious war? Which side do you support? If neither, why do you give them both money?' The spirit of that prince of civil servants began to fade. 'Stay,' I cried. 'Everyone except our government knows that these are the right questions. But how shall we answer?' He returned into focus, with the sardonic smile which so irritated Lorenzo de' Medici. 'I have written,' he replied, 'That a foreign power cannot succeed by generosity alone; for the people's gratitude is fickle. A liberal rule must be tempered by severity. Hannibal, for example, avoided insurrection because his fine qualities included extreme brutality . . .' 'No doubt, no doubt' I said, 'But we abandoned even the mildest torture decades ago after The Sunday Times discovered that prisoners were being made to stand against a wall . . .Yes, we have tried locking up all suspects, including the innocent. But as you said in 1513, that sort of thing foments unrest.' 'And you no longer exact tribute from their lands,' he mused. 'No,' I replied. 'English settlers were once rapacious. There was hunger and oppression. But now the province is part of our kingdom, just like Kent or Wales. The people there get the same benefits as in Great Britain even though they generate less wealth.' 'So you must pay . . ' 'Yes, Pounds 3,200m a year, plus another Pounds 400m for an army to stop them killing each other. That is about Pounds 43 a week per head.' Machiavelli looked puzzled, so I explained: 'We give every person in Northern Ireland the equivalent of a 20kg sack of silver each year.' His lip curled: 'You are much loved for this?' 'No. Powerful Americans believe the Irish are still enslaved and send them money for explosives. The Irish think state benefits are theirs by right (as people do in England). The protestants fear we will take away their privileges, and the catholics grumble because so many cannot find work. 'You pay them even if they do not work?' 'Of course. Especially if they do not work.' 'Including the terrorists?' 'Perhaps, if they have no work.' 'Few successful rulers have paid rebels who kill their own soldiers,' he said. 'But we are a democracy.' 'Nevertheless, your rulers must force both sides to understand how much is being paid and exact conditions for the money. This cannot be done, you agree, so long as Northern Ireland is treated like your Kent. Perhaps the province could be given a kind of independence. The protestants should then be warned that the grant will be cut unless they behave, and the catholics would see that if they were to join the Republic they would be very much poorer.' 'We tried this.' 'You must be more ruthless. And this time get rid of the terrorists. Kill or imprison all that you prudently can. Bribe the rest. Give very large bribes to the leaders; then they will control their comrades and inform on any who break ranks. This will be much cheaper than paying Pounds 400m to your soldiers. Of course these payments must be disguised: perhaps as a rehabilitation fund run by Norwegians.' 'But this is totally unacceptable.' 'Then keep your dreams,' he said and faded into the dawn.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: TURKEY ENTREES PROVIDE LOW-FAT FOUNDATION FOR 7-DAY  DIET PACKAGE  </P> <P> Dieting? Who isn't these days. If a week's worth of diet menus would be a  welcome reprieve for day-to-day planning, calculating and measuring regime,  read on.  </P> <P> The following diet was developed with the help of a registered dietitian. It  contains a seven-day weight-loss plan, designed by Dr. Joan Walsh, director of  Western Nutritional Services, including delicious meals and easy recipes. It  provides all the instructions, daily menus and recipes so you can clip it out  and hang it on the refrigerator for quick reference.  </P> <P> The plan is built around a foundation of turkey entrees, since turkey is one  source of protein that is naturally low in fat. Each dish may be accompanied by  a serving of carbohydrate, vegetable or one cup of skim milk (except where  milk, vegetable and carbohydrate are combined in the dinner entree such as soup  or pasta dish).  </P> <P> In most cases, you will need to meet the carbohydrate serving for each dinner  menu by selecting either one-half cup brown rice, one corn muffin, one small  boiled potato with one teaspoon margarine, or one cranberry-bran muffin as a  side dish.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vegetable Serving  </P> <P> The vegetable serving each day might be chosen from one of these: one cup  cooked crookneck squash, three-quarters cup glazed carrots, sliced tomato and  cucumber salad, romaine lettuce salad with one tablespoon reduced-calorie  dressing, fresh spinach and mushroom salad with one tablespoon reduced-calorie  dressing or one cup steamed broccoli.  </P> <P> In addition to dinner menus, there are suggestions for breakfast and lunch that  make them quite simple.  </P> <P> But it's not a diet without rules. Here are some tips offered by Walsh:  </P> <P> This basic diet is designed to supply about 1,200 calories per day, so be  careful not to add extra calories with items such as butter, margarine, oil or  salad dressing. Follow the meal plans and recipes as closely as possible,  measuring portions carefully.  </P> <P> When no beverage is specified, include a non-caloric beverage such as coffee,  tea, diet soda or water. Do not drink milk or juices except where suggested.  </P> <P> Reduce the recipes if cooking for fewer than the specified number of servings.  Or cook the full meal and freeze half for later.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Exercise Weekly  </P> <P> Exercise continuously for 15 to 60 minutes three to five days during the week.  </P> <P> If you're still hungry, choose one serving from the following list of extras.  This will add about 100 more calories to the day: one-half cantaloupe; one  muffin; one banana or apple; one peach; one cup grapes; one slice bread with  one teaspoon margarine; two medium or three small cookies; one-half cup sherbet  or ice milk; one ounce hard cheese; one slice bread with one slice turkey ham;  one cup puffed wheat cereal with one-half cup nonfat milk; two cups popcorn  with two teaspoons melted margarine; one cup orange juice; one-half carton  fruit flavored yogurt; one-half cup gelatin; one (4-ounce) glass red, white or  rose wine, or one (12-ounce) can light beer.  </P> <P> Keep in mind that as with any diet, you won't become slender overnight. It is,  however, possible to lose two pounds per week, the amount that nutritionists  believe is safe, according to Walsh.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 7-DAY TURKEY DIETDAY 1  </P> <P> BREAKFAST  </P> <P> 1 cup grapefruit juice  </P> <P> 1 poached or boiled egg  </P> <P> 2 slices whole-wheat toast with 2 teaspoons margarine  </P> <P> LUNCH  </P> <P> 1 slice wheat bread  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon peanut butter  </P> <P> 1 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> 1 fresh pear  </P> <P> DINNER  </P> <P> Turkey-Cracked Wheat Salad  </P> <P> Romaine lettuce  </P> <P> 1 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> DAY 2  </P> <P> BREAKFAST  </P> <P> 1/2 cup pineapple juice  </P> <P> 3/4 cup cooked oatmeal  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons raisins  </P> <P> 1/4 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> 1 slice whole-wheat toast  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon margarine  </P> <P> LUNCH  </P> <P> 1 cup plain low-fat yogurt  </P> <P> 1/2 cup peaches, packed in juice  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons wheat germ  </P> <P> 1 rice cake or other low-fat cracker  </P> <P> DINNER  </P> <P> Poached Turkey Tenderloins With Tarragon Sauce  </P> <P> 1 small boiled potato  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon margarine  </P> <P> 1/2 cup cooked spinach  </P> <P> 1 Cranberry-Bran Muffin  </P> <P> DAY 3  </P> <P> BREAKFAST  </P> <P> 1/2 cup orange juice  </P> <P> 2 Cranberry-Bran Muffins  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons margarine  </P> <P> 1 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> LUNCH  </P> <P> 1 slice whole-wheat bread  </P> <P> 1 ounce turkey ham  </P> <P> 1 ounce mozzarella cheese  </P> <P> Green pepper rings  </P> <P> 1 apple  </P> <P> DINNER  </P> <P> Turkey-Rice Hash  </P> <P> Green salad with 2 tablespoons kidney beans, chopped red cabbage, 1 ounce  mozzarella cheese cubes  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon reduced calorie dressing  </P> <P> 1 Cranberry-Bran Muffin  </P> <P> DAY 4  </P> <P> BREAKFAST  </P> <P> 1 cup orange juice  </P> <P> 3/4 cup raisin bran cereal  </P> <P> 1/2 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> 1 slice whole-wheat toast  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons jelly  </P> <P> LUNCH  </P> <P> 1/2 cup low-fat cottage cheese  </P> <P> 1/4 cup chopped vegetables  </P> <P> 1 large rye cracker  </P> <P> 1 banana  </P> <P> DINNER  </P> <P> West Coast Chili  </P> <P> 1 corn muffin  </P> <P> Spinach and mushroom salad  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon reduced calorie dressing  </P> <P> 1 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> DAY 5  </P> <P> BREAKFAST  </P> <P> 3/4 cup bran flakes cereal  </P> <P> 1/2 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> 1/2 banana  </P> <P> 1 corn muffin  </P> <P> LUNCH  </P> <P> 1 cup leftover West Coast Chili  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese  </P> <P> 1 orange  </P> <P> DINNER  </P> <P> Turkey-Pasta Plenty  </P> <P> Sliced tomato and cucumber salad  </P> <P> 1 Baked Apple  </P> <P> DAY 6  </P> <P> BREAKFAST  </P> <P> 1 cup grapefruit juice  </P> <P> Western Omelet  </P> <P> 1 slice whole-wheat toast  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon margarine  </P> <P> LUNCH  </P> <P> 1 cup lentil soup  </P> <P> 1 small whole-wheat roll  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon margarine  </P> <P> 1 apple  </P> <P> DINNER  </P> <P> Scaloppine Turkey Slices  </P> <P> 1/2 cup cooked fine noodles  </P> <P> 1 cup cooked crookneck squash  </P> <P> 1 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> DAY 7  </P> <P> BREAKFAST  </P> <P> 1/2 cup pineapple juice  </P> <P> 3/4 cup cooked cream-of-wheat cereal  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons raisins  </P> <P> 1/4 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> 1/2 toasted English muffin  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon jelly  </P> <P> LUNCH  </P> <P> 1 Quesadilla  </P> <P> Fruit cup: 1/3 cup crushed pineapple and 1/3 cup cubed apple  </P> <P> DINNER  </P> <P> Layered Salad Vinaigrette  </P> <P> 1 small whole-wheat roll  </P> <P> 1 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon margarine  </P> <P> TURKEY-CRACKED WHEAT SALAD  </P> <P> 1 cup cracked wheat (bulgur)  </P> <P> 2 cups boiling water  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons lemon juice  </P> <P> 1/2 cup prepared mincemeat  </P> <P> 1 cup cooked turkey, cut into small pieces  </P> <P> 1 cup diced pear or jicama  </P> <P> 12 cherry tomatoes, cut in half  </P> <P> 1/2 cup small black olives  </P> <P> 3/4 cup reduced calorie French, Italian or vinaigrette dressing  </P> <P> Romaine lettuce leaves  </P> <P> Pear slices  </P> <P> Simmer bulgur in boiling water in covered saucepan 10 minutes.

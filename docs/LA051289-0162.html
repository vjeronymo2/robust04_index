La  Palma Ave.  </P> <P> The fourth was Costa Mesa's Seaview West Business Park, 930 W. 16th St.  </P> <P> The acquisition means Hanover -- an investment arm of Delaware's Hanover  Acceptances -- now owns nearly 1 million square feet of industrial space worth  $78 million in Orange County, most of it in Anaheim.  </P> <P> Altogether the firm's real estate investments total $230 million nationwide.  </P> <P> The firm likes Anaheim because of the proximity of freeways and its  "competitive land prices," said C. Dennis Abramson, managing general partner of  Hanover Associates and a former shopping mall designer.  </P></p>

"My decision on participation in early presidential  elections  depends on many factors", he told reporters on Friday.    "First and foremost we have to elect a new parliament and  appoint a new Cabinet of Ministers", he stressed and added that  any candidate for the presidency "should know his future powers"  before joining the election campaign.    "At present they (the powers) have not been determined. If  the new president is elected according to the acting  constitution, the new parliament is sure to raise the question  about the powers of the president, the Supreme Soviet and the  government. The powers of local heads of administrations have  not been determined either", he said.</p>

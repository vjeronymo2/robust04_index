			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 6 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia and  Cambodia will set up a joint commission to promote  reconstruction in the Indochinese country.    Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, was announced this  yesterday, said the commission was suggested by Cambodian Deputy  Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut at their one-hour meeting  at the Foreign Ministry here.    Cambodia wanted to tap Malaysia's experience and expertise  in  agriculture, tourism, extraction of Minerals and petroleum,  logging and manpower training, he told reporters after the  meeting.    Abdullah said Cambodia also requested Malaysia's help to  attract foreign investment.    He said the Malaysian Industrial Development Authority was  the most suitable agency to explain Malaysia's investment  strategy to the Investment Council of Cambodia.    The Malaysian Economic Planning Unit might also help the  Cambodian Development Council on development strategies, he said.    Abdullah also said Malaysia would support Cambodia's  participation as an observer in July's ASEAN foreign ministers  meeting and the post-ministerial conference in Bangkok as well  as the ASEAN regional security forum.    He did not expect any objection from other ASEAN member  countries since ASEAN had played a role in bringing peace to  Cambodia.    As such, Cambodia's participation in regional conferences  should be welcomed, he added.</p>

Since the Department notifies all lenders of the HEAL interest rate at the beginning of each quarter, and since students and schools can contact either the Department or a HEAL lender for information on the HEAL interest rate, the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice is no longer necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 60.14&blank;The Insurance Premium <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is proposing to change the heading of this section to ``Risk-based insurance premiums.'' The section would be amended to reflect the new statutory provisions for determining borrower and school insurance premiums and to include the proposed lender and holder premiums. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(1) of this section would be redesignated as paragraph (a), and would be amended to state that a risk-based insurance premium is charged to the borrower, school, lender, and holder, in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reference in paragraph (a)(1) to the date that the premium is due to the Secretary would be moved to newly designated paragraph (c), described below, which would address procedures for collecting insurance premiums. In addition, existing paragraphs (a)(2) through (5), which also deal with the collection of the insurance premiums, would be moved to newly designated paragraph (c) and amended as described below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b), which addresses the insurance premium rate, would be amended to reflect the various insurance premium rates for borrowers, schools, lenders, and holders. Paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) would set forth the statutory insurance premium rates that apply to borrowers and schools, including the borrower's option to reduce the insurance premium by 50 percent by obtaining a credit worthy cosigner, and the 3-year special consideration provided for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) also would include clarification of the statutory provision which provides special consideration in determining the borrower and school insurance premium rate for schools with a low volume of HEAL loan activity. Under this proposal, any school which, for purposes of the default rate calculation, has made a total of 50 or less loans would be placed in the low-risk category, regardless of its default rate. In establishing the low volume threshold, the Department first considered the Conference report language accompanying Public Law 102&hyph;408, which states the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ``The Secretary may grant an institution a wavier of the requirements of the risk categories only if the Secretary determines that the default rate is not an accurate indicator because the volume of loans has been insufficient. For example, some schools of public health may have default rates that exceed 30%. However, since these default rates are based on a small number of loans (in some cases, only two to five loans) they may be a misleading measure of the institution's ability to control defaults.'' (Conference Report 102&hyph;925, p.111) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It seems apparent from this language that the Congress, while not defining ``low volume,'' intended for this exclusion to be limited to schools with a small amount of HEAL activity. The Department next considered the Department of Education's (ED) low-volume threshold for default penalties. ED uses a threshold of 30 loans for determining whether schools are subject to modified procedures for determining default rates. However, the ED procedures involve a comparison of data over a 3-year period for low volume entities, whereas the HEAL statute requires that any entity not meeting the low volume exclusion be subject to the same default formula applied to high volume entities. As a result, the Department determined that it would be most equitable to allow a higher threshold for the HEAL ``low volume'' definition. At the same time, given the Conference report language, the Department could not justify a level that would be so high as to reduce the effectiveness of the performance standard requirements. Further analysis of HEAL school data supported a threshold of 50 loans, since this level resulted in 34.6% of HEAL schools, representing only 1.3% of HEAL loans in repayment, being excluded from the performance standard penalties during Fiscal Year 1993. Based on the above, the Department considers a threshold of 50 loans to be more than adequate to prevent unfair penalties being imposed on schools with a small volume of HEAL activity, while at the same time assuring that this exemption is not so lenient as to make the performance standard requirements meaningless. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) would describe the proposed insurance premium rates for lenders and holders. The proposed rates for lenders included in paragraph (b)(3) would be as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Low-risk:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A lender with a default rate of not to exceed 5 percent would not be required to pay an insurance premium. In addition, a lender whose volume of HEAL loans made (for purposes of the default rate calculation) is 50 or less, would not be required to pay an insurance premium. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

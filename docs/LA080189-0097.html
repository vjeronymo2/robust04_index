			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GROUP CIRCULATES RECALL PETITIONS AGAINST BERNSON  </P> <P> Proponents of a fledgling recall drive against Los Angeles City Councilman Hal  Bernson began circulating petitions last weekend in their attempt to gather  more than 17,000 signatures from registered voters in the 12th Council  District.  </P> <P> A Northridge businessman angry over a redevelopment proposal that would affect  his property holdings initiated the drive. Walter N. Prince and his supporters,  who he says number more than 100, have until Nov. 20 to gather the signatures  of 15% of the registered voters in the district.  </P> <P> If the signatures are validated by the Los Angeles City Clerk, Bernson would be  forced into a recall election. Prince said volunteers of the group called CURB,  for Citizens Unite to Recall Bernson, are displeased with the councilman's  order to study placing a Northridge industrial area near Parthenia Street and  Tampa Avenue.  </P> <P> In a rebuttal published as part of the petition, Bernson called the drive a  "mean-spirited" effort by special interests in favor of mini-mall developments  and adult bookstores. The rebuttal was co-signed by Los Angeles Police Chief  Daryl Gates, local clergy and homeowner leaders.  </P></p>

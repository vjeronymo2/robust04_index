			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / US Money and Credit: Economic data point to modest growth IT WAS a week which began with inflation jitters, yet ended with a bond market rally. What came in between was a series of economic indicators, generally confirming a 'modest growth' scenario. The inflationary worries owed more to external events than domestic matters. Reports of Saudi Arabia's change in oil pricing policy sent crude prices higher and the bond market into hasty decline. Its retreat was then aided by two relatively buoyant sets of statistics: the monthly Conference Board survey showed that consumer confidence improved significantly in May, the third straight month that progress had been seen, while car sales also showed some incipient recovery. So down went the benchmark 30-year long bond, and prices of other fixed-income securities, at both the short and long end of the market, followed suit. The long bond fell by  17/32 to 100 7/8 , on Monday, with the yield rising from 7.82 per cent to 7.91. However matters were not destined to stay this way. Twenty-four hours later, bond investors shrugged off a mixed durable goods report, and by Wednesday they were rapidly reassessing the size of the potential oil price rise. As Bear Sterns noted: 'While it is true that the price of oil has increased from a low of Dollars 18 in February to the current price of Dollars 22, it is still 8 per cent below the previous near-term peak of Dollars 24 in November 1991.' Relatively tight monetary policy, its analysts argue, should limit the future inflationary risk, while longer-term supply-demand factors also argue against a sustained rise in oil prices. A day later, the bond market was focusing on some weak money supply figures  -showing that all three of the most closely tracked money supply measures fell during the week ending May 18 - and largely ignoring a fairly pronounced drop in weekly unemployment claims. This was not entirely quixotic. When the Federal Reserve last eased monetary policy in April, it cited weak money supply growth as a reason. Although some analysts have been sceptical, wondering whether this was really the underlying reason, the bond market has paid increased attention to the money supply numbers ever since. On Friday, there was then the cheering sight of a revised first-quarter gross domestic product number, which showed the economy performing only slightly better than originally suggested. This was in contrast to a previous prediction, by the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, that the revised figures would be 'substantially' higher than first estimates. And, just to round off the market's feeling of relief, the Chicago purchasing managers' survey showed a modest upturn in the manufacturing sector last month, but with the employment component of the index falling from April levels. So, on that relaxed note, the long bond ended the week with another  9/32 gain, at 101 15/32 , to yield 7.83 per cent. Now all eyes are on the May employment report, due out on Friday. If this is truely grim, some pundits suggest that room still exists for a further easing. However, most observers doubt the statistics will be decisive. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, for example, estimates that non-farm payroll employment rose by 110,000 workers in May - slightly less than the 126,000 increase in April. It predicts that the unemployment rate overall should have eased modestly, from 7.2 per cent two months ago, to 7.1 per cent in May.</p>

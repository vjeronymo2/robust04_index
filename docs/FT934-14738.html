			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Audio-visual trade fears 'unfounded' MR Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, yesterday sought to allay the loudly-voiced fears of European broadcasters and film-makers that inclusion of audio-visual services in a world trade agreement would destroy their industry. He said in a statement that the debate on the potential effect on the audio-visual sector of the Uruguay Round global trade talks was proceeding on the basis of 'some serious misunderstandings'. 'The big question is, does anything in the Uruguay Round require that the European market be opened up to such an extent that European - and particularly, non-English-language - film-making will be destroyed? The answer has to be a resounding 'no'.' There was nothing in the proposed services accord that envisaged deregulation, let alone total deregulation, of any sector and there was nothing to prevent governments from subsidising films and other audio-visual projects, he said. Mr Sutherland's unusual intervention reflects Gatt's anxieties that the Uruguay Round services agreement is being inaccurately targeted for criticism in what is essentially a bilateral argument between the US and the European Community. Under the draft services agreement, countries bargain with one another on which sectors they will liberalise and by how much. In these negotiations the US has called for the scrapping of European quotas on foreign broadcasting material and films, which it says unfairly restrict sales by American producers. France and other European nations argue that the quotas are needed to preserve Europe's culture and values from wholesale takeover by Hollywood. The US film and television industry, the country's second biggest export industry after aircraft, has a turnover of about Dollars 40bn (Pounds 26.4bn) a year and represents about 40 per cent of the world market. Exports to the EC amounted to Dollars 3.6bn in 1992, against EC exports to the US market of Dollars 288m, and American films account for over 70 per cent of European box-office takings. France has pressed for audio-visual services to be excluded altogether from any Uruguay Round accord. However, most EC member states and Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's trade commissioner, favour the sector's inclusion with special treatment in recognition of its 'cultural specificity'. Mr Sutherland said yesterday that a general cultural exception had already been considered in the Uruguay Round negotiations and rejected.</p>

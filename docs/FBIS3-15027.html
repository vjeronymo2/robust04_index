			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 01, BNS -- Following is the official  text of Estonian Foreign Ministry's statement from Monday [28  February]:    In response to Russian Foreign Ministry official A.  Udaltsov's announcement that Russia has backed away from the  mutually agreed upon date for final withdrawal of Russian troops  from Estonia, the Estonian Foreign Ministry expressed the hope  that this was just one official's attempt to influence the 17th  round of talks beginning today outside Tallinn. However, if  Russia officially no longer accepts August 31, 1994 as the final  date, Estonia may seriously have to consider breaking off the  talks.    In interviews with Interfax and BNS February 28, Mr.  Udaltsov  also tied final withdrawal to "social guarantees" for military  retirees and their families, directly contradicting previous  Russian promises as well as CSCE and United Nations documents  which specify and require unconditional withdrawal. The  Udaltsov statements potentially negate the substantial progress  made in the 16th round of talks held February 1-2 in Moscow.    Despite repeated promises, Russia still has not presented a  withdrawal timetable as required by international practice.  Nevertheless, Estonia made a concession in Moscow and accepted  the August 31, 1994 date as proposed by the Russian side in the  15th round of talks.    The Estonian delegation will do everything possible to  ensure  that the withdrawal agreement is initialed in the current round  of talks. The Estonian side is also willing to discuss the  question of social welfare for Russian military pensioners, but  this does not mean that Estonia is prepared to tie that issue in  any way to the withdrawal of troops.</p>

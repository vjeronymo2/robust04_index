			<p>BFN     [Text] A provincial work meeting on the management of  ground facilities for reception of satellite television  broadcasts opened in Changsha yesterday [12 May]. In this  meeting, the participant mainly studied and implemented Order  No. 129 of the State Council and Order No. 11 of the Ministry of  Radio, Film and Television, and made arrangements for the  management of ground facilities for reception of satellite  television broadcasts. (Wen Xuande), member of the standing  committee of the provincial party committee and director of the  provincial propaganda department; Vice Governor (Zeng Guiyu);  and others attended and addressed the meeting.    The meeting pointed out: At present, more than 20 satellite  television programs from outside the border are receivable in  China, and 13 television programs are receivable in our province  via satellite. With the increase of satellite television  broadcast channels, there are more and more ground reception  facilities. Owing to the fact that in the past, China lacked  perfect laws and decrees for the management of these facilities,  a number of units and individuals have watched, via such ground  reception facilities, programs with vulgar or even reactionary  contents which harmed the building of our socialist spiritual  civilization. The State Council's regulations on the management  of ground reception facilities for satellite television  broadcasts have placed the management of ground reception  facilities under the procedures of the legal system. This is  beneficial to maintaining the principle of administering the  country characterized by doing two types of work simultaneously  while attaching equal importance to both. these also are  important measures for exercising and safeguarding our country's  territorial air sovereignty so as to ensure that our satellite  television broadcasting develops in a healthy and orderly way.</p>

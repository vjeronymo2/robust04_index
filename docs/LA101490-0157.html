			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SPARROW BECOMES A ROLE MODEL  </P> <P> The journey was long, but Rory Sparrow finally found a home.  </P> <P> After a decade of bouncing from the New Jersey Nets to the Atlanta Hawks, from  the New York Knicks to the Chicago Bulls, Sparrow landed in Miami.  </P> <P> The National Basketball Association expansion city grabbed him as a free agent  in 1988 and made him feel like a star.  </P> <P> As the senior member of the Heat, Sparrow enjoyed status and respect. People  overlooked his limitations as a point guard, accepting his mediocre shooting  and modest foot speed.  </P> <P> Heat fans focused on the positive aspects. They were impressed by Sparrow's  leadership and feel for the game.  </P> <P> At 32, nearing the end of a career that covered more rugged terrain than smooth  expressway, Sparrow settled down.  </P> <P> "They made a commitment to me," Sparrow said. "They told me to start building  my home."  </P> <P> On June 27 Sparrow's world fell apart. He was attending an NBA Players  Association meeting in Hawaii when he bumped into a tourist -- the mother of  former Sacramento Kings guard Randy Wittman -- who told him he had been traded  to the Kings.  </P> <P> "In retrospect, there was bitterness," Sparrow said this week at the Kings'  Yuba College training camp. "I didn't expect a trade. They hadn't said anything  at all."  </P> <P> Sparrow will return home when the Kings make an abbreviated trip to Boca Raton,  Fla., for an exhibition game Sunday against the Heat at Florida Atlantic  University.  </P> <P> The trade forced Sparrow back into the role he thought he had escaped, the role  of NBA nomad.  </P> <P> Since joining the Nets as a fourth-round draft pick from Villanova in 1980,  Sparrow had been traded, waived or released seven times.  </P> <P> Now the cycle is beginning again. Sparrow has landed on a new, rebuilt team  with an uncertain future.  </P> <P> The Heat made a calculated decision to trade Sparrow. In simple language, he  was too old.  </P> <P> Despite assurances there would always be room for Sparrow in Miami's heart, the  Heat was impressed by the progress made by rookie guard Sherman Douglas last  season. Douglas, 24, made Sparrow expendable.  </P> <P> When the Kings offered to trade a second-round draft choice for Sparrow, the  Heat accepted. Miami's risk was rewarded when guard Bimbo Coles was still  available with the 40th pick of June's draft.  </P> <P> The Heat instructed the Kings to draft Coles on Miami's behalf, gaining a young  point guard while sacrificing Sparrow. The Kings didn't like losing Coles, but  they were eager to acquire an experienced guard like Sparrow.  </P> <P> "We had our eyes on three veteran guards, but Scotty Stirling swore by Rory,"  Kings coach Dick Motta said. "He said Rory would be perfect for us, with the  right mentality, attitude and work ethic."  </P> <P> Stirling, the Kings' scout, was general manager of the Knicks when Sparrow  played in New York. Stirling bubbled with praise for Sparrow, noting, "You  can't go wrong with him."  </P> <P> Sparrow is part player, part teacher. The Kings have four rookies and five free  agents in camp. Rookie guard Travis Mays, a former shooting guard, is making  the switch to point guard.  </P> <P> "Travis is going to school on Rory," Motta said.  </P> <P> Sparrow's value extends beyond his tutorial talents. With his working-class  skills and experience, he is ideally suited for Motta's half-court offense and  physical defense.  </P> <P> But Sparrow isn't ready to concede the starting job to Mays. A collision with  Byron Irvin's elbow split Sparrow's lip Tuesday. After seven stitches, Sparrow  was back in uniform Wednesday but avoided contact.  </P> <P> Sparrow is trying to make the best of his circumstances with the Kings. His  contract expires next summer. He hopes to win a new agreement and stay in the  league for another few years.  </P> <P> "This team is a lot different than Miami," he said. "Here, we have two All-Star  caliber guys in Wayman Tisdale and Antoine Carr. They're capable of scoring  when we need it.  </P> <P> "In Miami, we would play hard but couldn't finish. I took a lot of last-second  shots."  </P></p>

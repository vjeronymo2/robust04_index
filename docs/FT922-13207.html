			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / German growth estimates halved: Economists urge Bundesbank to cut rates and help Europe beat recession THE BUNDESBANK should cut interest rates later this year to help pull western Europe from the grip of recession and stimulate the stagnating economy at home, according to Germany's leading independent economists. Halving their estimates for real west German growth this year to only 1 per cent from their 2 per cent forecast made last autumn, they say that even this improvement depends mostly on a real freeze in state spending and moderate pay settlements. Growth last year was 3.1 per cent. With national debt financing costing an estimated DM100bn (Pounds 35.2bn) this year, the experts propose fiscal sanctions against Lander (states) and local authorities which raise spending by more than inflation. In a report to be presented to the government this morning, the country's five main economic institutes base their modest hopes on rising consumer spending at home and increased economic activity in Japan and the US. However, they add, even though the latest data seem to suggest the German economy may be stabilising, 'it is not clear if the downturn will continue or if the turning point has been reached'. Other western European countries, important export markets, could be stimulated only by 'a considerable reduction in German interest rates', the report says. They expect capital market interest rates to fall in the second half, and then 'the Bundesbank should not hesitate to reduce its lead interest rates'. The independent, Frankfurt-based central bank is the dominant force in European Community monetary policy. Its rigid position on interest rates, underlined last December when it raised its discount rate to 8 per cent and the Lombard rate for lending to banks to 9.75 per cent, has been widely blamed for holding back recovery in Britain, France and other Community countries. Although cuts have been generally expected for this autumn, optimism has wavered recently as fears of inflationary German wage settlements have increased, growth has slowed and overall economic prospects dimmed. Today's report seems unlikely to remove all the uncertainties. Its forecasts are based partly on the assumption that average pay rises will be 6 per cent this year, compared with 6.7 per cent in 1991. There is some improvement, however, in forecasts for consumer price increases. They are now expected to average 3.75 per cent, compared with the earlier forecast of 4 per cent and last year's rate of 3.6 per cent. In recent months, the bank has made no secret of its concern about widespread inflationary pay claims. Last December's rates rise was also intended to send a clear signal that it would not tolerate inflation at the then-current levels of about 4 per cent.

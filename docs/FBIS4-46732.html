			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Khatsukov, head of the Kabardino-Balkaria </F> Republic Radio and Television Broadcasting Center: "A Message to  the Republic's Radio Listeners"]    [Text] The economic difficulties currently being  experienced by every enterprise, both in Russia and in our  republic, unfortunately extend to radio and television as well.  Thus due to a lack of funds to pay for electricity, the numerous  taxes levied by Russia and the republic and the technical upkeep  of television and radio broadcasting equipment or to pay  salaries to our employees, as of 1 April 1994 two radio  broadcasting stations in the medium-frequency band which carry  the programming of Mayak, Radio Rossiya and local  Kabardino-Balkaria Radio programming will go off the air.    It is not by choice that we are shutting down these two  energy-intensive radio transmitters, but rather for the purpose  of maintaining broadcasts of television programs within the  territory of our republic and maintaining broadcasts of the  aforementioned radio programming in the ultra-shortwave band,  since during the first quarter of 1994 the Republic Radio and  Television Broadcasting Center received only about 10 percent of  the requisite funding via television and radio companies from  the Russian budget, which is its sole source of funding.    Nor is the Russian Government currently promising to resolve  the matter of funding for the radio broadcasting companies that  carry television and radio broadcasts throughout all of Russia,  including our republic.    In consideration of the fact that many radio listeners do  not  own receivers capable of receiving the ultra-shortwave band,  temporarily, until such time as the current economic  difficulties stabilize, broadcasting of Kabardino-Balkaria Radio  programming will continue in the medium-frequency band, with one  station operating at a lower power level. Therefore reception of  the programming in question will be possible in the city of  Nalchik and in nearby towns if an external antenna is used.    For high-quality reception of central and local radio  broadcasts listeners must have a radio receiver that operates in  the ultra-shortwave band. These are available in stores.    We will be emphasizing this band as we develop our radio  broadcasting efforts. Toward that end, despite economic  difficulties the staff members of the republic radio and  television broadcasting center are themselves presently  installing a new four-channel Dozhd-4 radio transmitter that  will operate in the ultra-shortwave band. This transmitted will  be located in Nalchik and will replace a Dozhd-2 transmitter.    When this four-channel transmitter goes on air on 1 July  1994, full central programming will be available over three  channels: Channel One, Mayak and Radio Rossiya. The fourth  channel will be reserved for our own republic programming. This  will be the first time since its establishment that  Kabardino-Balkaria Radio will have its own independent channel.    At the present time the creative staff of Kabardino-Balkaria  Television and Radio Broadcasting are looking for ways to  increase their own air time.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The trouble with endowments is . . . - How to . . . find the right life cover (Part II) BUYING life cover when you take out a mortgage does not sound all that controversial. But the question of how best this can be done is at the centre of the most divisive issue within the UK's financial services industry today. Most people, purchase a house as a couple, or with the intention of sharing the house with someone at some time. This means you need life cover to protect your partner against liability for the outstanding mortgage should you die unexpectedly. But you need also to think about how to repay the loan at the end of its term - usually 25 years. Over the past decade, the financial services industry has trumpeted the endowment policy, rather than the old steady repayment method, as the best way of paying off a mortgage. Around 80 per cent of the UK's mortgages are backed by endowments, which offer life cover while acting as a savings mechanism which guarantees a pay-out after 25 years. But the repossessions crisis has revealed the flaw in the endowment - its inflexibility. Full pay-outs are made only if you hold on to the endowment until maturity. While they are often an excellent investment if held this long, it is impossible to recommend them if there is a serious chance of surrendering them early. The heavy costs involved in managing the investment and the life cover, and the commissions paid to salesmen, mean that in the early years of a policy you receive less than you have paid in premiums by surrendering early. This spells disaster if your financial circumstances change for the worse a few years after taking out the loan. The endowment makes it harder to disentangle yourself from the mortgage. Peter Smith, of Hill Martin, puts it this way: 'If I meet another young person who's lost their job and has poor employment prospects, saddled with an endowment mortgage, I'll scream.' He points out that lenders usually would be happy to change a capital repayment mortgage into an 'interest only', but that is not an option with an endowment mortgage. Heavy surrender penalties make it impossible to get rid of the endowment without a loss. Sadly, most people who take out endowments will suffer these penalties. Research by the Securities and Investments Board showed that in 1990 37.1 per cent of unit-linked life policies, and 23 per cent of with-profits policies, were terminated within two years of being started. Mark Bolland, of Chamberlain De Broe, points out that this casts doubt over the worth of tables showing the value of endowments at maturity. He suggests that as insurance companies make these pay-outs to so few people, it is scarcely surprising that final pay-outs are strong. Smith notes that endowments are no longer tax-efficient. At one time, life funds had a favourable tax position and, until 1984, you received tax relief on life assurance premiums. Now, endowments are less tax-efficient than the new investment vehicles created by legislation over the past decade - PEPs, personal pensions and TESSAs. Endowments are an expensive way to buy life cover. As last week's article showed, Pounds 50,000 cover for 25 years costs Pounds 18 via term, and Pounds 62.50 via an endowment, from Pearl. That leaves you plenty of room for imaginative saving. The fact that 80 per cent of mortgages are now backed by an endowment might, therefore, be more to do with the commissions they pay to salesmen than their suitability. These problems suggest that you should forsake the convenience of the endowment mortgage. If you already have one, you should still get a good deal - but only if you keep it until maturity. As the table (taken from Money Management magazine) shows, final pay-outs last year were healthy. Some offices, including Norwich Union, cut pay-outs this year but others, such as Commercial Union - which has the best pay-out announced so far with Pounds 65,596 - increased them. So most endowments offer similar value this year to last. Full details will not be available until the season of bonus announcements is over. The table of unit trust savings schemes shows, however, that an investment which would not penalise you for stopping early might have done better. Assumptions - Pounds 30 monthly premiums over 25 years - are held constant to allow comparisons. Some caveats are needed. Savings schemes were not available in 1967. Although the figures are 'offer-to-bid,' and include the dealing spread, they do not include extra charges managers might add for investing via a savings scheme. Unit trusts do not include life cover, but term cover in 1967 would not have been dear. On the plus side, the unit trust figures take no account of PEP tax reliefs which are now available. They assume that all income was reinvested net. Had it been reinvested gross, returns would have been boosted considerably. The unit trust table still tells a powerful story. It shows that you can have flexibility, and beat endowments, even over 25 years. The average unit trust savings scheme, according to Planned Savings, would have made Pounds 67,039.50, more than last year's best endowment However, risk is greater: the worst-performing unit trust, Brown Shipley Recovery, would have provided only Pounds 14,872.30. Last year's average endowment pay-out was Pounds 53,646. Personal pensions offer a tax-efficient way of covering your life and paying off the mortgage at the same time. You receive tax relief on premiums and you also receive full tax relief on term life cover up to 5 per cent of 'net relevant earnings.' The mortgage can be repaid out of the pension lump sum on retirement. Pension income will not be affected, but pension mortgages do have the disadvantage that they commit you to using a fixed portion of your pension lump sum when you retire. Term cover should give you adequate protection. Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial Services, suggests that cover should be taken out on a joint-life basis until both partners have reached the age of 60. He suggests avoiding the 25-year term because 'your house-buying career does not necessarily last for 25 years.' Taking out cheap term early in your career relieves you of any awkward decisions later on. When you buy your house, shop around for the cheapest term assurance and then take out a long-term savings scheme which allows you to make an escape if you need to. If your 'adviser' keeps trying to sell you an endowment, change your adviser.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 25 YEAR ENDOWMENT POLICIES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Maturity    Terminal                         value     bonus (%)                       (Pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Standard Life          65,858       63.0 Friends Prov           63,937       57.3 Royal London           63,797       49.6 Equity &amp; Law           63,451       63.0 Norwich Union          63,246       45.7 Scottish Amic          63,216       61.0 General Acc            63,080       50.3 Eagle Star             63,015       42.0 Commercial U           61,846       29.8 Clerical Med           61,789       55.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Money Management.

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Firestone man to take over as rubber buffer stock manager Mr James Hegarty, a senior manager at the US Firestone Tire and Rubber company, has been named as the new buffer stock manager of the International Natural Rubber Organisation. He replaces Mr Aldo Hofmeister, who retires in August after nearly nine years with Inro. The organisation groups the six main natural rubber producing countries and 21 consumer nations. At a meeting here this week Inro members agreed to request for a further conference, held under Unctad auspices, to discuss the formation of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement. The conference is likely to be held in Geneva during the first two weeks of October. Despite a rally in natural rubber prices in recent months Malaysia's production has continued to fall as further land is given over to industrial uses or planted with the more lucrative palm oil. The Malaysian statistics department says that the country's natural rubber production was 241,202 tonnes in the first quarter of the year, a drop of 18 per cent on the 1993 figure.</p>

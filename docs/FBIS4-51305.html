			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Gao Jian (7559 1017) from the United Nations] </F>   [Text] New York, 24 May (XINHUA) -- In his speech at the  UN Trusteeship Council, Zhang Yan, Chinese delegate to the  United Nations, said that China is willing to develop relations  of friendship and cooperation with Palau after its independence  on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence --  mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual  non- aggression, non-interference in one another's internal  affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.    The UN Trusteeship Council held its 61st conference today.  Representatives of the Palau Government and the U.S.  Administration, the authority in charge of the trust territory,  announced at the conference that the two countries will carry  out the Treaty of Free Contacts beginning on 1 October 1994.    According to this treaty, Palau will terminate its political  status as a trust territory of the United States and will become  an independent sovereign state.    Palau President Kunivo Nakamular, who is attending the  conference, said in his speech that he hopes Palau will take the  floor at the next UN General Assembly as a sovereign and  independent state and a member of the United Nations. Zhang Yan  said the Chinese Government and people always support the people  of the trust territories in their demands and aspirations for  national self-determination and independence.    He said: The Chinese people have always cherished friendly  affection toward the people of Palau. We hope that Palau will  become an independent member of the international community at  an early date, and that it will embark on the road of developing  its national economy and building its country.    Palau, with a population of approximately 16,000 people, is  situated in western Pacific and is one of the gateways leading  to Southeast Asia in the Pacific Ocean. It is currently the  only territory under UN trusteeship.    Palau was occupied by the United States during World War II.  The United Nations placed it under U.S. trust in 1947. A  referendum on Palau's future political status and prospects held  in January 1993 showed that 68.26 percent of the voters were in  favor of the Treaty of Free Contacts signed between Palau and  the United States in August 1982, and thus adopted the decision  to terminate its trustee status by a simple majority.</p>

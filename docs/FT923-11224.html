			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Arts: Macbeth, the king of heavy metal - Musicals ABOUT THE last thing the world needs is another rock musical. Fortunately, what the world gets is decided by impresarios, and these cautious, most unimaginative of men have screwed their backers' money to the sticking point and launched two more to keep us singing through the recession. Both plod familiar ground. Imagine, at the Liverpool Playhouse, is this year's Beatles musical, and just to make everyone feel at home the star is that perennial Lennon look-a-like Mark McGann, who stands a good chance of playing the role longer than John managed himself. From a Jack to a King (at the Ambassadors in London) is even more of a re-tread: writer Bob Carlton made such a success of converting Shakespeare's The Tempest into the cult hit Return to the Forbidden Planet that he is attempting to repeat history with a send-up of Macbeth. The best way to judge rock musicals is by the aisle action. From a Jack to a King wins hands down, with the audience on its feet well before the compulsory jam session finale. It still seems irritatingly easy to adapt some of Shakespeare's most famous lines to act as a loose prop for a selection of classic rock songs from the 1960s, but the brio of the cast is enough compensation. I was left totally unmoved by Forbidden Planet but I joined in the fun this time round. It helps that Macbeth has a strong and theatrical plot which works even when King Duncan is transmogrified into a rock singer and Macbeth to a lowly drummer, the most insignificant member of the court. Instead of a dagger the murder weapon is a spanner, which loosens the nuts on Duncan/Elvis's motorbike, (cue in 'Leader of the Pack'), enabling Thane Cawdor to do the deed and top the Wembley gig. It is real ensemble playing when Lady Macbeth - sorry, Queenie - powerfully portrayed by Allison Harding, does her stint on the drums, or the sax, or the guitar, and Matthew Devitt as Macbeth throws off guitar riffs like an axe hero. Since Devitt also directs he gets the credit for the relentless pace which disguises the more banal puns. It would be expecting miracles for popular lightning to strike twice in this genre, but since the cast so attractively pleaded for good word of mouth I will recommend the Ambassadors Theatre for stag nights, hen parties and silver wedding anniversaries. 'You know what happens next' says Mark McGann to the audience at the Playhouse, two hours into this Lennon bio-play. Yes. You are going to get shot; then there will be a black out; then you will sing 'Imagine'; and then the audience will join in a chorus of 'Give peace a chance'. Unfortunately, we also know what is going to happen the moment the curtain rises. Imagine is little more than a run-through of the Beatles song book, with a script which sounds more like programme notes than a work of creativity. A stone-deaf Bulgarian could tick off the Cavern scene; the recording studio scene; the US tour scene. Until the interval this has been a fairly indifferent Beatles musical. Things improve when Lennon finally falls into the clutches of Yoko Ono and cuts loose from the group. Once again every familiar image is conjured up, but at least there is a weirdness to it all. In fact the relationship between Lennon and Ono is worth a serious study. All we get here is Ava de Spouza looking advisedly inscrutable and McGann seizing the chance to behave badly at last. Still, while the Beatles songs now sound trite, some of Lennon's later work, 'Working class hero' and 'Jealous guy', seem to have the stuff of the classic about them. McGann remains the best thing in Imagine. By now Lennon's rasping voice and prickly personality, to say nothing of his profile, have become second nature and he holds the show together. The rest of the cast are just cyphers. Imagine totally ducks the really interesting question - how big a bastard was Lennon? In Ian Kellgren's production he is still the world's great white hope. There was also another musical opening unobtrusively at the King's Head in London this week. Once again it is a pastiche; once again it milks popular songs of the past. But Top of the Town deserves to be a smash, if only because of its witty script. Roy Smiles has gathered in every musical cliche about a 1940s off-Broadway musical to produce an appealing bonbon. It would be an insult to include songs like 'Long ago and far away', 'Try a little tenderness', and many more tingly standards if the script was not equally urbane. It is also right that the cast plays it dead straight, especially Smiles as the devious impresario Harry Stein, keen to emulate that great musical 'The Fleet goes Ga-ga'. My only caveat about the show is its limited horizons. The voices are too small; the personalities of some of the cast too restrained for this to bother the West End. At the King's Head it is ideal entertainment for a summer's evening.</p>

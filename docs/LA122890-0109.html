			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PADRES' SANTIAGO JAILED; PLAYER SAYS HE WAS BEATEN BY OFFICERS  </P> <P> San Diego Padre catcher Benito Santiago was arrested Sunday night on suspicion  of driving under the influence of alcohol and resisting arrest after an  incident during which the Padre All-Star said he was beaten by three officers.  </P> <P> Coronado Police Dept. spokesman Detective Keith James said Santiago spent about  four hours in jail.  </P> <P> Ed Checkert, deputy district attorney in the South Bay office, said charges  have not been filed.  </P> <P> Santiago said Thursday night that he was innocent and that he suffered a black  eye, a scratch on the side of his face, a sore neck and a sore left forearm.  </P> <P> Ishmael Fonseca, an arresting officer, was unavailable for comment. Sgt. James  Adams, a shift supervisor who said he was familiar with the case, said Santiago  was not mistreated.  </P> <P> "What our guys did was right," Adams said. "Benito pushed it."  </P> <P> Scott Boras, Santiago's agent and lawyer, said he is uncomfortable with the way  the matter was handled.  </P> <P> "The entire case will be reviewed succinctly by myself and our legal  department," Boras said, "and (police) conduct will be scrutinized in  accordance with provisional rules and regulations governing the conduct of  police officers in that situation. If after review we find their conduct not  within those standards, we will definitely pursue litigation."  </P> <P> Said Adams: "Let's go to court. When the situation comes out in court, I think  you'll find what Benito said is not accurate, and we'll prove it."  </P> <P> Padre President Dick Freeman said he knew nothing about the matter.  </P> <P> "I'm not aware of it," Freeman said. "I've got no comment."  </P></p>

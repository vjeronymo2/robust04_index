			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: FRN investors offered a home on the range - Risk and reward You have seen collared floating-rate notes, fixed-floater-fixed notes, reverse and perpetual floaters. Now meet the latest structured product to emerge from the laboratories of the Eurobond rocket scientists: the range-floater. In recent weeks this instrument has become all the rage, and hardly a day passes without a handful of such deals hitting the Eurobond market. The past two weeks have seen the issuance of more than Dollars 1bn of range-floaters, also called corridor floaters, and syndicate officials say there's more to come. US dollar range-floaters essentially hinge on investors' outlook for US interest rates. In order to make money, they have to hold the view that US short-term rates will stay in a narrow band during the life of the note and that interest-rate volatility will remain low. The salient feature of range floaters is that, when the dollar London inter-bank offered rate lies within a specific range, investors earn a much higher coupon than they would otherwise receive on a plain-vanilla floater from the same borrower. However, no interest accrues on the days when Libor lies outside that range. As an example, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) last week issued Dollars 200m of one-year range notes. They pay a coupon of three-month Libor plus 50 basis points when the three-month Libor daily fixing falls between zero and 4 per cent in the first six months of the note's life and between zero and 4.25 per cent during the second six months. No interest accrues when Libor rises above 4 per cent during the first half or above 4.25 per cent during the second half. US three-month Libor was fixed at 3.25 per cent on Friday. As a triple-A rated supranational borrower, the EBRD would pay well below Libor on a plain-vanilla FRN. According to the EBRD's treasurer, Mr Rene Karsenti, the deal beat its one-year funding target of around Libor minus 3/8 points. Range floaters pay investors an above-market rate to compensate them for the risk that interest may not accrue during some of its life. 'We are now in an environment where yields are so low that the only way to get a yield pick-up is to take a market view,' says Mr Tim Skeet, senior vice president on the syndication desk at Kidder, Peabody. Many range-floaters have been issued by triple-A rated borrowers, making credit risk a negligible consideration. Typical buyers of range-floaters include money-market fund managers and commercial banks. Even if Libor does fall outside the range during some of its life, it will take a while before investors lose out. In the case of the EBRD note, investors will earn the full Libor-plus-50 coupon if Libor lies within its range on each day in the quarter; but even if Libor is within the range for only 78 days, the investor will still earn around Libor flat - more than could be obtained from a plain vanilla EBRD floater. 'Libor can fall outside the corridor for a period of time and you can still have a good investment,' says one dealer. From the borrower's perspective, range floaters enable top-notch issuers to get deep sub-Libor funding by swapping the proceeds into plain-vanilla Libor-based funds. 'The value comes from the swap counterparty who agrees to pay the issuer the difference between its sub-Libor funding target and the coupon on the days when Libor is within the range,' explains a swaps trader. This leaves the issuer fully hedged while the swap counterparty assumes the risk that Libor stays within the range. The swap counterparty in turn can hedge itself with the use of options strategies.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> NO MORE RIZZUTO? HOLY COW!  </P> <P> "Like General MacArthur, I shall return," New York Yankees broadcaster Phil  Rizzuto said.  </P> <P> But it was unclear after Tuesday's game between the Yankees and the Baltimore  Orioles whether Rizzuto, who often shouts "Holy Cow" at crucial moments of  games, would be back at the microphone.  </P> <P> Rizzuto, who celebrated his 73rd birthday Tuesday, has been in the broadcast  booth for 34 years, but that may end after this season if WPIX-TV is unable to  purchase the rights to broadcast any of the Yankees' 1991 games from the  Madison Square Garden cable network.  </P> <P> "I have a terrible feeling right now," said Rizzuto, known as "Scooter," in a  story in today's editions of the New York Post. "I'm not an emotional guy, but  today, thinking about all of this, I had tears in my eyes.  </P> <P> "Fifty years have gone by and I can't believe there's a chance I won't be  coming here any more," said Rizzuto, who joined the Yankees as a shortstop in  1941. "It's kind of frightening."  </P></p>

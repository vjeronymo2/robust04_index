			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / The Italian connection: A business and political scandal As he faces his second weekend in Milan's decrepit San Vittore jail, Mr Salvatore Ligresti, the 60-year-old Sicilian-born property magnate who is one of the richest men in Italy, may reflect ruefully on his path to the top. Mr Ligresti is the most prominent figure to have been arrested in the growing political scandal in northern Italy, which has so far caught over 70 party functionaries, businessmen and bureaucrats in its net. With magistrates planning to work through the August holidays, many Milanese believe the investigation could yet reach the highest levels of the country's business and political elite. During his rise, Mr Ligresti has become a central cog in the network of corporate and business alliances which link many of the country's most prestigious companies. But having been charged with involvement in corruption and having admitted paying bribes of more than L1bn (Pounds 460,000) to win contracts for Milan's new metro line his lawyers are now trying to secure his release pending trial. The arrest of a businessman who counts among his friends Mr Enrico Cuccia, the veteran honorary chairman of Mediobanca, the Milanese merchant bank, and Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist party leader, has sent shock waves through Italian business circles. No other entrepreneur so successfully spans the worlds of politics, business and the bourse. And few have had a bigger visual impact on Milan than Mr Ligresti. His Premafin holding company has built a string of almost-identical glass-clad office towers. Premafin, 76 per cent owned by Mr Ligresti, controls four quoted companies in insurance, construction, toll motorways and porcelain and sanitary ware. The most important is SAI, one of Italy's biggest insurers with annual premiums of more than L2,300bn. The company has enabled Mr Ligresti to break out of his role as a property baron and become a linchpin of Italian finance. SAI's investments in blue chip companies such as Cofide, Pirelli and Italmobiliare, the holding companies for the De Benedetti, Pirelli and Pesenti families, gave him the key to the 'salotto buono', the good drawing room, of Italy's industrial aristocracy. In most cases, those shareholdings provided a seat on the board. SAI is also the best-known of Mr Ligresti's operations abroad and has built links with European insurance groups and institutional investors. Friends' Provident of the UK now owns 4.3 per cent of Premafin and almost 2 per cent of SAI, while Groupe des Assurances Nationales of France has 10 per cent of SAI. SAI's real gem is its 2 per cent stake in Mediobanca which is at the centre of a complex network of cross-shareholdings between many of Italy's best-known private-sector companies. The relationship between Mr Ligresti and Mr Cuccia, a fellow Sicilian, goes back at least to the mid-1980s when Mr Ligresti used his good offices with Mr Craxi, then prime minister, to smooth Mr Cuccia's plans for the part-privatisation of Mediobanca. Since Mediobanca managed the flotation of Premafin in 1989, the links between Mr Ligresti and Mr Cuccia have tightened. One of the most striking examples of their co-operation came with the revelation that Mr Ligresti had bought 5 per cent of Continental, the German tyres group which Pirelli, advised by Mediobanca, tried unsuccessfully to acquire in a protracted bid battle last year. Such high-level patronage has earned Mr Ligresti both envy and enemies. The son of a shopkeeper from a village near Catania, his virtually rags-to-riches story triggers gossip from the snobbish Milanese. Mr Ligresti first crossed swords with the city's magistrates in a scandal over land sales to the council in the mid-1980s. The affair prompted the resignation as mayor of Mr Carlo Tognoli, one of the most prominent politicians now under investigation as part of the umbrella Milan investigations into fraud and corruption. Subsequent arrests involved allegations of planning violations at new office developments. In each case, Mr Ligresti was acquitted. Mr Ligresti's latest problems are likely to prove more serious than those in the past because the scope of the current investigations is much wider and the position of the main political parties is weaker. Shares in all Mr Ligresti's companies have plunged since his arrest, though some parts of the group were already facing difficulties. SAI, for instance, has been exposed to underwriting losses while earnings at Grassetto, Premafin's construction subsidiary, have also fallen because of recession and tougher competition abroad. The scandal has aggravated the business outlook by putting a brake on new public-sector contracts. Orders could fall further given the prospect of severe public spending cuts as part of the government's plans to reduce the budget deficit. Even property development has been suffering. Real estate prices in Milan have fallen sharply since the late-1980s. Office rentals have also slipped. Many of Mr Ligresti's developments are vulnerable as they are in outlying areas, often poorly served by public transport. No one is suggesting that Mr Ligresti's empire is about to topple. He may bounce back. But bankers believe it will take time and even Mr Cuccia's patronage may not be enough to stop some of Mr Ligresti's boardroom buddies distancing themselves from their Sicilian colleague, no matter how great his financial muscle.</p>

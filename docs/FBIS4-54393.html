			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 28 (BTA) -- Deputy Prime Minister and  Minister of Trade Valentin Karabashev submitted his resignation  at the beginning of the Council of Ministers' regular meeting  today.    Valentin Karabashev is a member of the Alternative Social  Liberal Party (ASP), which entered parliament on the ticket of  the Union of Democratic Forces. It was expelled from the  coalition at the end of 1992 because of its support for Lyuben  Berov's cabinet formed under the mandate assigned to the ethnic  Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms and backed by the  formerly Communist Bulgarian Socialist Party, which now holds a  majority in the National Assembly. Minister of Industry Rumen  Bikov is also a member of the ASP.    Explaining his resignation in a letter to the prime  minister,  Mr. Karabashev says that last autumn the functions of the two  deputy prime ministers (the other is Evgeni Matinchev, who also  heads the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs) got confused,  creating mistrust and chaos in the governing institution, and  that there were several cases of the prime minister taking  action without notifying him. Mr. Karabashev says that one of  those cases was the prime minister's attempt to launch an idea  of his own about privatization. In Mr. Karabashev's opinion,  Prof. Berov's attempts to revise the operative legislation on  privatization were the reason for its slow pace.    Making a declaration on the government's intentions until  the  end of the year in parliament yesterday [27 April], Prime  Minister Berov blamed the slowdown in privatization on the  deputy prime minister in charge of it and sharply criticized the  Ministry of Trade. "The criticism of my performance as a deputy  prime minister and minister of trade is serious but unfounded,"  Mr. Karabashev says in his letter. He also states that the  cabinet changed planned by the prime minister are quite  different from his own views.    Interviewed by the media at the Council of Ministers,  Valentin Karabashev said that Prof. Berov had asked him not to  be overhasty with his resignation.    MP Asen Michkovski of the ASP, who was at the Council of  Ministers too, said that the party leadership would consider  whether to withdraw its support for Prof. Berov's government or  not. Mr. Michkovski stated that the ASP might ask another of  its representatives in the government, Minister of Industry  Bikov, to resign too. "I should abide by the decision of the  ASP, but ultimately this is a question of personal choice," Mr.  Bikov said.    The National Assembly is expected to debate Mr. Karabashev's  resignation when it resumes work after the Easter recess, which  is until May 11. It is possible that the ASP will propose an  extraordinary sitting of parliament because there is a cabinet  crisis in the country, as Mr. Michkovski put it.</p>

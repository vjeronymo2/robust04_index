			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Inquiry puts MPs' little earners in the spotlight - The remit of the latest investigation of standards in public life Mr John Major, the prime minister, said yesterday that his proposed committee of inquiry was the 'widest-ranging inquiry into standards in public life since the second world war'. This is a dubious claim. A royal commission sat for two years in the 1970s to investigate standards of conduct in public life. As with Mr Major's inquiry, it was chaired by a law lord, Lord Salmon, included nominees of the main political parties and non-party experts, and had a remit incorporating central government, local government and other public bodies. The background to the Salmon commission was the Poulson affair - a long-running case of sleaze far more serious than any yet alleged in public by Mr Mohamed Fayed, or by those critical of the activities of unelected quangos. For nearly 20 years Mr John Poulson's architecture and construction empire manipulated a web of corrupt officials in local government, the police and the National Health Service, which was revealed when he went bankrupt in 1972. Mr Poulson and several local councillors and officials were convicted of corruption. The Salmon commission was concerned mainly with corruption in local government. It recommended a range of reforms, notably declarations and registers of interest, which have since been instituted. It is the breach of the rules governing one such register of interests - that for MPs - which is a key issue in the present controversy. The Salmon report had little to say about central government and the Commons, which were only incidental to the Poulson affair, or about the way appointments were made to public bodies. It accepted implicitly that parliament should regulate itself. Lord Nolan's committee will not start with the same assumptions. It faces calls from across the political spectrum for MPs to be subject to some form of code of conduct, and growing unease about the way appointments are made to public bodies. Lord Nolan said last night that he supported hearings that were in public. He said: 'I've grown up doing my work in open court in public and that is how I would prefer to go forward.' As Lord Justice Nolan he assisted in the Appeal Court decision which found Mr Kenneth Baker, then home secretary, guilty of contempt after he failed to respond to an order to return an unlawfully deported asylum-seeker to Britain. Lord Nolan's committee has six months to grapple with a range of issues. The most important are: MPs and outside interests. Until recently few questioned the right of MPs to accept paid work outside the Commons. Indeed the practice is widely defended as desirable to give MPs a feel for the 'outside world' and to supplement a salary - now Pounds 31,687 - below that which many enjoyed before they were elected. The question has been the disclosure of outside payments. There are now calls for tighter rules to be placed on outside interests. Mr Vernon Bogdanor, reader in government at Oxford University, said: 'The Nolan committee needs to look carefully at whether MPs should have outside incomes. Their job is to serve their constituents, and it is a bogus argument to claim that they can only learn about the 'outside world' by being a paid consultant.' The implications are stark. More than than 200 MPs out of the 651 are employed as parliamentary consultants to lobbying companies and other commercial organisations - often at a fee of Pounds 10,000 or more per consultancy per year. The appointment of members of public bodies. Ministers have largely unfettered discretion over appointments they make to public bodies. Until 1979, however, ministers generally offered fair representation to the main opposition party. The breakdown of this tacit agreement accounts for much of the current acrimony. Entrenched in office, the governments of Mrs Thatcher and Mr Major have paid less regard to the claims of opposition parties for appointments. The resentment has been exacerbated by the growth of quangos, such as NHS trusts, strongly opposed by Labour. Options for change include placing obligations on ministers to offer a certain proportion of appointments to opposition parties, or the establishment of a vetting body to ensure the quality and fairness of appointments. Complaints against MPs. Members of the public aggrieved with their local council - or with many other public bodies - can appeal to an ombudsman. There is no such recourse for those dissatisfied with the service given to them by their MP - or for those who believe that their MP is not declaring his or her interests. One reform which has attracted support would be to establish an ombudsman to oversee the work of MPs - perhaps in conjunction with a formal code of conduct. Any such move would probably be opposed by MPs. Since King Charles I's attempts to arrest five MPs in 1642 they have fought tenaciously against any form of outside interference.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / EC retreat on energy tax likely THE European Commission is unlikely to press the case for an energy tax aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions unless the US and Japan show signs of following the same route, because of the effect on European competitiveness. Brussels had planned to deal with this through exemptions to energy-intensive industries such as chemicals, until the EC's main trading partners accepted the need for fiscal weapons to curb global warming. The Commission is still considering options which might allow the EC to press ahead alone. But Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, environment commissioner, has acknowledged that 'conditionality (introduction of the tax only if the US and Japan took similar measures) in this case is likely to be indispensable.' The test will come at June's 'earth summit' in Rio de Janeiro, by when the Commission hopes to have the conditional backing of the Twelve for the planned tax. This is a mixed levy on energy and fossil fuels, starting at Dollars 3 a barrel in 1993 and rising to Dollars 10 in the year 2000, by when the EC has undertaken to reduce CO emissions to 1990 levels. accepted German plans for a single EC law which would sweep away all internal frontier controls in the Community at a stroke will get tentative backing from the Commission at a ministers' meeting in Brussels today, writes Andrew Hill. At the moment, member states are proceeding on a case-by-case basis.</p>

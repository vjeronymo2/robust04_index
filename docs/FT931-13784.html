			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: North Sea oil dips below Dollars 17 NORTH SEA oil prices dipped below Dollars 17 per barrel for the first time in a week yesterday following a sharp drop in the New York market on Tuesday night. London and New York prices were depressed yesterday with North Sea Brent crude prices for March delivery touching Dollars 16.95 a barrel. The March futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by 19 cents to Dollars 18.51 per barrel in mid-day trading. The fall of more than 50 cents a barrel in the New York futures market on Tuesday night followed the release of a weekly report on oil stocks by the American Petroleum Institute. The API reported a rise in crude stocks of 7.8m barrels in the previous week, with gasoline inventories increasing by 6m barrels. The stock figures unnerved the market as they came out higher than analysts' expectations. Crude oil stocks rose as imports continued to build up at Gulf of Mexico terminals, but demand remained sluggish and US refineries cut their production runs to just under 85 per cent capacity utilisation. Another factor that sent prices falling was the ceasefire mooted by Saddam Hussein, Iraq's leader, on Tuesday. Crude prices have increased slightly on the back of tension in the Middle East even though Iraq does not export oil at present. In the North Sea, the Sullom Voe loading terminal remained closed because of high winds. Storage tanks at the terminal and at Chevron's Ninian platform are almost full, meaning production could be cut. These problems have had little effect on the oil price. The oil products market is still extremely weak as the weather remains mild in Europe and North America, depressing demand. Gas oil prices moved Dollars 2 a tonne lower on the Rotterdam market yesterday to Dollars 156 a tonne. The crude market remains over-supplied with oil as demand is low and traders are still looking to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries for leadership in cutting output. 'Clearly for this market to turn around, we've got to get something out of Opec and not just pledges, but action,' said Mr Andrew LeBow at ED &amp; F. Man, the international trading house, in New York.</p>

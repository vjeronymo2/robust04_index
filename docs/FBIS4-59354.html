			<p>BFN     [Text] Peshawar, May 10 -- Following fresh peace efforts in  Afghanistan President Borhanoddin Rabbani has agreed to step  down from his office by the end of year in order to pave way for  new democratic set-up.    Disclosing this at a news conference here on Tuesday, the  peace delegation of Mutahidda Ulema Council led by its Deputy  Secretary General, Prof Mohammad Yahya, who returned from Kabul  on Monday evening, claimed that both the warlords of  Afghanistan, Rabbani and Hekmatyar have agreed to their peace  formula with the exception of two points, which were still to be  resolved.    During their meetings with Afghan President and Prime  Minister they found no real differences between the two rather  they agreed in principle to the formation of an interim Shoora  for framing electoral roll and meeting other requirements within  a year [sentence as published]. But the bone of contention was  that how and who would form the Shoora. Rabbani was of the view  that Shoora should have at least one thousand members from all  provinces while Hekmatyar wanted a Shoora of maximum hundred  members only from Jehad forces, he disclosed.    Mohammad Yahya said that the main objective of the peace  mission was to coordinate the peace efforts of Jalaluddin  Haqqani, he has been making since Ramadzan last, for striking a  patch-up between the warring factions. He claimed that because  of his successful mediation the agreement between Rabbani and  Hekmatyar was only a few steps away as the main irritants have  been removed. He said that the two parties were tired of  fighting and wanted to put an end to hostilities for good.    He said that during its three-day stay in Afghanistan, the  delegation witnessed tremendous development in the peace process  and considerable flexibility by the leaders of the warring  factions as all of them were now ready to settle the dispute  within the framework of the text of peace formula announced by  the mediating commission of Haqqani. However, he alleged that  some miscreants from both sides were sabotaging their efforts by  escalating the fighting further.    He claimed that apart from political circles all segments in  Afghanistan welcomed their peace efforts and insisted that their  delegation should stay in Afghanistan till finding any possible  solution to the crisis. He said Haqqani's commission was there  to continue the peace plan.    He bitterly criticised the winding up of Pakistani Embassy  in  Afghanistan saying that this step of the government has enabled  the "RAW" [Research and Analysis Wing] to use to use its open  hand against Pakistan. He feared that the agents of "RAW" were  fully active to create hatred among Afghans against Pakistan.  He demanded of the government to reopen its Embassy in Kabul to  encounter the anti-Pakistan activities of the "RAW".    Commenting on Mehmud Mestiri's efforts for paving way for  the  former monarch of Afghanistan Zahir Shah, he said that one of  the main warring factions has categorically rejected him as a  mediator.    Answering a query, he denied the impression that their peace  efforts were aimed at providing relief to Rabbani for  reestablishing his position.</p>

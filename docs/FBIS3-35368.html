			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 23 Feb (MENA)--The Palestinian and Israeli  delegations headed by Dr. Nabil Sha'th and Major General Amnon  Shahaq have announced that their talks in Cairo on 21-23  February involved constructive work and promoted mutual respect  and trust.    In a joint press statement, the first to be issued on the  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations concerning ways to implement  autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, the two delegations said they  discussed three major issues during their committee meetings.  They discussed the Security Committee, the Civilian Affairs  Committee, and the Detainees Committee.    The statement said that regarding security issues, the two  delegations focused on security measures in the Gaza Strip and  the Jericho areas, the planning, size, and deployment of  Palestinian security forces, and some other related issues.    The statement added that the Security Committee discussed  historical sites, communications, land registration, and civil  registration.    The statement cited the two delegation heads saying they  were  satisfied with the progress made during this round and had hopes  of making further progress at future meetings in Cairo. They  expressed their gratitude to President Husni Mubarak, the  Egyptian Government, and the Egyptian people for their warm  hospitality and their constant assistance to the negotiators.    Dr. Nabil Sha'th, speaking at a news conference following  the  statement's release, announced that much was achieved in the  past two weeks and that only a few issues remain unresolved. He  said this will need two, or at most three, weeks to complete.    Sha'th added that it is difficult to specify a date for the  prospective meeting between Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat  and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to sign the final  agreement. He explained that setting a date depends on many  issues connected with the two men's prior engagements.    Sha'th asserted that determining the numbers in the  Palestinian police force does not pose a problem and will be  discussed when the issue is submitted to 'Arafat and Rabin.    He asserted that the statement issued today has special  significance because it is the first joint statement about the  Palestinian-Israeli Gaza-Jericho negotiations. He noted that  this reflects both sides' commitment to implement the  Gaza-Jericho agreement.    Sha'th said the two sides have made progress in connection  with most of the issues pertaining to the transfer of the  civilian authority.    Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahaq said he totally agrees with Dr.  Sha'th  that real progress was made in the past two weeks, noting that  the two delegations will seek to finalize agreement on other  issues next week.    He asserted that last week's negotiations were useful,  noting  that the two sides are now very close to an agreement.    Regarding the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho,  Shahaq said: We are negotiating so that the withdrawal will take  place in line with the agreement between the two parties. The  withdrawal will not take place unless the negotiations are  completed.    Sha'th said the next round of negotiations in Cairo will  involve meetings of all the committees, noting that talks are  also under way to draw up the draft of the general agreement.  Regarding the Israeli commitment to withdraw from Gaza and  Jericho by 13 April, Sha'th remarked that this is a very  important date, adding: We are doing our best to complete the  negotiations so that the commitment to withdraw on the specified  date will be fulfilled.    Sha'th added that in connection with the Palestinian  detainees, the Palestinian side is seeking to obtain a general  amnesty for all former strugglers.    On the work of the confidence building committee, Shahaq  said the committee discussed all the relevant issues, especially  Palestinian detainees.    Sha'th said work during the current round of talks was based  on maps and agreements were reached on the size of the  Palestinian police force [as received], the border and the  vicinity of the Israeli settlements, and security measures on  roads and at the border.    Sha'th said other security points, such as security at sea,  in the air, on the coast, and on the road between Gaza and  Jericho remain to be agreed upon during next week's talks.    He said agreements on many other daily concerns for  Palestinians, such as registering the lands of Palestinian  absentees, state land, historical sites, communications, and  telecommunications, have been reached.    There was also an agreement on a Palestinian radio station,  a  television station, and ground contacts with communication  satellites, Sha'th said.    He said all this will allow the Palestinian authority and  the  Palestinians, from the beginning of the Palestinian authority,  to contact Palestinians abroad, the Arab world, and the outside  world through the radio and television stations.    He said the general 15-point agreement, which constitutes a  preamble for the civilian, security, and other appendices, will  be finalized and negotiations on the general amnesty agreement  will be completed.    Dr. Sha'th said the Palestinians sensed no Israeli attempt  to  obstruct the negotiations. Indeed, he explained, the talks were  objective and positive.    He expressed satisfaction with the progress of the talks  this  week and last. He noted that the two sides are working  seriously to reach an agreement as soon as possible.    Sha'th reiterated that the size of Jericho will be  determined  in the upcoming meeting between Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin.    Shahaq said the release of the Palestinian detainees will  take place when an agreement is reached.    He stressed that those detained after 13 September 1993, the  day Israel and the PLO signed the Declaration of Principles in  Washington, will not be released.    On the participation of Rabin's policy adviser Ya'qov Neriah  in the talks, Sha'th said the entire delegation represents Prime  Minister Rabin, who is responsible for the results of the  negotiations. Neriah's participation, he said, adds positively  to the composition of the Israeli delegation.    Sha'th stressed the importance of a general amnesty for all  Palestinian detainees before signing an agreement on the  implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord.</p>

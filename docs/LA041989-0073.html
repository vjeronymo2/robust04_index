			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A judge rejected a motion to dismiss a felony indictment against Assemblyman  John R. Lewis (R-Orange), accused of forging former President Ronald Reagan's  name on endorsement letters mailed to thousands of voters in 1986. Defense  attorneys, relying on a nearly 100-year-old state Supreme Court decision,  maintained that Lewis could not be charged with forgery, because he did not  intend to defraud anyone of money or property. They said the phony endorsements  were, at most, an unfair ploy to influence voters. But Sacramento County  Superior Court Judge James Morris ruled that the voters could have been  defrauded of their "voting franchise right" and ordered Lewis to appear for  arraignment on May 2.  </P></p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Assessing the age allowance I am 65 and trying to assess whether I will be eligible for age allowance in the 1994/95 tax year. I know what gross income from my pension and investments is likely to be in 1994/95 and I pay private medical insurance subscriptions, from which tax is deducted at 25 per cent. 1. When the tax office makes an assessment for age allowance eligibility, will it make a gross private medical insurance deduction from total gross income or will it be a net deduction? 2. I received some investment income gross in the 1992/93 and 1993/94 tax years, and the account was closed in January this year. When I pay the tax on this investment income in the 1994/95 tax year, will the increase to my total gross income apply to the previous year or will the gross investment income for 92/93 and 93/94 become a part of my total gross income for 94/95? 1. The answer is neither. Under paragraph 2 of schedule 10 to the Finance Bill, medical insurance premiums will no longer be deductible after 1993-94 in calculating someone's total income for age relief. You might like to write to the Inland Revenue, Public Enquiry Office, Somerset House, Strand, London, WC2R 1LB, for a (free) copy of the Budget day press release IR7 (Tax relief for private medical insurance). 2. The investment income received gross in 1992-93 and 1993-94 forms part of your total income of the years in which it was received, namely 1992-93 and 1993-94. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

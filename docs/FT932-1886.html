			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lords' Maastricht motion withdrawn THE House of Lords will not have an opportunity to debate whether there should be a referendum on the Maastricht treaty until after the bill has completed its detailed committee stage discussion. The amendment to the legislation, which was tabled earlier this month by a cross-party group of peers, has been withdrawn because of difficulties about its drafting. The government is expected to announce today that there will be an extra two days to debate the bill's committee stage, for which well over 400 amendments have been tabled.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Danisco slides to DKr826m for year DANISCO, the Danish food, beverages and packaging group, saw profits after net financial items fall by 22 per cent in the year ending March 31, to DKr826m (Dollars 127m) from DKr1.05bn in the previous year. The result, which was at the lower end of analysts' forecasts, was affected by last year's dry summer (which hit the sugar beet and pea harvest), falling domestic consumption of spirits (which affected the distilling division) and devaluations by other European countries (which hit export competitiveness). High Danish interest rates for much of last year helped lift net financial costs to DKr322m from DKr182m. Sales fell 3 per cent to DKr13.02bn from DKr13.46bn. Net profits dropped to DKr809m from DKr988m, but the group will pay an unchanged DKr12 dividend. Last year, Danisco bought the Swedish sugar refining company, Sockerbolaget, from Procordia for DKr2.22bn, which together with the group's Danish and German sugar production operations has made the group one of Europe's biggest sugar producers, with output of around 930,000 tonnes. Danisco also sold its machinery company Niro Atomizer and fan manufacturer Novenco for a total of DKr1.03bn. The group said it expected no change in the low level of activity in its markets in the current year, and added that the strength of the Danish currency was affecting competitiveness. However, if external conditions did not deteriorate, there should be moderate growth in operating profits this year, the group said.</p>

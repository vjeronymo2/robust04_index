Webb, requesting that actions be taken regarding the Brunswick Steam Electric Plant (Brunswick), Units 1 and 2, of the Carolina Power &amp; Light Company (CP&amp;L or the Licensee). The Petition requested that (1) the NRC staff enter into a confidentiality agreement with NWC to facilitate the release of additional information; (2) the NRC immediately require the Licensee to state whether it has, in fact, known about cracks in the reactor core shroud since at least 1984; and (3) the Commission's Office of Investigations determine whether CP&amp;L management engaged in criminal wrongdoing, commencing in 1984, when CP&amp;L is alleged to have failed to report the existence of cracks in the core shroud to the NRC. The Petition also requested an immediate suspension of the operating license for Brunswick pending the criminal investigation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Petitioners based their request on allegations that (1) the Licensee falsely asserted to the NRC and to the public that cracks in the reactor shroud were but recently discovered, and the Petitioners contend that the Licensee discovered the cracks nine years earlier and the Licensee's management instructed the engineers who detected the cracks to prepare paperwork that would ensure that the cracks would not be reported to the NRC; (2) this alleged coverup demonstrates that CP&amp;L does not have the character or integrity to operate a nuclear facility because of its unwillingness to report significant safety problems to the NRC; and (3) the Licensee is willing to take unreasonable risks with the health and safety of the public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director of NRR has granted in part and denied in part the Petitioner's requests. The reasons are explained in the ``Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206'' (DD&hyph;94&hyph;09), which is available for public inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20037, and at the Licensee's local public document room at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, William Madison Randall Library, 601 S. College Road, Wilmington, NC 28403&hyph;3297.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of the Decision will be filed with the Secretary of the Commission for the Commission's review in accordance with 10 CFR 2.206(c). As provided for in 10 CFR 2.206(c), the Decision will become the final action of the Commission 25 days after the date of issuance unless the Commission on its own motion institutes a review of the Decision within that time. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 19th day of October 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William T.

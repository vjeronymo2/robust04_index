			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Crisis in Russia: Markets take a cautious view WORLD financial markets appeared yesterday to put their faith in the relative stability offered by President Yeltsin, although most trading was still cautious. 'People took the view that Yeltsin would win even if it meant flattening the White House,' said Mr Julian Jessop of Midland Global Markets. The D-Mark, the currency most at risk from any turmoil in Russia, recovered an early loss of around two pfennigs on Far East markets to close later in London at DM1.6240 against the dollar. European government bond markets, which normally thrive in a climate of political stability, rose across the board. Stock markets also edged higher. German government bonds moved higher, with the bund futures contract for December ending 0.20 points higher at around 99.00. Gold rose sharply at the opening in London, but plunged later under pressure from US selling inspired by the belief that Russia's turmoil was ending. It closed down Dollars 2.45 at Dollars 352.75. European equity markets were relatively unperturbed in early trading but rose as Mr Yeltsin was perceived to be regaining control.</p>

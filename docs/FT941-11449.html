			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Charges on war crimes ruled out The Scottish legal authorities have decided not to prosecute 17 alleged war criminals living in Scotland. The Simon Wiesenthal Centre, which traces former Nazi war criminals, said the decision meant killers would never be brought to trial. It was a 'terrible blow' to efforts to bring Holocaust murderers to justice. The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecutions in Scotland, said no prosecutions were to be brought because of a lack of evidence. An investigation unit set up in May 1991 will be disbanded, although the inquiry could be reopened if fresh evidence emerges. A parallel investigation into alleged war criminals living in England is still under way. The all-party parliamentary war crimes group, which is chaired by Lord Merlyn-Rees, former Labour home secretary, said it had expected a 'more encouraging decision' after the 1987 libel case in which Mr Antanas Gecas, 78, who lives in Edinburgh, unsuccessfully sued Scottish Television over its claim that he had committed war crimes in Lithuania.</p>

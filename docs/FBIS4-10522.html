			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Miguel Angel de la Guardia Hernandez from the </F> "Evening Information Review" newscast]    [Text] The so-called daily blackout system that Cuba has  been forced to implement because of the country's serious  economic crisis has intensified over the past few days because  of fuel problems and numerous damages to electrical generators.    The Maximo Gomez thermoelectric plant, one of the nation's  largest with an installed capacity of 600 megawatts, suffered  damages and had to be removed from the national network. Other  plants throughout the country have also been damaged by Cuba's  heavy oil, which can cause serious damage if it is not  adequately treated or if adjustments are not made to the  industrial equipment in which it is used. Cuba has been forced  to use this heavy oil to generate a considerable amount of the  electricity required by the country, because there is an  insufficient amount of light oil for all of the generators.    Workers at the Maximo Gomez plant are struggling tooth and  nail to repair this important power plant before the month is  over in an effort to restore services to the limited level the  people were receiving before the plant went off-line. Problems  like these, which pose a daily inconvenience for the entire  population and generate severe economic problems because they  paralyze various services that require electricity, are  characteristic of the critical economic situation Cuba has  suffered ever since the USSR collapsed and the full burden of  the criminal blockade imposed more than 30 years ago by the U.S.  Government was brought to bear on the country.    This blockade has now been intensified by the well-known  Torricelli amendment, whose purpose is to extend the so-called  embargo to all of the countries that maintain commercial ties  with Cuba. This is yet one more difficulty the Cuban people  must deal with. It is perhaps one of the main difficulties, if  you will, but certainly not the only one, because the industrial  sector is nearly paralyzed by a shortage of fuel, replacement  parts, lubricants, fertilizers, and numerous other resources  which, in turn, has created the worst economic situation in the  country's history.    A situation like this would have made the best of the  capitalist or so-called democratic-representative governments  collapse. In Cuba, however, we have a heroic people who are  resisting, because they know what they are defending, and  because they are fully aware of what they would lose with the  disappearance of their socialist system, which has brought them  so many achievements, not only material, but also moral and  spiritual. This is why the Cuban people voted overwhelmingly in  favor of the revolution headed by Fidel Castro during the recent  elections. This is why Cuba has so much strength and prestige  throughout the world. This is why the Cuban people will  continue fighting until they achieve victory.</p>

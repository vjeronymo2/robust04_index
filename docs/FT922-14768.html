			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Finance and The Family (The Election and You): Good news hits M&amp;G launch M&amp;G MUST think that every silver lining has a cloud. The group announced this week that the launch of its Recovery investment trust had raised Pounds 129.8m. This was the second biggest investment trust launch, beaten only by M&amp;G's own Income trust, launched last October. The figure fell far short of expectations - M&amp;G had aimed to raise at least Pounds 300m, with capacity for Pounds 1bn. However, the shortfall was thanks to two items of excellent news for M&amp;G and the rest of the fund management industry. Managers had long called for the annual limit on investment and unit trust Personal Equity Plans to be raised to Pounds 6,000. In the Budget on March 10 they at last got their wish. Pep providers have also been running scared of a return to power by Labour, which at one time seemed set on abolishing the plans. But on February 13, the party made clear it would keep Peps in the short-term, and expand them in the longer term. This was excellent news for the fund management industry. But it was bad news for the Recovery trust, which was launched to exploit a loophole for newly launched investment trusts and timed to allow investment in both tax years 1991-92 and 1992-93, thus protecting against Labour. M&amp;G had expected heavier investment for 1992-93 because demand for this year had already been soaked up by its Income trust. In the event, the group took more money for 1991-92. Next year, the option of putting Pounds 6,000 in a unit trust Pep, with no risk of sinking to a discount, or in an investment trust Pep, where bargains might be available if shares are already at a discount, will look much more appealing. M&amp;G admitted that the final returns were disappointing, but pointed out that the group had in six months completed the two biggest investment trust launches yet. Roger Jennings, marketing manager, said he was convinced that investors would be pleased with the trust's performance, and that the timing had been right to buy 'recovery' stocks.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by AL-BALAD PRESS and 'Abd-al-Jabbar al-Barghuthi] </F>   [Text] Gaza -- Lawyer Furayh Abu-Middayn, member of the  Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip, said that the storm  raised by Israel regarding President 'Arafat's statement in  Johannesburg, in which he compared the Palestinian-Israeli  agreement to the Peace of al-Hudaybiyyah, is just a tempest in a  teacup designed to block the way to negotiations about the final  stage. He added that he firmly believes that the Meretz  Movement and its ministers are no less extreme than Rabin. They  are all gripped by ideological rather than security fears. He  said that at this time the Israeli Government wants to distort  the image of the National Authority in Gaza and Jericho around  the world and to portray it as being unable to shoulder its  responsibilities in order to block the possibility of spreading  Palestinian self-rule to the other parts of the West Bank.    He expressed surprise at Israel's claims that the  Palestinian  security forces are unable to control the situation in the Gaza  Strip. This is despite the Israeli Government's knowledge that  the donor states have so far not fulfilled their promises to  equip the Palestinian police forces. For example, the  Palestinian security forces have no radio equipment. They also  have no suitable logistical means. The military vehicles they  are using now are large and old and unsuitable for the task.    Abu-Middayn asked: How could any police force in the world  carry out its duties successfully without such necessary  equipment? He noted that the Israeli Army with all its might  could not prevent operations against Israeli targets for the  past 27 years, whereas now the Israelis are demanding that the  Palestinian security forces control the situation in the  self-rule areas within a few days.    He said that if the purpose is to show that the Palestinians  have failed the test and to involve them in a civil war, we say  clearly that intra-Palestinian fighting is prohibited, and the  Palestinians will frustrate the hopes of those who are wagering  on such war.    Regarding the National Authority's efforts to collect the  weapons in the Gaza Strip, Abu-Middayn said that there are about  20,000 weapons, 80 percent of which are in the possession  regular citizens. These must be collected. Those who wish to  keep their weapons must get a license from the appropriate  Palestinian authority. Regarding the remaining 20 percent of  weapons, they are in the possession of factions, and we must  discuss the issue with them in order to maintain purity of arms.    He added that in its bid to collect the weapons, the  authority will not raid houses and search them. It will ban  people from carrying weapons in the streets and public places.    Abu-Middayn expressed the view that the Rabin  Administration's refusal to evacuate the settlements in the Gaza  Strip will perpetuate the friction, complicating matters on the  scene and prompting some people to hold on to their weapons for  self-defense against attacks by the settlers.    He said: Despite limited resources, we have started building  legislative and judicial systems, and we will prove to the world  that we can establish an independent Palestinian state.</p>

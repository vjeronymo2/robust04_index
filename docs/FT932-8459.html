			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ulster picks who empties its bins - How little real power is at stake in the council elections IN South Armagh, one of furthest-flung corners of the UK, the only indication that local elections are taking place in Northern Ireland today are the occasional posters advertising the local Sinn Fein candidates. At the border village of Cullaville, where in the space of one mile one crosses from the republic, into Northern Ireland and back into the republic again, a more ominous hand-painted poster proclaims 'The barracks buster. Reliable, accurate, effective.' referring to the IRA's latest heavy mortar weapon. Irish flags fly from the lampposts. Unlike the main roads that traverse the border, there are no army checkpoints here. The only indication that one has crossed back into the north is the better road surface. A few miles further on at Crossmaglen a fortified police and army post, bristling with radio antennae and observation towers, dominates the town's square. A faded British flag flutters over the fortifications. The locals refer to it disparagingly as 'the outpost'. Conversation in the pubs centres on the fortunes of the local Gaelic football teams. When the subject of politics is broached most people say they are Sinn Fein supporters. One man has his own question: 'Now what would an Englishman be doing in Crossmaglen?' Since direct rule from Westminster was imposed at the height of the troubles in 1972 the province's councils have been stripped of most of their powers. They administer cemeteries, garbage disposal and road cleaning, and have some discretionary spending. But they have no say in affairs normally associated with local government on the mainland, such as health, education, housing and policing. Across the province about 930 candidates are contesting 582 seats in 26 district councils. As in the general elections, national politics are of little importance here. What will be tested instead is the balance of power between the two unionist parties, the DUP and the UUP, and between the two nationalist parties the SDLP, and Sinn Fein. The outcome may have a strong bearing on whether the political talks process, abandoned last November without agreement, can be put back on the rails. In the last local elections in 1989 the more extreme of the two sides - the DUP and Sinn Fein, suffered setbacks at the expense of the more moderate and conciliatory UUP and SDLP. The expectation is that should that trend be confirmed in today's elections the British and Irish governments will be able to cajole the main parties back to the negotiating table. A swing to the extremes will make the task much more difficult. But even should the moderates achieve further gains today, deep differences remain between the UUP and SDLP on the timing of introducing greater local powers. The UUP manifesto demands 'an immediate restoration of accountable democracy in Northern Ireland - the present system, wherein the most mundane local problem can only be resolved by a department of central government or a minister, is both remote and unresponsive.' The SDLP has deep reservations about giving greater powers to local government, outside the framework of a broader political settlement. The SDLP prides itself on having introduced power sharing at local government level with Unionist politicians, where the SDLP has been in a majority. In Derry for example, an SDLP majority on the council rotates the position of mayor, which is currently held by a member of the DUP. The SDLP manifesto says: 'Belfast City Council on the other hand, controlled at present by a Unionist coalition, has become a by-word for sectarian, obstructionist politics of a kind that most of us hoped we had seen the last of 20 years ago.' The recent talks between Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, has alarmed unionists who view it as the emergence of a 'pan-nationalist front' comprising the two parties and the Dublin government. Although both Mr Hume and Sinn Fein emphatically deny they have agreed to any electoral pact, the fact of them talking and issuing joint political statements on the peace process could influence supporters to use their transferable votes under the proportional representation system in the province to support each others' candidates. Sinn Fein have been told by all parties to the talks process that they cannot expect a seat at the negotiating table until they first renounce violence. Today's results are unlikely to change that position. But the Loyalist gun attack on the Sinn Fein offices in Belfast on Monday would seem to underline deep-seated Unionist fears of where the political process may be heading.</p>

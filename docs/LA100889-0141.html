			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESS OKS CONTENT CURBS ON ARTS FUNDING;  </P> <P> BUT MEASURE DOES NOT ENTIRELY BAR MONEY FOR SHOCKING OR SACRILEGIOUS WORKS  </P> <P> The Senate approved and sent to President Bush on Saturday a bill that for the  first time imposes content restrictions on federally funded art, but it does  not completely rule out funding of shocking or sacrilegious works.  </P> <P> The legislation, which cleared the Senate by a vote of 91 to 6, represented a  victory for arts community leaders in their long-running struggle with  conservatives over what criteria the federal government should use in funding  art, music, literature and dance.  </P> <P> Bush is expected to sign the bill, which also provides funds for the Interior  Department and contains provisions to protect an endangered owl, restrict  government lobbyists and limit preliminary oil leasing activity off the coast  of California.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Helms' Bid Rejected  </P> <P> By a vote of 62 to 35, the Senate rejected a last-ditch effort by Sen. Jesse  Helms (R-N.C.) to set stricter limitations on the prerogatives of the National  Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities to fund  lewd or sacrilegious works. It was the third time in a week that the Senate had  defeated Helms on what has become a hotly debated free speech issue.  </P> <P> And even though Helms acknowledged he had been foiled by the intense lobbying  of what he disdainfully called "the arts crowd," he and like-minded senators  did not give up easily.  </P> <P> As senators filed into the chamber to vote, Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.), a Helms  ally, positioned himself at the door with some of the federally funded  black-and-white photographs that provoked the uproar: Andres Serrano's  depiction of a cross in a bottle of urine and Robert Mapplethorpe's photos of  homosexual acts and sexual conduct by children.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Question of Judgment  </P> <P> The legislation states that no federal funds should be spent "to promote,  disseminate or produce materials which in the judgment of the National  Endowment for the Arts or the National Endowment for the Humanities may be  considered obscene, including but not limited to depictions of sadomasochism,  homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of children or individuals engaged in  sex acts and which, when taken as a whole, do not have serious literary,  artistic, political or scientific value."  </P> <P> While many senators portrayed it as a fair compromise between conservatives and  the arts community, Helms said the language contains an enormous loophole --  "so big you could drive 12 Mack trucks through it" -- that allows endowment  officials to determine what kind of art violates the statute. He said the  loophole was unacceptable to him since officials involved in funding Serrano  and Mapplethorpe refuse to acknowledge making a mistake.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Nothing More Than a Sop'  </P> <P> "It would prohibit nothing, absolutely nothing," Helms declared. "It was  nothing more than a sop to fool the American people into thinking that the  liberal majority in Congress was actively willing to do something to stop  federal funding of obscene material . . . . Any yo-yo can get himself a glass  jar and fill it with urine and he can stick a crucifix in it and get $5,000, as  one did whose name is Andres Serrano."  </P> <P> Helms noted that Rep. Sidney R. Yates (D-Ill.), who was instrumental in  weakening proposed restrictions on NEA during negotiations between the House  and Senate, had recently received a standing ovation at an arts community event  for his success in defeating Helms.  </P> <P> Indeed, many arts community leaders embraced the compromise, even though some  legal experts question whether it is constitutional and gay activists fear it  might prompt a backlash against all art dealing with homosexual subjects.  </P> <P> Helms, who met last week with incoming NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer, said he  was convinced that the newly appointed endowment chief would not fund anything  objectionable to Congress. But he said he could not trust that Frohnmayer's  successors would take the same attitude.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wording of Helms' Provision  </P> <P> The substitute provision proposed by Helms and rejected by the Senate would  have outlawed the expenditure of federal funds "to promote, disseminate or  produce materials that are obscene or that depict or describe in a patently  offensive way, sexual or excretory activities or organs, including but not  limited to obscene depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual  exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sexual intercourse."  </P> <P> Helms said his language was based on Supreme Court definitions of what  constitutes obscenity and thus gave the NEA no discretion in interpreting the  law. Opponents said it would be impractical to take the decision out of the  hands of the NEA.  </P> <P> Although it has frequently been debated as a First Amendment issue, most  senators accepted Helms' argument that the refusal of the government to fund  offensive artworks does nothing to abridge the free expression of artists, who  still can produce these works with private funds.  </P> <P> But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said the new restrictions represented the  first step in a campaign by conservative "know-nothings" to abolish federal  support for the arts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sets Up Panel  </P> <P> The legislation establishes a 12-member commission to review the standards and  grant-making procedures of the endowments. It also requires the endowments to  notify Congress before making any grants to the Southeastern Center for  Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem, N.C., and the Institute for Contemporary Art  at the University of Pennsylvania, both of which presented controversial art  shows last year.  </P> <P> The reaction within the arts community to the Senate vote was cautious.  </P> <P> "I hope it is over," said Frohnmayer, the Portland, Ore., lawyer who takes over  Tuesday as the national endowment's new chairman.  </P> <P> Even if Helms abandons his efforts to win legislative approval of more  restrictive directives, Frohnmayer said the Senate vote does not signal a final  resolution of the controversy over the content of federally funded art.  </P> <P> "It's obviously something we're going to have to deal with over the coming  years," he said. "I also hope, as I have told Sen. Helms, that what this really  boils down to in the end is judgment of those who are in charge of the NEA. I  now would hope that they would give me an opportunity to exercise that  judgment."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Future of Spotted Owl  </P> <P> Although the limitation on arts funding dominated debate over the Interior  Department funding bill, it was by no means the only important provision in the  legislation. The measure also affects the future of the endangered spotted owl,  sets restrictions on lobbyists seeking money from the federal government and  calls for a presidential task force to look into the environmental concerns  involved in oil and gas drilling off the coast of California.  </P> <P> Sen. Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.) said the bill's provisions governing timberland  inhabited by the spotted owl reflect a 50-50 compromise that does not fully  satisfy either environmentalists or timber interests, which claim that court  orders protecting wildlife habitats are destroying their industry.  </P> <P> The issue arose when the Senate voted to free timber sales in Washington and  Oregon from court-ordered bans on logging. Under the compromise, Congress  agreed to reduce the allowable level of timber sales somewhat and require  environmentalists to chose which of the timber sales now blocked by the courts  will be allowed to proceed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tied to HUD Scandal  </P> <P> The lobbying restrictions were authored originally by Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.  Va.) in response to the scandal at the Department of Housing and Urban  Development. They will require detailed reports to be filed by lobbyists and  prohibit recipients of federal grants from using tax dollars to finance their  lobbying efforts.  </P> <P> The provisions governing offshore drilling grew out of an effort by the House  to place a moratorium on all activity leading up to the leasing of oil and gas  tracts off the California coast. The compromise stipulates that no draft  environmental impact statement on the proposed leasing can be issued until five  months after a presidential task force releases the results of an inquiry into  what effect drilling would have on the environment.  </P> <P> Staff writer Allan Parachini in Los Angeles contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OWNERS, PLAYERS NEAR SETTLEMENT OVER COLLUSION  </P> <P> Baseball owners today gave their labor negotiators approval to make a collusion  settlement with the players.  </P> <P> "In essence, we can consider the collusion agreement concluded," said Chuck  O'Connor, general counsel of the Players Relations Committee. "We don't have a  definite document yet -- there is still some language to work out -- but we  have points of agreement."  </P> <P> O'Connor said the agreement will be sent to the Players Assn. and a vote is  expected at the union's winter meeting in Orlando, Fla., on Thursday.  </P> <P> If the proposal is approved, as expected, the owners will pay $280 million in  collusion damages and 16 players will again become free agents. Among the  players involved are Gary Gaetti and Dave Smith.  </P></p>

			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (16): Good time to hunt for bargains - Investment trust / David Wighton looks at Legal &amp; General's latest idea With venture capitalists sitting on more funds for buy-outs than there are buy-outs to fund, managers are coming up with some ingenious ideas to increase their share of the action. Legal &amp; General Ventures' latest notion is an investment trust which will invest primarily in companies recently floated by management buy-out and buy-in teams. Charles Peal, managing director, admits that one of the main aims behind the trust is to support the company's own buy-out funds. He hopes that buy-outs will be keener to bring Legal &amp; General Ventures in on the original deal if they think that the new trust will take shares in the eventual flotation - the very time when other venture capitalists want to exit. 'In this respect the concept is similar to Mithras Investment Trust, the first investment trust in the UK to specialise in mezzanine loans which we formed earlier this year.' The new trust will reserve up to 25 per cent of its assets for unquoted investment in buy-outs and buy-ins. This should ensure that it can take a full allocation of new issues which other fund managers may find are oversubscribed. It will also give it the benefit of knowing the buy-out for some time before making its decision on flotation. And with luck the unquoted portfolio should also deliver a useful boost to the trust's overall performance. However, this will depend mainly on the progress of the flotations. And recent experience of buy-out new issues is not encouraging. The past few months have brought several disappointments and spectacular flops. Shares in Aerostructures Hamble and McDonnell Information Systems have tumbled after profit warnings issued very shortly after their flotations. They seemed to confirm the widely-held view that buy-out/buy-ins should be treated with even more caution than other flotations. According to this argument venture capitalists are only interested in getting as high a price as possible on flotation and managements are only too happy to go along with them if the size of their own stake is dependent on the price. Critics also point to the danger that highly geared buy-out companies have been starved of capital to invest in the business, reducing future growth prospects. However, while these arguments might seem plausible, there is little evidence to suggest that buy-outs underperform after flotation. Indeed, the studies that have been done tend to show the opposite. Last year stockbrokers James Capel constructed an index of all buy-outs with a market capitalisation of more than Pounds 40m starting at the beginning of 1986. The companies were removed from the index three years after flotation on the grounds that, after a time, their characteristics become more typical of a quoted company than of a buy-out. The index, which included 32 companies, outperformed the the FT-SE All-Share index almost fourfold in the eight years to September 1993. Capel has recently updated the research and the results for the past year are not quite so impressive since many of the companies that came to market in early 1994 were overpriced. But buy-out flotations overall have still outperformed their stock market sectors. Work by SG Warburg Securities has reached similar conclusions and older studies in the US also support the case. Mr Peal believes the results are not surprising. 'The success of these ex-buy-outs and ex-buy-ins is attributed to the motivation of the management, whose personal fortunes were made as founding shareholders in the original buy-out or buy-in.' He points out that most managements retain the bulk of their shareholdings after flotation giving them every incentive to make the company perform. He also believes that the disciplines imposed by venture capitalists are healthy. 'Under venture capital control managements are obsessed with profits and cash flow rather than turnover and market share.' Former buy-outs tend to be highly focused and lean companies with good managements. Weak managers usually do not survive the weight of the buy-out structure and the scrutiny of the venture capital backers. Many buy-outs have been extremely successful after flotation such as Hays, Compass, Trinity and Fairey. Moreover several that blotted their copybooks shortly after flotation, like Holliday Chemicals and Kenwood, have since recovered fully. The market is now so nervous about buy-out flotations that go wrong that Mr Peal believes share prices over-react on the merest hint of bad news. Regarding these as buying opportunities the trust has invested in a number of the recent casualties. Formed in 1986 as Group Development Capital Trust, it had decided to liquidate itself in the middle of this year when Legal &amp; General, the largest shareholder with 26 per cent, proposed taking over as manager and changing the investment policy. It has just raised Pounds 18m from a share issue, taking its total value to more than Pounds 30m, with Legal &amp; General increasing its stake to 49 per cent. The new trust aims to pick the top 25 per cent of all the former buy-outs and buy-ins that have come to the market since the beginning of 1990. There have been more than 60 above its minimum flotation size of Pounds 25m with a total value of Pounds 5bn. On top of a core portfolio of around 15 stocks the trust will aim to invest in about one in four of all new former buy-out flotations. The objective of the new investment policy is to generate a total return in excess of the FT-SE All-Share index. If it can achieve this after three years or more then its directors and managers qualify for a 5 per cent option package. The options are exercisable between years three and seven only if the All-Share hurdle has been exceeded by 1.25 per cent a year compound. The trust has attracted a heavyweight chairman in the form of Lord Sheppard, chairman and chief executive of Grand Metropolitan, who has considerable experience of buy-outs from all angles. The trust has timed its rebirth pretty well. Not only are several of the recent buy-out flops trading at very depressed levels the disasters have made investors extremely cautious about new buy-out flotations driving prices down. Mr Peal is not the only one who believes that now is a good time to hunt for bargains.</p>

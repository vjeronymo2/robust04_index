			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow weaker despite Fed support for dollar Wall Street After holding their ground in early trading following successful intervention by the Federal Reserve to support the dollar, US share prices tumbled yesterday afternoon as the market resumed its downward path, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 26.24 lower at 3,837.13. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.92 at 466.50, while the American SE composite declined 1.34 to 454.18 and the Nasdaq composite eased 0.37 to 771.82. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 333.2m shares. From the start, the stock market fell in the wake of lower bond prices, which were pulled down by a weakening dollar. At one point, when the dollar had dropped to a post-1945 low and the 30-year bond yield was at a 2 1/2  year high, the Dow dropped by more than 20 points. But equities later recovered, albeit temporarily, after Fed intervention in the currency markets wiped out early morning losses in the dollar, helping bond yields retreat from their earlier highs. The Fed's intervention was welcomed by investors, who had feared that the central bank would allow the dollar to keep falling. Apart from the damage a weak dollar inflicts on the bond market, equity investors feared that a weakening US currency would make stocks unattractive to foreign buyers. Later in the afternoon, stocks began to slip lower as the dollar's recovery faded, and the selling seen earlier in the week resumed. The day's economic news, meanwhile, had little impact on trading. The Commerce Department reported no change in its index of leading economic indicators for September and revised August's figures downward. The government also reported that factory orders declined 0.2 per cent in September, a turnround from the 4.7 per cent rise in the previous month, and the Fed released its Beige Book report on the economy showing continued expansion in business activity. Quaker Oats dropped Dollars 7 3/8 to Dollars 67 1/8 in volume of 2.7m shares on news that the company planned to buy Snapple Beverage, the soft drinks group, for Dollars 14 a share, or Dollars 1.7bn, in cash. Quaker also said it would seek buyers for its European pet food and Mexican chocolate businesses. The sharp fall in share prices killed recent bid speculation surrounding the company, while the acquisition indicated a dilution of Quaker's earnings. Snapple, traded on the Nasdaq market, shed Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 13 3/4 in heavy trading. Technology stocks were strongly in favour at the start, but fell back with the market later in the day. IBM ended Dollars  3/8 up at Dollars 74 1/8 , Compaq Dollars  1/8 firmer at Dollars 40 5/8 , Digital Equipment Dollars 1/2 ahead at Dollars 30 3/8 and Hewlett-Packard Dollars  1/4 harder at Dollars 97 5/8 . Eli Lilly rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 63 on expectations that the Federal Trade Commission will announce an agreement today with the company to allow the drugmaker to purchase PCS, a drugs distributor. On the Nasdaq market, technology issues performed well. Intel climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 62 1/2 , Microsoft added Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 63 and Lotus Development appreciated Dollars 1 to Dollars 39 1/4 . The exception was Apple Computer, which slipped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 41 3/8 . Canada A late afternoon rally fizzled out as Canadian stock prices followed New York to leave the Toronto market sharply down and at its low for the session. The TSE 300 composite index was finally 35.47 off at 4,228.98 and declining issues outpaced advances by 414 to 304 after volume of 60m shares valued at CDollars 771m. Overall, 13 of the 14 sub-indices were down, led by real estate, consumer products, financial services and transportation stocks. Only the oil and gas sector posted a gain, a modest 0.04 per cent increase. The golds group receded 1.1 per cent as the New York spot bullion price eased 10 cents to USDollars 384.45 an ounce. Venezuela Equity prices in Caracas fell in thin activity, the Merinvest index losing 1.84 or 1.3 per cent at 142.08 after a drop of 2.2 per cent on Tuesday. Confusion was reported over rights to a one-for-six, Dollars 65m offer of shares by the benchmark utility Electricidad de Caracas. Affected by this the stock fell sharply in midsession, prompting the exchange to suspend trading while it consulted with the company. Trading in the stock did not resume. At the moment it was suspended, a half-hour before the end of the two-hour session, Electricidad was trading at 305.00 bolivars, down 8.50 bolivars on the day.</p>

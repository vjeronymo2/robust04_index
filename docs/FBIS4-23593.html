			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 9 Jun (AFP) -- The call by the opposition  Campaign for Democracy [CD] for civil disobedience last week in  Nigeria was made in agreement with the opposition National  Democratic Coalition [NADECO]. This was disclosed this evening  to AFP by a top NADECO official.    "Civil disobedience is part of NADECO's stipulated lines of  action. The CD is helping to organize it," added the official,  who was speaking by telephone from his hideout.    "For the moment, NADECO will not appear much in the  forefront  of the political scene, and will operate through several  organizations, including the CD," the same source said, while  refusing to disclose his identity.    The CD, which comprises nearly 40 human rights defense  committees and associations for democracy "is affiliated to  NADECO and closely collaborates with it," the official stated.    The CD had on 8 June called on Nigerians to stage a one-week  mass protest effective 13 June to press for the rapid departure  of the ruling military regime and the formation of a government  by Moshood Abiola, the self-proclaimed winner of the 12 June  1993 presidential election.</p>

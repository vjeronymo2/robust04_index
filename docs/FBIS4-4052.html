			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Liaowang Forum" by staff commentator: "Commodity Prices </F> Are Not Trifles"]    [Text] Since last winter and this spring, there have been  fairly sharp price rises, and this has evoked strong  repercussions among the masses. The party Central Committee and  the State Council are paying great attention to this. Recently,  the State Council has issued a series of circulars and adopted a  series of measures to curb unauthorized rises in prices and fees  and to standardize price behavior to meet the needs of  establishing a socialist market economy system and to keep price  rises for the basic necessities of life and service fees within  a range that most people can sustain.    At present, our country enjoys political stability and  economic prosperity, and the situation of reform and development  is good. However, some problems also exist in economic life that  should not be neglected. The fairly sharp rise in prices is a  prominent problem. Some enterprises have taken advantage of the  introduction of tax, exchange rate, and price reforms to drive  up prices. For the sake of local interests, some localities  have exceeded their own power in fixing prices and  indiscriminately collecting fees. Disregarding regulations on  putting goods on sale with clearly marked prices, some  businessmen have asked exorbitant prices, monopolized business,  cheated people in the same trade, and played the bully. They  have even caused consumers to suffer and sought staggering  profits by selling fake and shoddy products. All of this  illegal business behavior has pushed the general price level  higher and consequently injured the interests of the people. If  the above-mentioned behavior is not effectively checked and  problems are not solved in a timely fashion, it will inevitably  disrupt the normal price order in the market, affect the  people's lives and social stability, and be disadvantageous to  the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national  economy. Commodity prices are not trifles. Sufficient  attention should be attached to them.    The causes of the price hikes are varied. There are problems  in economic operations, in macroeconomic regulation and control  and management, and in the ideological understanding of leaders  in some localities and departments. To solve these problems, it  is fundamental to grasp both aspects of our work: The first is  to do a good job of macroeconomic regulation and control in  economic operations and to keep an overall balance in the  economy. It is most important to control the scale of  fixed-assets investment, and, at the same time, rein in the  overgrowth of consumption funds. The second is to develop  production and ensure market supply. Special attention should  be paid to strengthening agriculture to maintain growth in farm  products, especially major farm products such as grain, cotton  and edible oil, and to grasp the "shopping basket project" to  ensure market supply.    We should have a correct understanding of the price problem.  The fluctuation in grain prices which occurred in November and  December last year has sent us a warning: In practicing a  socialist market economy, we should by no means let go our hold  of and take no further interest in prices, especially of the  basic necessities of life and service fees. One view holds that  practicing a market economy means completely letting go our hold  and depending wholly on regulation by market mechanisms.  Whoever wants to practice macroeconomic regulation and control  and provide necessary guidance and carry out necessary  intervention in prices is considered to be going against the  laws governing the market economy and returning to the old ways  of the planned economy. This viewpoint is wrong. Practice over  the past few months offers a clear answer to this problem:  Macroeconomic regulation and control is necessary and  appropriate government behavior in the course of building a  socialist market economic structure. All countries in the  world, including developed ones, do the same thing. In the  course of establishing a socialist market economic structure and  changing the old system to a new one, it is necessary to carry  out macroeconomic regulation and control and exercise necessary  price supervision. If we let things go adrift, the price order  will be disrupted, price violations will not be stopped, and  economic construction and reform will be affected.    There are also others who ask: Have we not liberalized our  prices after carrying out price reforms for many years? Why  should we supervise and inspect the prices of some goods? Does  this conform to the orientation of reform? This viewpoint  reflects some comrades who do not have a correct understanding  of price reform. In carrying out price reform, it is of course  necessary to gradually abolish means of production and means of  living prices that were controlled too tightly under the planned  economic system and to form market price mechanisms. In the  past few years, we have done this and have achieved great  results. But price liberalization is only part of price reform.  The final goal of price reform lies in doing away with the  price system and price formation mechanisms that were  established under the planned economic structure and  establishing a new price formation mechanism and a system of  inspection and control which is in keeping with the socialist  market economic structure. This is a task where we have a long  way. It does not conform to the requirements of price reform to  let prices go adrift without control before a new price  formation mechanism is perfected. Through practice, we should  gradually establish and perfect a new price formation mechanism  by way of price liberalization and the necessary means of  supervision, inspection, and intervention to make it conform  with the socialist market economic structure and finally  accomplish the task of price reform.    There are also some comrades who hold that it does not  matter to have a certain amount of price hikes as the people's  living standards have greatly improved and their capacity to  sustain price hikes has been strengthened. After over 10 years  of reform, the overwhelming majority of the people have actually  benefited from the reform, and their lives have improved  remarkably. However, in view of the uneven development in  various regions in our country, we must not overestimate this.  It is our duty to be responsible to the people. We must take  measures to bring price hikes for services and basic  necessities, which are closely related to the people's daily  life and of immediate concern to their interests, within a range  which most people can sustain. The practice of indiscriminately  raising prices and collecting charges should by no means be left  unchecked.    It is an important task at present to overcome the  above-mentioned erroneous or vague understandings, unify our  thinking, take unified action, carry out conscientiously the  series of State Council directives, do a good job of price  inspection, do a really good job of supervising and inspecting  prices of basic necessities and service items, curb price  violations, standardize the market price order, and rein in  excessive rises in the general level of price. Only when we do  a good job of this can we stabilize the people's lives, maintain  social stability, and create a good environment for economic  development and the battle to storm heavily fortified positions  of reform which began this year.</p>

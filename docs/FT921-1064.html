			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Hardship in the high street: In the sober 1990s, retailing is undergoing a sea change For British retailers, the 1980s are a dim memory. As the big groups report falls in profits and predict further shake-outs in the high street, the extent to which the recession has reversed industry fortunes is painfully clear. The 1980s saw an unprecedented surge in consumer spending, which led to a relentless flow of ever-increasing profits and swept the industry into a state of near-frenzied excitement. The slogan 'shop 'til you drop' seemed to sum up the spirit of the age. As John Brady, a partner at McKinsey, the management consultant, says: 'The 1980s were a dream for retailers - an era when almost anybody on the high street made money just by being there.' Now, even the stronger retailers are struggling. On Monday, Argos, the catalogue showroom retailer, reported a 17 per cent fall in profits and spoke of 'the most difficult retailing environment since the company was founded in 1973'. Yesterday, the Kingfisher group, which embraces B&amp;Q, Woolworths, Superdrug and Comet, announced a 10 per cent fall in pre-tax profits after exceptional items and forecast restructuring among its weaker competitors. High streets throughout the country have been transformed as familiar retailing landmarks have been hit. The Lewis's department stores which dominated town centres in many provincial cities collapsed last year. And, according to figures from KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, more than 300 retailers went into receivership last year. While the overall picture is bleak, there are glimmers of light. Food retailers have remained largely immune from the downturn because of stable demand. And investment is picking up. 3i (Investors in Industry), the venture capital company, reports an accelerating investment trend as small, financially sound independent chains (mainly from the north of England and Scotland) expand in the depressed areas of the Midlands and the south-east. Overseas retailers have also been quick to enter the UK market in an effort to build market share. Five of the six biggest acquisitions of UK retailers last year were made by overseas companies, with famous names such as Daks Simpson and Harvey Nichols falling to buyers from the Far East. These new entrants will only intensify the pressures on established UK retailers, adding to fears about their future profitability. Compounding the grim outlook, there is a growing belief that a sea change in the nature of retailing has recently taken place, and that the 1990s will pose unparalleled challenges. The constraints of belonging to the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System are likely to ensure that the UK economy will experience slower - if more stable - rates of economic growth than in previous decades. 'Sales growth in the 1970s was driven by inflation and in the 1980s by very high levels of consumer credit,' says Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman and chief executive of Marks and Spencer, the food and clothing retailer. 'Life will be much tougher in the 1990s. There won't be so much margin for error.' In the 1980s, retail sales, fuelled by financial deregulation and strong economic growth, increased in real terms by 20 per cent. Verdict, the retail consultants, suggest that in 1990-95 sales will rise by 8.3 per cent. The rising costs of operating on the high street will continue to squeeze margins. The retailers' main occupancy costs - rents, rates, electricity and security - are continuing to increase at a faster rate than sales. Although new rent levels are beginning to fall fast, many retailers are still facing a rising bill because they are bound by five-year contracts which reflect the excessive demand levels of the late 1980s, when retailers bid up prices in their scramble to acquire new sites. The Uniform Business Rate, introduced in 1990, has also imposed a heavy burden on many retailers. As a result of the UBR, a national chain stores group faced an average annual increase of 15 per cent in its rates bill for the following five years. Last month's Budget gave retailers a 'breathing space' by freezing this year's rates increase but the cost pressures will resume next year. The possible introduction of a minimum wage if the Labour party wins the general election will add another element to cost pressures. The UK retail market currently suffers from a structural imbalance: put simply, there are too many shops chasing too few sales. The recession may have helped choke off some of the more speculative retail developments, but big chains, such as Sears and Ratners Group, are now closing stores in the saturated shoe and jewellery markets. In the US, excess retail capacity has led to the era of the 'permanent sale' to the detriment of retailers' margins. Some retailers fear that a similar, if smaller-scale, phenomenon has developed in the UK as the recession has resulted in widespread price cuts. The changing nature of consumer demand will also impose new constraints. First, the recession has encouraged the growth of discount stores with implications for all retailers. 'It doesn't mean that you have to discount like a crazy man. But you will have to provide the consumer with consistent evidence of value,' says Sir James Blyth, chief executive of Boots, the chemists. Second, the environmental movement has spawned an increase in 'ethical shoppers' who are concerned about the consequences of their consumption. Third, the ageing population is leading many retailers to adapt their approach to customers. The Ratners jewellery chain thrived on selling 'flash trash' to teenagers but will have to redefine its target market as young people decline as a percentage of the population. All of these considerations are likely to accentuate the trend towards strengthening the strong and weakening the weak, a development which has been such a marked feature of the recession. On one hand retailers such as Marks and Spencer, Boots, W H Smith and John Lewis Partnership, have battled their way through the downturn in reasonable shape. Their resilience stems from strong customer loyalty, conservative financing and low operating costs. M and S, for example, retains a Pounds 1.3bn portfolio of freehold property, accounting for 28 per cent of all that held in the retailing sector. Unlike many competitors, M and S has largely sidestepped the cost pressures from increasing rents. According to a study by Nikko Securities, the Japanese stockbroker, M and S's rent bill represents only 1.1 per cent of its Pounds 5.8bn yearly sales, compared with 8.3 per cent of Pounds 1.7bn annual sales at Burton Group, the next biggest competitor in the clothing industry, which sold and leased back its freehold sites. Another group of relative winners may be called the scientifically-managed companies, which rely far more on professional management skills than retailing flair. Retailers such as Argos and Kingfisher place a premium on 'backroom' retailing functions, emphasising cost control, the effective use of information technology, and the efficient management of goods from the suppliers' gates to their shop shelves. On the other hand, weaker retailing companies have suffered more from cost pressures on the high street. In many cases their problems have been compounded by over-expansion and financial over-extension. Seduced by the appeal of a seemingly good idea, retailers such as Sock Shop expanded beyond their capacity to manage effectively. Others, such as Burton Group, diversified disastrously into property development. Many of the glamour stocks of the 1980s, such as fashion groups Next, Laura Ashley and Storehouse (which runs BhS, Habitat and Mothercare), have seen drastic falls in their profitability, but have assured their survival by slimming operations and reducing high levels of debt by means of asset disposals. But how rapidly they can return to sustained profitability remains open to doubt. Although their profits may rebound quickly when sales recover, they will face a longer-term struggle to remain competitive against nimble independent chains and aggressive forms of retailing, especially in out-of-town locations. One of the most notable examples of the so-called 'category killer' - which sells high volumes of discounted goods, killing competitors in a chosen market - is Toys 'R' Us. In the seven years it has operated in the UK, the US-based chain has revolutionised the UK toy market. Its 33 stores have seized almost a fifth of the total market, leading to the demise of a string of smaller specialist chains. The concept is spreading to other sectors: Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer, has opened three stores with great success; PC World, a privately owned computer retailer, has opened a discount computer superstore in Croydon and is set to open another outlet in north London by May. Nevada Bob, the US-owned chain of golf shops, has six outlets in the UK and plans to open more than 40 stores by 1995. The internationalisation of retailing, spurred by the recession, is raising both competitive pressures and opportunities for UK retailers. Many groups, from John Menzies to Dixons, which both fell foul of differences in the US market when they entered it in the 1980s, have experienced the pitfalls of trying to export a winning formula. In the 1990s, the emphasis is shifting from acquisitions in north America to slow, but steady expansion of existing stores in Europe. M and S, for example, has switched its focus from North America, where it owns the Brooks Brothers clothing stores and the King's supermarket chain, towards growth opportunities in Europe. Sir Richard Greenbury describes expansion in Europe as the company's 'immediate priority', and says he aims to open 40 stores as quickly as suitable sites become available. As a more subdued retailing climate evolves over the 1990s, the industry will be faced with the challenge of extracting growing profits from a static sales base. To do this, it will have to squeeze extra productivity from existing physical and human assets; it will need tighter management; and it will have to create demand, not just satisfy it. But although the heady days of the 1980s have long since faded, the principles that underpin retailing remain the same. As Sir Simon Hornby, chairman of W H Smith, the chain of newsagents, says: 'Retailing is nothing more than putting the right product in the right place at the right price.' Yet never has it been so difficult to achieve something so seemingly simple.</p>

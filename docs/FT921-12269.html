			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Mexico sells Serfin to Obsa THE MEXICAN government has sold Banca Serfin, the country's third largest bank, to Grupo Financiero Operadora de Bolsa (Obsa) for Dollars 918m. Obsa, Mexico's largest retail brokerage measured by branches, paid 8,065 pesos (Dollars 2.62) per share, valuing the bank at 2.69 times book value. The next and only other bid was for Dollars 870m, or 2.55 times book value. The sale of Serfin puts the proceeds from the 10 bank privatisations so far at more than Dollars 8.1bn, well above government and independent forecasts. The Finance Ministry expects to have sold the eight banks still in government hands by the middle of this year. All the large banks - including Banamex, Bancomer, and now Serfin  - have been sold to investors from brokerages. So far, all have formed integrated financial groups, and Obsa, which narrowly lost out when bidding for Bancomer last October, is expected to do the same. Obsa was once Mexico's high-flying brokerage, with a market capitalisation of Dollars 2bn at the height of 1987's stock market boom. But in the October 1987 crash its stock price collapsed, and at the time its president, Mr Eduardo Legorreta, was imprisoned in February 1989 for trading abuses, its share price was just 2 per cent of the pre-crash peak. Since then, its reputation and market value have recovered, and it is expected to form with Serfin one of Mexico's stronger financial groups. The investors are mainly from the industrial city of Monterrey, and are controlling shareholders in Vitro, Mexico's largest industrial conglomerate. Serfin is Mexico's oldest bank, and has assets of Dollars 22.1bn, 16 per cent of the total held by Mexican banks, 598 branches, and last year profits of Dollars 122m.</p>

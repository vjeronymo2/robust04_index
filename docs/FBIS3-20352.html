			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial report] Rome RAI Uno Television Network in  Italian at 2105 GMT on 29 March carries a 45-minute special  edition of the election program "Beyond Words" featuring  interviews with Achille Occhetto, leader of the Democratic Party  of the Left; Mino Marinazzoli, leader of the Italian Popular  Party; Gianfranco Fini, leader of the National Alliance; and  Silvio Berlusconi, leader of Forza Italia.    The interviews start with Democratic Party of the Left  leader  Achille Occhetto. Occhetto is asked by journalist Bruno Vespa  whether he feels Berlusconi could give Italy a stable  government. Occhetto says that as leader of the largest  grouping, Berlusconi should be called on by the president to  form a government. Occhetto says it will be difficult for three  very different parties in the alliance to gel into an effective  coalition, and that he will lead a strong oppostion, which will  make life difficult for the new government should Berlusconi  fail to maintain any of his promises. Occhetto says he most  fears "the social conflict caused by the Right all over Europe."  "I am afraid of French-style or Thatcherite policies," he says.    Forza Italia leader Berlusconi is interviewed next.  Berlusconi hopes he will be able to form a government quickly,  because the electorate has made its wish very clear. Berlusconi  tells journalist Bruno Vespa that he has resigned as chairman of  Fininvest and saw no conflict of interests. But, Berlusconi  says, "I have heard that some people say that if I want to be  prime minister, I must sell my companies. Let them come  forward. If there is someone willing to buy them from me, I  have nothing against it." He says that if someone offered to  buy a television channel from him he will hand one over and will  be happy if "the price is right, if it reflected the true value  of something that had been built with blood, sweat, and tears."    Vespa asks Berlusconi if he would step aside if he realized  that his bid to be prime minister would be a hindrance to  forming a government. Berlusconi says: "I would step aside  immediately if the proposed alternative solution was the better  solution."    Bruno Vespa finishes the interviews by asking National  Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini if he would accept Northern  League leader Umberto Bossi's candidate for the post of prime  minister, Roberto Maroni. Fini says he does not think a party  with a purely regional power base has the right to lead the  country as a whole.    Fini says he does not understand what the League means by  federalism and that this will have to be thrashed out since his  own party is committed to the unity of Italy, although it does  believe in more decentralization.    He says the economy should be the new government's priority  and that measures should be taken not only to provide tax relief  for small- and medium-sized companies so that they could  reinvest profits, but also to make it easier to employ people by  abolishing certain regulations.</p>

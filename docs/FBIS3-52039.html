The PFL [Liberal Front Party] has  managed to convince Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso  that revisions are in the best interest of the government.  After lunching with Fernando Henrique last week, Marco Maciel  (PE) [Pernambuco State] -- the PFL bloc leader in the Senate --  and Deputy Luis Eduardo Magalhaes (BA) [Bahia State] -- the PFL  bloc leader in the Chamber of Deputies -- believe the government  is the newest ally of the revisionists who are struggling for  votes now.    Maciel told JORNAL DO BRASIL yesterday afternoon: "We now  have a very important partner, namely the government." During  their lunch, the PFL leaders explained the importance of the  revision for the government's economic program. Neither the  fiscal adjustment nor the 1994 budget will be approved without  constitutional changes that necessarily involve a reform. The  senator claimed: "It is essential to begin the revision this  week." He guaranteed: "The minister totally agrees with this  point of view." [passage omitted]</p>

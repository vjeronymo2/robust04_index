			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Statoil tumbles by 40% to NKr2.5bn for 1992 STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday reported a 40 per cent slide in 1992 net profits to NKr2.5bn (Dollars 361.3m) from NKr4.1bn, caused mainly by a big operating loss in petrochemicals operations. Low oil prices and weak refinery margins also contributed to the downturn. The company has proposed to cut its dividend payment to the state - Statoil's owners - to NKr1.25bn from NKr1.4bn in 1991, but even at this level the payout would rise to 50 per cent of net profits, from 34 per cent in 1991. Group operating income rose last year to NKr79.4bn from NKr78.3bn, but operating profits fell to NKr12.5bn from NKr13.6bn in 1991. Petrochemicals saw a NKr500m decline in operating income to NKr5.5bn as operating losses widened to NKr438m from NKr30m. Statoil also suffered financial charges of NKr1.6bn, up from NKr1bn in 1991, which it blamed partially on a NKr489m loss on a swap arrangement in shares in Saga Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent oil company. The company issued a pessimistic outlook for its main markets in 1993 and warned it would be unable to generate sufficient cashflow from operations to finance immediate investment commitments. 'This imposes additional demands on the group's earnings and financial strength,' the company said. Ms Brit Rugland, vice-president of finance, said Statoil would seek to borrow between NKr4bn and NKr6bn in 1993, including refinancing of existing loans, and that investments would rise to NKr12bn from NKr7bn last year. The company plans a major international expansion in exploration and production operations in an effort to find fresh oil reserves to replenish a sharp decline in production expected by 1995-96. 'Access to new commercially recoverable reserves will strengthen Statoil's earnings in the long term,' it said. The group's estimated tax bill for 1992, at NKr8.5bn, is at last year's level, but Statoil said its effective tax rate had increased to 77 per cent in 1992, from 68 per cent in 1991.

			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PROP. A OPPONENTS SET SIGHTS ON '87 TRANSPORTATION SALES TAX  </P> <P> Buoyed by their legal victory overturning a half-cent sales tax for San Diego  jails and courtrooms, the political activists who won that case said Friday  they are considering filing another lawsuit to try to strike down a similar  1987 transportation sales tax.  </P> <P> However, before broadening their legal horizons, the group indicated that it  may first move to solidify Thursday's court ruling invalidating Proposition A,  the jails measure narrowly approved by San Diego voters last June, by seeking a  court order prohibiting the county from collecting the half-cent tax pending  appeals.  </P> <P> Emboldened by the ruling and with a bit of a swagger in their style,  Proposition A's opponents held a downtown news conference Friday at which they  both savored that victory -- one that, if upheld on appeal, poses far-reaching  implications -- and suggested that they may attempt to replicate it through  other lawsuits.  </P> <P> "This victory . . . refutes the old canard, 'You can't fight City Hall,' " said  San Diego Libertarian Party Chairman Dick Rider, a plaintiffs in the case. "We  did, and we won."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Declared Illegal  </P> <P> On Thursday, Riverside County Superior Court Judge Gordon Burkhart declared the  half-cent jails tax illegal on the grounds that its 50.6% approval at the polls  fell short of Proposition 13's requirement of a two-thirds vote for approval of  new taxes. Over its 10-year life, it is estimated that there would be about  $1.6 billion for new jails and courtrooms to alleviate San Diego's longstanding  jail crowding problem and a badly overextended court system.  </P> <P> Proposition A and the state legislation authorizing it, Burkhart wrote in his  decision, "purposely circumvented" the two-thirds margin mandated by  Proposition 13, the landmark property-tax cutting initiative approved by voters  statewide in 1978.  </P> <P> That same legal argument perhaps could be applied, Rider said, to a similar  half-cent sales tax for public transit, street improvements and highway  construction that San Diego voters approved by a 53%-47% margin in November,  1987. That measure -- which, ironically, also appeared on the ballot as  Proposition A -- is expected to raise about $2.25 billion for street and mass  transit programs over the next 20 years.  </P> <P> Both propositions relied upon "the same invalid subterfuge" to avoid the  two-thirds vote requirement by creating elections in which only a majority vote  was needed for approval, Rider and some of his fellow Libertarians argued  Friday.  </P> <P> "We still question whether or not that first (transit) tax is valid," Rider  said. "And we are seriously considering taking action against that tax. . . .  We will be pursuing some sort of remedy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Fundamental Difference'  </P> <P> However, even some of the seven defense lawyers who aligned themselves with the  Libertarians in the lawsuit against the jails tax expressed doubts Friday about  whether a similar case could be made against the transit sales tax.  </P> <P> "There is at least one fundamental difference," lawyer Thomas Homann said.  While Homann and his colleagues described the body set up to administer the  jails tax revenue a "a shell, a pseudo-agency" that is little more than an arm  of the county, he said he views a similar agency that oversees the transit  funds as being "truly separate and independent."  </P> <P> "The transportation agency was formed to perform a function which is not one  that traditionally was performed by the county," Homann said. "In this (jails)  case, what we have is a function which has traditionally, historically been  performed by the county -- that is, the construction of jails and courthouses."  </P> <P> If that factual distinction causes Homann to be skeptical about the feasibility  of challenging the transit tax, officials of the San Diego County Regional  Transportation Commission feel even more certain that they are on unassailable  legal ground.  </P> <P> "For a variety of reasons, we're convinced that the same challenge would not be  successful if made against the Transportation Commission," said Debra  Greenfield, general counsel of the 19-member panel that administers the transit  sales-tax funds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Elected Membership  </P> <P> Besides echoing Homann's observation that the transit board fulfills a function  "not provided by any other local government," Greenfield noted that the board's  membership, which includes elected representatives from the 18 local  incorporated cities and the county Board of Supervisors, further demonstrates  its "separate nature."  </P> <P> More importantly, the state legislation that enabled the half-cent transit tax  to be placed on the 1987 ballot established a six-month statute of limitations  for challenging the measure. Because that period has expired, it is too late  for a lawsuit similar to that which led to Thursday's ruling to be filed,  Greenfield said.  </P> <P> Libertarian leader Rider, however, suggested that a court might be persuaded to  waive the statute of limitations if it could be proved that the transit tax was  "patently unconstitutional."  </P> <P> "We don't agree with that conclusion," Greenfield responded.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Interest Conflict  </P> <P> Although another lawsuit remains problematical, both sides in the jails' case  continued Friday to attempt to sort out the short- and long-range ramifications  of Burkhart's ruling. Burkhart heard the case in Riverside County because of  San Diego judges' conflict of interest on a trial affecting courtroom space.  </P> <P> With the case expected to eventually reach the California Supreme Court, the  appeal could last as long as two years. As a result, a key unresolved question  is whether collection of the tax must be halted in the interim or may continue  pending the appellate decisions.  </P> <P> Although Burkhart ruled Proposition A invalid, attorney Louis Katz, one of  Homann's colleagues, conceded that "there's nothing in the judge's order to  stop them from collecting the tax."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hope to Continue  </P> <P> Several top county officials, in fact, have said they hope to continue  collecting the half-cent tax, which has generated about $21 million since it  raised the local sales tax to 7% on Jan. 1, until the state Supreme Court rules  on the matter. If Thursday's ruling is upheld, the county would have to devise  a method to equitably refund that money.  </P> <P> "I see no reason to discontinue it now," Board of Supervisors Chairman Susan  Golding said. "As far as I'm concerned, we don't even have a decision at this  point. What we have is one step on the way to that decision."  </P> <P> To clarify the sales tax's current status, Katz said that Proposition A's  opponents may ask Burkhart to hold a hearing on the matter later this spring if  his final order, expected to be signed in about one week, does not specifically  address that question. Their position at any such hearing, Katz explained,  would be that it is legally and politically illogical to continue levying a  sales tax that a court has ruled unconstitutional.  </P> <P> "But I'm sure the county probably would feel differently," he said, chuckling.  "We've still got a few more questions to answer about this decision before we  even get to the appeals."  </P></p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: A late victim of the recession - Heavy debt provisions have hit profits at Bank of Scotland HAS THE angel of the British clearing banks fallen from grace? It was tempting to draw such a conclusion yesterday as Bank of Scotland announced an 11 per cent fall in pre-tax profits only a day after its old rival, Royal Bank of Scotland, started to show clear evidence of recovering from the worst. Bank of Scotland has achieved an enviable reputation in the past few years of being both less accident-prone than others, and of running operations efficiently. It avoided the exposure to lending in the south of England that has hurt most banks, and its ratio of costs to income has been far lower. Yet as signs appear of economic growth, Bank of Scotland's 45 per cent rise in debt provisions raised questions about whether it under-provided earlier in the cycle. It also had to respond to doubts about whether it will generate enough income to increase assets without the need for a rights issue. Provisions rose in the second half of the year to February 28 - the bank provided Pounds 233.7m of a total Pounds 371.7m in the second half. This included six provisions worth at least Pounds 5m, and an adjustment to a provisioning formula at Forthright Finance, its motor finance subsidiary. The bank argued yesterday that several factors lay behind the deterioration in the second half, including the fact that recession reached Scotland during the year; that it suffered two months more recession because its year ends in February; and that it was hit by one-off failures. 'We have had to revisit the same accounts several times as the recession has spiralled down. That makes us uncomfortable, but it does not mean our judgment was wrong,' said Mr Bruce Patullo, governor and chief executive. But the bank none the less accepts that it has lessons to learn. One of these relates to the way in which it has expanded its loan book in England without the branch network of rival banks. It has instead relied on direct services run by telephone and computer, and corporate lending carried out at 20 regional offices around England. Although the bank believes that direct banking subsidiaries, such as its NWS Bank finance house based in Chester, can carry out accurate risk assessment using credit scoring, it accepts there is some potential weakness in its lack of local branch managers who can assess businesses face-to-face. It is attempting to strengthen local knowledge by ensuring that its regional managers become closer to local business establishments. 'We have got to become good friends with the key local lawyers and accountants who know businesses,' said Mr Peter Burt, treasurer and chief general manager. The rise in provisions, combined with a 16 per cent rise in assets, weakened the ratio of Tier 1 capital - its equity plus retained earnings - to risk-weighted assets to 5.8 per cent from 6.5 per cent in 1992. This remains above banks such as National Westminster, but is below most large US banks. This reinforces a criticism of the bank by some analysts: that it is not generating a high enough return on its capital to prevent it from making regular rights issues. The last issue - of Pounds 194m - was two years ago, and it would face scepticism if it tried to raise more capital soon. Mr Patullo insists this is not necessary. He says the bank has made careful projections, and believes it will be able to maintain its Tier 1 ratio at 5.8 per cent over the coming year without a large improvement in debt provisions, provided that loan growth does not exceed 5 per cent. Yet this, in turn, raises a question about whether it will have to limit loan growth just as the recovery starts. Mr Julian Robins, analyst at BZW, argues that a curtailment of loans would curb Bank of Scotland's earnings because it is heavily reliant on traditional loan-related business. Mr Robins says the bank is relying both on its poor second half for provisions being an aberration, and the assumption that loan demand will tail off from last year. 'They are making some rather dangerous assumptions, and I am not necessarily convinced,' says Mr Robins. Mr Patullo argues that the bank's strong growth in income - net interest income rose by 16 per cent - combined with cost control will see it through. But he believes it will have to achieve pre-tax return on equity of more than 20 per cent in the long term to generate enough capital internally.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Bids for Turkish N-project Turkey has received bids from 18 foreign consortia to prepare studies for the country's first nuclear power plant. The US companies include Bechtel Power and Southern Electric. Among other bidders are Belgatom of Belgium, Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute in partnership with Hyundai Engineering, and the Nuclear Power Corporation of India. The invitation to tender last month coincided with Turkey's worst financial crisis in a decade. However, without more plant capacity, energy officials predict Turkey will face power shortfalls as early as 1996. John Murray Brown, Ankara</p>

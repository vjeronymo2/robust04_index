			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Yes, No" column by Oktay Akbal: "To the Front of 80 </F> Percent"]    [Excerpt] Some 80 percent of the electorate is in favor of  a secular republic. Only 19 percent of the people support the  Prosperity Party [PP]. I believe that it is wrong to panic over  the local election results. No party can come to power with a  20 percent vote in any country. Even if it does, it cannot  remain in power.    The Turkish nation expressed its real belief with its votes.  Some 80 percent of our people proved that they are against  fundamentalism and anachronism. So why this fear of the PP in  all the cities and towns?    To tell you the truth, the PP victory in the big cities has  jolted certain circles back to reality. It was obvious that the  PP which raised militants in mosques, religious schools, and in  every street in the cities for years would collect many votes in  the first elections to come along. The first step in this  direction was taken when the PP won the municipal elections in  six Istanbul districts a year and a half ago.    We warned both the social democrats and the liberals. The  secular and pro-Ataturk voters are always strong and faithful.  Unfortunately, the parties are divided both at the center right  and at the center left. The electorate was forced to divide its  vote among the True Path Party, the Motherland Party and the  Nationalist Action Party in the right, and among the Social  Democratic Populist Party, the Democratic Left Party, and the  Republican People's Party in the left.    The total number of votes the rightist parties received was  50 percent, and the total number of votes the leftist parties  received was 25 percent. The PP only got 19 percent throughout  Turkey.    The division in the right and left was certainly going to  lead to such results. If the PP is singing with the joy of  victory today it is thanks to the pretentious party leaders who  do not know what they are doing, not thanks to the voters.  These leaders who caused the defeat of their parties as well as  the pro-Ataturk masses in the country should not be allowed to  remain in the political arena. The party grassroots will sooner  or later find the way of getting rid of the current leaders;  they must. [passage omitted]</p>

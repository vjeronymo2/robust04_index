			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: EVEN CALORIE-CONSCIOUS SWEETHEARTS CAN ENJOY THESE  VALENTINE DESSERTS  </P> <P> There's no reason to abolish desserts this Valentine's Day just because of a  weight control plan. Simply enjoy one of these lighter versions of special  occasion treats then resume your diet the following day.  </P> <P> With desserts that are lower in fat it is possible to have a romantic ending to  a favorite meal with a lot less guilt. Modifying desserts to reduce their fat  content makes it possible for treats to fit into a sensible calorie-controlled  plan. And experts agree that people who have an occasional treat have far  better diet success because they reduce feelings of deprivation that can lead  to over-indulgence of a forbidden food later.  </P> <P> Choose from among desserts like Almond Meringue Hearts With Raspberry Poached  Pears. Here, richly flavored raspberry-cinnamon poached pears are topped with a  raspberry sauce and used to fill light and airy heart-shaped meringue shells.  The meringue shells are made with egg whites that have been piped onto a baking  sheet and baked. Toasted almonds add nutty flavor.  </P> <P> Ginger-Peach Cheesecake Tart is another sweet treat that keeps fat under  control. The creamy rich texture of the filling comes from Neufchatel cheese  (low-fat cream cheese) and low-fat evaporated milk. Folding cling peaches into  the mixture eliminates the need for high-calorie toppings such as sweetened  sour cream or sweet, thickened fruit.  </P> <P> Scones, a favorite tea-time treat from the United Kingdom, is updated for  health-conscious Valentines in this version of Apricot Scones. Canned apricots  add tangy-sweet flavor, fiber, Vitamin A, potassium, iron and Vitamin C. Oat  bran and low-fat milk also are included.  </P> <P> A light biscuit topped with a succulent raspberry topping, angel food cake  featuring a skinny blueberry-yogurt sauce, and Pineapple Noodle Pudding are  some other ideas.  </P> <P> ALMOND MERINGUE HEARTS WITH RASPBERRY POACHED PEARS  </P> <P> 3 egg whites  </P> <P> 1 1/4 cups sugar  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar  </P> <P> 1/2 cup sliced almonds  </P> <P> 1 (12-ounce) package whole frozen raspberries, thawed  </P> <P> 8 cloves  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  </P> <P> 2 ripe pears  </P> <P> Line baking sheet with parchment or brown paper.

Pipe approximately 3  tablespoons meringue into center of each heart outline. Spread evenly to edges  with back of spoon or small knife. Pipe remaining meringue around rim of hearts  to form shell about 1-inch high. Sprinkle sides and tops of hearts with  almonds. Bake at 200 degrees 2 hours or until meringue is dried and crisp.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, combine raspberries with remaining 1/2 cup sugar, cloves and  cinnamon in saucepan.

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Pricing drugs ON THE FACE of it, the UK drugs industry has been let off lightly under yesterday's proposed five-year deal with the Department of Health. The 2.5 per cent price cut is less than might have been expected, while there has been no tightening of the overall profit control mechanism. A 17 to 21 per cent target for return on capital employed is generous by comparison with the average 12.5 per cent earned by British industry as a whole. But the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme cannot be seen in isolation. In its attempt to control the Pounds 3.4bn National Health Service drugs bill - which is growing at more than 10 per cent a year - the government has also curbed doctors' prescription budgets and is extending the blacklist of medicines it will refuse to pay for on the grounds that they are too expensive or non-essential. The latter plan in particular has provoked cries of protest from the industry, with dire warnings that it could undermine its international competitiveness while harming patient care. These complaints should, in the main, be dismissed. Although the NHS's position as near-monopoly purchaser of prescription drugs in the UK could theoretically allow it to drive an excessively hard bargain, there is no evidence that it has actually abused its power in this way. Rather it has sought to develop a long-term relationship, which has allowed British pharmaceutical companies to invest in research and shine in world markets ' earning Pounds 3bn a year in exports. But at a time when cost-cutting is necessary throughout the public sector in order to contain the budget deficit, it is only right that the drugs bill should bear some of the strain. To achieve this, it is legitimate for the government to refuse to pay for drugs where cheaper but adequate substitutes are available or where it is reasonable for patients to pay themselves. What is being proposed is less drastic than similar moves to control drugs bills in other countries such as Germany, where blacklists are broader and doctors' salaries are docked if they exceed their prescription budgets. In so far as there is valid criticism of the government's approach, it is over the way the blacklists have been implemented, rather than the principle. Because there has been no clear explanation of how drugs will be chosen for the blacklist, the industry says it may not go to the expense and trouble of launching certain categories of drugs out of fear that they could be blacklisted, or their prices artificially suppressed. To avoid this danger, it is important that the government sets out openly the criteria for drawing up such lists and reassures the industry that innovative new drugs will earn premium prices. That way, it will be able to continue its tricky balancing act of safeguarding patients' and taxpayers' interests while supporting one of the few British industries still at the top of the world league.</p>

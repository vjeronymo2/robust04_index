			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Nafta urged as model for western trade pact THE North American Free Trade Agreement should be used as a core around which to build a western hemisphere free trade pact, an influential Washington-based foreign policy group says. The proposal is one of a series of recommendations in a report published today by the Inter-American Dialogue of the Aspen Institute. The report from the group, which includes prominent Democrats, is in part aimed at influencing Clinton administration policy towards Latin America. The report argues that a new multilateral organisation is needed to guide and co-ordinate progress towards a western hemisphere economic community. In the meantime, the Nafta partners - the US, Canada and Mexico - should begin consultations to establish procedures for building Nafta into a hemispheric free trade pact. Chile would be a likely first candidate for membership. Efforts should also be made to pave the way for the participation of the smaller countries of central America and the Caribbean, which are likely to suffer from Nafta. Rejection of Nafta would, says the report, 'gut the core of future hemisphere-wide trade arrangements'. The report also proposes strengthened collective action among American states to preserve democracy in the region and a forceful collective attack on poverty and inequality. It calls on external organisations to put financial, intellectual and political muscle behind national anti-poverty programmes, with the World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank committing at least one-third of their Latin American lending to poverty reduction. It also urges governments of the hemisphere to promote negotiated settlements of Latin America's remaining guerrilla conflicts and to look at their armed forces, with the objective of establishing firm civilian control over the military.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "Aty-Baty" </F> program]    [Text] (Yuriy Pikul), general director of the Estonian  Security Police, accused Russian military unit commanders  deployed in the territory and senior officers at the Tallinn  garrison of trading in radioactive materials. He said that at  least five highly radioactive articles made of metal were sold  to the West from Estonia. He explained how the command of the  [place-name indistinct] harbor in Tallinn sold two air-cushion  vessels for scrap whose engine components emitted 200 roentgens  per hour of radioactivity. Specialists consider a person's  unprotected exposure to such a source of radioactivity for three  hours to be lethal. After the vessels were scrapped, the metal  was sold to Finland. However, several turbine sections  containing radioactive cobalt disappeared without a trace.    According to the statement made by (Viktor Mikhaylovich  Krug), assistant to the chief military procurator, the Russian  Federation military procuracy possesses no facts or material  concerning the sale by the Northern Group of Forces of  components or other items containing radioactive isotopes. For  its part, the Russian Federation military procuracy is prepared  to begin the immediate investigation of such a situation.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed Thierry Levy-Abegnoli: "The First </F> Object-Oriented Real Time Executive Is Born"]    [Text] A real-time executive developed by the French firm  Microprocess could lead to major upheavals not just for the  development of on-board software but also for its  implementation. It extends the advantages of object-oriented  technology to the whole of the application's life cycle.    The French company Microprocess has recently developed  SoftKernel, a real-time executive that is unique in the world  since it is completely object-oriented. In particular it brings  an extreme degree of modularity to the stages of development,  maintenance, and even operation while optimizing the available  memory space. Moreover, the very design of SoftKernel means  that is particularly easily ported from one microprocessor  architecture to the next and also ensures a high level of  application portability. In addition, with SoftKernel the  executive and the applications form a whole. These advantages  will become particularly evident when used with on-board  applications which have limited resources.    Microprocess explains that the principle used is an  extension  of the microkernel concept to all parts of the executive and to  all application programs. Thus, as with Chorus, there is a  microkernel charged with managing the memory area (and therefore  linked to the microprocessor). The novelty, however, lies in  the fact that other microkernels manage the files, interrupts,  semaphores, etc. In fact, we find more or less the same  principle in Chorus, except that with SoftKernel it is possible  to create a specific version of any microkernel (they are all  written in C++, sometimes with a bit of assembly language). You  therefore only need to make an "instantiation" (a form of  cloning) of the standard microkernel (which is just a C++  object) which inherits all of its properties, and then alter it.  Moreover, an application will itself be produced by the  instantiation of the "task" microkernel.    This architecture makes it possible to optimize the  available  resources without any particular effort, since several  applications can share a set of microkernels and thus share the  same code. For example, in a fax machine, the applications  controlling the document scanner and the user interface will  both communicate with the application controlling the line.  Product designer Bertrand Dautrevaux explained: "It would be  possible to do the same thing with a conventional executive and  programs written in C, but then you would have to make sure that  there was no conflict between the different applications. With  SoftKernel you do not run any such risk." A number of different  developers can therefore easily work in parallel on the same  project.  <H5>  Modularity Preserved In The Operating Stage </H5>   This modularity is also expressed in other ways. Thanks to  dynamic links established when the application is run, the basic  and application microkernels can be loaded unsequenced into  memory. It is therefore a simple task to replace one  application microkernel with another, even on the target system  itself and especially if it is equipped with flash memory. This  then makes it simple to produce different versions of a product,  or an open-ended product (for example, one which could take  add-on communication protocols). In addition, it would be  possible to order the transfer of certain "critical"  microkernels, for example from ROM [read-only memory] to RAM  [random access memory], so as to optimize performance. In  Bernard Dautrevaux's opinion: "Such functions are impossible  using conventional techniques because the applications are  monolithic. Even if developers write in C++, if they use a  traditional executive then the executable code will be  monolithic. Therefore the advantage of the inherent modularity  of object-oriented technology is only felt at the development  stage."    The development of SoftKernel took just seven man-years,  plus  10 man-years for the development environment. Bernard  Dautrevaux again: "That is a lot less than was needed for  Chorus, but then SoftKernel is only an executive, not a true  operating system."    For the time being, SoftKernel has been ported to Motorola  68000, Intel 8086 (real mode) and 386 (protected mode) and Sparc  architectures. Porting to ARM is also being examined. Of  course, this executive is aimed at industrial-type real-time  applications, but it is also aimed at voluminous on-board  applications with resources in the order of 64K of ROM and the  same amount of RAM: for example, intelligent radiotelephones,  small printers, and military applications. Microprocess does  not, however, intend to compete with the Apple Newton or  Microsoft At Work technologies which are aimed at more evolved,  resource-greedy applications.</p>

The authorities have also acknowledged a ban on the  latest edition of the United States news magazine Newsweek.  Witnesses said the demonstrators in the square scattered  leaflets as a group of delegates to parliament passed by. The  content of the leaflets was not known.    Police grabbed the camera of an AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE  photographer who had taken pictures of the protest and opened it  to expose the film.    The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that two Chinese  women "were stopped by other citizens for disturbing public  order this morning".    The statement quoted by the XINHUA News Agency said: "It was  improper for foreign journalists to cover news in China without  going through necessary formalities."    In a related incident, dissident Gao Hongmin, who had  planned  to distribute an open statement to the national legislature, was  picked up by security officers at the Jianguomenwai foreigners'  compound after visiting the offices of the Canadian Broadcasting  Corporation.    On the ban on the latest edition of NEWSWEEK, a spokesman  for  the government body that controls the import of periodicals  would only say there was an unspecified "problem" with the  issue. The cover of the current Asian edition is entitled  "China's Angry Voices" and features prominent dissident Wei  Jingsheng. The edition contains two highly critical stories.  The more controversial one covers the crackdown on growing  political dissent in China during last week's visit by U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher.    The other article questions the ability of the central  government to control the economy and highlights corruption and  social problems.    Subscriber copies of NEWSWEEK continued to arrive through  the  mail.</p>

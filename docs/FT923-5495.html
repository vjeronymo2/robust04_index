			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / French No vote would destabilise Europe, EC warns: Delors threatens to quit as Commission head if Maastricht is rejected SENIOR European Community officials - unnerved by growing opposition in France to the Maastricht treaty - are warning that Europe's stability is at stake in the referendum on September 20. Mr Jacques Delors who, like President Francois Mitterrand of France, has staked his reputation on the successful outcome of Maastricht, said that he would resign as president of the European Commission in the event of a 'No' vote. Mr Karel Van Miert, the Belgian commissioner in charge of the environment, said yesterday that rejection of the treaty would cut Europe adrift from its only real anchor, the Community. He joined Sir Leon Brittan, the UK's senior commissioner who runs competition policy, with a warning that a French 'No' would undermine the single market, due to start on January 1. Springing to the defence of a French government which has so far run a subdued pro-treaty campaign, Mr Delors said on Sunday while campaigning in France that he would resign if Maastricht fell. Yesterday in a radio interview, when asked whether he would remain in his job if the French electorate rejected the treaty, he said: 'I wouldn't stay on for another mandate if the 'No' vote won. 'This would be for the simple reason that as far as my colleagues are concerned I do not see how I could overcome the handicap of the loss of influence of France and all those who represent France in all the European institutions.' Adopting an even more vigorous tone, Mr Michel Sapin, French finance minister, warned that a vote against the treaty would bring a halt to fresh investment across Europe, higher interest rates and an end to European hopes of creating a currency to rival the dollar. 'Instead of selling our Airbuses in dollars, we will sell them in Ecus. Today we exercise a limited sovereignty. Tomorrow, with others, we will have full sovereignty,' he told a Socialist party summer school. Recent polls showing a narrow majority against Maastricht have forced French government ministers and Brussels officials to face up to the possibility of French rejection and its impact on international financial markets. When Danish voters turned down Maastricht, EC ministers hoped to save the treaty through a French endorsement. A 'No' vote in France, one of the driving forces towards European integration, was considered unthinkable. An opinion poll yesterday showed a margin of 53 per cent in favour to 47 per cent against. Six opinion polls last week predicted a close vote on September 20. Three showed the 'No' vote winning by a margin of up to 53-47 and three others showed the 'Yes' ahead by up to 52-48. Mr Sapin's remarks reflect the government's alarm at growing opposition to the European union. The anti-Maastricht campaign has been aggressive, and has often played on domestic rather than European issues, attracting protest votes against the political establishment. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, told the conference that the recent polls were 'full of danger'. He added: 'Our efforts of the past 40 years in favour of a reunited and pacified Europe risk being annihilated by the convergence of conservatism and fear.'

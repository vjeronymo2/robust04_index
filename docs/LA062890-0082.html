			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> MALCOLM X SLAYING SITE PLANS ADVANCE  </P> <P> The New York City Planning Commission unanimously approved Columbia  University's controversial plan to build a bio-medical research center at the  Audubon Ballroom, site of Malcolm X's assassination.  </P> <P> But the commission ruled that the school must preserve about 40% of the  ballroom in Washington Heights, including the stage where Malcolm X was slain  as he made a speech in 1965, and the building's original facade. It also set  limits on the level of hazardous materials at the facility. The plan now goes  before the Board of Estimate.  </P></p>

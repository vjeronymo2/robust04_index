			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Letter: UK manufacturing industry must attract the most able Sir, Prof Mackintosh (Letters, April 15) makes points about Britain's industrial future which few would question. It is fortunate that all schools must now teach technology as part of the national curriculum, but that in itself will not ensure healthy industrial production. Part of the answer lies with the schools and universities as well as with the industries themselves. Since the middle of the last century the most able pupils have been encouraged to enter the professions, the services and other non-technical careers. Many great industrialists of the early 1800s, when they retired to the countryside, discouraged their sons from 'dirtying their hands' in industry and sent them to appropriate schools. This tendency is now perhaps declining but the trend continues. The City of London seems more attractive than the factory. Manufacturing industry now urgently needs to make itself at least as attractive a possibility for pupils leaving school and university as other well-trodden careers. The onus is on the academic world to give informed advice, with real encouragement to enter industry, and on industry to draw the best pupils.

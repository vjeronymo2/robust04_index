The main signs are:    --Cross-strait economic links became closer, the number  of Taiwan businessmen coming to the mainland for investment  greatly increased, and cross-strait trade interactions rapidly  developed.    Over the past year, our country's political situation was  steady, our society was stable, and our national economy  maintained strong growth. Amid various reforms aimed at  building the socialist market economic system, investment  environment continuously improved. The great potential in  economic development and the broad prospects which had been  revealed continuously attracted numerous investors, traders, and  industrial and commercial entrepreneurs from Taiwan. Investments  made by Taiwan businessmen once again greatly increased in 1993,  on the basis of 1992, a year in which the number of investment  projects and the agreed upon funds all surpassed the sums of  former years. According to statistics provided by a relevant  department, from January to June 1993 the state approved a total  of 4,891 Taiwan-funded projects, and the agreed upon investment  funds reached $4.637 billion, an 187 percent increase and a 251  percent increase respectively over the same period in 1992. A  relevant person has estimated that in 1993 newly added  Taiwan-funded projects might reach 10,000, and the agreed upon  investment funds might exceed $10 billion, ranking Taiwan second  on the mainland in the drive to attract and utilize foreign  funds.    Another gratifying change in Taiwan investments in the  mainland during 1993 was that investors developed from medium  and small enterprises to large consortia and large enterprises,  and the investment regions rapidly developed from the coastal  areas and large and medium cities to the interior, remote areas,  prefectures, counties, towns, and townships. Jiangsu, Shandong,  Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong are still the areas attracting  most Taiwan investments, while Qinghai and Tibet also succeeded  in absorbing and utilizing Taiwan funds for the first time.  Taiwan-funded enterprises can be found in every province,  autonomous region, and municipality in the country. Many large  consortia and enterprises in Taiwan rushed to the mainland for  inspections and talks, and this undoubtedly created a broader  perspective for Taiwan businessmen to invest in the mainland.  Public opinion on the island held that "it was the largest  scale in collectively going to the mainland for investments"  since the Taiwan authorities lifted the ban on contacts with the  mainland in 1987.    In the area of cross-strait trade, according to the  statistics provided by the relevant department, from January to  September 1993 the total trade volume between the two sides  passing through the entrepot of Hong Kong reached $6.39 billion,  a 21.18 percent increase over the same period in 1992. The  supplementary and reciprocal feature of trade and economic  development across the strait has already become a common  understanding on both sides. In order to further promote  economic cooperation between the two sides of the strait, at the  end of last year the Standing Committee of the National People's  Congress [NPC] began to discuss the "PRC Law on Protecting  Investments by Taiwan Compatriots (draft)." It can be predicted  that once this bill is adopted and implemented, it will greatly  promote cross-strait trade and economic development in the  direction to standardization and institutionalization.    --The coming and going of personnel across the strait  became more frequent, the level continuously rose, and various  exchanges continuously expanded, bringing in a new phase in  which the two sides of the strait carried out special  discussions and academic research together on various domains  such as politics, economy, science, technology, education,  culture, and society.    According to the statistics provided by the relevant  department, from January to September 1993 1.155 million Taiwan  residents visited the mainland, and the figure is expected to  top 1.6 million for the whole year, thus greatly surpassing the  1.36 million in 1992, whereas the cumulative sum in the past six  years would exceed 5 million people. The number of mainland  residents going to Taiwan also rose greatly. According to  statistics, 3,309 persons went to Taiwan in 1993 for various  exchange activities, 3.6 times the figure of 926 in 1992.    The two prominent characteristics of the coming and going of  personnel are the great increase in number and the continuous  upgrading of level. In June 1993 the Taiwan authorities,  succumbing to the pressure of opinions from various quarters,  could not but allow Zhang Kehui, member of NPC Standing  Committee and president of All-China Federation of Taiwan  Compatriots, to hasten home to Taiwan for the funeral of his  parent, and this was a breakthrough in the visits to Taiwan by  senior personnel from the mainland. The visits to Taiwan for  exchanges activities by well-known mainland personnel such as  Wang Fosong, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences;  Liu Ji, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Social  Sciences; He Zhenliang, president of the Chinese Olympic  Committee; Wang Meng, former culture minister; Ying Ruocheng,  former vice minister of culture; and Bao Yujun, deputy editor in  chief of RENMIN RIBAO, all aroused greater responses on the  island.    The number of senior personnel coming from Taiwan to the  mainland for exchange activities also markedly increased over  1992, and among them were "members of the National Assembly,"  "members of the Legislative Yuan," "adviser to the presidential  palace," members of the Standing Committee of the Central  Committee of the Kuomintang, and main leaders of other political  parties. Seeing for oneself is a hundred times better than  hearing from others. The frequent exchanges of personnel across  the strait and the upgrading of level are helpful to enhancing  mutual understanding between the people on both sides of the  strait, as well as among persons of various circles of the  society, so that they can foster compassion and increase  consensus. Their significance and influence are obvious and  profound.    When the coming and going of personnel from both sides of  the  strait became more frequent, various exchanges across the strait  also continuously expanded and deepened, scoring rich results.  Last year, apart from the bilateral exchanges in the domains  such as culture, education, science, technology, film,  television, news, and health, which continued to develop, other  domains such as religion, tourism, architecture, finance,  securities, land management, sports, and social customs also  realized bilateral exchanges. What must be mentioned in  particular is cultural exchange, which involved a large number  of people and large projects, and had good effects. The  performances by the China School of Beijing Opera, the Beijing  School of Beijing Opera, Sichuan's Sichuan Opera Troupe, Hubei's  Hankou Troupe, Beijing People's Arts Troupe, and Young Chinese  Arts Troupe, as well as the exhibition of wood and clay figures  of ancient warriors and horses, the exhibition of the jade  clothes sewn with gold thread, the visit by Yunmen Dance  Performing Troupe to Taiwan, and the first cross-strait movies  show all had great impacts and changed the past pattern whereby  Taiwan pop singers "dominated" the mainland. The cultural  exchanges between the two sides of the strait are developing in  the multilevel, multi-domain, and high- taste direction. The  success in the cross-strait cultural exchanges illustrated that  Chinese culture has tremendous rallying force, and is an  important foundation for the two sides of the strait to  establish consensus and mutual trust.    Another feature of the continuously deepening bilateral  exchanges across the strait last year was that there was an  increasing number of various seminars jointly held by both sides  of the strait, and the contents became richer and touched on  cross-strait relations, as well as economic, industrial,  cultural, educational, scientific, and technological  topics....The discussions on areas and topics by various  quarters from both sides of the strait will undoubtedly play a  positive role in developing cross-strait economic, social, and  cultural ties, and in strengthening the links and interactions  among various circles on both sides of the strait. They can  also enlighten both sides when they sit down for consultations  and negotiations, and seek peaceful reunification of the country.    --Smoothly holding the "talks between Wang Daohan and  Koo Cheng- fu," realizing official contacts and discussions  between the senior- level persons of the nongovernmental domain,  and making an historic and important step forward in the  development of relations between the two sides of the  strait.    The "Wang-Ku talks" were the most eye-catching event in the  development of relations between the two sides of the strait in  1993. It was held at the end of April last year in Singapore,  after efforts made jointly by both sides. It was the first  meeting of the most senior persons of the empowered  nongovernmental organizations on both sides of the strait, as  well as the first open contact and discussion between the  senior-level persons in nongovernmental capacity in more than 40  years. It had great significance and profound impact, and it  drew a widespread attention from both sides of the strait and  the international community.    As part of that nongovernmental, economic, routine, and  functional meeting, basing themselves on the spirit of mutual  respect, of consultation on equal footing, of being practical,  and of seeking common point while allowing differences, both  sides seriously discussed the relevant problems, reached  consensus on many areas, and signed the four documents of the  "Wang-Ku Talks Joint Accord," the "Agreement on Ties and System  of Talks Between the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Strait [ARATS] and the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF]," the  "Agreement on Examination and Verification of Notarial Deeds in  Use on Both Sides of the Strait," and the "Agreement on  Cross-Strait Enquiry Into Registered Mail and the Matter of  Compensation," scoring results which satisfied both sides. The  complete success in this round of talks played a positive role  in promoting forward development of cross- strait relations and  in fostering peaceful reunification of the country. President  Jiang Zemin spoke highly of it, and he said: "The Wang-Ku  meeting is successful and fruitful, signifying that the  development of cross-strait relations has made a historic and  important step."    In order to thoroughly implement the relevant agreements  reached by the talks, the ARATS and SEF held work meetings in  late August, early November, and mid-December in Beijing,  Xiamen, and Taipei. Both sides discussed the matters such as  repatriation of personnel, fishing disputes, repatriation of  hijackers, and the way to arrange trips for the work personnel  from the ARATS and SEF. Both sides also exchanged ideas and  reached some consensus on protecting the rights and benefits of  Taiwan investors on the mainland, as well as the related  problems, and on the issue of visits by the persons of  industrial and commercial circles from both sides of the strait.  This enabled the routine talks between the two sides of the  strait to be further deepened.    --The publishing of the white paper on "The Taiwan  Question and China's Reunification," has for the first time  systematically and openly explained the cause of the Taiwan  question, its current situation, and the crux of the problem.  It also explained the Chinese Government's position, idea, and  basic policy on solving the Taiwan question.    The white paper resolutely safeguarded state sovereignty and  territorial integrity, sternly refuted the fallacious theories  such as "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan," and "Taiwan  independence." The white paper also clearly pointed out: "The  wishes of Taiwan compatriots to become masters of their homes  and to administer Taiwan are reasonable and proper, and this is  not like `Taiwan independence' and they are basically different  from a very small handful of those who insist on following the  road of `Taiwan independence.'" The white paper, after being  published, aroused enthusiastic responses in the international  community and on the island of Taiwan, and scored very good  results. It has already produced -- and will continue to  produce -- a more profound impact on the development of  cross-strait ties and reunification of the country.    In conclusion, 1993 was a year in which the development of  cross- strait ties made a new breakthrough and important  headway. The situation continues to develop in the direction  which is conducive to the peaceful reunification of the country.  Over the past year, in order to promote the development of ties  across the strait and to realize peaceful reunification of the  country sooner, the CPC and the Chinese Government adopted a  series of important measures to promote various exchanges and  interactions across the strait, as well as nongovernmental  contacts and talks, and to promote direct "three links," winning  the support and approval from people on both sides of the  strait. At the same time, the Taiwan authorities also further  lifted certain restrictions on cross-strait exchanges and  interactions, and adopted some measures which helped fostering  communications and understanding, and this is in accordance with  the wishes and interests of the people in the whole country,  including the compatriots in Taiwan, and this is also conducive  to the benevolent development of ties between the two sides of  the strait.    However, over the past year, the development of relations  between the two sides of the strait still experienced some  twists, turns, obstructions, and variables. The main reason  rested on the island of Taiwan. Over the past year, the  struggle among various political forces on the island  intensified, in particular, the Taiwan authorities advocated  "participation in the United Nations," put forward so-called  "phase-nature policy of two Chinas," and fell back on the  one-China position, while the trend of thought of "Taiwan  independence" ran rampant on the island. This produced  unfavorable influence on the development of cross-strait ties,  and met with the strong opposition from the people on both sides  of the strait, as well as from Overseas Chinese. There is only  one China in this world, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of  Chinese territory, any attempt to pursue "two Chinas" "one  China, one Taiwan," or "Taiwan independence" cannot succeed.    Although things are not always smooth in the course of  reunification of the country, reunification of the country  accords with the will of the people, and this general trend of  history is one which cannot be changed by any force. We believe  that in the new year, cross-strait ties will continue to have a  bigger development, and cross-strait interactions and  cooperation will still maintain the tendency of rapid  development. We hope that, proceeding from the basic interest  of the Chinese nation, the Taiwan authorities will continue to  uphold the principle of one China, further remove various  artificial obstacles to political contacts and negotiations  between the two sides of the strait, and do more practical  things in order to develop cross-strait relations and foster  reunification of the country.</p>

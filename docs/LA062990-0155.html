			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> COAST GUARD OKS WIDENING OF BRIDGE  </P> <P> The U.S. Coast Guard on Thursday announced its approval of an application by  the city and Caltrans to widen the Newport Boulevard bridge. The endorsement is  the last one needed before the city seeks bids for the $3.3-million project.  </P> <P> The project, which is expected to be under way by September, will mean an  additional northbound lane over the bridge on 32nd Street. The lane will  provide an exit for vehicles heading east on Coast Highway.  </P> <P> According to City Manager Robert L. Wynn, the additional width on the boulevard  will mean "a great deal of relief to vehicles leaving the (Balboa) peninsula."  The city estimates that the extra lane should reduce congestion at the  intersection of Newport Boulevard and Via Lido by about 30%.  </P> <P> But during the yearlong construction period, congestion will continue to be a  problem for traffic leaving the peninsula, Project Manager John Wolter admits.  </P> <P> "We've designed this thing to maintain two traffic lanes in all directions, but  there will still be sometimes when the road's going to be closed to one lane,"  Wolter said. "We'll be very happy when this project is complete."  </P> <P> The widening project will also add a bicycle lane to the east side of the  bridge. LAURA MICHAELIS  </P></p>

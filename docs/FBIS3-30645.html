So far the SDS has tabled four  motions for no confidence in the cabinet formed under the  mandate assigned to the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and  Freedoms and elected at the end of 1992 thanks to the support of  the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), the New Union for Democracy  (NSD, a parliamentary group set up by MP's who split or were  expelled from the SDS), three of the no confidence motions were  voted down.    Setting out the arguments for the no confidence vote, Ms.  Ekaterina Mikhaylova, deputy floor leader of the parliamentary  SDS, said that the government had not only allowed "crime to  grow enormously, but let criminals form large organized groups  of the mafia type, blend with state authorities and get  important economic sectors under their control." She recalled  the cases of what she described as escalating gangland fighting,  accusing the cabinet and the Interior Ministry in particular of  inaction.    The reasons for the helplessness of the executive branch and  of the Interior Ministry in curbing crime can hardly be said to  stem from the lack of laws, Mrs. Mikhaylova said. In her view,  widespread corruption at the Interior Ministry makes it  impossible for its members, called upon to protect the lives and  security of Bulgaria's citizens, to fight crime in this country.  The cabinet unanimously backed Interior Minister Viktor  Mikhaylov, thus shouldering the responsibility for the chaos at  the Interior Ministry and growing crime, Ms. Mikhaylova  stressed. [passage omitted]    Answering the accusations against the cabinet in parliament  today, Prime Minister Berov said that "there is more to rising  crime than the cases which the SDS lists in its arguments for  the no confidence vote." "The attempts to represent crime as  street clashes among criminals are actually aimed to conceal how  deep the roots of crime go. This may be to the interest of  those who made the no confidence motion, but it is definitely  not to the interest of the nation," the prime minister said. He  reminded that in 1990- 1992 (when the SDS was in power), 15,000  Interior Ministry employees were either dismissed or left of  their own will. "I would not describe this as an open attempt  to politicize the Interior Ministry in 1992 again and make it  serve certain narrow partisan interests," Prof. Berov said.    Recalling that the government programme as a whole and its  section on crime control in particular were linked to the  passage of much needed laws on establishing and maintaining a  new rule of law, Prime Minister Berov accused parliament of  inaction. "Parliament has not passed yet the most urgently  needed amendments to the Penal Code, the Code of Criminal  Procedure, and the Sojourn of Aliens Act, though it emerged that  some 65,000 foreigners reside in this country unregistered," he  stressed. "The SDS has been doing its best to prevent the  passage of a law on the organization of the judiciary," Prof.  Berov said. Stressing that the government bears its share of  responsibility for fighting crime, Prof. Berov said all  incidents listed in the motives for the no-confidence vote are  subject to investigation by the Interior Ministry. Most  criminals have been detected but not tried yet, Prof. Berov said.    "The government will be uncompromising about everything  within its powers. I assure you that the police are at their  post, in full control of the situation in the country," Prof.  Berov stressed, adding that the government would continue to  prioritize fighting crime and view it with responsibility but  would not allow crime problems to be politicized. "I can well  understand certain claims for decisive action by the government,  for more attention to social affairs, the structural adjustment  of the economy and the land reform, but I strongly object to  attempts at wasting parliament's time and blocking the  government's work. This is an irresponsible tactic adopted by  the present SDS leadership," the prime minister said. [passage  omitted]    At the end of his speech in parliament today, the prime  minister expressed his conviction that "There is a nationally  responsible majority in parliament and if it believes the  government can stick to the chosen path of reform, of ending the  country's international financial isolation and economic crisis,  this will mean support for future more decisive steps to control  crime and strengthen the state in the name of the nation and  Bulgaria."    The debates on the no-confidence vote went on for about five  hours. Interior Minister Viktor Mikhaylov went to hospital  yesterday and did not attend the sitting. Mainly MP's of the  SDS and the BSP took the floor. In their statements MP's of the  SDS repeatedly stressed the need for new parliamentary  elections. After a regular meeting of the SDS top leadership,  the National Coordinating Council, on Tuesday, it was announced  that if the government survived the no-confidence vote or the  1994 budget was approved, the SDS leadership and parliamentary  group would discuss a boycott of parliament's sittings. MP's of  the ASP repeatedly stated that no parliamentary force wants  early parliamentary elections now and the motion for a  no-confidence vote is intended to waste time.    According to parliament's rules of procedure, the motion can  be put to the vote 24 hours after the end of debates at the  earliest. In this case the vote will be taken on Wednesday [9  February] at the earliest. The MP's decided to vote by secret  ballot.</p>

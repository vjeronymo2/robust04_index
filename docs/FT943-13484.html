			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Producer sales cap palladium price surge - Market Report Sales of PALLADIUM believed to be from Russia - the biggest producer - capped prices after a rise to fresh five-year highs yesterday afternoon. Palladium was fixed at Dollars 147.30 a troy ounce, up Dollars 1.05, helping its sister metal PLATINUM to a three-month high of Dollars 416.75. Dealers said the early price surge reflected investment fund buying on the New York futures markets where the rally in the platinum group metals began on Friday. GOLD and SILVER silver benefitted from the trend. Compiled from Reuters</p>

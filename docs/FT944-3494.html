			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: The democratic deficit Sir, I hesitate to take issue with Lord Plumb (Letters, December 8), but I believe there is a rather more important lesson to be drawn from your public-spirited Anglo-German opinion poll, even allowing for the known imperfections of such exercises. It demonstrates the very substantial gap (should we call it a 'democratic deficit'?) that exists on matters European between EU national governments and their electorates. One should also note that the one head of government that is in tune with this aspect of his electorate's concerns is the UK prime minister. The 'European project' has much to recommend it, and is probably essential to the future of the peoples of Europe. What the politicians appear to have lost track of is the sensibilities of their electorates, and until that problem is addressed the European grouping will continue to stutter rather badly.

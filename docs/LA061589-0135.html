			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN HONORED FOR 'SKINHEAD' RESCUE  </P> <P> A man was honored Wednesday for coming to the rescue of an Iranian couple who  were attacked by a group of neo-Nazi "skinheads" who mistakenly believed that  their victims were Jewish.  </P> <P> Leonard Washington, 34, of Pomona, was presented with a distinguished service  award by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Washington intervened in the May 28 attack on the Iranian couple, who had their  baby with them in a shopping center parking lot in La Verne.  </P> <P> The reputed neo-Nazi skinheads, three men and a woman, face charges of assault  and for allegedly violating the victims' civil rights.  </P> <P> "A citizen stepped forward in a situation where there was clearly an attack on  a couple and their infant child that was motivated by racial hatred," the  Wiesenthal center's Rabbi Abraham Cooper said of Washington.  </P> <P> Of the honor, Washington, a school security officer, said, "It's kind of a  strange feeling for me. I really didn't expect this much to be made of it."  </P></p>

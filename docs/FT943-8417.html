			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Rising car sales help Evans Halshaw to Pounds 7m Evans Halshaw, the West Midlands-based motor distributor, almost doubled first half profits as it increased car sales sharply, sustained its after-market business and pushed operating margins to a five year peak. In the six months to June 30, pre-tax profits rose 85 per cent to Pounds 6.91m (Pounds 3.73m), producing earnings per share of 19.6p, against 11.3p. The group declared the interim dividend of 5p (3.8p) promised last June when it announced a recommended offer of Pounds 32.6m for Davenport Vernon and went to the market to raise Pounds 29m with a 3-for-10 rights issue. Yesterday it restated its intention that 'the interim should represent approximately one third of the total dividend for the year'. Last year a total of 13p was paid. Turnover increased 43 per cent to Pounds 270.9m (Pounds 189m) boosted by the 1993 takeover of the TK Group, which contributed 12 percentage points of the rise. The Davenport takeover and the purchase of the smaller GT Cars came too late to affect the first half figures. Mr Geoffrey Dale, chairman, said the acquisitions had doubled the size of the group and it would now be concentrating on developing the enlarged company. Operating profits climbed to Pounds 8.37m (Pounds 4.99m), helped by a 40 per cent increase in the sales of both new and used cars to a total of 23,000 units. The increase shifted the balance of the group's business. Car sales accounted for 39 per cent of turnover, compared with 31 per cent in the 1993 first half, while the staple source of revenue, servicing and parts sales, fell from 62 per cent to 54 per cent. Car sales have continued strongly. Mr Dale said that for August, the first month of the new registration year, it had been 'seeing an increase in new car sales of over 10 per cent on a comparable basis to last year'. The national increase for the first 10 days of the month was 3.7 per cent. Operating margins rose to 3.1 per cent, the first time the figure has been above 3 per cent since 1989, compared with 2.6 per cent for 1993 and 1.6 per cent for 1992.</p>

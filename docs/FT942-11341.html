			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Refugees flee to Tanzania Nearly half a million people have fled Rwanda to escape tribal massacres in the central African country, Medecins sans Frontieres, the medical charity, said yesterday, Leslie Crawford writes from Nairobi. The upheaval has created the largest makeshift refugee camp in the world at Benako, in northern Tanzania. MSF says between 150,000 and 200,000 destitute and exhausted refugees have gathered at Benako. A nearby river marking the border between Rwanda and Tanzania has become polluted with corpses. Aid workers fear the outbreak of disease. Rebels of Rwanda's Tutsi minority have been fighting the dominant Hutu ethnic group for control of the country. But Tanzania said Rwanda's interim government yesterday signed a pact to stop the fighting and massacres. It said rebel forces had also agreed to implement it from tomorrow.</p>

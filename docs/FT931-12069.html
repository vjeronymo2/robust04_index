			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Money Markets: UK overnight at 100% THE OVERNIGHT rate for lending sterling cash rose to 100 per cent yesterday after the Bank of England posted a huge shortage at the end of a tight week in the money markets, writes James Blitz. The Bank announced a shortage of Pounds 2.35bn at the start of the day, later revised up to Pounds 2.4bn. Cash is always tight at the end of the month, when dealers try to square their books. The market is also in the middle of a tax collection period, which creates big demands for funds among the clearing banks. However, the market found it difficult to remove the shortage for several reasons. One was the paucity of bills in the hands of clearing banks and discount houses. A dealer said that large quantities of bills had been used to mop up Thursday's Pounds 1.8bn shortage. Another dealer said that the Bank had made an error in offering to buy a repurchase agreement which was due to expire on February 26, at the start of the day. For technical reasons, this was not in the interest of market participants. A sign of the stickiness of the market was that late assistance was very high at Pounds 780m. The sharp rise in the 'overnight' would have brought substantial profits and losses, especially on a Friday when loans must be funded for three days. For example, a trader who had bought a 1-month cash asset worth Pounds 1m at 6 1/2 per cent would reap a profit of around Pounds 5,000 in 30 days time. But this weekend, he may have incurred interest payments of more than Pounds 8,000 servicing the loan by borrowing overnight cash. Such wild fluctuations in sterling rates have raised concerns about the Bank of England's money market operations in the past. In Europe, cash rates in the French franc market rose to new highs on rumours that the Bank of France would raise its intervention rate to defend its currency. The intense pressure on the Irish punt, which is seen as a strong candidate for devaluation, has raised fears that the franc could come under speculative pressure. One-month French francs rose to 13 1/2 per cent from around 13 per cent the previous day. The March franc futures contract fell another 43 basis points to close at 88.40, as dealers assumed that French rates will remain high until the parliamentary elections.</p>

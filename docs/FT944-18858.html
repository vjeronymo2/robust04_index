			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Sindall in reverse takeover Shares in building contractor William Sindall were suspended yesterday as it announced plans to reverse into an unlisted building company. Sindall is paying an initial Pounds 12.2m for Morgan Lovell, an office refurbishment company, through the issue of 18.5m shares and Pounds 1m cash. Additionally, 4.4m shares are being issued through a placing and open offer to raise Pounds 2.6m. This will cover the cash consideration and costs relating to the takeover. The new shares are being issued at 60p, against yesterday's closing price of 90p. If Morgan Lovell meets financial targets for this financial year, up to a further Pounds 1.35m will be payable in shares, which could leave its vendors owning up to 66.5 per cent of the enlarged company. The deal is subject to shareholders' approval at an extraordinary general meeting on October 26. Morgan Lovell was formed in 1977 and specialises in refurbishing and fitting-out commercial property. In the year to March 31, the company had a turnover of Pounds 59.8m and made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.3m. Mr John Morgan, one of its founders, will become chief executive of the combined company, which will be re-named Morgan Sindall. Sindall also reported an interim pre-tax profit of Pounds 931,000 against a loss of Pounds 619,000 last time. Turnover was down from Pounds 24.5m to Pounds 22.2m. However, the result was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 480,000 to cover property write-downs, redundancy costs and fees paid to advisers. This was balanced by Pounds 1.65m exceptional gains arising from profits on the disposal of fixed assets and amounts written back to current assets.</p>

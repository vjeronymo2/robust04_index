			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Daily Mail Trust sells wharf The Daily Mail and General Trust, the newspaper publishing group, has sold its freehold interest in a wharfage in Purfleet, Essex for at least Pounds 17.5m. The proceeds will be used to reduce the group's net debt, which at the last reporting date stood at Pounds 378m. The wharf, previously used to store newsprint before being taken to Fleet Street, has been rendered redundant by the opening of new print works at Surrey Quays. The asset was held in the DMGT's books at about Pounds 15m.</p>

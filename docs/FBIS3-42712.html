			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Smyk: "The Obstacles of Gaydarism: </F> Domestic Metallurgy Is on the Verge of Disaster"]    [Text] The lament of our mass media with respect to Gaydar  and Fedorov should convince our compatriots of the fact that the  management corps which is taking the reins of government into  its hands will bring the country to the catastrophe, from which  the radical reform wing was allegedly keeping it. The ink had  not even managed to dry on the edict about the dismissal of Ye.  Gaydar and B. Fedorov had not yet left his office when the  dollar dutifully shot up, promising a jump in inflation and  prices: as if to say what things will be like without reform's  two knights in shining armor.    Meanwhile, all the talk about stabilization of the ruble and  a deficit-free budget is nothing more than a diversionary  maneuver which masks a system of purposeful destruction of the  economy, which our shock therapists have been methodically  carrying out. In the fall, at the conciliation commission of  metallurgists and miners, which was established after coal  prices were freed, the leaders of Magnitka [Magnitogorsk  Metallurgical Combine] and the Novokuznetsk and other combines  warned that the enterprises could not endure a sevenfold surge  in coal prices and that 1993 might turn out to be the last year  in the history of domestic metallurgy. And so, recently, the  leaders of this sector, at an expanded collegium of their own  committee, summed up the results of the past year in the  presence of Oleg Soskovets and other members of the government.    The increase in coal prices has led to repeated increases in  the railroad rates and a sharp increase in electric power  prices. The nonpayment fine for it is equal to 2 percent per day  and, inasmuch as, as a rule, an enterprise has no money, the  payments just for the fines for electricity are beginning to  climb above world prices. The increase in the railroad shipping  rates, given the enormous expanses of Russia, have led to the  fact that the transportation cost has begun to exceed the cost  of the ore and even of enriched iron-ore raw material. The  Magnitogorsk combine, for example, is paying 10,000 rubles [R]  for a metric ton of sinter and R12,000 for shipping it.    Taking into account the shipping, the cost of domestic ore  has become higher than the world cost. As a result of all the  expenses, the prices for metal products have also risen to the  world level and, in a number of instances, exceeded it.  Exporting is becoming unprofitable. Whereas, back in the summer,  for Magnitka, the profitability of exporting was equal to 25  percent, it has currently declined to 2 percent. In the domestic  market, the effective demand for metal products has decreased  catastrophically and whereas, prior to July of last year, the  metallurgical sector was able to make ends meet, after prices  were freed, the metallurgy workers found themselves in debt to  the miners, the railroad workers and the power industry workers.    "I am bankrupt," N. Ordzhonikidze, head of the Krasnyy  Oktyabr plant, declared to the managers who had gathered in the  hall of the collegium of Roskommetallurgiya [Russian Federation  Committee on Metallurgy]. "Anyone here who is not bankrupt,  raise your hand."    And not a single hand was raised. Even I. Frantsenyuk, the  manager of the sector's most technically advanced enterprise,  the Novokuznetsk combine, stated that his enterprise will become  unprofitable this year.    There is one mysterious thing: everyone is talking about  inflation, emission and the fact that the printing press is  operating at full power, yet the enterprises have no money. They  are putting out products, but the consumers are not paying them  and they themselves, of course, cannot pay for the shipments of  raw ore material and coking coals. Really, is this inflation  real or artificial, something specially contrived for the  purpose of bringing down Russia's economy? The producer does not  have the money he earned -- it is sitting in the banks. The  latter are especially hindering monetary settlements, so that  "payments" are sitting for months; the plants' funds are being  withdrawn from the productive sphere and sent into the trade  network in the form of high-interest short-term credit. The  productive sphere is being brought to ruin during this time, the  shadow structures and commercial banks are growing rich and this  entire ridiculous system of financial destruction of industry is  called inflation, for which, supposedly, those at fault are the  plants and kolkhozes established in the "era of totalitarianism"  and which, so it is said, are needed by no one. The rails are  falling apart, the railroad cars are worn out and high-quality  metal for engines cannot be found, yet metal products lie  unclaimed and the metallurgy workers have nothing with which to  pay for coal and electricity. And so it becomes necessary to  turn off the blast furnaces, shut off the electric melting units  and, the main thing, shut down the coke-oven batteries.    Any manager, no matter what the financial problems, will  find  money for the coal miners -- he will persuade his colleague, the  manager of the mine, to wait and not pay the ore-dressing  combine, but he will find funds for the coking needs because the  coke-oven batteries must not be shut down: the refractory  brickwork would be ruined and shutting down the batteries is  tantamount to putting them out of commission.    "The most terrible thing is happening now," I. Frantsenyuk  acknowledged, "the destruction of the coking supply."    The Serov metallurgical combine has been shut down. The pipe  plants and the rolled aluminum plants are operating at 20-30  percent of capacity. At the Chelyabinsk combine, the  electric-furnace steel shop, which produced metal for space  vehicles, has been shut down. The shutting down of enterprises  is occurring, first of all, because the state is being led by  the money men in price matters. But, under monopoly conditions  and the absence of competition, the price does not reflect the  actual cost of the product. A monopoly will set prices to cover  costs at the expense of the consumer and thus, it will preserve  technological backwardness.    "The liberalization of prices, which declared as its goal  the  overcoming of the spending mechanism of the economy, in  actuality, is stimulating it," noted S. Afonin, chairman of the  Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy.    Almost every enterprise manager talked about the tax  situation. The creation of taxes is still one important part of  the activities of our glorious money men for eliminating the  country's economic potential.    And, oh, the kinds of taxes which are being devised and  approved by the department of our "No 2 Marketer," Boris  Fedorov! A perfect example is the tax devised last year "on the  exchange rate difference," which, instead of encouraging the  producing exporter, is forcing the latter to pay for the  devaluation of the ruble, as if inflation were not ravaging the  enterprise, but rather, bringing it a profit.    It is significant that B. Fedorov's department has currently  established, in essence, the same level of taxes as existed  under the planned socialist system (more than 80 kopecks from  each ruble of profit), but without the guaranteed delivery of  raw materials, assured sales market and budget financing. No  other country in the world has such a level of taxation.    Yet still, one thought stood out like a sore thumb in all  the  statements. The metallurgical plants, the mines and the dressing  combines are overwhelmingly enterprises which form cities. If  the Cherepovets combine closes (and its manager, Yuriy Lipukhin,  during the last Vorkuta strike, was already issuing an order  about closing the combine), what is to be done with the workers  and what are the rest of the residents of Cherepovets, the  economy of which is supported by the combine, supposed to do?  The same situation is faced by Magnitogorsk, Nizhniy Tagil,  Lipetsk.... Meanwhile, the social situation in the metallurgical  regions is heating up. Boris Prokudin, the manager of the  Chelyabinsk plant, declared that the workers' patience is not  without limits and, if the wage payment situation does not  change, the people of the Urals "will take up arms."    Thus, at the meeting in the collegium hall, the metallurgy  workers unrolled before the members of the government a panorama  of their own difficult problems. They least of all complained  about the situation and they analyzed it: why did a basic  industry, on which the country's industry is supported, due to  the endeavors of the macroeconomists, find itself threatened  with destruction? They thought about how to correct the  situation.    Russian First Deputy Prime Minister O. Soskovets said that  it  is necessary to establish a state set of measures for the  revitalization of investment activities. He requested that the  metallurgy workers prepare, in a thesis format, the most  important of their proposals for consideration in the  government. Time will show whether or not they find support  there, but one thing is clear: the renovated cabinet, before  getting down to actual reforms for Russia's economy, will have  to do quite a bit of work on doing away with the obstacles left  by the money men.</p>

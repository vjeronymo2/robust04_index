For 12 days, the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industry  kept the biggest enterprises in Port-au-Prince closed and will  enact new protests if the Armed Forces and Aristide do not  restart negotiations, warned business sector spokesman Bernard  Craan. "We attained our objective. We have caused a  psychological shock, and now everyone understands that we must  find a solution quickly," said Craan.    In a joint resolution signed by the leaders of several  powerful business associations, Haiti's big businessmen asked  that everyone sacrifice. The businessmen urged Aristide,  overthrown by a military coup on 30 September 91, to appoint as  soon as possible a new prime minister to replace Robert Malval,  who resigned on 15 December. They also demanded the lifting of  economic sanctions imposed by the international community, as  well as the resignation of Army Chief General Raoul Cedras,  leader of the coup. If these demands are met, the Caribbean  country will be close to a solution of the crisis, said the  businessmen.    Democracy in Haiti was almost reestablished last October, in  accordance with an agreement sponsored by the United Nations,  but the military prevented Aristide's return, which had been  scheduled for 30 October. Until January, when the petroleum  embargo began forcing several industries and other enterprises  to close their doors, the business sector had been reticent  about participating in the political debate on the country's  situation.    Several business leaders said many businessmen who were  doing  very well before the 1991 military coup are now in danger of  going bankrupt, whereas the new businessmen with ties to the  Army are getting rich through preferential treatment from the  Customs Department, among other advantages.</p>

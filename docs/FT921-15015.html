			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Letter: CEOs are economically crucial - so pay the successful ones even more Sir, In your editorial, 'Hurry home, Mr Bush' (January 8), you quite properly caution against Japan-bashing in the US. You then go on to criticise chief executive officer (CEO) compensation in the US as too high in comparison to CEO salaries in Japan, as follows: 'The fact that the average US CEO earns 125 times the annual remuneration of a manufacturing worker, compared to just 16 times in Japan, is one indication of the contrast.' The reasoning behind this criticism appears to be that Japanese manufacturing companies are more successful in global markets than US manufacturers; CEO compensation in Japan is lower than CEO compensation in the US; therefore, lower CEO compensation in the US would be better. This is a highly doubtful recommendation for the US and probably also for the UK. It is true that unsuccessful CEOs in the US are paid too much and, even more important, are allowed to stay on too long. On the other hand, there are good reasons for believing that successful CEOs in the US usually are paid too little. The problem in the US is that CEO compensation and retention in employment generally do not respond enough to performance. Some simple examples should make these points clearer. Top opera stars, virtuoso violinists and orchestra conductors are paid huge amounts because even very small differences in performance can result in very large differences in economic outcomes for music promoters. CEOs, because of the economically crucial nature of their jobs, have a much more important effect on society. Stockholders and society in the US and UK probably would benefit enormously from paying successful CEOs more and eliminating unsuccessful ones more quickly. A similar point of view is presented in more detail with some highly revealing statistics on the subject in CEO incentives - it's not how much you pay but how, by Michael C. Jensen and Kevin G. Murphy in the Harvard Business Review, May-June, 1990. Leo Herzel, Mayer, Brown &amp; Platt, 190 South La Salle Street, Chicago, Illinois US</p>

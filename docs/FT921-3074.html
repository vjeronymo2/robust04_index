			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (30): Inconsistencies' in state funds / A look at a World Bank report on the oil 'windfall' IT HAS become known as the Gulf war 'windfall', and questions about what happened to it go to the heart of Nigerian politics and economic management. The 'windfall' - Nigeria's higher-than-expected export earnings in 1990, after world oil prices rose amid fears that the conflict would disrupt supplies - is a sensitive subject. The Financial Times's correspondent in Lagos was deported last year after reporting that economists working for donor agencies calculated that some Dollars 3bn in oil receipts during the period July 1990 and May 1991 were not accounted for. Reacting to the allegations, the federal government said 'categorically that the estimates of 'oil windfall' contained in (the FT) story are without foundation'. The FT's reports were designed 'to deliberately mislead the public, including our development partners' the statement said. 'The federal government remains undaunted and unshaken in her determination to run an open and responsible government,' it concluded. The FT has since obtained a copy of an unpublished World Bank summary of the findings of its report on public expenditure management in Nigeria. The report, researched in early 1991, makes clear the Bank's concern about how the windfall was disbursed. 'Oil receipts were some Dollars 2bn higher in 1990 than the Bank had been projecting at the beginning of the year,' says the report. The transition to civilian rule added to the pressures on government to spend and 'led to a breakdown in fiscal and monetary discipline during 1990 . . . not only characterised by additional spending and monetary expansion, but also by a major surge in expenditures bypassing budgetary mechanisms of expenditure authorisation and control.' The report continues: 'The practice of spending oil revenues through dedication accounts and other devices outside the purview of statutory budgetary and accounting controls has re-emerged on a large scale. 'In addition, significant domestic currency spending appears to have occurred without any apparent budgetary authorisations,' says the report. In an analysis that raises serious questions about government management, the World Bank study makes these further points: 'Some Dollars 1.5bn equivalent of revenues was allocated under ill-defined and poorly documented procedures outside of the usual accounting framework'; There are 'accounting inconsistencies' in the handling of crude oil revenues paid into the Federal Government Account, for distribution by the Federation Account Committee. 'One such inconsistency is the direct payment for certain contracts from the offshore oil revenue accounts, and the diversion of the gross proceeds from fixed volumes of sales of Federation oil to special accounts for the use of the (state-owned) Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation - and perhaps other agencies - for certain project and other expenditures. Certain obligations also appear to be met by direct shipments of oil.' Under agreements with the IMF and the World Bank in 1986, says the report, 'all but two of such 'dedication account' expenditures were supposed to be discontinued. 'However, Bank staff attempts to account for the proceeds from oil production in 1990 produced a shortfall of foreign exchange inflows reflected in the official Central Bank cashflow of around Dollars 2.1bn, of which only Dollars 0.6bn can be explained by the two continuing dedication accounts'; In addition, the report goes on, 'there is evidence to suggest that some N5.6bn counterpart of around Dollars 0.5bn of foreign exchange oil receipts reported by the Central Bank did not pass to the Federation Account Committee for distribution.' 'Transactions on the Federation Stabilisation Account for 1989 and 1990 suggest that non-budgetary expenditures of about N10bn have been financed out of these accounts.' (Under an informal practice started in 1989 the Federation Account Committee has been depositing a portion of its revenues, including some of the 'windfall receipts' into a 'stabilisation' account. 'The exact status of this account remains unclear,' says the Bank report). 'These 'inconsistencies' are large,' comments the Bank report: 'To the extent that they represent actual expenditures, they imply spending outside normal accounting and budgetary mechanisms which exceeds total budgetary non-debt service spending of the Federal government in 1990.' The report's findings will, say diplomats, be taken into account when issues such as aid to Nigeria and debt rescheduling are under discussion. And it seems appropriate that Mr Barber Conable, then World Bank president, last year chose the new Nigerian capital of Abuja to warn: 'Accountability, transparency, predictability (and) adherence to the rule of law' were fundamental to development.</p>

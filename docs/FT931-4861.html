			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Drayton Asia feels fire on its neck - A bid battle in the investment trust arena DRAGONS ARE not supposed to be the underdogs. But that is the status of EFM Dragon, the Far East investment trust, which is bidding for Drayton Asia, an opponent twice its size - the relative market capitalisations are Pounds 57m and Pounds 116m. Some of the fire in EFM Dragon's bid comes from its big brother, the Coal Board pension fund. It owns 20 per cent of both EFM Dragon and Invesco MIM, and has given its support, in the form of a letter of intent, to the bid. In addition it owns 85 per cent of British Investment Trust, which in turn owns 54.3 per cent of Edinburgh Fund Managers, which manages EFM Dragon. The pension fund's backing has helped EFM get off to a good start. Irrevocable undertakings to accept in respect of 13.6 per cent of the shares have been received from holders such as Co-Operative Insurance and Newton Investment Management. Added to the letters of intent, EFM Dragon already has the backing of 36.7 per cent of the shares. An important factor may be the perceived unpopularity of Drayton Asia's investment managers, Invesco MIM. There do seen to be times in the investment trust sector when one group comes under repeated attack. It was Touche Remnant in the mid-1980s and it seems to be Invesco MIM at present. The problems of Drayton Consolidated, where Invesco was forced to pay Pounds 9.5m in compensation to shareholders; a fine from IMRO, the investment management regulator; and the group's involvement in the Maxwell affair have all resulted in difficult publicity. Perhaps investor reluctance to back Invesco MIM led to the shares falling to a discount to net asset value, which reached 26.8 per cent at one point in 1992. When a trust's shares fall to a wide discount, opportunity arises for an outside bidder. A bid just below asset value offers a profit for existing shareholders, plus the chance for a bidder to buy a portfolio at a reasonable price. EFM Dragon, in contrast, has often seen its shares trade at a premium. In essence, this represents an incentive to expand. EFM could take the option of a placing or a rights issue but it would probably find it impossible to raise as much as it could by buying Drayton Asia, which also comes with a ready-assembled portfolio of Far Eastern stocks. If the bid succeeds, EFM Dragon argues that investment trust shareholders are only likely to accept a paper offer from another trust if they believe that the bidders are better managers. As the graph shows, EFM Dragon has clearly outperformed Drayton Asia since the start of 1992. But the Drayton team argues that this outperformance is due to the Dragon policy of gearing up the trust, which improves the performance of trusts in bull markets, but damages it in bear markets. The Drayton team has decided not to gear up, because it feels the Far East stock markets are volatile enough already. The essence of the Drayton argument is that EFM Dragon may have provided higher rewards, but at the expense of higher risk. 'Gearing is part of management,' says Mr Ian Watt of Edinburgh Fund Managers. 'We took a bullish view of markets and it worked. But our performance is more due to stock selection and asset allocation.' Whatever the facts on performance, Drayton argues that EFM Dragon is trying to buy the trust on the cheap. Bids are couched in terms of the formula asset value, which is the net asset value, minus the costs associated with the offer. In this case, EFM is offering shares worth 96.4 per cent of Drayton Asia's formula asset value, which in turn is about 3 percentage points less than the target's net asset value. Drayton also points to the lack of a cash alternative. The value of EFM Dragon's offer thus depends on its shares. If those shares fell to a discount of 9 per cent, the average for the year to March 3, Drayton says the value of EFM's share offer would fall to 86 per cent of its undiluted net asset value. Mr Lewis Aaron, senior investment trust analyst at SG Warburg Securities backs Drayton on this point. 'I think the bid is an opportunistic attack on a fund management group when it is most vulnerable. 'EFM Dragon will probably go to a discount if the bid succeeds, because it will be a much bigger trust. Therefore I think the bid is not high enough and there is not a cash alternative.' But with so many of the Drayton Asia's shareholders backing EFM, the trust realises that these arguments may carry little weight. It is seeking to produce alternative proposals which might give investors better value. Normally, trusts faced with a predator resort to one of two schemes - unitisation or a split capital structure. The former turns the fund into a unit trust, which trades at asset value, and can be realised for cash. The latter, by splitting the share capital into more tax-efficient components, may eliminate the discount by creating extra demand for the shares. But the lack of income from Far Eastern stocks may not make a split capital structure possible in this case. Drayton, unless it can find an alternative bidder, may thus be forced down the unitisation route. But with the bid nearly a month old, it needs to act quickly.</p>

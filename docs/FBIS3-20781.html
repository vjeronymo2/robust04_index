Lekovic: "`1 December' Electronics Industry </F> Enterprise, Pljevlja: New Program Despite Problems"]    [Text] The sanctions and economic blockade have  significantly diminished the usability of facilities for  manufacturing modern electronic and microwave machines,  equipment, and systems; enterprise experts have turned to new  programs--they are producing laser systems and radio-relay  equipment; after the sanctions are lifted, they will announce  several new programs for their main customer--the Armed Forces  of Yugoslavia [VJ], but also for export.    When production began in 1985 at the "1 December"  electronics  industry enterprise plants in Pljevlja, one of the designated  facilities of the military industry, no one could have suspected  that after seven or eight years of full-swing operation and  prosperity, production would be cut by more than half and only  one-third of the facilities would be in use. The effect of  sanctions and the economic blockade has been that the production  of one part of the equipment at the collective involving  especially highly trained staff has shut down, while part of  production has been adapted to the existing possibilities of the  VJ and of the Yugoslav market.    Lately, cooperation has been reduced to electronics industry  enterprises in the FRY. The fruit of this rapid adaptation and  of the reaction of experts to secessionism has been the "pilot"  series of a type of telephone-telegraph device. "1 December"  will perform the finishing work, and the production of more than  100 such devices has already been contracted. The Pljevlja  enterprise will soon begin repairs on several types of weaponry  and military equipment, especially radar and radar systems,  electronic countermeasure systems for VJ ships, thermovisual  systems for MiG-23 warplanes, radar detonators for air-to-air  missiles, and various radio systems.  <H5>  Development of Laser Equipment </H5>   The "1 December" enterprise is concentrating on the  production of optronic laser systems and radio-relay equipment  in cooperation with domestic firms. Thus preparations are being  made for the production of laser rangefinders for tanks. The  production of laser systems and radio-relay equipment has been  necessitated by the new demands and needs of the VJ, because  previously this equipment was manufactured in Slovenia.    Nevertheless, there are serious obstacles to be overcome in  the production process. According to the director of the  enterprise, engineer Rados Beljkas, the biggest problem is the  shortage of money and the serious economic situation of the  Armed Forces of Yugoslavia--the main customer. Acquiring  intermediate goods from abroad is also creating problems.    "All of this has meant that utilization of our facilities is  at 20 to 30 percent, which is very bad, because we have at our  disposal the most modern equipment and a highly skilled work  force, of which any European factory would be proud," director  Beljkas tells VOJSKA.    Of the 186 employees, engineers account for one-fourth. They  are not all sitting around waiting for the sanctions to be  lifted. The director says that "1 December" has good prospects,  and that contention is backed up by the existing and new  programs for the needs of the VJ. Many countries are also  interested in this collective's production--Egypt, India, the  DPRK, Russia--especially its detectors and radars.  <H5>  Rapid Adaptation </H5>   Although the enterprise has been forced to send part of its  workers on mandatory leave, it is quickly coping with and  adapting to current market needs. Thus facilities are being used  to manufacture products that are essential to the Pljevlja  economy, especially industry. As there is no machine industry in  Pljevlja, it has come to the aid of many enterprises by  manufacturing machine parts that were previously imported or  manufactured in former Yugoslav republics. Production of a metal  dormer window is under way for KID "Velimir Jakic," together  with components for blinds, window reinforcements, and doors.    "The worst thing is to sit around and complain. Wages must  be  and, we are convinced, can be earned through labor," says  engineer Slavko Krezovic, the head of the machine plant.    During our visit to the "1 December" enterprise, we saw that  the collective was not giving in and succumbing to the problems  that are present in abundance. The most valuable impression  comes from the fact that the high-profile experts and all the  employees are capable of independently producing very complex  electronic equipment and systems under current circumstances.  Nevertheless, renewed prosperity for the enterprise is expected  only after the economic blockade is lifted.  <H5>  [Box, p 37] </H5> <H5>  First-Rate Equipment </H5>   The "1 December" enterprise produces modern electronic and  microwave machines, equipment, and systems. It has a closed  technological process for producing electronic equipment at  three production plants--the electrical plant, the machine  plant, and the surface protection plant--with well-organized and  professionally qualified services for technical preparation and  quality control. The development sector deals with preparing and  applying new technologies and products. The factory is equipped  with top-rate equipment from the world's best-known producers.  The electrical production plant has equipment for manufacturing  microwave integral cars and modules for preparing and assembling  stamped cars, measurement equipment for digital  signal-processing, as well as an anachronous measurement room  for recording antenna radiation diagrams at long range, with an  automatic system for gathering data.    Mass production of the most complex parts and systems takes  place in the modern machine plant using sheet metal of various  thicknesses and qualities, while in the surface protection plant  all sorts of galvanic and organic protection is done.  <H5>  [Box, p 37] </H5> <H5>  Through Its Own Devices </H5>   An ambitious beginning was made in the manufacture of a  large  number of electronic devices. The first products were  reconnaissance radar, a portable radar detector, and mechanical  components for a radio-teleprinter system. In recent years, the  development sector, through its own devices, has brought into  "pilot" production a passive radio-direction finder for the  acquisition, direction-finding, and tracking of low-flying air  targets by azimuth, and a subsystem in an antiair system valued  at more than $100,000.</p>

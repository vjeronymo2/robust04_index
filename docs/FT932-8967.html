			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / How to Spend It: Best advice from a closet mistress - Jane Mulvagh puts a wardrobe adviser to the test MANY PEOPLE, both men and women, initially baulk at the idea of going to a dress adviser assuming that, like an interior decorator, they are an unnecessary extravagance. The popular myth runs like this: they flounce into your life, toss out half your wardrobe, impose their own taste, turn you into a fashion victim by sending you to a designer with whom they are in cahoots and then charge you for the humiliation. On the other hand, if you have just experienced a big change in your life - be it a windfall, a change of job, a new relationship or the birth of a child - treating yourself to a dress advisory session can be a therapeutic fillip. This is where the London Fashion Advisory can help. The most significant feature of the LFA is its independence. It offers impartial advice and recommends shops and private dressmakers who do not pay them a kick-back for doing so. Sessions take place in the privacy of your home, after work if necessary. This is not only for your convenience but also to allow the consultant to see you in situ and assess your wardrobe and the state in which it is kept. A consultation takes at least three hours, can be exhausting and costs Pounds 180. The LFA is run by Kate Ward Jones, a 32-year-old graduate of fashion who has spent ten years as a private dressmaker. Her strengths are that she is keenly informed about cut, shape and cloth; she is objective about your shape and colouring; has amassed an impressive array of research and - most important - conducts herself with winning tact and kindness. She is not, however, a creative original; her strengths are that she will respect your taste, will help you create an idiosyncratic style of your own or, if that is what you want, just help you dress in a more flattering or suitable manner. Doctor Alison Joy, a London GP, agreed to be our guinea pig - although she said she would normally never dream of employing a dress adviser because she did not want to change her own style. Her current wardrobe is jam-packed, as she loathes throwing things out, and contains a few good classics, brought recently, some 'Oxfam Grunge' bought as a student and still worn, and a few dearly-loved character pieces. She has a strong artistic streak and a suspicion of corporate dressing. Kate first asked what Dr Joy was aiming for. A new look? Not particularly. A clearout? No, she hates throwing things away. To spend some money? Yes, she wanted a better wardrobe both for her professional and private lives. Alison admitted that she has never spent more than Pounds 1,500 a year on clothes and shoes, but now that she wanted to improve her wardrobe, 'an independent adviser is very helpful, for friends and husbands get bored with this sort of overhaul.' Like so many women, and in spite of a pleasing figure, she is dissatisfied with her shape. 'I should be small all over but in fact I'm small on top with wide hips - a classic pear. It's a difficult shape to buy for off-the-peg.' Kate worked steadily through the clothes, making piles to keep, piles to alter, piles to sell and piles to give to Oxfam. Her diplomacy was impressive but she rightly pointed out that 'I'm going to be ruthless and say what I think, because you're paying me for this.' Kate quickly grasped the essentials of Alison's lifestyle. Throughout the session she emphasised that 'clothes are a serious investment and you must look after them.' Maintenance tips are part of the service: metal coat hangers, old dry cleaning bags and sentimental but unwearable hand-me-downs were all banished. She gave advice on moths, how to press clothes by hovering a steam iron a millimetre or so above clothing rather than pressing down on them, how to disinfect wardrobes and keep them aired. She recommended that jumpers be washed inside out and suggested spot cleaning rather than repetitive dry cleaning. Best of all were her 'make do and mend' tips. A beautifully tailored but very old-fashioned cream wool overcoat was transformed into a long-line dandy jacket with amusing buttons, while the garish red braid that had rendered a loden jacket unwearable was exchanged for a subtle and pretty floral one. The jacket has become the stalwart of Alison's country wardrobe. Two favourites - Moschino shorts and a Pollen bustier which are no longer pristine - were altered and copied. A few days later Alison was sent a thorough report suggesting what needed to be bought, altered, copied, thrown out and including a helpful list of stores with varying price levels: ranging from Fortnum &amp; Mason and bespoke tailors to inexpensive boutiques in the suburbs. If Alison had wanted to, she could then have gone shopping with a consultant to advise her. On the whole the suggestions were sensible rather than wildly original, concentrating on a professional working woman's look, but overall LFA did an impressive job. Alison's verdict? 'On the whole I thought Kate was excellent, although I felt that she was dressing me up too much as a professional woman and not enough for my real life or my fantasy life, be it the countryside or playful evenings. Her knowledge about tailoring a shape is good. She taught me how to use my figure and not to mind its curves. Kate gave me the guts to use my good bust and has suggested bodies - they are flattering and inexpensive and don't have to be ironed] I've already bought one each from Maxmara and Graham &amp; Greene.' She also felt that Kate was excellent at pulling various pieces together, at advising how to add a new belt or an inexpensive accessory to make them look smarter. Another satisfied customer said: 'LFA came to my rescue. I have no time to plan a wardrobe, let alone go shopping on a budget, and they even helped to produce a new wardrobe out of old clothes and horrendous mistakes.' Amanda Pelham Burn, director of Corporate Relations International, says: 'LFA performed the arduous task of forcing me to weed out a 15-year-plus collection of clothes. Once I could see what was left, together we built a coordinated and organised wardrobe for both work and play.' London Fashion Advisory, The Plaza, 535 Kings Road, London SW10 0FZ.

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Arts: Laurie Booth - Queen Elizabeth Hall Laurie Booth's newest piece, Requiair, is subtitled 'A Flight Dance', and Nigel Coates' design is of a pair of white aeroplane wings hanging above the dance area. Hans Peter Kuhn's sound installation is an often ravishing sequence of noises interspersed with bird-song, faint curlew pipings, and what may well be the first electronic celestial choir. We seem to be poised between earth and heavens, as if on top of a windy hill-top - the Elizabeth Hall's hideous and steeply raked auditorium encourages this feeling - looking at dance that meditates upon ideas of flight and the aspirations behind those ideas. It is thus I interpret Booth's work for himself and four colleagues: Jo Chandler, Desiree Cherrington, Gary Lambert and Ellen van Schuylenburch, which received its London premiere on Tuesday and Wednesday. The dancers wear unisex shirts and trousers in anonymous clayey shades and, like the clothes, Booth's dances - which had an erotically challenging tension in recent duets with Russell Maliphant - here look neutral, almost neutered. The text, as displayed by Booth himself, is fascinating, because his own movement style - sinuous, coloured by stunningly effective accelerandos that melt into quiescent poses - is so richly varied. The dancer and the dance become one. His companions, able dancers all, can nowhere match (as Russell Maliphant can match, and indeed challenge) the many nuances of Booth's bravura language. It owes something to martial arts, to T'ai Chi, to contact improvisation, Indian dance and capoeira - whence come the flicker-quick gesture and the long, logical flow of action. It owes as much to Booth's own prodigious concentration, which draws us into his imaginative world. In Requiair, the ideas are oblique, allusive: the manner of post-modern dance is never going to provide the obvious imagery of aerial ecstasy that ballet can furnish. Instead, Booth appears like a Daedalus, dreaming of escape by flight. In one of the most touching and beautiful sections of the piece - which is uneven, but often rewarding - Booth lies on the ground as Kuhn's shimmering sound-world hangs above him, and seems to meditate upon movement that he then starts to explore. In contrast, he also creates a trio for the two men and himself which is a dazzlingly accented scherzo of contact games, of falls, holds, and wild clamberings. The dance runs for about 70 minutes. I think it too long, and because of the dissipation of movement ideas among the cast, too diffuse: few of its massed effects touch the potency of Booth's own presence. But it is also a work from a secure and eminently gifted creator, whose vision of dancing is strong, highly personal, and always convincing. The performance initiated the annual 'Spring Loaded' festival of new dance which now moves to The Place: there will be further reports in due course.</p>

The first part of the two-part program includes security,  socioeconomic and legal issues that need to be coordinated; the  second part deals with the methods and the mechanism of  unification, Raig said.    "Estonia can realistically expect to join the European Union  before the other former socialist countries," Raig claimed. The  country's main goal is not to lag behind Ukraine, Slovenia and  the Czech Republic that already have asked to be admitted to the  union, he added.    The working group consists of a score of politicians and  economics experts. Last week it appointed Priit Kolbre, the head  of the Foreign Ministry's foreign economic policy department, as  its secretary, Raig told BNS.</p>

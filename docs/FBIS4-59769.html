			<p>BFN     [Text] Minister Shulamit Aloni says 'Arafat's call for  jihad against Israel is ludicrous. In her opinion, his remarks  are an extravaganza stemming from profound frustration at having  achieved less than he had wanted, or perhaps from a dread of  coping with reality while living in fantasy.    Interviewed by a Qol Yisra'el correspondent this morning,  Minister Aloni said the peace process would continue, and even  'Arafat would not be able to jeopardize it, because the  Palestinian people want peace. If he continues daydreaming and  does not withdraw his remarks, Israel may take time out and  possibly pursue negotiations with other members of the  Palestinian leadership -- serious, level-headed people  representing the Palestinian people, with whom we have become  acquainted in the course of the negotiations.</p>

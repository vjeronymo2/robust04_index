			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BLANKENSHIP STAYS HOT IN MAIN EVENT AT SAUGUS  </P> <P> Dave Blankenship of Reseda had a feeling that his summer racing days would be  scorching indeed when he came within one one-hundredth of a second of the  Street Stock division one-lap oval record in qualifying races Saturday at  Saugus Speedway.  </P> <P> His time of 18.55 seconds was just shy of the mark of 18.54 set by Rick Crow of  Canyon Country in 1989.  </P> <P> "I was on a roll," Blankenship said.  </P> <P> So Blankenship's Street Stock main-event win in front of 4,400 was no surprise.  It was just a continuation of his hot driving.  </P> <P> "I credit it to a good old car," he said. "This car's been around this track a  lot of times. It's been racing out here about 10 years."  </P> <P> Blankenship took the lead for good on Turn 2 in Lap 6 when he sneaked past John  Kirby of Ventura.  </P> <P> "You take what you can get," Blankenship said. "You don't think. You just do  it. If the opportunity is there, you just do it."  </P> <P> The win was Blankenship's first in a main event this season. Craig Rayburn of  Simi Valley finished second, with Kirby third.  </P> <P> In the Sportsman division main event, John Cran of Reseda defied a recent  Saugus trend in his 40-lap win.  </P> <P> In the last eight Sportsman races, the pole-position car never relinquished its  lead. But on Laps 24 and 25, Cran pressured leader Rayburn with attempts to  pass.  </P> <P> Then, on Turn 2 and the back straightaway of Lap 26, Cran whizzed past Rayburn  -- much to the delight of his fluorescent green-clad rooting section -- and  stayed in front for his third main-event win this season.  </P> <P> "I was taking a helluva chance," Cran said amid backslaps from his pit crew.  "But I figured, it's now or never. Let's go for it."  </P> <P> Cran said that the track was slippery from a bang-up involving several cars,  including points leader Will Harper of Tarzana. As a result, Rayburn could not  drive exceedingly fast in the lead.  </P> <P> Rayburn, who raced in three main events Saturday night, finished second.  </P> <P> In earlier races, Garrett Yamada of North Hollywood started fast glided to an  uncontested win in the 10-lap Mini Stock Main Event.  </P> <P> In the Sportsman fast-heat race, Rayburn started on the pole and led all the  way, with Cran taking second.  </P></p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: New York The US bond markets will be dominated this week by tomorrow's meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank's policy-making Open Market Committee, amid widespread speculation it will sanction a further tightening of US monetary policy. Market analysts are braced for the Fed Funds rate to rise from its current 3.25 per cent to 3.50 per cent over the next few weeks, possibly as early as the next few days, as the Fed tries to rein back the rapid rate of US economic expansion. The market will have several hurdles to face during the week, as well as two substantial auctions of Government paper: Dollars 17bn of two-year Treasury notes on Tuesday and an Dollars 11bn sale of five-year notes the next day. Wednesday will also see the publication of durable goods orders for February. Stripping out defence and transport equipment, which tend to distort the statistics, the market is expecting orders to rise for the eighth successive month, with analysts' forecasts ranging from 1 to 3.5 per cent. Friday will bring figures for existing home sales for February, which are expected to show a sharp rebound during the month. Thursday could also bring further market nervousness over the Whitewater political affair, concerning President and Mrs Clinton's investment in a controversial Arkansas land development scheme.</p>

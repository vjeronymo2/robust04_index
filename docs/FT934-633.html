			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: Banesto puts off bond issue as ratings are cut Banesto, the troubled Spanish financial group which in February entered a capital raising and strategic advice agreement with the US bank J. P. Morgan, has shelved a Dollars 400m convertible bond issue planned before the end of the year. The delay came as IBCA, the London-based rating agency, lowered its short and long-term ratings of Banesto, from A to A- and from AI to A2 respectively. The agency had lowered Banesto's long-term rating in June and its move yesterday followed similar downgrades by Standard &amp; Poor's last week and by Moody's in August. Adding a further controversial note to Banesto's fortunes, Ms Violy de Harper, who as managing director of J. P. Morgan's corporate advisory arm masterminded the agreement with J. P. Morgan's Corsair fund, has joined James D. Wolfensohn, the New York investment bank. She will remain an external co-adviser to Banesto. Banesto was the first target of the Dollars 1.1bn Corsair fund, a portfolio set up by J. P. Morgan to invest in undervalued banks. The bond issue was to be the third tranche in a programme that has already raised Pta94bn (Dollars 671m) through new issues which turned the Corsair fund into Banesto's biggest stockholder with 8.16 per cent of its equity. The issue was aimed at lifting Banesto's capital to the level of rival Spanish banks. Banesto is run by Mr Mario Conde, who purchased shares worth Pta6.4bn in the rights issue, increasing his holding in the bank to 3.1 per cent. Banesto and J. P. Morgan said yesterday the bonds would be issued next year after the Spanish bank's 1993 results had been fully audited. This was the first official admission there had been problems over the issue's timing and it fuelled market rumours, staunchly denied by both Banesto and J. P. Morgan, that the delay had been prompted by a disagreement between the two banks which had led to Ms de Harper's departure from the US bank. Wolfensohn said Ms de Harper was joining the firm as a member of its executive committee and would be the partner responsible for its Latin American and Iberian business.</p>

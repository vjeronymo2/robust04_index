			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 13 TASS -- The press service of the  Russian Government confirmed that Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin had a 20-minute meeting with nationalist leader  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on Thursday, but refused to give any  comments.    "Government services refrain from any comments on the matter  so far", a spokesman of the press service told TASS. "One can  judge about the essence of the talk only from what the LDPR  leader said", he added.    Zhirinovskiy told reporters after the meeting with  Chernomyrdin that he had proposed to the prime minister to  replace some of the ministers with members of his "shadow  cabinet".    Zhirinovskiy is mostly against Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev and Privatization Minister Anatoliy Chubays.</p>

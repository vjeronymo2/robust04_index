			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Appeal fails to exclude evidence in Guinness trial TWO FORMER City merchant bankers facing criminal charges in the forthcoming second Guinness trial have failed to exclude evidence they gave to Department of Trade and Industry inspectors investigating the Guinness affair. Mr Roger Seelig, former corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell, and Lord Spens, former director of corporate finance at Henry Ansbacher, had argued that it would be wrong and unfair to admit the evidence at the trial, since the inspectors had not cautioned against self-incrimination. Dismissing their appeal against a pre-trial ruling by Mr Justice Henry, Lord Justice Watkins said in the Court of Appeal yesterday that the Crown set great store by gaining the admission of the evidence, contending that it amounted to confessions by the two men. The appeal court upheld Mr Justice Henry's decision that DTI inspectors were not 'persons . . . charged with the duty of investigating offences' within the Police &amp; Criminal Evidence Act (Pace) and were therefore not obliged to caution witnesses. Lord Justice Watkins said that, even if the inspectors had been investigating offences, and there had been a breach of the Pace code on cautions, it would still have been open to Mr Justice Henry to admit the evidence. Mr Seelig and Lord Spens, who are likely to try to take their appeal to the Law Lords, face charges of false accounting and offences under the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act over their alleged involvement in an unlawful share support operation mounted by Guinness during its takeover battle for Distillers in 1986. The trial, already postponed since January, is due to start this month but is likely to be delayed further. Lord Justice Watkins said Mr Seelig alleged that there had been a conspiracy between the inspectors, the DTI, the Serious Fraud Office and the police that the inspectors would use their statutory powers not for the purpose for which they had been appointed, but illegitimately to build a criminal case against him. Mr Seelig claimed that the police had suggested the inspectors' lines of inquiry and deliberately delayed charging him until the inspectors had finished interviewing him. He also alleged that the inspectors set out to trap him into a confession at a time when, if questioned by the police, he would have had to be cautioned and would have relied on his right to silence. The Crown said the inspectors did not have to caution or advise a witness that he need not answer a question he thought would tend to incriminate him. To impose any such obligation on inspectors would make their investigations useless, the Crown contended. Rejecting complaints that Mr Justice Henry wrongly exercised his discretion, Lord Justice Watkins said the trial judge had decided that the fairness of the trial would not be threatened by admitting the evidence, and that no improper means had been used to force Mr Seelig and Lord Spens to give evidence that might incriminate them.</p>

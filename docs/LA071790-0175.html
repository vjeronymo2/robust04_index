			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> UNENCUMBERED NADIA IN SEOUL  </P> <P> It's hard to keep up with Nadia Comaneci. The gymnastics star of the 1976  Olympics is in Seoul now for a visit at the invitation of a friend, Kim  Sang-min, a Korean businessman who lives in the United States.  </P> <P> She long ago dumped Constantin Panait, the roofer who helped her defect from  Romania before the Iron Curtain fell last year, and apparently has scrapped  plans announced in February to marry Mihai Vasilescu, a Romanian computer  programmer.  </P> <P> "I have no one to speak of as my spouse-to-be and I have a lot to do," Comaneci  said. "I would like to take my four family members -- my parents, brother and  sister-in-law -- out of Romania to Canada, where I live now." During her Korean  stay, Comaneci will visit the Seoul Olympic facilities, meet sports officials  and sign autographs.  </P></p>

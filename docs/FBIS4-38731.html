			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Economics" rubric: "The </F> Wages of Workers in Budget-Funded Sectors Should Grow If the  Budget Income Grows, Russian Federation Labor Minister Gennadiy  Melikyan Believes"]    [Text] Many government lances have already been broken on  the question of the indexation of the minimum wage. No one  seriously objects to it in principle. Both the president and  the prime minister have repeatedly stated that the main aim of  economic reform as a whole is to improve people's lives, but  without scrupulous calculations and long-term forecasting of the  social consequences of the government's actions, no serious  decisions can be made.    That is why I propose that we should look at the problem of  indexation more closely. An increase in the minimum wage in the  country to 19,000 rubles [R] will immediately be reflected in a  corresponding growth in all social payments. And this means  subsidies, pensions, and compensation. The main point is that  the payment of the first category under the Single Tariff Scheme  in budget-funded sectors of the economy will definitely change.    In this case I am not so much worried about a possible spurt  in inflation as by the practical problems of budgets at various  levels. We know that today workers in budget-funded sectors are  80-percent funded out of local treasuries. Will regional  budgets be able to provide another wage increase to their  teachers and doctors if the government adopts this decision? I  think it unlikely. Indeed, my latest trips around the country  have convinced me that, with an inflation rate that has slowed  down, people are demanding not so much the indexation of wages  as their payment on time.    To my mind, it would be more reasonable to elaborate a  system  of clear-cut recommendations on which local authorities could  base independent decisions on increasing wages to their  budget-funded workers. In that case, their decisions would be  based on real financial possibilities and therefore would be of  a practical nature rather than being on paper only.</p>

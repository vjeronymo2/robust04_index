			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Carlos Segovia] </F>   [Text] Brussels--The European Commission, which is headed  by France's Jacques Delors, believes that the Community, Spain  included, has weathered the worst of the recession, but its  short-term projections for the Spanish economy are less  optimistic than those the government set forth in the budget  bill.    The Community executive will approve tomorrow (Wednesday)  its  Annual Economic Report, which as usual includes short- and  medium-term economic and social forecasts for all member states,  including Spain.    The document, prepared by the staff of commissioner for  economic and financial affairs Henning Christophersen, takes a  positive view of measures taken to reform the Spanish labor  market but believes they will need more time to bear fruit.    Initially, it expects business and industry to take  advantage  of labor's greater flexibility to complete workforce downsizing,  and this will add to the state's financial burden by putting  more people on the unemployment rolls.    "In the short term, it may exacerbate unemployment, adding  to  the cost of social services. However, in the medium term, there  is hope for improved competitiveness, higher levels of  investment, and creation of new jobs," says the five-page  chapter devoted to Spain, to which DIARIO 16 obtained access.    In its review of the Spanish economy, it described as  "optimistic" the government's avowed goal of keeping the fiscal  deficit at 6.4 percent of Gross Domestic Product [GDP], "unless  there is significant economic recovery."    Economic experts in Brussels say one of the biggest problems  is resistance to the need to cut social spending.    However painful it may be, says the report, "the deficit  demands a reevaluation of social spending in light of the  country's financial capacity, and more selective access to  welfare benefits."    Also, the commission notes that decentralization is impeding  the central government's efforts to directly influence the  deficits run at regional and (most importantly) local levels,  i.e., the municipalities.    "It would be appropriate to improve coordination between the  various levels of government," says the aforementioned report in  its chapter on Spain.    The Spanish economy's competitive position improved in 1993  with devaluation of the peseta (13 percent against the German  mark), but it would have been even better if accompanied by  greater restraint in wage increases. (The effects of  devaluation) "were somewhat attenuated by the poor behavior of  the labor market."    Brussels experts fear that the recent amelioration of  inflation, which stood at 4.6 percent last year, cannot  continue. "It cannot be taken as certain that the progress in  dampening inflation will continue in 1994. The impact of the  peseta's devaluation on domestic prices, combined with a  recovery in demand, may push prices up again. Prospects will  continue to deteriorate without better wage restraint."    The report opines, however, that Community economies overall  have "succeeded in weathering the worst of the recession," even  if "the most recent indicators offer scant evidence for a rapid  recovery."    For example, the commission report says that GDP in the EU  will grow by 1.3 percent this year. Unemployment will rise by  0.5 percent to 11.5 percent of the work force.    Average inflation will be 3.5 percent, versus 3.8 percent  last year. The European Commission says growth in 1995 will be  2.1 percent and there will be a net increase in number of jobs  (+0.2 percent).</p>

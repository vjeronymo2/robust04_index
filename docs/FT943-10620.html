			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Delay over Saudi power contract Saudi Arabia has delayed the award of a Dollars 1bn power project in Riyadh, the capital, and is still evaluating ways of financing it, Reuter reports from Manama. Industry sources said the Kingdom was assessing financing proposals from US banks and from Belleli Saudi Heavy Industries, one of the companies competing for the deal. BSHI, in consortium with General Electric of the US and Binladen, a Saudi company, submitted the lowest bid of Dollars 970m to the Saudi Consolidated Electric Company. Further customer options have raised the cost of the 1,200MW plant to around Dollars 1bn. Asea Brown Boveri of Sweden and Siemens of Germany were also competing to win the contract.</p>

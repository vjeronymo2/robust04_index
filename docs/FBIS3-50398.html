He should be arriving in  Belgrade this evening.    [Ilic] Currently the most controversial person on the  international political scene, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of  the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, arrived this afternoon  in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at the invitation of the  Serbian Democratic Party of all Serbian Lands and the  Serbian-Russian Friendship Society. He was welcomed at the  Hungarian-Yugoslav border crossing by Radomir Smiljanic.  Expressing thanks for the welcome, Zhirinovskiy said that he  was happy that he had stepped onto Serbian soil, onto the  beginning of the Slav world, and that he was among the people  who are today fervently fighting for all the Slavs.    After a brief traditional Orthodox ceremony, Zhirinovskiy  went to Subotica, where he was greeted by many citizens.  Addressing them, he said: I am coming to your country for the  first time, but I am coming here as a representative of the  victorious party at the Russian elections, as a representative  of Russia, which has chosen a new course. This course is the  obligation of Russia to help the brotherly Serbian people. Our  enemies are our common enemies and you ought to know that they  will be punished for all the evils committed against the Slav  people.    A new era is beginning, Zhirinovskiy said. His words were  accompanied with chanting: Russia, Serbia. He stressed that the  enemies of the Slav people are now trembling in Paris, Bonn,  London, and Washington.    Commenting on the war the Serbian people are waging on the  territory of the former Yugoslavia, Zhirinovskiy said that all  the barbarians that have settled on the sacred Serbian soil must  accept the fact that this land belongs to the Serbian people, or  leave it.    After a brief stop in a big restaurant in Subotica, Agros  Centar, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy continued his journey to Belgrade,  where he will hold a news conference. According to the plan,  Zhirinovskiy will visit Bijeljina as a guest of the republic of  Srpska, and then meet Milan Martic, newly elected president of  the republic of Serbian Krajina, in Vukovar.</p>

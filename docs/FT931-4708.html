			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Fish row protests stepped up FISHERMEN IN Grimsby yesterday prevented French fish from being unloaded for the second day running in the latest stage of a growing European Community dispute over cheap imports. Police were yesterday investigating a separate incident on Monday night in which trawlermen at Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, poured diesel oil into the hold of a Russian factory ship. The actions in the UK coincided with further protests by French fishermen against cheap fish imports following a violent clash between fishermen and riot police outside the fish market in Nantes. The National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, representing most fishermen in England and Wales, said UK fishermen were frustrated by what they perceived as their disadvantaged financial situation in the face of government restrictions, a flood of cheap imports from Russia and Norway, and an increase in fish landed by EC boats. Mr Barry Deas, federation secretary, said: 'We are operating against weak demand. What we really need are tight quantitive controls on the amount of fish coming in.' Mr David Curry, fisheries minister, accused fishermen of simplifying the problem besetting the industry, and inadequately regulating themselves. He warned that protest action would undermine the government's attempts to argue its case within the EC. Mr Curry said: 'It may be that imports are playing some role in the problems of the market place at the moment. But that is not the only factor. British fishermen are landing too much fish simultaneously. They are oversupplying the market.' The minister described the protest actions in Grimsby and Peterhead as 'totally silly' when UK ministers were urging their French counterparts to take measures to protect British lorries. The complex issues besetting the fishing industry were highlighted last night by Mr Philip Greig, managing director of Abacus Frozen Foods, the importer of the Russian fish destroyed by Monday night's action in Peterhead. Mr Greig said Russian cod was being imported in exchange for locally fished haddock and whiting. He warned that further protest action would force the closure of his factory and have a knock-on effect on local fishermen. Mr Ron Gillan, chief executive of the Scottish North East Fish Producers' Organisation, said he could not rule out the possibility of protest action spreading among British ports.</p>

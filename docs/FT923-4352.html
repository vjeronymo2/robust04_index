			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UK loses chance of Pounds 1bn tank exports VICKERS of the UK has lost the chance of a Pounds 1bn Swedish export deal because it is unable to send one of its new Challenger 2 tanks for field trials. Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive of the group, said the Ministry of Defence refused to release one of the eight prototypes being tested for the British army. It is understood the decision was taken at a senior level of the MoD's procurement executive. Mr Anders Bjorck, Swedish defence minister, said yesterday the Challenger 2 had been ruled out of a competition to supply 200 battle tanks to the Swedish army. He expressed astonishment that the UK had turned down a request to take part in field trials starting in Sweden on October 1. The Swedish government made a second request, thinking there had been a misunderstanding. 'The answer was very clearly 'We can't' and so we skipped it,' Mr Bjorck said. The competition would now be between the German Leopard 2, the US M1A2 Abrams and the French Leclerc tank, he said. A contract was due early in 1994. Last year, Vickers won a fiercely fought UK contest for 130 tanks in a deal worth more than Pounds 400m. Export prospects was one of the arguments used in support of its bid against its three main western rivals. One of the nine Challenger 2 prototypes is in Saudi Arabia, following recent trials in Kuwait. Further trials aimed at securing contracts are due to be conducted in the United Arab Emirates and Oman. Mr Bjorck said the UK plainly considered the Middle East to be more important than Sweden. Vickers had pinned hopes on Sweden as its biggest western export prospect in the near future. Sir Colin said that he hoped Vickers would be able to rejoin the contest: 'We are hoping common sense will prevail between the two governments.' If Vickers had unilaterally removed one of its tanks from the UK test programme it would have been in breach of its contractual commitment, he said. The Swedish minister, who was attending the Farnborough Air Show, was due to meet Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, last night. Farnborough air show, Page 8</p>

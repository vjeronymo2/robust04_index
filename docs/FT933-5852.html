			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Growing out of the traditional boundaries: Changes fuelled by the Midland buy HSBC Holdings is hardly the household name in Britain that Hongkong and Shanghai Bank used to be in Asia. Its interim results yesterday showed one of the reasons. The true nature of the bank is hard to detect because it has only started to take shape over the past year. The results were full of adjustments for the consolidation of Midland Bank, currency movements and other one-offs such as the Pounds 484m disposal of a stake in Cathay Pacific. Yet below these complications, a quite different bank from the traditional one seems to be forming. The bank's aim is to become a well balanced business with strong enough risk management controls to avoid some of its past mishaps with foreign acquisitions. HSBC's acquisition of Midland - which now comprises Pounds 67bn of the Pounds 183bn assets - was intended to reduce its reliance on Hong Kong. The 46 per cent of assets that now lie in Europe produced 30 per cent of profits. The manner in which assets expanded from Pounds 143bn in June last year  - adjusted for Midland - shows its two-pronged development. The first line of growth was in trading assets such as debt securities held by Midland. Midland's purchase of gilts and other government bonds nearly doubled debt security holdings to Pounds 21.5bn. This was in contrast to poor loan demand in Europe. The second component of growth was different: the increase in residential mortgages, particularly in Hong Kong. Mortgage assets rose from Pounds 14.6bn to Pounds 19.2bn over the year. The bank has tried to limit risk from a housing market downturn by lending an average of 63 per cent of asset value. Mr John Bond, HSBC's chief executive, said the bank was 'comfortable' with its mix of assets. But the re-balancing of assets raises two questions: whether it is exposing itself to risks through assets growth; and what criteria it will use to allocate capital. The risk question has been given added force by a further slip in the Marine Midland US retail bank subsidiary. It had to write down the value of its mortgage servicing business by Dollars 182m (Pounds 122.9m) because many consumers repaid fixed rate loans. The business has now been reduced to a net value of Dollars 96m. Mr Bond argued that risk in Hong Kong had been limited by the low loan-to-value ratio, and avoidance of people buying and selling houses rapidly. The bank regards treasury assets as low risk because they are more liquid than medium-term loans. The longer-term question is the criteria by which the bank will choose where to allocate its capital. It is becoming popular among banks to set targets for returns on equity against which their parts can be judged. But HSBC does not believe in such targets, largely because its businesses are diverse. It judges returns on what it would get by putting the money into local treasury bonds. It believes returns on equity will be lower in low inflation economies, but this will be balanced by increases in asset values as currencies appreciate. This means it does not judge subsidiaries wholly on their earnings. 'We are looking for continuous improvement. We do not have a catch-all return on equity target,' said Mr Bond. If so, it means that HSBC will develop differently - perhaps more organically - than banks which judge themselves by clinical rules, though its emergence is likely to take some time yet.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 24 Mar Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] on 23  March decided to send a mission of party Diet members, led by  Vice Chairman Issei Inoue (director general of the party's  International Bureau), to China for three days from 1 April to  discuss the issue of nuclear inspections in the DPRK (North  Korea). Among the coalition parties, the SDPJ is in the unique  position of being the only party with connections to North  Korea, through the Workers Party of Korea [WPK], and it wants to  probe for a "dialogue-based" way of resolving the issue in  meetings with Chinese officials. The mission will also conduct  advance consultations on party General Secretary Wataru Kubo's  visit to China in May.    Kazou Watanabe, director of the party's General Affairs  Bureau, and Hajime Fukada, director of its Organization Bureau,  are other members of the mission, and they are due to meet with  such key Chinese officials as Liu Shuzheng, head of the CPC  International Liaison Department, and Zhu Liang, former head of  the department.    When the SDPJ met, Chairman Tomiichi Murayama spoke about  the  tense situation over the nuclear inspection issue on 22 March,  and emphasized the importance of dialogue, saying, "We should  refrain from immediate economic sanctions, and should try to  resolve the mater through dialogue."    At the party planning conference held the same day, the view  emerged that "the government should continue efforts to find a  breakthrough in the situation by resuming Japan-DRPK talks" and  "Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to China with  sanctions against North Korea in mind is a de-facto failure."    Meanwhile, on 23 March, Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the  Japanese Trade Union Confederation [Rengo], urged the SDPJ to  make diplomatic efforts, and expressed the hope that Murayama  "will work on North Korea -- through the WPK -- to accept  international opinions."    The SDPJ is expected to confirm, at a meeting of the Central  Executive Committee on 24 March, that it wants to work with the  other coalition member parties to resolve the issue through  dialogue.</p>

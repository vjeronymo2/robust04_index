			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Finland's measures avert devaluation FINLAND succeeded in averting a devaluation of its currency yesterday following the announcement of an emergency economic package at the weekend and pledges of support from the Bundesbank and the Nordic central banks to help maintain the value of the markka. The centre-right government hastily put together a FM10bn (Pounds 1.3bn) package of cuts in welfare spending in an attempt to calm Finland's panicky financial markets. Short-term interest rates soared on Friday after a row between the government and the central bank over policy prompted the governor of the Bank of Finland to announce his resignation. Interest rates continued to rise when the markets opened yesterday but gradually fell back during the day as some semblance of calm took hold. In Sweden, the overnight rate was increased from 11 per cent to 13 per cent to prevent further krona outflows, after Skr22bn (Pounds 2.1bn) flooded out of the country on Friday. Finland's one-month Helibor rate climbed to 25 per cent yesterday from its close of 16.76 per cent on Friday, but gradually slipped back to around 18-19 per cent by the end of trading. The Bank of Finland said that there were further outflows of currency yesterday despite the high interest rates, but added that the outflow was nowhere near as high as on Friday, when an estimated FM5bn-10bn left the country. 'There was some selling pressure on the Finnmark so we intervened in the market to maintain its level,' said Mr Markus Fogelholm, head of market operations at the central bank, adding that the markka had closed marginally firmer against the Ecu. Analysts responded to the government's package of welfare cuts with some caution. Mr Roger Kempe, an analyst at Evli Securities, one of the largest securities houses in Finland, said: 'Overall the reaction to these measures was good, but they are not sufficient and so we could see some further nervousness. The government needs to cut spending this year, and by FM20bn-25bn.' The government said its FM10bn cuts in spending would take place in 1993. See Capital Markets Page</p>

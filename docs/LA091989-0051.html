Lebanese police said the exchanges at  times averaged 20 shells a minute and that six people were killed. Hundreds  have been killed since March, when the most recent round of fighting began. The  renewed dueling began after Maj. Gen. Aoun announced his rejection of a  security committee proposed by Arab mediators over the weekend.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mozambique Armed Forces General Domingos </F> Fondo by reporter Almiro Santos; place and date not given]    [Text] Domingos Fondo is the general everyone is talking  about. He was curt, perhaps "abrupt." He spoke only a few words  to say what went on in his mind. "I shall not grant any more  interviews for as long as Dhlakama does not prove my involvement  in arms smuggling," he said.    That was all. The person who caused the storm was Afonso  Dhlakama, the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader,  who accused General Fondo of being involved in smuggling weapons  to South Africa.    Gen. Fondo will not be taking Dhlakama to court on charges  of  defamation. The general is not worried. The general is waiting  for the Renamo leader to prove that he is guilty. The family of  the general is not angry. The general got to know Dhlakama when  the latter was a "logistics soldier." What the general wants to  know about is national reconciliation and he wants "to taste the  fruit of the national liberation armed struggle."    The rest is up to the Renamo leader: let him prove it.    Until he does so, this will be Gen. Domingos Fondo's last  interview.    [Santos] Gen. Fondo: you have been the commander of the  border security troops for nearly four years. During that  period did you detect any signs of arms smuggling to South  Africa?    [Fondo] Well, I thought you might have wanted to begin by  asking what I had done during the national liberation armed  struggle. Where you want to begin only reflects half of the  work I have done.    As for your question, I must tell you that there were not  just signs of arms smuggling to and from South Africa. There  was also the smuggling of vehicles and strategic export products  such as cashews, rosewood, sandalwood and so forth. In other  words, all those products that a person carries and illegally  takes to another country. There were also persons who were  caught illegally crossing both sides of the border.    When we talk about South Africa, we talk about an area that  begins up in Pafuri....    [Santos] But how did the border security troops deal with  those cases of smuggling and with the smugglers?    [Fondo] Seeing that it was not up to us to judge -- we were  there only to ensure that the law was observed -- those persons  were taken to the police and to court. Obviously, first we  asked some small questions, we tried to establish who was  driving the vehicle, whether the hidden goods belonged to him,  and so on, after which that person would be taken to the  authorities with jurisdiction, notably the police. Thus, the  case had been opened and, from that point onward, it was left in  the hands of the courts. We were not informed about the  evolution of the case because it was no longer our concern, at  least until the border security forces were disbanded.    [Santos] How many cases were detected at the time?    [Fondo] I believe that the public and the journalists had  the  opportunity to follow the cases that were discovered. It was  not just South Africa. It was also Swaziland. Weapons are the  prime concern of the bilateral security commission. Those  weapons are not taken to the countries by the persons that will  use them....    [Santos] They are taken by persons who want to score some  money, is that right?    [Fondo] That is right: Those weapons are taken by persons  who  are interested in making money. They smuggle any kind of  merchandise.    [Santos] A documentary was run at one time that depicted the  alleged killing of elephants in Renamo-controlled areas so that  ivory could be exchanged for weapons. General, did you come  across any such case while you were commander of the border  security forces?    [Fondo] No, I never discovered such a thing.  <H5>  Absolutely Nothing </H5>   [Santos] After that accusation by the Renamo president, have  you, General, been asked by any institution to make a statement?  Are you facing any inquiry at this point?    [Fondo] I must tell you that I have nothing, really  absolutely nothing to answer in connection with that matter.  Perhaps the person who reported it has something to tell some  institution. I do not.    [Santos] That means, then, that you are at peace with  yourself...    [Fondo] Absolutely.    [Santos] But, in your opinion, General, what may have been  the reason for those accusations by the Renamo president?    [Fondo] I do not know. I cannot say what the reason may have  been. It is pretty much like when a person wants to buy a  shirt: I cannot say why a person would want to buy a particular  shirt. It is not I who must respond to that question. He is  the one who must answer it.    [Santos] General: Do you know Mr. Afonso Dhlakama?    [Fondo] Yes, I do. We worked together at one time.    [Santos] Within the Frelimo Party?    [Fondo] Yes, within the Frelimo Party. He worked and he was  in Frelimo them.    [Santos] He came in 1973....    [Fondo] That concerns the Personnel Department.    [Santos] But what was he working as, when you got to know  him?    [Fondo] He was working in the logistics department. He was a  logistics soldier.    [Santos] In Beira?    [Fondo] Yes, in Beira.    [Santos] General, did you have any problems in your  relationship with Afonso Dhlakama at the time?    [Fondo] If memory does not fail me, I was in Cabo Delgado  Province at the time and I was provincial military commander.    [Santos] The president of the Republic has told our  newspaper  that your name never cropped up at meetings he has had with the  Renmao leader. Would you care to comment?    [Fondo] I have no comment to make.    [Santos] At the news conference which you held, you said:  "He  will pay." Exactly what did you mean by that?    [Fondo] The meaning is clear, when I say "he will pay." It  is very clear. He will pay because he is the person who is  worried. He will pay. Whom will he pay? He will pay the  public, because he must inform the public on the basis of  concrete evidence. That is what pay means: he must explain to  the public exctaly what such and such a thing means.    For instance, right now I am the one who is paying. I should  not be asked such questions. I am paying for Dhlakama's worries.    There is one other thing I would like to say: journalists  and  reporters are constantly around me. I would like to inform you,  the journalists, here and now, that until such a time as Mr.  Dhlakama confirms his accusations, I do not want, I do not want,  and I strongly emphasize that I do not want you, the  journalists, to ask me any more questions in connection with  that matter. Go to the person who has the details and ask him.  You are just wasting my time.  <H5>  The General's Affairs </H5>   [Santos] Perhaps we can ask other questions. Can we, for  instance, talk about your businesses?    [Fondo] We can.    [Santos] May we begin with your companies?    [Fondo] As a matter of principle, I am a person who does not  like to talk much. If there are people who are worried, those  people should go to the places where I have my interests as a  citizen. I have farms....    [Santos] Here in Maputo?    [Fondo] Yes, here in Maputo.    [Santos] Are they far?    [Fondo] No, they are not far. I have a farm here at Pequenos  Libombos. I have another farm in Corumana. I have workers  there, and they are working even though I am not there. Just go  there and you will get the answers you are looking for.    If you do not know me, you can get to know me now. Fondo is  a Mozambican citizen. What is his background, though? Just go  directly to the area of Fondo, in Zavala District, Inhambane  Province. You will see the area of Fondo on the map. Just go  there and see for yourselves the work that this man Fondo is  doing with the property he inherited from his grandparents, his  parents, and so on. You will see that, after all Fondo does all  this work when he comes here, when he is here on leave, and as  the inheritor of this farm.    You are going to learn all that. Now, there is no point in  asking me about that here in the city, because I may give you  the wrong answer and you may turn around and say that, no, this  was not what you wanted to know. Just go out there and you  shall find answers to your concerns.  <H5>  On The Attack Again </H5>   [Santos] Do you really think, General, that there are  Mozambique Armed Forces, FAM, soldiers involved in arms  smuggling practices?    [Fondo] I might also ask you: is this an accusation against  the FAM forces?    [Santos] No, it is no accusation.    [Fondo] Well, then, drop the question.    [Santos] It is just that many people have been saying  that...    [Fondo] I would like to insist that if this is an accusation  against the FAM forces, I will show where it is. [sentence as  heard]    [Santos] No, obviously it is not an accusation.    [Fondo] That settles it, then.    [Santos] I would just like to know your stand on this  matter.    [Fondo] I have no opinion on it. You must tell me, though,  whether this is an accusation against the FAM forces.    [Santos] No, it is not. General, will you be suing the  Renamo  president on grounds of defamation?    [Fondo] I do not believe I should be the one to answer that  question. As I have said before, he is the one who must produce  proof.    [Santos] So General, you are waiting for the Renamo leader  to  prove his charges?    [Fondo] Yes. It is not up to me to prove them. The onus is  on him.    [Santos] General, will you not take the matter to court?    [Fondo] No. Even my children are cracking jokes. They went  to "Chope" and they are calm. Tomorrow, others will go to  Zavala. They are all calm, and they will be traveling by bus.    [Santos] What about your colleagues? Don't they ask you  anything?    [Fondo] No, we are all at peace with ourselves.    [Santos] That means, then, that the journalists are the only  people who are troubling you, General?    [Fondo] No, not even the journalists, who, I think, are only  looking for the truth.    [Santos] Hypothetically, were you to make accusations  against  the Renamo leader, could you have made them? Perhaps you have  collected evidence of some irregularities in all the time you  have worked....    [Fondo] As a general and a member of the FAM forces, I have  had to overcome hurdles from the outset. We have had political  problems with Portugal. Everything ended automatically. Good  boy. [as published]    Then we had [Ian] Smith. There were very serious problems,  widespread destruction, and the war was over. Good boy.    Now, we are going through a time of reconciliation. I have  no accusations to make against anyone. The country, the people,  are engaged in reconciliation at this time, to ensure that the  country is free and that people enjoy peace and independence  after going for so long without knowing what independence really  is and, above all, without enjoying the fruit of the national  liberation armed struggle.    [Santos] As you said at the beginning of the interview,  perhaps we can cut your interview in half by beginning at the  time when you were already commander of the border security  forces. Let us go back in time, then. When did you join Frelimo?    [Fondo] I joined Frelimo directly in 1965.    [Santos] Like many others, did you use the Swaziland route?    [Fondo] Yes, via Swaziland, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia,  and up to Tanzania.    [Santos] So you met up with Frelimo in Tanzania?    [Fondo] Yes, I did.    [Santos] Is that where you were trained?    [Fondo] Yes. All our group was trained in Tanzania.    [Santos] Then you had to fight. What front were you on?    [Fondo] I was always lucky, really very lucky. Perhaps my  colleagues did not have that sort of luck. I went on courses  abroad, came back to Tanzania, and that is how it was.    [Santos] Were you in Algeria, too?    [Fondo] No, I was not in Algeria. Eventually, I was placed  in Cabo Delgado Province. People even thought I was a member of  the Maconde tribe. I speak the Maconde language, and I am proud  of it. I am proud of coming from the south and of speaking a  northern language. I am proud of having friends there whom I  regard as more my brothers than the people from my own area. I  had very close relations with them.    [Santos] So, you fought in Cabo Delgado, then?    [Fondo] Yes, I did. I also used to go abroad and then return  to Cabo Delgado. After the period of transitional government, I  came to these parts and I was even chosen as a commander. I was  the first provincial military commander for Cabo Delgado  Province. Then, I was in Maputo, Gaza, and Mapai. Then Smith  came up and caused another problem. He presented another cheek.  That was it: I was sent to Inhambane then.    [Santos] Are you resting now that there is peace?    [Fondo] Yes, now I am resting.    [Santos] You are not confined yet?    [Fondo] A general is never confined. When the times comes  for a general to be confined...a general can only be retired,  not confined.</p>

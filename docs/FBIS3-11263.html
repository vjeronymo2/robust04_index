			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Haji Ahmad  Badawi acknowledged, in a meeting with Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina, that Cuba is clearly making progress and that  under no pretext should anyone exert pressure on that country.    Robaina arrived in the Malaysian capital yesterday from  India. In an exchange, his counterpart reiterated that it is the  Cubans who alone must determine their fate -- an allusion to the  U.S. policy against Cuba. The Malaysian foreign minister also  expressed his satisfaction with the Cuban Foreign Ministry's new  policy of rapprochement with the region, and stressed that he is  willing to form a businessmen's delegation to visit Havana over  the next few months to increase trade between the two nations.    Robaina agreed with the Malaysian foreign minister on the  need to take practical steps toward progress in the world of  communication. Robaina said: We are here to learn about and  assess the experiences of countries that, like this one, have  enjoyed sustained development.</p>

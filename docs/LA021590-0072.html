			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROWTH AGAIN ELECTION ISSUE IN CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> POLITICS: MAYOR JOZELLE SMITH IS ONE OF THREE CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR TWO CITY  COUNCIL SEATS. COMPETING MEASURES THAT WOULD SET BUILDING LIMITS WILL ALSO BE  ON THE BALLOT.  </P> <P> Two years ago, growth was the major issue in a campaign that saw nine  candidates run for three City Council seats in Culver City. This year, voters  will get a replay of the issue as three candidates vie for two seats.  </P> <P> Also competing against each other are two ballot measures, one to limit  building height and the other to impose density controls on buildings over a  certain height.  </P> <P> The candidates are Mayor Jozelle Smith and newcomers Mike Balkman and Tom  Hammons. Richard Alexander, a four-term councilman, decided not to run for  reelection, citing personal reasons, including a desire to travel. He said he  endorses Balkman and Smith.  </P> <P> Although slow-growth forces consider Balkman as pro-development and  pro-business, he likes to talk in terms of "balanced . . . renewal."  </P> <P>  "Growth means that you've got land and can expand on it. We don't have a lot  of that in Culver City," said Balkman, the 36-year-old president of an  electrical contracting company and a member of the Culver City Chamber of  Commerce board of directors. Instead, he said, "you take an area that's older,  and renew it by putting new things on it. That has to be balanced between  residential and commercial."  </P> <P> Hammons, 51, is a district manager for Thrifty Drug Stores. He is backed by  Councilmen Steven Gourley and Jim Boulgarides, who trumpeted slow-growth when  they defeated incumbents in 1988.  </P> <P> Smith said she is running on her record of the past four years, which includes  "promoting our responsible growth, even though Los Angeles is going wild with  free-wheeling developments all around us" and "cooperation with the business  community." Smith, 50, is an insurance agent and a columnist for a local  newspaper.  </P> <P> Voters in the April 10 election will also decide on the two competing measures,  one proposed by the City Council and the other the result of a citizens'  petition drive. Should both measures pass, the one that gets the most votes  will take effect.  </P> <P> The voters' initiative specifies only a limit on height -- 56 feet (about four  stories) -- in certain commercial zones. Slow-growth advocates collected nearly  3,000 signatures in 1988 to qualify it for the ballot. The vote would have been  taken sooner if more signatures had been gathered.  </P> <P> An interim ordinance that expires on Election Day limits the height of  buildings to 58 1/2 feet, with an additional 13 1/2 feet allowed for  architectural features and mechanical or electrical equipment.  </P> <P> The council's measure would impose a limit on how much of a lot could be  covered by a structure and create traffic-mitigation requirements for any  non-residential buildings taller than 43 feet. Such buildings would also be  prohibited from blocking views or causing "significant detriment" by their  shade, shadows or glare.  </P> <P> The city attorney has said that if the council proposal wins, the height limit  would revert to that in the Zoning Code: 167 feet (12 stories).  </P> <P> Robin Turner, a sponsor of the citizens' measure, attacks the council version  as having no built-in height limit, saying it leaves too much up to the  council. "It's at all their own discretion what's going to give shadow (and  block) views."  </P> <P> She said the council put its proposal on the ballot only to "discredit ours. .  . . It's a total disregard of what the citizens' wishes are."  </P> <P> Hammons agreed, saying the council version would allow "three people only (on  the five-member council) . . . to approve a building (167 feet) tall, . . .  regardless of the public's sentiments."  </P> <P> But Smith said this was unlikely. "I can never envision 167 feet in my lifetime  because we don't have that kind of open space." A building that tall must still  meet setback and other requirements, she said.  </P> <P> She and Balkman said the citizens' initiative lacks flexibility. "It's  impossible to project what kinds of land uses might come before us down the  road, where we may want to go higher than 56 feet," Smith said.  </P> <P> The council's measure, she said, is more comprehensive because it includes  criteria besides height. But Turner and Hammons argue that those considerations  are handled by strict setback, parking and other requirements that the city  already has.  </P> <P> All the council candidates agree that downtown, where Washington and Culver  boulevards cross, needs some sort of master plan. Smith and Hammons speak of a  "pedestrian-friendly" area with shops and restaurants. Balkman called the  downtown a "run-down" mishmash.  </P> <P> "We've got Filmland (Corporate Center)," a modern glass edifice, "and virtually  across the street, (the Spanish-style) Meralta Plaza," he said. "Those  buildings don't fit at all with each other."  </P> <P> The three candidates also pledge to fight traffic gridlock. "This is one of the  worst laid out cities in terms of traffic and roads," Balkman said, saying the  streets are too narrow and complaining about the Los Angeles traffic that cuts  across Culver City's main arteries.  </P> <P> Culver City's relationship with surrounding Los Angeles came to the fore again  recently with the Culver City's Planning Commission's approval of Marina Place,  a proposed regional mall at the western edge Culver City. Los Angeles officials  are objecting to the project because of anticipated problems with traffic,  noise and pollution.  </P> <P> The approval came despite findings that the mall, similar in size to the  Westside Pavilion, would burden nearby intersections, hamper access to the  beach and lead to unhealthful levels of air pollution. Culver City will net an  estimated $2.5 million a year in taxes and business license fees should the  mall be built. The City Council is expected to consider the mall's plans by  early March.  </P> <P> Balkman and Smith said they support the project as is, with Balkman saying that  "any project is going to have some negative."  </P> <P> "We've honestly tried to mitigate it the best we can," Smith said. "I don't  think we're thumbing our nose at L.A."  </P> <P> Hammons, however, said the project should be scaled down, saying, "I think of  it as if I were living there." Cutting its size by 25% would still produce  plenty of revenue for the city, he said.  </P> <P> Hammons said his candidacy stems from three years ago when the council  "(imposed) its will on my (Sunkist Park) neighborhood" and erected barricades  to solve traffic problems there. After an outcry by residents, the council  reversed itself, but then installed stop signs and turn restrictions.  </P> <P> "I want to see that we prevent the government from imposing on another  neighborhood," said Hammons, a member of the Culver City Homeowners Assn. He  also is a member of council-appointed committees on the Studio Drive-In site  and on sign ordinances. He will promote the need to improve parks and  recreational facilities, he said.  </P> <P> Balkman, who sent surveys to registered voters to get input on issues, agrees  with Hammons that communication between residents and city government is  inadequate. The city should write synopses of upcoming council and  Redevelopment Agency agendas and have them printed in local newspapers, he  said. The City Council, he said, has to be more fiscally responsible and ask  common sense questions.  </P> <P> Balkman is the president of the Culver City Lions Club and a member of the  Culver City Homeowners Assn. He said the city should help the school district  with security, maintenance and by donating equipment.  </P> <P> Smith argues that City Hall has already had an open door, to the extent of  getting criticized for "involving citizens too much, where a simple  grab-the-bull-by-the-horns-and-council-make-a-decision would be the right or  proper thing to do."  </P> <P> She is pleased with the revamping of Studio Village shopping center but decries  the number of mini-malls in the city. But, she added, "it's unrealistic to  think we can only attract Beverly Hills-type shops because we're not a Beverly  Hills neighborhood."  </P> <P> City Clerk Pauline Dolce is running unopposed for another four-year term.  </P></p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Hosokawa abandons cabinet reshuffle Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, last night abandoned plans for an immediate cabinet reshuffle in the face of opposition from two members of his seven-party coalition, write Our Tokyo and Foreign Staff. The Social Democratic party, the largest partner, sensitive that the right wing of the coalition is increasing its influence over the prime minister, feared a hasty cabinet change could cause the fragile seven-party alliance to collapse. At a meeting with Mr Hosokawa last night the small New Harbinger party was also said to have opposed the move. Its main representative in the cabinet is Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, who was likely to have been a victim of the reshuffle. Mr Takemura had earlier maintained he had no personal objection to losing his job. The upheavals have started to harm the government's popularity, according to two polls yesterday, showing that support for the cabinet had fallen from a record high to its lowest since the coalition came to power last August. Mr Hosokawa is planning an important policy speech to parliament tomorrow to coincide with the submission of a final Y73,080bn (Pounds 468bn) budget for the coming year.</p>

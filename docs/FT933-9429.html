			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Letter: A better way to save on energy bills Sir, Re 'Advance payments could avoid VAT on fuel bills' (August 7), if energy consumers have cash to spare for such payments they would be far better advised to spend it on energy efficiency improvements at home - thus saving themselves far more than the 8 per cent VAT this year, next year, and for ever more. An investment of Pounds 1,500 in the right combination of house insulation, draught proofing, heating controls, low energy lighting and a more efficient boiler could save a typical householder 30-50 per cent of their energy bills  -enough to pay the VAT and still have change. And if all the energy and hot air devoted by populist politicians in attacking VAT on fuel had been devoted to the cause of energy efficiency, we'd all be better off, with lower fuel bills and less environmental damage.

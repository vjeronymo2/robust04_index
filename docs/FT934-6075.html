			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Thorp market tested and offers jobs in high unemployment area Sir, With 3,000 jobs on the line at the Thorp plant at Sellafield and many more at stake in contracting companies such as mine, the debate about whether the plant should open is absurd, as Paul Leventhal suggests (Letters, November 23). However, he misses the point. Thorp is built. It has full order books and the customers put up their money in advance. The German and Japanese utilities have said again and again that they stand by their commitments to the plant. What greater market test can there be than that? It is time that British industry was left alone to do the job it knows best: to lead the world in high technology; to make profits and be proud of it. David Compston, chairman, Allott &amp; Lomax, Southwood House, 23 Buckingham Gate, London SW1E 6LB</p>

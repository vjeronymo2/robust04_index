			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ROYAL BEATS ESPERANZA TO WALK OFF WITH TITLE  </P> <P> It took a balanced attack, great serving, tough defense and about an hour for  the Royal High girls' volleyball team to defeat Esperanza, 15-13, 15-4, 15-3,  Saturday in the Southern Section 4-A Division final at Marina High.  </P> <P> Throughout the match, Royal (18-1) used a balanced attack with four players  finishing with six kills or more.  </P> <P> Wende Brown led Royal with nine kills and three blocks, Alison Bantel had eight  kills and Jennifer Hamilton had six kills and four blocks.  </P> <P> As swift and stunning as Royal's victory was, it came as little surprise to  either side. Both had gotten to the final as unseeded teams.  </P> <P> But the fact that Royal was unseeded is misleading. The Highlanders shared the  Marmonte League championship with Thousand Oaks, which was the division's  top-seeded team. "I'm not surprised we dominated tonight," said Royal Coach Bob  Ferguson, whose team had advanced to the semifinals four of the past six years.  </P> <P> "All the kids played so well. It's been like that for the past three weeks."  </P> <P> "We've got a good program," Ferguson said. "I think maybe some people found  that out tonight."  </P> <P> Esperanza, the Empire League champion, had had a surprisingly good year,  dealing La Habra its only loss of the season -- the Highlanders won the 3-A  championship Saturday -- and finishing second in the Orange County  championships.  </P> <P> CHATSWORTH LOSES IN CITY FINAL: Palisades defeated the Chancellors in three  games to win the 4-A title.

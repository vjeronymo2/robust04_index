			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Arts: Toovey's 'Ubu Roi' - Music Theatre The cartoon cuts of Alfred Jarry's Ubu Roi, much celebrated 19th-century precursor of the Theatre of the Absurd, seem to offer a constant temptation to opera composers. Only last year Penderecki's Ubu Rex appeared at the Munich Festival, and now Andrew Toovey's version has been staged in Cardiff by Music Theatre Wales, which commissioned it. The touring production by Keith Turnbull is shared with the Banff Centre in Alberta, Canada. Toovey, born in 1962, has already amassed a substantial catalogue of works; an article by Michael Finnisy in the most recent issue of the magazine Tempo offered a useful introduction to his music. Ubu is his second theatre piece, but much more substantial and ambitious than its predecessor, based upon Artaud. Everything the composer has written about it suggests a summation of his development so far, and hints at the possibility of a fix on his musical style and future prospects. But in both these respects and in fact from every other perspective too, the evening is a huge disappointment, musically thin, dramatically unfocussed and doggedly unfunny. The libretto was prepared by Toovey and Michael Finnissy, making a translation of Jarry's original that is at pains to preserve and to enhance where necessary its scabrous and scatological elements. The intention seems to have been to write an Offenbach comic opera for the 1990s; perhaps the tale of the terrible Ubus is meant to have an awful resonance for our own times. The grotesque Pa Ubu, the Essex Man of his day, is goaded by his equally noxious wife into killing the King and seizing power for himself; he then runs riot in his kingdom, reducing it to ruins by destroying its entire social fabric. Toovey's version is far too leaden, and the humour impossibly coarse-grained to carry any kind of satirical force. An opera that considers that a line like 'Then I'll get the fuck out of here' becomes side-splittingly funny just because it is sung to an ornate vocal line is in dire straits. The score is most convincing when deliberately intended as pastiche - there are some winning Ibert-like numbers, cornily melodic. The accidental pastiches, of the violence of Birtwistle's Punch and Judy or of Maxwell Davies's hyper-expressionism, ring less true, perhaps because they are never placed within a convincing frame. Ubu does not lack the courage of its convictions, but its full frontal assault on the audience's finer sensibilities is never accurately targeted. Toovey is a much more discriminating composer than he allows himself to be here, and a few beautifully imagined passages towards the end of the opera give that game away. The production is reasonably effective, the performance conducted by Michael Rafferty enthusiastic. Both Richard Morris's Pa and Gale Oxley's tenor Ma are larger-than-life horrors; there is a neat Prince Buggerlips from Anne-Margaret Cameron, while Twylla Augustson, representiong both the Nobility and the Army, deals with some stratospheric coloratura with great aplomb. St David's Hall, Cardiff; further performance tonight, and then touring to Milford Haven (October 1), Aberystwyth (October 3), London (Queen Elizabeth Hall, October 5), Swansea (October 7), Builth Wells (October 10)</p>

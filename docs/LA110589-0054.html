			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAME OLD CLAPTRAP  </P> <P> In Leon Whiteson's otherwise interesting article on the admirable Case Study  Exhibit at the Temporary Contemporary ("Homes That Captured the Dream," Oct.  15) it is disappointing to read the same old claptrap about the great  significance of the Case Study program.  </P> <P> It is entirely possible to praise John Entenza's program for its utopian  concept and for the artistry of some of the resulting designs, while at the  same time admitting that it failed in its goal of influencing the mast housing  market. To claim that it had a "major impact" is laughable; of the "major  innovations . . . in popular house design" that Whiteson lists, only the lowly  sliding glass door applies.  </P> <P> False praise does the cause no good. Critics and designers must have a more  clear-eyed view of past successes and failures if their present opinions are to  be valued by others in society.  </P> <P> DAVID R. WEAVER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P>  Weaver is an architect.  </P> <P> </P></p>

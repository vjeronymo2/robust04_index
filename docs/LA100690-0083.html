			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IF JACK CLARK RETURNS, AT LEAST ONE FAN WON'T  </P> <P> After this latest of many tirades by Jack Clark, let's all give the guy a  break. Before anyone calls him a crybaby loser, maybe someone should check to  see if he's being poked by one of his diaper pins. With any luck, poor,  picked-on Clark will be throwing his temper tantrums in some far off city such  as Atlanta or the Bronx come next spring.  </P> <P> DOUG GETTINGER, Oceanside  </P></p>

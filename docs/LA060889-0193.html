			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> BUDGETS FOR REDEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> The Culver City Redevelopment Agency this week adopted a $55-million general  fund budget and a $1-million housing budget for fiscal year 1989-90, which  begins July 1.  </P> <P> The agency's general fund budget includes expenditures for traffic improvements  in the Corporate Pointe area, the acquisition of the Studio Drive-In Theatre  property and start-up cost for a new City Hall.  </P> <P> The budget projects revenues of nearly $83 million, with $28 million to be set  aside as a contingency fund and for new projects.  </P> <P> Half of the agency's 1989-90 housing budget, about $500,000, will cover costs  related to the construction of the Liberty Plaza housing project for low-income  senior citizens. Revenues are expected to be $6 million, with the $5-million  balance set aside for future projects.  </P> <P> The agency is required by state law to set aside 20% of what it takes in from  taxes and bond issue proceeds for construction of affordable housing.  </P> <P> The agency will hold a public hearing June 19 to determine if its efforts to  provide low- and moderate-income housing have been enough to meet the city's  needs.  </P></p>

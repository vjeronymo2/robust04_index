			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Reformed CAP will be a tight fit - David Blackwell on problems looming for medium-scale farmers THE FUTURE of top quality 500-acre family farms in the UK looks bleak, however diluted the proposed EC Common Agricultural Policy reforms become. Two separate recent studies have reached similar conclusions after analysing the effect of the reforms proposed by Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC Farm Commissioner. Central to his plan is a 35 per cent reduction in cereals prices to bring them nearer to world levels. Farmers would get compensation for the cut only if they set aside 15 per cent of their land. Only recently a 500-acre farm would provide a comfortable living - certainly enough to send a couple of sons to public school, according to Mr Malcolm McAllister, managing director of Booker Farming, which farms and advises on 45,000 acres in England. The comfortable living has already disappeared, and the additional imposition of the proposed reforms would be 'devastating' to a 500-acre unit. Its net income, estimated at Pounds 20,000 now, would fall to just Pounds 3,500 before the 'nominal set-aside compensation', Booker predicts. Grant Thornton, the farming accountancy firm, is predicting a fall in the income of a well-run 500-acre farm from Pounds 65.70 an acre to Pounds 55 an acre before rent and finance costs. Given the tightening restrictions in income, it is not surprising that more than 9,000 UK farms have gone out of production in the past five years, as a National Westminster Bank study showed earlier this year. The bank predicted a continuing concentration in the industry as the largest farms expanded and the smallest shrank. Ironically, Mr MacSharry sees his reform plans as supportive of family farming in Europe. 'In this country he will definitely not be supporting the concept of the family farm,' says Mr McAllister. Mr Gary Markham of Grant Thornton points out that even in the UK the MacSharry plans will benefit the average, as opposed to the high performance 500-acre farm, which would show a profit of Pounds 25 an acre compared with the Pounds 21.40 being realised at the moment. However, for most farmers this is still not sufficient to fund interest on borrowings and/or rent, which can be more than Pounds 50 an acre. Mr Markham believes that the MacSharry reforms will be of maximum benefit 'on low performance farms of under 300 acres, but most of these will still trade at a loss, and will probably disappear'. For the bigger farmers the options are limited - they can try to increase output still further, they can reduce fixed costs, or they can adjust their business to make full use of crops such as potatoes and sugar-beet which are not affected by the MacSharry plans. 'Progressive units must plan for the changes now,' Mr Markham says. 'It could make the difference between staying in farming or not, depending on the level of rent or finance.' Booker Farming has worked out that the MacSharry plans would cut the net profit on one of its 1,200-acre farms from Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 19,500. But Mr McAllister believes the damage can be limited through further expansion, such as taking a typical 500-acre farm under contract. Under such a scheme, according to Booker, the owner of the 500-acre farm would end the year with an income of Pounds 27,000 while the net income for the 1,200-acre farm will be Pounds 70,500. The 500-acre farmer's income will come from a fixed sum of Pounds 50 an acre, including the 75 acres of set-aside which Booker would manage, coupled with a share of the profits. Mr McAllister, whose company achieved a return last year of 24 per cent on capital employed, believes such an arrangement would create a single viable business through economy of scale in place of two unviable businesses. The contracted-out farmer would live on his farm and enjoy it, but cease to farm directly. Booker would spend more money on training, hoping to reduce costs on fuel, sprays and fertilisers still further. Last year, Mr McAllister claims a 15 per cent saving on fuel after making sure that every tractor driver could check fuel injectors and filters. Contracting-out might seem a drastic way out, but Mr Markham agrees that increasing the size of a well-run farm appears to be almost the only option to reduce fixed costs by any substantial amount. Meanwhile, Mr Markham points out, it is the uncertainty surrounding the reforms that is hurting the farming business most. 'Let's get on with it and fix the goal posts in place,' he said.</p>

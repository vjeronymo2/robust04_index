			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RABBI SETTLER JAILED IN ARAB'S KILLING FREED  </P> <P> Jewish settler leader Rabbi Moshe Levinger left jail today after serving 13  weeks of a five-month sentence for killing an Arab man and said he would shoot  again if he thought it necessary.  </P> <P> Dozens of supporters and two legislators from the right-wing Likud Party  greeted Levinger on his release from the minimum-security Nir prison.  </P> <P> The legislators lifted Levinger on their shoulders and began dancing in  celebration.  </P> <P> Levinger was convicted by a Jerusalem District Court in April of causing the  shooting death of Kayed Sallah, 42, through negligence. He plea-bargained to  reduce the charge of manslaughter.  </P> <P> In the Sept. 30, 1988, incident in the West Bank town of Hebron, Levinger fired  his pistol indiscriminately after Palestinians stoned his car. Sallah, who was  standing in front of the shoe store he owned, was killed.  </P> <P> The ultra-nationalist rabbi said he fired in self-defense because Arab  protesters stoned his car. But witnesses said he rampaged through Hebron's Arab  market -- overturning stalls and shooting wildly -- well after the stoning.  </P> <P> Levinger vowed today to open fire again if he believed he was in a  life-threatening situation.  </P> <P> "If I'm in a situation of danger again, I'll again open fire," Levinger said on  Israel radio. "I hope that next time, I will be more careful and I won't miss  the target."  </P> <P> Levinger served 92 days of his term and was released early for "good behavior,"  Prison Authority spokeswoman Shuli Meiri said.  </P> <P> Members of the left-wing Mapam Party demonstrated outside the prison to protest  Levinger's early release, scuffling with Levinger's supporters.  </P></p>

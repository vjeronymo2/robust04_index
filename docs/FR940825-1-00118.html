			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for the purposes of both section 116 of the Act and for all of the CAA preemption provisions, including provisions such as section 177 that authorize exclusions from preemption provisions. This will clarify EPA's position that Tribes like States generally have authority to exceed minimum Federal requirements. It will also clarify the fact that Tribes, like States, are preempted from imposing stricter standards where Congress has so specified. This will advance the overarching purpose of the preemption provisions to avoid undue barriers on the trade of goods in commerce.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Provisions for Which no Separate Tribal Program Required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under some provisions of the CAA, Tribes would have a specific role by virtue of having met the minimum eligibility requirements discussed in Part III.A, irrespective of whether a specific program is approved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, under section 107(d)(3), the Administrator would notify an eligible Tribe of information indicating that an area within the Tribe's jurisdiction should be redesignated, and the Tribe would have an opportunity to provide input on that redesignation in the same fashion as a State. Under section 107(d)(3) a Tribe could also submit a revised designation of any area within its jurisdiction on its own motion. Similarly, under section 112(r)(7)(B)(iii), risk management plans would be submitted to Tribal Emergency Response Commissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under sections 169B, 176A and 184 Tribes meeting eligibility requirements for such provisions shall be treated in the same manner as States in identifying what areas should be included in interstate air pollution and visibility transport regions and in establishing commission membership. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA always retains any general discretionary authority to make Federal Indian Reservations part of a transport Region and to include representatives of Indian Tribes as interstate transport Commission members.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Also, treating Tribes in the same manner as States for purposes of section 505(a)(2) would require permitting authorities under Title V to notify an eligible Tribe that is contiguous to a State in which an emission originates and whose air quality may be affected by that emission, or that is within 50 miles of the emission source, of any Title V permit applications that are forwarded to EPA. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Permitting authorities would also be required to provide such Tribes an opportunity to submit written recommendations and to notify such Tribes in writing of any recommendations not accepted and the reasons why. See 40 CFR 70.8(b)(2). Thus, special procedural provisions would apply to Tribes treated in the same manner as States for the purpose of Title V notification. This Title V notification and permitting authority obligation to explain any recommendations not accepted would apply regardless of whether an eligible Tribe has an approved Title V program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The geographic scope of Tribal lands for Title V notification purposes would include any lands over which an eligible Tribe has been determined to have jurisdiction, including any off-reservation lands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As elaborated below, EPA expects that most recognized Tribes will be able to readily meet the eligibility requirements for such provisions as Title V permit application notification. To promote intergovernmental coordination, EPA encourages States and local governments to take steps now to provide Title V notification to Tribes, instead of waiting for a formal eligibility determination by EPA. EPA also encourages Tribes to exercise the notification rights that extend to any citizen under the Title V program in the interim period preceding a Tribal eligibility determination, if necessary to ensure notification. The regulations implementing the Title V operating permit program generally require that permitting authorities must provide adequate procedures for public notice including offering an opportunity for public comment and a hearing on the draft permit. See 40 CFR 70.7(h). These procedures include providing notice of draft permit proceedings to persons on a mailing list developed by the permitting authority, including those who request in writing to be on the list. See 40 CFR 70.7(h)(1). Thus, a Tribe not determined eligible to be treated in the same manner as a State for notification could nevertheless ensure that it receives notification of draft permits by submitting a written request for such notification to appropriate permitting authorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intends to revise existing CAA regulations to reflect this Tribal authority as part of its on-going regulatory development efforts. EPA also requests public comment identifying any other provisions of the CAA which similarly do not require a Tribal program submittal in order for a Tribe to have a role in CAA implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In all instances, including those provisions of the Act for which no separate Tribal program submittal is required, it is a statutory requirement that a Tribe meet the section 301(d)(2) eligibility requirements, discussed in Part III.A above, before it may be treated in the same manner as a State. However, as a practical matter, this should not be burdensome. Often the provisions not requiring accompanying program submittals are intended to promote intergovernmental coordination and involve receipt or transmittal of information or active participation on a multigovernmental entity. Therefore, a minimal demonstration would be necessary to establish Tribal capability to carry out these functions consistent with the terms and purposes of statutory and regulatory requirements. Further, under today's proposed streamlined procedures for determining eligibility, EPA has generally simplified the demonstration that must be made for eligibility approval. Taken together with the minimum capability needed to carry out these particular requirements, most Federally recognized Tribes are expected to be able to readily demonstrate eligibility to be treated in the same manner as States for CAA provisions not requiring a program submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

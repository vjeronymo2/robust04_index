			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Idea" column by Mustafa Amin] </F>   [Text] People were pleased when the prime minister declared  that the government would revoke the emergency law as soon as  terrorism ends. The people will not accept living under this  law when terrorism is over. This law is dubious and of  ill-repute, and the people dub it martial law.    The prime minister's statement urges people to increase  their  resistance to terrorism, because the country does not need more  problems and the people do not want their movements restricted  for three years. Why three years? Does this mean the  government expects terrorism to continue for three more years?    Egypt is the first country to have an emergency law in force  for 13 years. Other countries have declared states of emergency  for one month. Emergency laws have neither curbed nor prevented  terrorism. Terrorism has been on the rise. People have started  to forget what normal life is like, the days when they were  never tried before military courts or state security courts and  when the government never detained anyone for more than three  days.    I always believed that freedom, not the emergency law, could  eliminate terrorism. I recall that all the assassinations in  Egypt took place under martial law and the emergency law. True,  people are aware of the prevailing serious situation, but at the  same time the people believe they can eliminate terrorism while  they enjoy freedom and a normal life free from oppression and  despotism.    Other countries have been seen more terrorist operations  than  our country. Britain, for example, has not declared emergency  law although bombs explode in London daily. Germany has not  passed an emergency law despite the daily demonstrations and the  burning of foreigners' houses.    The government claims that it will not repress writers or  opinions. At the same time, however, we see many journalists  being tried before the criminal court and other journalists  being persecuted at dawn, which is reminiscent of the sixties.    The prime minister has, however, assured us that the  emergency law is temporary, not permanent. This would be a  consolation if true. Let us remember that emergency law was  never declared for even a day in the United States when  President Kennedy was assassinated.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Special to the JORDAN TIMES by Sa'idah Kilani] </F>   [Text] The democratic process in Jordan, a major stride in  the history of the country and the region, is no more than a  political overturn that is likely to be reversed, according to  Jordanian specialists.    "The status quo is a transitory state between predemocracy  and democracy, but staying in the same place for a long time is  equivalent to a reversal (to the original status)," said Jamil  al-Nimri, former chief editor of the opposition weekly AL-AHALI  newspaper. "The presence of the old authority apparatus in  power means the collapse of the democratic regime."    In a conference entitled the Jordanian Democratic Path,  organized jointly by al-Urdun al-Jadid [New Jordan] Research  Centre and Friedrich Ebert Foundation and held at the Forte  Grand hotel, Mr. al-Nimri said that enormous restrictions were  introduced by the laws enacted after the introduction of  democracy in 1989 and they can only negatively influence the  progress of democracy in the Jordanian society. These laws, he  said, include the political parties law, the press and  publications law, the defence law, the state security courts  law, and the elections law. He said they include articles that  can be used by the government to restrict freedoms.    Mr. al-Nimri, who is a member of the leftist party Hashd  said  the press and publications law "was used to file numerous cases  against newspapers for publishing articles that were meant to  enhance freedoms of expression.    "Those negative developments had decreased the people's  interest in democracy and weakened the party life in the country  which is not in favour of social and democratic growth." Mr.  al-Nimri said.    The president of the Writers Association, Mu'nis al-Razzazz,  said one of the most important factors influencing the "relative  Jordanian democratic openness" is the developments in the  Palestinian issue.    He said that Jordan's envisioned role in the process had  hastened the introduction of democracy. Mr. al-Razzazz,  Jordan's leading novelist and a leading columnist, pointed to  several other factors that he considered crucial to the  enhancement of democracy in Jordan. First, the failure of  political parties in assuming a leading role in the Jordanian  political life; setbacks that influenced the democratic march  "that the country was not able to overcome were it not for the  intervention of the King personally", the lack of participation  of the intelligentsia in the civil society organisations such as  Centre for the Study of Freedom, Democracy and human Rights in  the Arab World.    "And perhaps the recent dramatic developments of the  Palestinian issue can be considered as key factors leading to  this reversal," he concluded.    Participants in the three-day conference sought to determine  whether April 1987 riots were behind the introduction of  democracy or not. Most said they feared a setback.    "More than four decades have passed since the promulgation  of  the Constitution, and, during this period, the Jordanian society  had developed politically, socially and economically that it  became necessary to amend and introduce changes to certain  articles," Sulayman Sweiss said during the evening session.    Dr. Sweiss, a prominent human rights advocate, cited the  election law, prisons law, the press and publications law and  the labour law as legislations that include articles that  contradict human rights principles, and, therefore, should be  amended.    "Official statements regarding human rights and democracy  are  almost close to slogans...what we direly need is serious and  pragmatic steps and political will to translate official  commitment to human rights into a reality," he added.    According to Dr. Sweiss, a national strategy should be  adopted to enhance and develop human rights causes. Such a  strategy, he said, should include the appointment of a national  commissioner to protect human rights; official response to  complaints filed by human rights organisations; the introduction  of human rights principles in the school curriculum; the  establishment of centres for enhancing democracy and human  rights; and drafting a comprehensive plan for legal reform in  order to revise laws and legislations in conformity with human  rights principles and conventions.    Musa al-Kilani, chief editor of AL-DUSTUR newspaper,  believes  that the democratic process is going to be slow but steady.  While pointing to several factors that hamper the enhancement  of the democratisation process that he thought were beyond the  government control, Dr. al-Kilani also criticised government  hegemony over the media.    "The most powerful weapon the government uses in its control  of the radio and television and the Jordan News Agency (PETRA),  which are all promoting the government's achievements and its  decisions," Dr. al-Kilani said.    "As for those newspapers that oppose the government's  policies, the government resorts to old laws to punish them," he  added. "It would be sufficient to know that there are currently  50 cases filed against newspapers"</p>

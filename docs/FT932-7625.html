			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Tough road to travel: The challenges facing Adele Biss, the new head of the British Tourist Authority Ms Adele Biss smiled broadly for the cameras in central London yesterday as the government announced she was to be Britain's new tourism chief. If she is still smiling when her term as chairman of the British Tourist Authority and the English Tourist Board ends in three years that will be an achievement in itself. Her predecessor, ex-Punch editor Mr William Davis, rounded off his stint by declaring: 'The pay is absurd and the chances of achieving any worthwhile results are slim.' Ms Biss, who takes up the part-time, Pounds 35,000 a year appointment on June 1, has the advantage that the tourist industry has no preconceived ideas about her. 'I've never heard of her,' said one senior industry figure. 'No one seems to have heard of her.' Ms Biss, 48, has, however, had a successful business career. She was a founder of the Biss Lancaster public relations company which was acquired by WCRS, the advertising group, in 1985. She was also a non-executive director of the British Railways Board for five years. She is currently a director of European Passenger Services, the BR subsidiary that will run rail services through the Channel tunnel. In the 1970s, she worked for Thomson Holidays, the UK's biggest travel group. As a public relations consultant, she represented the Association of British Travel Agents, Pickfords Travel, Holiday Inn and several charter airlines and cruise companies. She also, as an economics student at University College London in the 1960s, took coach-loads of tourists on 10-day trips around Europe, for which they had paid Pounds 19. While her experience with the travel industry has mostly involved taking tourists out of the UK rather than bringing them in, she is not a complete novice. That some in the British travel trade reacted sceptically to her appointment has far more to do with an unwillingness to believe the government will treat the industry fairly and generously than with any personal antipathy. The UK tourist industry employs 1.5m people - more than the construction sector or the health service. It represents about 4 per cent of gross domestic product and contributes Pounds 25bn to the economy annually. Yet it is barely discussed by ministers. Responsibility for tourism has been passed from the Department of Trade and Industry to employment and now to the Department of National Heritage. At national heritage, formed after last year's general election, tourist industry managers believe they are regarded as unimportant compared with broadcasting and the arts. The House of Commons did debate tourism last March, for the first time in nearly five years. But Mr Robert Key, the national heritage minister, was derided for his claim during the debate that the flying of more Union Jacks would assist the industry. The delay in appointing Ms Biss, when the government had known since last January that Mr Davis would not be continuing in the post, was seen as further evidence of official lack of interest. As always, however, the chief gripe is money. While the BTA's grant is to rise from Pounds 32.1m this year to Pounds 33.5m in 1995, the ETB's funding will be cut from Pounds 15.4m this year to Pounds 9.1m in 1995. The BTA promotes Britain abroad, while the ETB attempts to improve the quality of tourist facilities and encourage the locals to take their holidays at home. The government argues that the ETB's work should be done by the 11 English regional tourist boards. Some in the industry agree that at a time of public spending cuts, what money there is should be devoted to the BTA. However, Mr John Jarvis, chairman of the privately-owned Jarvis Hotels group, who has served as interim ETB chairman for the past two months, believes Ms Biss should fight for the ETB's survival. English tourism needs a central co-ordinating board to ensure that standards are maintained and improved. 'To co-ordinate tourism will take more than Pounds 9m,' he says. Mr Jarvis, who described Ms Biss's appointment as a 'refreshing choice', says that a still unpublished study he has commissioned from management consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand will strengthen the argument for the ETB's retention. Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage minister, accepted, during the parliamentary debate, that the BTA performs a function which the private sector cannot. 'Overseas promotion is difficult to organise and the returns to individual businesses may be quite small and unpredictable - not worth the investment. 'The industry, unaided, would not put sufficient money and effort into overseas promotion. The tourism industry is particularly fragmented; it covers many sectors and it is not in the direct interest of any one private sector company to promote Britain as a destination,' he said. While the BTA is a frequent winner of awards for the service offered by its overseas offices, some comment on how paltry its efforts seem when compared with other countries. Mr Mario Bodini, managing director of Jac Travel, which brings tour groups to the UK, said: 'Given the funds they have available, the BTA, for the most part, is fairly good. Still, I get quite embarrassed when I'm at international trade shows and I see that the British stand is feeble compared with quite small destina-tions such as Holland, Austria or Portugal.' Mr Peter Bates, marketing director of the Savoy Hotel group, said the BTA needed to focus its energies more clearly when promoting the UK's attractions. He said, for example, that the relative cheapness of the UK to American visitors after sterling's effective devaluation last September had not been sufficiently stressed in the US market. In 1991-2, the BTA received Pounds 24m in funding from the private sector and other public bodies such as local authorities. Mr Bates argued the BTA needs to pay more attention to travel companies' views on how that money should be spent. Ms Biss insists she is ready to listen and does not think she will suffer her predecessor's frustrations. 'I would guess my expectations are a little bit different from what his were. A lot of my past has been spent persuading people and reconciling different points of view.' Unlike Mr Davis when he began, she has no illusions about the level of government support she is likely to get. 'Anyone going into a public appointment now understands the economic background, the whole problem of public finances. Maybe I've got a different starting point from him.'</p>

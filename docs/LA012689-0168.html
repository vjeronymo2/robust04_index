			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A district judge in Dunn, N.C., threw the book at a drunken driver with a  21-page arrest record, sentencing him to seven years in prison and raising his  bond to $100,000 after his 33rd drunken-driving conviction. Otis Wadford, 52,  who pleaded guilty to the charge, was also fined $4,000 by Judge Sam  Stephenson, who said he was appalled by the Raleigh man's record. In addition  to his 33 drunken-driving convictions, Wadford's 21-page record showed he had  been convicted 22 times of driving after his license had been revoked.  </P></p>

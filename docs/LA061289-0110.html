			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BRITONS' SPREE PRESSURES ECONOMY  </P> <P> British consumers, taking advantage of an unusually warm May, went on a  shopping spree that added to inflationary pressures and raised concerns that  further rises in interest rates may be needed to cool the economy.  </P> <P> The government reported today that seasonally adjusted retail sales jumped by  2.5% in May -- three times the rise economists had predicted -- after a 1.4%  decline in April.  </P> <P> "This is much stronger than expected and will increase the upward pressure on  U.K. interest rates," said an economist with Midland Bank.  </P> <P> Stocks eased in London and money market interest rates climbed as investors  were disappointed that the government's strategy of using high interest rates  to brake inflation has not yet succeeded.  </P></p>

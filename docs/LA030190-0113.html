			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 31 NAMED IN PHONY ACCIDENT SCHEME;  </P> <P> FRAUD: THEY ARE ACCUSED OF COLLECTING $1 MILLION IN CLAIMS. OFFICIALS SAY IT IS  ORANGE COUNTY'S LARGEST INSURANCE SCAM.  </P> <P> Thirty-one people have been indicted on charges of staging scores of auto  accidents and collecting $1 million in phony claims in Orange County's largest  insurance scam ever, authorities said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The case, though massive, involves just one of dozens of fraud rings that  generate an estimated $500 million to $1 billion in phony or inflated claims  each year in California, insurance company executives and fraud investigators  said.  </P> <P> Some officials estimate that one out of every five dollars that consumers pay  for auto insurance goes for fraudulent claims. Insurance companies cite fraud  as a major cause of skyrocketing premium rates.  </P> <P> The fraud scams are myriad and ingenious, investigators say. According to the  indictments unsealed Wednesday, the Orange County ring, allegedly masterminded  by a Fullerton body shop owner, used the same cars to submit scores of phony  damage claims.  </P> <P> "Sometimes they'd take out five policies in a two-day period on the same car,"  said Officer Theresa Clark, who investigated the case for the California  Highway Patrol.  </P> <P> The car owners would then allegedly damage the autos -- including a Porsche and  a Mercedes-Benz -- tell the insurance companies that one car had run into up to  four others in a parking lot and then collect up to $10,000 in property damages  on each car, investigators said.  </P> <P> Clark said the defendants knew that police would not investigate a parking lot  crash in which no one was hurt.  </P> <P> "One of them said (the crash) happened in the Santa Ana Courthouse parking  lot," she said.  </P> <P> The defendants allegedly filed similar claims on the same accident with  multiple insurance companies, varying the details of the parking lot accident  only slightly. The insurance companies, which included Farmers, State Farm,  Mercury Casualty, Allstate, Travelers and Auto Club of Southern California,  sometimes cross-check bodily injury reports but not property damage claims,  Clark said.  </P> <P> Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan McNerney said he was not surprised by the  alleged scam. "It's an easy thing to do, especially when the claims don't  involve personal injury. They tried to get $3,000 to $5,000 per vehicle --  amounts that investigators usually aren't suspicious about."  </P> <P> But the overall impact of hundreds of phony claims has prompted the insurance  industry to push for legislation to make many types of insurance fraud felonies  instead of misdemeanors, in hopes that prosecutors will take more interest in  such cases.  </P> <P> The State Bar of California also has identified at least 47 attorneys suspected  of handling false insurance claims, and at least nine of them are under  investigation, said deputy chief trial counsel Frank Bassios.  </P> <P> Specialized units to prosecute auto insurance fraud are now being formed by  district attorney's offices across the state, including Orange County's.  Further mandates to curtail auto insurance fraud were included in Proposition  103, the controversial insurance reform initiative passed in November, 1988.  </P> <P> As an indication of the size of the overall problem, State Farm Insurance Co.  statistics show that the bodily injury rate in California is 22.5 injuries per  1,000 accidents. That is almost double the figure for similar accidents in the  rest of the nation.  </P> <P> "The cars come together only 10% more in California, but you get hurt twice as  often, and I just don't believe you people out there are more fragile than the  rest of us," said G. Robert Mecherle, a claims vice president for State Farm  Insurance in Bloomington, Ill.  </P> <P> In addition, since 1986, reports of false automobile claims to the state  Department of Insurance have increased by almost 300% statewide, from 1,355 to  almost 4,000 in 1989.  </P> <P> The Orange County case began to unfold in March, 1987, when a sheriff's deputy  arrested one person named in the scheme and discovered that the suspect had  fake identification and several insurance policies showing different names. The  Sheriff's Department handed the case over to the California Highway Patrol,  which submitted the case to the Orange County Grand Jury after 2 1/2 years of  investigation.  </P> <P> Last Thursday, the grand jury issued a 28-page sealed indictment charging the  31 suspects with nine counts of conspiracy to commit grand theft. The alleged  ringleader, Norman Sidney Gerstein, 38, of Colton, was charged with nine  conspiracy counts as well as one count of possession of cocaine for sale.  </P> <P> Authorities say 60 people took out fake insurance policies, but the indictment  names only 31. The defendants allegedly submitted 57 false claims to nine  insurance companies from April, 1986, to March, 1988.  </P> <P> The CHP asked that the indictments be sealed to prevent the targets from  fleeing before they could be arrested. Early Tuesday, CHP officers arrested 18  of the 31 suspects, including Gerstein and his wife, in Orange, Riverside and  Los Angeles counties, as well as in Sacramento. Three more of the accused  turned themselves in to the court Wednesday morning, while one was already in  state prison, serving time for an unrelated crime.  </P> <P> Gerstein is being held in Orange County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail, and is  expected to be arraigned Friday with some of the other defendants, McNerney  said. The others are to be arraigned in two weeks, he added.  </P> <P> Nine of the accused are still at large and investigators believe that at least  four have left the state. They are now being sought in Florida, Oregon and  Georgia.  </P> <P> If convicted, the defendants could face a maximum penalty of three years in  prison on each count of conspiracy to commit grand theft. On the cocaine  charge, Gerstein also faces another four years.  </P> <P> Gerstein is also suspected in a second fraud ring that involved employees of  two more insurance companies, said Chief Clarence C. Tuck of the CHP's border  division based in San Diego. Tuck declined to comment further because that case  is still under investigation.  </P></p>

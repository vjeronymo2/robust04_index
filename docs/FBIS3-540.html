A plenary session began this  morning to deal with the program and the State General Budget.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Honorable  deputy, do you agree with the 1994 program?    [Norberto de Castro, deputy for the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola] I would like to say that it is  evident that the government has made an effort to draw itself  closer to a reality from which it had distanced itself.  Nevertheless, it is an effort that leaves something to be  desired. We believe that the program and the State General  Budget have many weaknesses. Let us see if the majority comes  to its senses during this plenary session and heeds the call of  the minority and rectifies what we think is wrong.    [Correspondent] Are you confident the program will be  adopted?    [Paixao Junior, vice governor of National Bank of Angola]  Absolutely. I believe the program contains everything to  warrant its approval.    [Miguel N'zau Puna, deputy for the Angolan Democratic Forum]  As I see it, there are good prospects for the program to be  adopted because we are in a minority. So, I think the budget  will be approved. [end recording]    The plenary session only began at 1100 because yesterday's  rain disrupted the communications system. Before the debates  could take place, the opposition members of parliament wanted  the government to present a report on the country's economic  situation in 1993.    [Begin Castro recording] Mr. President, if you allow me, I  would like to show you a resolution that effectively says there  should be a report giving an account of the performance of the  State General Budget for the third quarter of 1993, as well as  the government's program of action for 1994.    Mr. President, regardless of whatever explanations that one  can give, we have an illegality on our hands. Either the  majority complies with what has been agreed or we will act in  disregard of the assembly regulations. I have the document  right here and if you so wish you can have it. [end recording]    Prime Minister Marcolino Moco was then forced to brief the  opposition members of parliament. His explanations fell short  of the deputies' expectations. Other deputies addressed the  session, but the opposition appeared to be aloof when the agenda  came up for voting. The opposition members of parliament did  not take part in the voting. As the situation began to look  complicated, Marcolino Moco delivered his speech in which he  characterized 1993 as a catastrophic year for Angola's economic,  social, and political life. He said the war was the main cause  of the situation.    [Begin Moco recording] It has not been easy to monitor the  ongoing political transition, not only because it is no easy  task, but also because the war has created even more dramatic  situations that should be taken into account when we decide on  what course of action to follow. The ongoing political  transition has affected the social behavior of our fellow  countrymen who have grown tired, and in many instances  despondent.    The government is committed to a prosperous nation, and a  democratic and fair society. That, however, should also be the  duty and goal of every citizen. To move decisively toward that  goal, citizens ought to regain self-confidence, and to trust  their own country. Unless we believe in the future and move  together in building this new country, it will not be possible  to fully overcome the current situation, and be sure that we  will strengthen our position.    Mr. President and honorable deputies, there is an unanimous  belief that inflation is the main cause of the prevailing  economic crisis. Under the circumstances, the honorable  deputies should rest assured that we will prevent hyperinflation  from taking root in the country, even if we have to introduce  the most drastic measures. The most cruel consequences of  hyperinflation are felt by the most impoverished and  hard-pressed layers of society. We are committed to that goal  because we believe the fight against inflation is more than an  economic goal, but rather an imperative and a social  responsibility that ensures stability in our country.    Your excellencies, it has never been possible anywhere in  the  world to overcome a situation like ours without the sacrifices  of all. [end recording]    The plenary session has adjourned until 1500.</p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON BACK, MAKES BIG SPLASH WITH DIVING CATCH  </P> <P> There were plenty of thank-yous to throw around after the Angels' 5-0 victory  over the New York Yankees Sunday.  </P> <P> Manager Doug Rader thanked right fielder Claudell Washington for his sprawling  sixth-inning catch of a Steve Sax line drive, a Greg Louganis dive-and-slide  that stretched every muscle in Washington's 34-year-old body.  </P> <P> "You don't think about it (age) when you're taking off after the ball," said a  sore Washington afterward.  </P> <P> Washington then thanked Rader for showing such compassion during the right  fielder's recent personal ordeal in which Washington's 15-year-old daughter,  Camille, was nearly paralyzed after a freak domestic accident.  </P> <P> Washington's appearance Sunday was his first since April 29 and his first since  the accident on May 2. He was on the road when Camille was injured and  immediately flew home to Orinda, Calif., to be with his daughter.  </P> <P> Washington rejoined the team Friday, but sat out the first two games of the  series.  </P> <P> "She's coming along fine," Washington said of his daughter, who bruised her  brain stem when a lamp struck her on the back of the neck. "She's taking  therapy now, and she's going to start to swim a little bit to get her legs  back, because she can't walk from here to there without losing her balance.  They figure the swimming pool will strengthen her legs. In a couple of weeks,  she'll be up and at 'em. That's what they say."  </P> <P> The first reports weren't as encouraging.  </P> <P> "It was tough," Washington said. "We're just happy she's not paralyzed. That's  what they were worried about. And for four days she was."  </P> <P> This, mind you, wasn't your average household accident.  </P> <P> "She was making a bed, doing her regular housework," he explained. "And she was  pulling the cover up over the pillow. She was down on her knees, got caught in  the (lamp) cord and pulled it down and hit her in the spinal column. It was a  big dresser lamp. I was telling her that it could only happen to her. She's so  fragile. She's an athlete, but she's a little fragile too."  </P> <P> Washington was out of the lineup for more than two weeks, but said the Angels  insisted he not return until Camille was out of danger.  </P> <P> Washington wondered whether other teams would have showed as much compassion.  </P> <P> "It did surprise me," he said. "Because I think if I'd been on the other side,  in New York, well I don't know what might have happened."  </P> <P> Washington played two and a half seasons with the Yankees before signing with  the Angels as a free agent over the winter.  </P> <P> "I'd hate to even think about it if I was still with the Yankees," he said.  </P> <P> It was better just to take things out on his former teammates.  </P> <P> Washington, who also added a fourth-inning single in Sunday's victory, said he  stayed in frequent contact with the Angels while he was away.  </P> <P> "I've been real happy about the way they've handled it," he said. "Because I  was concerned. It wasn't tough for me to come back once she got out of the  hospital. I was just waiting for her to be released and for them (doctors) to  tell me everything was fine. Once they did that, I was ready to come back."  </P> <P> And it wasn't a bad comeback. Washington's catch was drawing raves around the  locker room.  </P> <P> Washington tried to compliment left fielder Chili Davis on his fine running  catch of a Tom Brookens fly ball in the second inning.  </P> <P> "Yours was sweeter," Davis shot back.  </P> <P> And Washington couldn't argue.  </P> <P> "It was a 10," he said of his catch.  </P> <P> It was good to be back.  </P></p>

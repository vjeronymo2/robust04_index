			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Irina Shchegoleva] </F>   [Text] Sochi June 8 TASS -- The severance of ties and  communication between the republics of the former Soviet Union  caused Tuesday's incident involving an American plane, according  to a duty officer of Sochi's airport.    The plane en route to Tbilisi and Baku to deliver supplies  for American diplomats in Georgia and Azerbaijan violated  Russia's airspace and was landed at Sochi's Adler airport at  14:37 on Tuesday. Three hours later, at 17:46, when the  incident was settled the plane continued the flight.    "Before we had direct telephone lines with all nearest  district centres and such an incident could have been settled  much faster," Vyacheslav Isayev, duty officer of Sochi's  airport, said.    "There are no flights from Adler to Sukhumi (capital of  Abkhazia) -- neither civil nor military. There is no  communication. It is extremely hard to work in such  conditions," he said.</p>

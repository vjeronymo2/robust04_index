			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Fashion: Party dresses for the smart young things - Avril Groom on what the under-sixes are wearing The entertainment is about to begin. The girls are twirling and preening, checking out each other's velvet and lace. The boys are already loosening their bow ties and blaming mummy for forcing them into tight-buttoned shirts. This is not a corporate Christmas dinner but a smart tots' party in a Kensington townhouse. This is the domain of the competitive pre-prep school mother. The duels that start with fur coats at dawn outside the school gates can too easily escalate with the festive season into full-scale party wars. The end may be providing ever-more magical experiences for innocent children but the means sometimes run into extremely conspicuous displays of consumption. At some parties the children, seated formally round tables, are waited on by the hostess's staff. The latest wheeze is the 'limo party', where a number of dressed-up little girls pile into a stretch limousine and are driven round town watching videos and taking in attractions such as a museum or a burger restaurant. If the party is held at home a huge fantasy cake, costing perhaps Pounds 400 and which no one will eat, is the centrepiece. An entertainer is de rigueur, aided and abetted at this time of year by both Santa Claus and costumed 'characters'. The usual form is for the children to arrive with their nannies, who are offered champagne; and for mothers to make an appearance at the end in order to thank the hostess. Country parties follow a similar, if more low-key, pattern - the cake may be made by a family retainer rather than Jane Asher and a glass of wine next to the Aga tends to replace the champagne and white shag pile. In either case there are, according to one veteran of such rituals, two factions - the modernists and the traditionalists. This means, broadly, that the 'characters' and the contents of the essential party bags will be inspired by Disney or Beatrix Potter respectively. One aspect, however, is common to all. Dress is always traditional and nostalgic, involving yards of net petticoat for girls and white shirts and breeches or long shorts for boys. The only difference is in the amount of glitz. South west London leans towards plain velvet or smocking whereas the capital's northern suburbs favour gilt buttons and lace-ruffles. Similar styles appear at children's parties in Paris, Milan and New York because what is perceived as the traditional British look has become the universal standard of special occasion children's clothes. Its origins lie in media portrayals of royal children, whose formal style has scarcely changed for generations. Andre Durand's recent portrait of Princes William and Harry in T-shirts and trainers, however ridiculed by the art establishment, was probably a more sartorially accurate portrayal of what goes on in most homes but the public perception of aristocratic children in party wear and smocked frocks has brought considerable commercial success to the original purveyors of such items. The White House, in New Bond Street, London, specialises in hand-finished clothes which are almost children's couture and numbers tourists, arrivistes and indulgent grandmothers among its customers, along with the greatest families in the land. These are clothes which largely aim to please the giver or the parent rather than the children, who rarely appreciate the finer points of exquisite fabrics and perfect execution. Slightly simpler, but also geared to an export market with an insatiable appetite for British tradition, are clothes from Burberry, Daks Simpson and Scotch House. British mothers are more inclined to shop at department stores or small, upmarket shops such as Young England owned by former royal nanny Barbara Barnes. Trotters, owned by Sock Shop founder Sophie Mirman, Patrizia Wigan, Bonpoint or the small Jacadi chain. The latter two are of French origin and their neat-collared, small-check dresses and shirts and Tyrolean-style knits show that in children's, as in adults' fashion, the European version of le style anglais is often more chic than the home-grown variety. Emporio Armani, Ralph Lauren and The Gap are other stylish imports. As fashionable children's names filter through society, so do their clothing styles, so that today party frocks and formal jackets pack the rails of chain stores alongside the denim and the sweatshirts. Laura Ashley's redefined 'British Heritage' image has been highly successful in their Mother and Child departments and the style has found an echo at Marks and Spencer, Next, BhS and - for children up to five years - Boots. Yet the lavish party is - like most aspects of childhood - just a phase, whose passing is a source of either regret or relief to parents. Boys lose interest first, both in dressing up and in behaving with decorum. Barnes says she stocks little for boys over six 'because their mothers cannot persuade them out of sweatshirts and tracksuits'. At around the age of eight, girls go from fairy princesses to grunge queens, seemingly overnight. Then you are into the wasteland of black denim and Dr Martens, from which, with luck adolescents emerge into black tie and evening frocks around 15. My son, aged 12, recently received his first invitation to a pre-teen ball. But he and his friends decided to pass on a grown-up, late night out because the card suggested ties might be worn. Life may currently be cheaper but the wistful nostalgia evoked by wide-eyed tots in pretty party gear cannot be denied.</p>

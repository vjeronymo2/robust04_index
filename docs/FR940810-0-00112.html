			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> In addition to the above studies showing relatively low exposures, almost all below the revised PELs, other submissions showed the potential for Class III work to exceed the PEL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BCTD submitted studies including those by Keyes and Chesson which reported results of a series of experiments designed to determine fiber levels in asbestos-containing buildings during simulated activities (Ex.9&hyph;34 OO, PP and 7&hyph;53). They demonstrated (using transmission electron microscopic measurements) that use of dry methods in a room containing damaged ACM and visible dust and debris elevated the fiber level in air significantly, that physical activity (playing ball) within such an area increased fiber levels and that cable pulling activities also raised fiber counts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEI submitted an analysis of a data set provided to them by Hygienetics, Inc. which contained data on airborne asbestos fiber concentrations during various maintenance activities performed under an operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) program in a large U.S. hospital (Ex. 162&hyph;6). During the period of study, all maintenance work in areas with ACM in the hospital required a permit issued by the Hygienetics project manager on site. The authors concluded ``*&blank;*&blank;* spatial and temporal proximity to maintenance work was an important determinate of PCM fiber levels'' (Ex. 1&hyph;344, p. 1.8). Jobs involving removal of ACM resulted in higher fiber levels than non-removal jobs [personal samples: mean, removal jobs=0.166 f/cc, non-removal=0.0897  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> f/cc (Ex. 1&hyph;344 p. 1.6)]. HEI concluded that these activities resulted in increased fiber levels (Ex. 1&hyph;344, p. 1.8).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA has reviewed and evaluated all available information pertaining to maintenance, repair, and other asbestos-disturbing activities within buildings classified as ``Class III'' and has concluded that some of these activities can result in significant risk from exposure of workers. The range of activities and exposure potential encompassed by a Class III designation is wide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The studies generally show that when protective work practices are used by trained workers, exposures are greatly reduced. Thus, OSHA is requiring various work practices and protective measures to reduce exposure to asbestos containing material (or material which is presumed to contain asbestos) and that workers must receive training in courses which include the appropriate techniques to use in handling and/or avoiding such disturbances. OSHA concludes that these are effective, feasible controls needed to reduce significant risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (g)(8) sets out these requirements. Again, wet methods are required; local exhaust ventilation is required, if feasible; Where the material OSHA has found to be of high-risk, TSI and surfacing material, is drilled, cut, abraded, sanded, chipped, broken or sawed, dropcloths and isolation methods such as mini-enclosures or glove bags must be used; and respirators must be worn; and where a negative exposure assessment has not been produced, dropcloths and plastic barriers (tenting or equivalent) must be used. OSHA believes these mandatory practices will protect employees who perform Class III work from significant risk of asbestos-related effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Class IV Work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> As defined in paragraph (b), Class IV work consists of ``maintenance and custodial work'' where employees contact ACM and PACM, including activities to clean up waste and debris containing ACM and PACM. Examples of such work are sweeping, mopping, dusting, cleaning, and vacuuming of asbestos containing materials such as resilient flooring, or any surface where asbestos-containing dust has accumulated; stripping and buffing of asbestos containing resilient flooring, and clean-up after Class I, II, and III work, or other asbestos construction work such as the installation of new asbestos-containing materials. Clean-up of waste and debris during a removal job, or other Class job, is Class IV work. Because in these cases the employee doing the clean-up is within the regulated area and subject to the same exposure conditions as the employees actually doing the removal, paragraph (9)(1) requires the custodial employee to be provided with the same respiratory protection as the employees performing the removal or other asbestos work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, exposures for Class IV work are lower than for other classes. Data in the record show this general exposure profile (see for example, Kominsky study, Ex. 119 I, where carpet ``naturally contaminated'' for year by friable, TSI and surfacing ACM was cleaned using three cleaning methods; all personal samples were below 0.022 f/cc; using allowable methods resulted in the highest personal sample of 0.019 f/cc; see also, data in Ex. 162&hyph;52). Other data show even lower exposures for custodial work (see for example, Wickman et al, Ex. L163, where the authors conclude: ``This study determined that custodians who performed routine activities in buildings which contained friable asbestos materials were not exposed to levels of airborne asbestos which approached the OSHA action level of 0.1 f/cc. The arithmetic mean value for 38 personal samples, analyzed by TEM, was 0.0009 s/cc, 8 hour TWA for structure lengths greater than 5 &mu;m'' ( Id at 20). The much higher exposure data from the earlier Sawyer study, (Ex. 84&hyph;262A), showed exposure levels ranging to 4.0 f/cc for dry dusting of bookshelves under friable ACM. As noted above, at this rulemaking hearing Sawyer noted that the conditions in the building he studied were unrepresentative of other buildings in the U.S. (Tr. 2157).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

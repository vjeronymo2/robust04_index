			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Barlow Rand eyes Spanish target BARLOW RAND, South Africa's biggest industrial conglomerate, is in talks to buy Finanzauto, Spain's principal distributor of earth-moving equipment. The purchase would be the largest South African investment on the Iberian peninsular. Baring Brothers, the UK merchant bank advising Barlow Rand, said yesterday the South African group, through its British industrial affiliate, J. Bibby &amp; Sons, was discussing making a formal takeover offer for Finanzauto. The Spanish stock market yesterday suspended trading in Finanzauto. At its suspended share price, the Spanish company, which is the sole distributor of Caterpillar equipment in Spain, is capitalised at some Dollars 114m. Finanzauto has been hit in the past two years by a drop in orders as tight economic policies have dampened construction activity. Pre-tax profits last year dropped 50 per cent to Pta1.3bn as sales fell from Pta61.1bn in 1990 to Pta52.5bn. A fierce marketing effort in Spain by Komatsu of Japan, which analysts say has concentrated mainly on underpricing Caterpillar, has also sharpened the effects of the construction industry slowdown. Many analysts in Spain expect the slowdown in construction to continue well into next year, particularly as Spain battles to trim its large public sector deficits as a prelude to entering the European Community's economic and monetary union. The government is trying to hold spending in infrastructural work steady but it will find the going difficult if the EC does not quickly begin to transfer it funds through a new channel - so-called cohesion funds designed to help poor EC members who demonstrate they are enforcing fiscal discipline. But many of Spain's EC partners are loathe to support the new funds.</p>

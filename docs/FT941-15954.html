			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Wall Street broker in alliance with Remsen Smith Barney Shearson, the Wall Street brokerage house, has formed an alliance with Remsen Partners, the property financing group, that will provide funds for the US commercial property market. Remsen will arrange mortgages on commercial property funded by Smith Barney which the brokerage firm will sell as mortgage-backed securities to investors. The two partners said yesterday they had put together more than Dollars 100m in mortgage loans, and expected the venture to generate as much as Dollars 1bn in financing before the end of the year. For Smith Barney, which is owned by Travelers, the insurance and financial services group, the aim of the alliance is to lift its presence in the large US mortgage-backed securities market by linking up with Remsen's network of property owners and mortgage bankers. Last year, Smith Barney was ranked 15th among underwriters of mortgage deals in the US, even though the firm was the second largest brokerage house in the US. The appeal of the alliance to Remsen is fast access to Smith Barney's capital and the ability to win business on the back of the brokerage firm's name.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhang Yu'an: "First National Border Trade Fair Will </F> Open in Pingxiang in July"]    [Text] The country's first national border trade fair will  be held from July 26 to August 2 in Pingxiang in Guangxi Zhuang  Autonomous Region.    The organizers of the fair hope to further promote border  trade and economic co-operation between China and Vietnam as  well as other Southeast Asian countries, Liang Yuxiang, a senior  official of Pingxiang, said last week. Liang is also executive  director of the fair's organizing committee.    Liang noted that Pingxiang shares a 97-kilometre-long border  with Vietnam, has direct rail and highway links with Vietnam  through the Friendship Pass, and is only 187 kilometres from  Hanoi.    This places Pingxiang in a favourable position for  developing  border trade and economic co-operation with Vietnam, Liang said.    To make full use of the opportunity, more than 1,000 Chinese  firms will offer overseas participants in the fair about 300  co-operation projects, in addition to displaying various  commodities and technologies.    The organizers are also considering organizing delegations  of  Chinese business managers to visit Vietnam after the fair.    Vietnam will send a 150-person delegation, representing more  than 40 enterprises, to the fair. Liang expects that individual  Vietnamese visitors will far outnumber the official delegation.    At the fair, the Vietnamese will exhibit sedan cars,  motorbikes and air-conditioners that are assembled or  manufactured in Vietnam by foreign companies. The Vietnamese  will also display their own mineral, rubber and aquatic products.    Entrepreneurs from Thailand Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong,  Macao and Taiwan will also participate in the fair in order to  tap new business opportunities, Liang said.    Since the United States has lifted its trade embargo on  Vietnam, this Southeast Asian country is attracting more foreign  investment and creating more business opportunities.    Thus, Liang noted, Chinese enterprises will be able to find  co-operation and investment opportunities in Vietnam in addition  to border trade.</p>

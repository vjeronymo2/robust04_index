			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> O, HAPPY DAYS! ;  </P> <P> WHEN WE WERE VERY YOUNG  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES is kaput, they say. The quality of life has gone to the dogs. In  the city that was for so long the fastest-growing in the world, you can hear  natives talk about moving out, to Portland or Seattle or somewhere. The Golden  Age of L.A. was the decade of "the good war," followed by the optimistic '50s.  And now all the good times are gone.  </P> <P> Every age romanticizes the past, of course -- usually the age before the last  because memories have had longer to mellow. We're right to hold a vision of the  past: It steadies our views on life. Still, it should be an accurate vision. In  these harried times we need some detailed nostalgia, a closer look at the  Golden Age.  </P> <P> In the early '40s, I had no idea I even lived in Los Angeles. My home was a  little farm town called Van Nuys, and so far as I could tell, it was the dusty,  ragtag, tail end of the world. Everything on the radio was happening somewhere  else, like the war in the South Pacific, or whatever it was that went on in a  mysterious land called Hollywood.  </P> <P> Though the San Fernando Valley was all about to change beyond recognition, my  street was still full of chicken and turkey ranches, and there were commercial  cornfields within a mile or two. Whatever else they might have done, everybody  on my street raised a couple of acres of walnuts. Every fall, a family of  braceros would come and shake down our walnuts with long pruning hooks and camp  out in the orchard at nightfall. These were the only non-Anglos we ever saw.  </P> <P> To the north, my world practically ended at the Southern Pacific tracks a few  hundred yards from our orchard. Beyond the tracks, there seemed to be nothing  but dirt roads and an occasional sunburnt paved road patched with tar, all in a  vast sea of orange groves. For years, oranges were so important that when a  frost was expected, the weatherman would tell orange growers to light heaters  called smudge pots in their groves.  </P> <P> We were so remote that the mailman made only one pass down our street a day, so  all the mailboxes had to be on the same side of the street. That's the way a  lot of our neighbors liked it, the Midwesterners who had achieved the great  '30s dream of retiring in California and raising chickens. There was a strong  Midwestern flavor to Los Angeles in those days, even some lingering dry  sentiment. One local supermarket chain didn't start selling beer and wine until  well into the '50s.  </P> <P> Maybe I remember Van Nuys as dusty and ragtag because it was dusty and ragtag.  After all, there was a war going on. All the cars were old, and the tires were  worn down to fabric because of the rubber shortage. I remember my mother making  soap from bacon drippings.  </P> <P> She was sturdily patriotic about the war, and whenever she was asked to spell  Van Nuys, she'd begin, "V, as in victory." However, she hated rationing as much  as anybody and sometimes bought black-market hamburger meat in North Hollywood.  Needless to say, it was injected with water to increase the weight, and when  you put it in the pan, boiling droplets would skid everywhere.  </P> <P> The war was actually changing Los Angeles in ways I couldn't see. It brought a  lot of people, many of them black and Mexican, from out of state to work in the  war industries. And they were just the beginning of the boom. After the war,  there was a popular song titled "I'm Gonna Make the San Fernando Valley My  Home." I couldn't believe my ears; a song about this old place? I almost  blushed.  </P> <P> It turned out people had started moving to L.A., and particularly to the  Valley, in unbelievable numbers. There were whole industries catering to the  newcomers. At Christmas, a company called Mission Pak would send boxes of  exotic California fruit to your friends and relatives back East -- gloating  souvenirs from the land without snow.  </P> <P> After the war, there was a terrific housing shortage, and at one time an  estimated 162,000 families were living in tents, garages and other makeshift  dwellings. A poor family whose kids always had the sniffles moved into a  converted chicken coop down the block from us. The city lumbered into action  and maintained some Quonset huts left over from the war as cheap public  housing.  </P> <P> But the problem solved itself with amazing speed. Instead of going into a  tailspin, as experts had predicted, L.A. started building houses at a dazzling  pace. To me, the smell of the late '40s is a combination of pine, gravel and  plaster. And what strange houses they were! One-story stucco houses without  fireplaces, the kitchen counters topped with Formica in a peculiar pattern of  tiny boomerangs. And all these little tract houses were advertised as "estates"  or "ranchos" or "villas."  </P> <P> For years on end, we were told the Valley was the fastest-growing place on  earth. The flood of newcomers diluted the rural quality of Van Nuys. By the  time I was in junior high, it was considered a stylish insult to call somebody  a "dumb farmer." Even so, in the late '50s, Van Nuys High School still made a  great fuss over its senior classes, a tradition from the days when few, if any,  of its graduates went on to college.  </P> <P> There was an industrial boom, too. Overnight, there were businesses everywhere,  at first small, hopeful, undercapitalized places, and then major manufacturing.  The words prices slightly higher west of the Rockies started disappearing from  advertisements. The vacant land north of the Southern Pacific tracks, where my  sister and I used to pick cattails, became the General Motors plant and called  into being a place called Panorama City.  </P> <P> Television finished off the isolated quality of the Valley. The big year was  1949, when the number of TV sets in Los Angeles went from 80,000 to 354,000. By  1951, when I was 10, if your family didn't have a set, you really couldn't get  away with the excuse "we're waiting for color," and your parents finally had to  buy one. This introduced you to the ordeal of doing without TV whenever your  set was being repaired; there were no transistors yet, and a tube would blow  every couple of months.  </P> <P> There wasn't any satellite transmission, of course, so apart from some fuzzy  recordings from New York called kinescopes, most of the programming originated  locally. We were shocked when we finally saw "Howdy Doody," the New York  children's show. How lame and patronizing it was compared with our own "Time  for Beanie," the work of a bunch of hotshots straight from the Warner Bros.  cartoon factory! I figured New Yorkers must be a bunch of dumb farmers.  </P> <P> Ultimately, television undermined Hollywood's position as the center of the  universe by siphoning off the general-interest audience that had been the  mainstay of the old studios. Of course, by that time, Hollywood was already  deglamorized for us -- it was just that place over Cahuenga Pass, and we  accepted the presence of show people in our midst quite casually. Across the  street from the Crystal Plunge, where if you went swimming too often your hair  would turn green from the chlorine in the water, lived the comic cowboy actor  Andy Devine, the "unofficial mayor of Van Nuys"; his son went to public schools  with us. Jane Russell's family lived down at the end of my street, and later  on, band leader Frank DeVol lived there, too. His daughter went to Fulton  Junior High, so he wrote the school song for it.  </P> <P> Even after TV, we went to the movies a couple of times a week, either to the  Fox or the Bijou (I forget which one we called the Flea Bag). We were pretty  blase about them, though. I had a friend whose father worked for a cartoon  studio, and he would loftily critique the animation in the "Superman" serial as  we watched. After a while, his family suddenly disappeared from sight, and we  heard they'd been found out as Communists.  </P> <P> My father worked downtown, which meant about an hour's commute for him. Then  came the freeways; for years we saw maps with dotted lines that indicated where  freeways were going to go. First came a short patch over Cahuenga Pass, and  then, in spurts, the Ventura and San Diego freeways. Now my father could go to  work without having to mess with surface streets, but it was still about an  hour's commute. Everybody knowingly said the freeways were all obsolete as soon  as they were built.  </P> <P> Mayors Fletcher Bowron and Norris Poulson, who both looked like school  principals to me, presided over a pretty placid time. Nearly all the issues  revolved around the city's growth. The freeways: They were never built fast  enough and were always too expensive. The Dodgers: Why, my father demanded, did  he have to pay extra taxes to bring them here when he never watched baseball?  </P> <P> And smog, which was much worse than it is today: Once or twice a year it was so  bad that the schools would be closed. In the '50s, the County Air Pollution  Control District didn't issue smog alerts, but it did measure what was in the  air, and on the smoggiest day of 1955, it found an ozone level of 0.69. These  days, they call a third-stage smog alert if the level ever gets above 0.50,  something that hasn't happened in more than 10 years.  </P> <P> For a long time, nobody was sure what caused smog. On Oct. 1, 1957, burning  trash in a home incinerator became a crime, and everybody had to get an extra  trash can just for non-combustible rubbish. The smog didn't go away, though  particulate matter, which had sometimes been so bad that I saw strings of soot  trailing from goldfish gills, got a lot better. At least the incinerator ban  showed that the automobile was the chief culprit.  </P> <P> The California car culture had been in bloom since the '40s. I remember my  older brothers customizing a Model A Ford, tearing off the fenders and  blowtorching the springs to lower the rear so that the car seemed to be leaping  out of the road. By the '50s, cars were a full-fledged life style, and we all  knew the cars to customize were old Mercs and '39 or '40 Fords.  </P> <P> We '50s kids were more polished than the '40s kids with their wolf-whistle  horns and loud "Hollywood" exhausts. We were into gorgeousness. We painted cars  with flame designs or the fine outline patterns of a car painter named Von  Dutch (both styles have long since been reduced to decals you can just stick  on). We went to Tijuana to get plush "tuck and roll" upholstery. You had to  remember to bring stout American thread for the workmen, or your upholstery job  would come out after a couple of months.  </P> <P> By now, it was a teen-ager's right to spend most of his non-sleeping and  non-school hours in his car. A lot of kids' social lives revolved around  cruising Van Nuys Boulevard and hanging out at Bob's Big Boy or Curry's ice  cream shop. The hope was that two guys in customized hot rods would challenge  each other to a drag race.  </P> <P> To many grown-ups, this obsession with cars and rock 'n' roll smelled of  juvenile delinquency. There certainly were young hoods around, but their  criminality was pretty mild. They weren't on drugs, and their most fearsome  weapons were the switch-blade knife and occasionally a primitive, homemade zip  gun.  </P> <P> Cars also made it possible for us to hit the beaches, where we discovered the  car culture paralleled the surf culture, which was already a total way of life  but as yet unknown to the rest of the country. A filmmaker named Bruce Brown  was showing his home movies of surfing up and down the beach towns -- for  instance, in the public shower room at San Clemente State Park. Eventually,  he'd make feature films that would create a nationwide surf craze. My cousin  was one of a number of Valley boys who thought of becoming professional  surfboard makers.  </P> <P> By the end of the '50s, it was obvious that things were going to change even  more. The first low-rise apartment building arose on my street. One of my  teachers at Van Nuys High predicted commercial jet airplane flights, and  another told about an amazing drug he'd tried, under doctor's orders, called  LSD.  </P> <P> Amid this growth, we lost a lot of things, of course. Much of what we lost was  what every small town loses when it becomes a city: a ready neighborliness and  a certain amount of innocence. By the '60s, you'd have to have been crazy to  leave your house or your car unlocked for very long, or to accept anybody's  check without ID. We also lost a certain small-town attitude of local pride.  For a long time, there was a famous rivalry between L.A. and San Francisco, but  only San Francisco is interested in keeping it up.  </P> <P> But nostalgia for that time is not for everybody. The population of Los Angeles  today is five times what it was in 1940, and that means there are about 6  million people living here to whom the '40s are dim or blank. Old-timers always  tend to glamorize the past, too. The Red Car trolleys, for instance; I remember  them as scary. You had to stand out in the middle of traffic to catch them, and  sometimes people got hit. And Red Cars didn't go everywhere. If you were near  one of the stops, they were a pretty good deal, but if you weren't, you really  wanted a car.  </P> <P> And while some things may not have changed -- GTE was notorious for bad service  even 40 years ago; it's nickname was "Drip, Drip and Tinkle" -- much has  improved. The people who complain that the Los Angeles River is a "cement scar  in the landscape" just don't know what it was like before our waterways were  tamed. Every time there was a big rain, the Pacoima Wash would overflow and  stores on Van Nuys Boulevard would have to be sandbagged.  </P> <P> This is the bottom line: I don't remember a single bookstore in Van Nuys in the  '50s, and at the same time there was a restaurant that used the slogan "Tough  Steaks and Dull Knives." Altogether, with all its faults, I prefer the present.  </P></p>

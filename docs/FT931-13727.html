			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Khmer Rouge holds out against accord KHMER ROUGE guerrillas yesterday rejected last-minute diplomatic efforts to persuade them to adhere to the Cambodian peace accords and take part in elections in May. Mr Ali Alatas, the Indonesian foreign minister who has been attempting to mediate a solution to the Cambodian conflict, said that he had failed in a bid to persuade Mr Khieu Samphan, the nominal Khmer Rouge leader, to co-operate with the UN peacekeeping operation. After talks at the Indonesian embassy in Bangkok, Mr Alatas said he regretted that the Khmer Rouge leader had maintained his view that 'his party could not rejoin the process and could not as of now participate in the elections.' Political parties must be registered for the polls by the end of this month. The failure of yesterday's talks means that Cambodia will almost certainly be partitioned after the elections, with the future government controlling most of the country's territory and Khmer Rouge guerrillas holding the rest. The United Nations and the four Cambodian factions which signed the peace agreements in Paris in 1991 will therefore have failed in their mission to bring peace and democracy to the whole of Cambodia. One diplomat said he was concerned that the Cambodian peace accords would suffer the same fate as those for Afghanistan. 'Two years later everyone is still fighting and they have 1m refugees,' he said. Mr Alatas said he hoped the Khmer Rouge would not actively obstruct the elections. He added that there was broad agreement among interested parties - except for the Khmer Rouge - that a presidential election should be held about two or three weeks before the general election. The idea is to bring Prince Sihanouk to power as president as a stabilising force while the newly-elected assembly negotiates a constitution.</p>

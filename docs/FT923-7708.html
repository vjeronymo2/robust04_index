			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Kabul troops repulse rebels Troops loyal to the Islamic government in Kabul have repulsed violent assaults by rebel mujahideen fighters yesterday, agencies report from Kabul. However Gen. Majid Khan told reporters that he anticipated another round of fighting as forces loyal to firebrand fundamentalist Gulbudddin Hekmatyar prepared to make another bid for the battle-weary capital. 'He will try again. But we won't let him,' said Gen. Khan, without elaborating how government soldiers proposed stopping him. After more than a week of relentless rocketing, the capital was quiet yesterday. But the bloodletting injured hundreds of people and left no water or electricity and meager medical supplies.</p>

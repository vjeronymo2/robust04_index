			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Long gilts rally on renewed hopes of early cut in base rates UK government bonds rallied more than one point at the long end following the release of weaker-than-expected retail sales and inflation data for December, which revived speculation of an early cut in interest rates. News that the public spending borrowing requirement last month was Pounds 2.11bn - well below the consensus market forecast of Pounds 5.1bn - also fuelled the market's rally. 'The data have put the market on a more confident footing,' said Mr Julian Callow, international economist at Kleinwort Benson. He added that the market could be further encouraged by the release tomorrow of preliminary gross domestic product data for the fourth quarter and December money supply figures. The March long gilt future on Liffe rose as high as 120 13/32 but slipped to 119 29/32 in late trading, up  7/8 on the day. Hopes of a rate cut also lifted the short end where the March short-term Eurosterling future rose to 94.81 from 94.73. German government bonds and futures came off the day's highs yesterday as traders took the view that the Bundesbank would not cut official interest rates after its fortnightly council meeting today. Analysts added that nervousness over the situation in Russia and elections in Germany this year also hung over the market. The Liffe March bund future traded at 100.58 late in the day in brisk volume of 141,357 lots, below the day's high of 100.90 and down 0.13 point from Tuesday's close. Encouraging industrial production data for November contributed to the firm tone in the French government bond market, prompting a further narrowing of the yield differential between 10-year French and German government bonds to less than two basis points. Talk of an interest rate cut in France independent of Germany also supported the market. The March 10-year future settled at 131.12, up 0.10 point on the day in volume of 181,470 lots. News that Italian treasury minister Mr Piero Barucci had signed a decree regarding the refund of a 12.5 per cent withholding tax on bond coupon payments to eligible non-residents lifted Italian bond futures yesterday. The March futures contract on Liffe opened at 118.90 and went as high as 119.12, but failed to stay above the 119 chart resistance point for long. It settled back at 118.80 in late trading, giving a gain of 0.3 point on the day. Trading volume was moderate at 65,412 contracts. Mr Marco Pianelli, southern European economist at Nomura in London, said that the market's upside had been limited by the political uncertainty ahead of the country's general election in March. However, he added that the release tomorrow of favourable preliminary inflation figures for January could provide the bond market with fresh impetus. Japanese government bond futures fell to their lowest close since November 25 as market sentiment remained bearish. The March futures contract closed at 114.68, down from 114.95 on Tuesday. The 30-year US Treasury benchmark bond fell  3/8 of a point in thin trading yesterday as the market returned to the nervous mood of recent days, taking the yield up to just under 6.3 per cent. The release of the Federal Reserve's 'Beige Book', assessing the pace of economic growth, was the immediate excuse for the sell-off, though there was little to raise fears of higher interest rates. While noting that growth was accelerating in some sectors, the Fed said there were few signs that inflationary pressures were growing. A Treasury announcement that it would sell Dollars 17bn of two-year notes and Dollars 12bn of five-year notes was in line with market expectations. Shorter-dated issues proved more robust, with the 10-year note off only for a yield of 5.7 per cent.</p>

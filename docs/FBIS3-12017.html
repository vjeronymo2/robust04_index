			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rosie Ahuactzin Vasquez from the "ACIR Radio </F> News" newscast]    [Text] [Ahuactzin] Today, the National Executive Committee  [CEN] of the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] issued six  clarification points regarding the organization and development  of the rally presided over by Candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio at  the Lomas Taurinas neighborhood in Baja California.    [Station announcer] This is probably in response to  newspaper  reports on the disorganization and lack of security surrounding  the PRI candidate.    [Ahuactzin] That is correct. According to the PRI-CEN, this  explanation is aimed at clarifying events. They expressed their  willingness to provide more information if it is requested by  judicial authorities. We will now proceed to read the six  clarification points:    1. The rally with residents was held in accordance with the  program. The aim was to have the best possibilities for contact  between the candidate and citizens.    2. Luis Donaldo Colosio addressed residents from a stand  on a pickup truck so the participants could have better  visibility.    3. Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, general coordinator of  Colosio's campaign, did not attend the Baja California rally  because his participation in state visits was not deemed  necessary.    4. Candidate Colosio was transferred immediately to the  Tijuana General Hospital, which is close to the area of the  attack.    5. Colosio was initially transferred to a blazer truck  because it was close to the place where the tragedy took place.    6. From this truck, he was transferred to the assisting  ambulance which was part of the rally's organization.    These are the six clarifications made by the PRI-CEN.  Obviously, the PRI-CEN expressed its willingness to provide  whatever information is necessary in order to clarify these  tragic events.</p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: GEOGRAPHY SEPARATES BARBARA WALTERS, MERV ADELSON  </P> <P> IT IS WITH great sadness that Barbara Walters and Merv Adelson are announcing  that they will be having a trial separation. For the last five years, this  glamorous and very nice couple has lived a high-intensity, bi-coastal wedlock,  with each traveling from coast-to-coast at least once a month.  </P> <P> But now, Merv's business interests require his spending most of his time in Los  Angeles and Barbara's television assignments, instead of lessening, seem to  have multiplied so that she is traveling all over the world or operating  primarily from New York. The twain meets -- but the effort is gigantic.  </P> <P> Merv has always had, and continues to have, total respect for Barbara's career  and has never suggested she give it up. But when he sold his company, Lorimar  Telepictures, to Warner Brothers, his business requirements changed and he was  not in New York as much as he had been in the past.  </P> <P> The many friends of the couple on both coasts know that Merv and Barbara are  still deeply devoted to each other. It sounds like a cliche, but I believe they  will remain the closest of friends.  </P> <P> And, being the incurable romantic that I am, I personally hope they will find  that their separation isn't worth the separation.  </P> <P> PATTI DAVIS isn't going to give up life just because she isn't Mommy and  Daddy's pet kid. The daughter of Nancy and Ronald Reagan has just signed with  Carol Publishing for her second novel. She is about three-quarters of the way  through the new fiction. It will tell the story of a woman's struggle with the  issue of motherhood (does she want it or not?), and it will contain flashbacks  of the protagonist's own childhood. "Smoke Signals" is the working title for  this, and it is due next year.  </P> <P> Patti has also written a book for children coming from Lowell House this fall.  "Blue and Darby" is about two dolphins. Conventional wisdom has it that the  Reagans have more or less washed their hands of their rebellious Patti  precisely because of her pro-dolphin/anti-tuna nets crusade, which seemed  critical of her father's policies when he occupied the White House.  </P> <P> So maybe you'd like to buy Patti's book if you are a dolphin lover -- as a  gesture of loyalty. Remember, it's tough being an orphan, especially when your  parents are living.  </P> <P> ENDQUOTE: Sandra Bernhard gives lots of "attitude" in her recent profile by  People magazine. And her fans like it that way, say the editors. Asked  constantly throughout about her friendship with Madonna, Sandra gets rather  definite: "If Madonna and I were really having an affair, I don't think we  would be talking about it in public. She's a nice friend, and I have a great  time with her. She has a lot of money and takes me out to dinner. . . . If I  was really having an affair with her, do you think I'd be here? I'd be in Japan  spending all her money. If I'm with a man, it's because I'm with a man. If I'm  with a woman, you know, every woman that I'm seen with I'm not sleeping with.  And I'm not sleeping with every man, either. Anything goes in my life. I'm an  adventurous person, and I'm also a very sexual person, and I like interacting  with a lot of people. I think it's boring to be stuck in one genre.  </P> <P> "I'm not a lesbian, and I'm sick of being called one. I'm not, and I want to  set the record straight. . . . I'm going to blow everybody's minds. I'm going  to get married and belong to Hadassah!"  </P></p>

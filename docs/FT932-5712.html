			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Regulator sees growth in French shareholders MR PIERRE Fleuriot, managing director of the Commission des Operations de Bourse, France's stock market regulator, believes the large individual shareholding base in France could be maintained and even enlarged, Reuter reports from Paris. 'There is a historic base of individual shareholders which was created during the 1980s and there is a potential for new shareholders,' Mr Fleuriot said, during the release of a survey on shareholders. He said growth could come from the transfer of savings from money market funds into shares and from employees buying shares in their own companies as these are privatised. 'According to the poll, there are 4.5m individual shareholders, about 11 per cent of the French population, which hold a third of the bourse's capitalisation.' Mr Fleuriot said 60 per cent of individual shareholders started investing in shares between 1978 and 1980, attracted by the launch of the equity mutual funds with tax breaks aimed at private investors. A further 30 per cent were drawn to the stock market between 1986 and 1987 during the last wave of privatisations. Most of the individual shareholders were small shareholders - 50 per cent of them had portfolios worth less than FFr50,000. They continued to invest in shares despite the market turbulence of 1987 and 1989 and the poor economic climate. He also said individuals who bought shares in newly-privatised companies in 1986 and 1987 had seen their portfolios rise in value by 38 per cent even before dividend payments. Mr Fleuriot said there was a reserve of new shareholders, including savers, who could be tempted out of money market funds because of the fall in interest rates. About two thirds of the investments in money market funds belonged to individuals he said. The government is hoping to raise FFr40bn by the end of the year through privatisations.</p>

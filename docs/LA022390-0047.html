			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 'STREET KID' ACCUSED OF HELPING WIFE KILL ESTRANGED HUSBAND  </P> <P> An 18-year-old "street kid" was arrested on suspicion that he helped a Sun  Valley woman stab her estranged husband to death while he slept, then attempted  to make the killing appear to be the work of an intruder, authorities said  Thursday.  </P> <P> Anthony Thomas Moore, 18, was scheduled to be arraigned today in San Fernando  Municipal Court on a charge of murder for financial gain for allegedly helping  Mary L. Kellel-Sophiea kill her husband, Gregory Kellel-Sophiea, in his Sun  Valley home.  </P> <P> She called police at 3 a.m. on Jan. 31 and reported that her husband had been  stabbed to death in his bed. She told police she had been asleep in another  bedroom with the couple's 6-year-old daughter and had not heard the intruder.  </P> <P> Police found pry marks on a door to the house, but said inconsistencies in the  woman's statements led to her arrest.  </P> <P> Police said Kellel-Sophiea stabbed her husband while he was sleeping, then  tried to cover her tracks by making the slaying appear to have been committed  during a break-in.  </P> <P> Moore's fingerprints were also found in the house, and he was arrested Tuesday.  Police said Moore, whom they described as a "street kid," knew Kellel-Sophiea  and helped her murder her husband.  </P> <P> Police refused to elaborate on their relationship.  </P> <P> But Kellel-Sophiea's attorney, Leslie H. Abramson, denied that her client knew  Moore, and said that he was solely responsible for the slaying.  </P> <P> "She has never seen him before in her life. He is a complete stranger,"  Abramson said.  </P> <P> "This was clearly a burglary, and I guarantee you that this woman had nothing  to do with this."  </P> <P> Kellel-Sophiea pleaded not guilty earlier this month to a first-degree murder  charge in San Fernando Municipal Court, and was free on $150,000 bail awaiting  a preliminary hearing. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig R. Richman said the  prosecution will ask that she be re-arraigned on a charge of murder with the  special allegation that she killed for financial gain and will ask the judge to  revoke her bail.  </P> <P> Mary and Gregory Kellel-Sophiea had separated shortly before the killing, and  she and her daughter were living in the Long Beach area. The night of the  killing, she went to the couple's home to sign papers allowing her husband to  sell the house, police said, and decided to stay overnight in a separate  bedroom.  </P></p>

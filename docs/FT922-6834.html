			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Arts: Such stuff as dreams are made on - Cinema THE LONG DAY CLOSES (12) Curzon West End WAYNE'S WORLD (PG) Empire Leicester Sq DON'T TELL MOM THE BABY SITTER'S DEAD (PG) MGMs West End, Odeon Kensington DEF BY TEMPTATION (18) Prince Charles Terence Davies's The Long Day Closes, like his Distant Voices, Still Lives, is a dream of what film-making could be like. Davies is telling us another story from his past: his boyhood memories of life with Mum (Marjorie Yates) in mid-1950s Liverpool, when the bliss of family life and of discovering the movies (The Robe, Private's Progress, The Lady-killers) was poisoned only by an eleven year old's first taste of life at a new Catholic school. It is not what Davies tells, it is how he tells it. He must never have listened to sensible cinematic advice in his life. The film has no coherent story; there are long silences interspersed with cryptic dialogue or impromptu singalongs; and the images mix the real with the surreal. In one scene a fantasised sailing ship splashes real spray at hero Bud (Leigh McCormack as the young Davies) as he daydreams in a classroom. In another, he sees his own face in a school window: but it is not a reflection, it is a new image of himself about to flash us forward into a new scene. The Long Day Closes is a miracle of rebel imagination over movie manners. Since Davies's first film Trilogy, a three-part suicide note shot in black and white with BFI money, he has put colour and humour into his work. And a dazzling sensuality. He turns his recreated postwar Liverpool, painstakingly mocked up at London's Rotherhithe Studios, into a dreamscape part beautiful, part brutalist. Changing daylight weaves shifting traceries on worn carpets. Rain lends a silver pointillism to a street outside a cinema. (As abruptly and dramatically as it comes, it is cut off.) And lyrical tracking-shots travel not just between streets but between years, lubricated by Davies's invocation of hallowed movie dialogue lines. 'In those years they had time for everything' (The Magnificent Ambersons); 'Mrs Wilberforce, I understand you have rooms to let' (The Ladykillers). Some filmgoers resist or even resent film-making so determinedly impressionistic. Even though their own minds operate in this free-associative way almost every minute of their lives, they think films should tell neat linear stories. But just look at one scene that turned this filmgoer incandescent with joy. The boy sits on a staircase silently musing. All that 'happens' is that the lighting on his face changes three times. The scene has no takeaway message, the boy's thoughts and feelings are not spelled out in over-voice. But the profundity and serendipity of changing human mood has never been more simply, vividly caught. Davies only falters, briefly, when he harks back to the messianic miserablism of Trilogy. It is a good black joke to follow Mum's wistful 'I wonder what 1956 will bring' with a shot of nailed feet on a cross. (Cue Bud's entry into his new school.) But the round of lice inspections and bleak cruelty, with more helpings of religious symbolism, is too overtly querulous. We feel hectored. Worse, we feel we have been smuggled into Davies's mind by the non-denominational beguilements of the film's early scenes in order to be his anti-Catholic storm troopers when he needs us. Far more haunting is a single, inexplicable nightmare image at home. A pair of hands reach out from behind Bud's bed and clasp his head. Nothing leads to the scene, nothing leads away: it is for the audience to join the emotional dots. Here and in the film's use of music to challenge or ironise the visuals, and in the ingenuity of the visuals themselves like the halo-ing back-light on Bud's head in class that suddenly wobbles to become a movie projector beam, Terence Davies proves that he is not just a good film-maker, he has the makings of a great film-maker. Wayne's World provides the most convincing argument since Network for throwing your television out of the window. It follows the antics of two young American couch potatoes, Wayne and Garth (Mike Myers and Dana Carvey), as they present their public access TV chat show, an anarchic combination of mindless babble of the 'party on, dude' variety, woebegone special guests and lots of heavy metal music. When not on air, Wayne and Garth stumble through the world in a permanent electronic thrall - quoting TV adverts, lip synching to the radio, dreaming of the girl in the rock video. Their idea of witty dialogue is for one to exclaim 'No Way]', whereupon the other counters by saying 'Way]'. The film was born as a regular skit on America's Saturday Night Live comedy show, where it provided an often hilarious depiction of a generation of youth unable to conceive of anything that is not bounced off a satellite or channelled through loudspeakers. It is a shame that Myers, the show's creator, felt it had to be stretched out to a movie format - the plot, involving a venal network producer trying to take over the show, is nonsense, while the satire quickly achieves saturation point in a series of gags which will try the patience of most viewers. To make matters worse, there are continual references to television commercials and programmes unavailable over here. This is not to say that there are not some funny moments, though the overall impression the film leaves you with is that the telecommunications revolution is over, and the machines have won. A far less distressing view of American youth is on display in Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead. The film's plot is more or less deducible from its title: a harried single mother of five decides to take a few months off in Australia, leaving her children in the care of a tough old sitter, who promptly dies, whereupon the eldest child (Christina Applegate) must take charge of the family. The carefree 17-year-old soon shows her worth by bluffing her way into a high-paying position in the fashion industry, managing to hold the family together while at the same time winning the heart of the boy in the hot dog delivery van. What starts out as a potentially chaotic teen comedy soon turns into a gormlessly charming coming-of-age story that comes down firmly in favor of honesty, hard work and traditional family values. The distributors of Def by Temptation claim that it is 'the best black vampire movie since Blacula', an assessment I am not prepared to argue with, having missed all the other black vampire movies. Unfortunately, first time writer/director James Bond III has made a film which is hard to praise in many other ways. It tells the story of a young divinity student who travels to New York City for a vacation, only to find himself doing battle with a female vampire barfly who tries to tempt him away from his faith. Despite some spirited acting by Bill Nunn and Kadeem Hardison, the film's pace too uneven and its goriness too unconvincing to make it very scary. It is not that Bond is without talent - he just has failed to stretch his low budget to adequately cover the horror genre.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: IBM IBM's long history of underperformance on Wall Street means investors might be forgiven for doubting whether the latest restructuring effort marks the turn. With the dividend now officially in doubt, the shares certainly look vulnerable. But a cut dividend should hardly come as a surprise. Mr John Akers had already challenged some cornerstones of strategy - not least faith in mainframe computers - and the cherished policy of full employment. The maintained dividend commitment looked likely to be next on the block. More worrying is that IBM seems as far as ever from a sustained recovery. Even before restructuring charges, IBM will do well to break even at an operating level in the fourth quarter. The cycle has been cruel. The downturn in Europe and slowdown in the Far East are hurting just as the US market is showing the first signs of life. That said, the incumbent management must take its share of the blame. The promise, under pressure from institutional investors, to take out another Dollars 1bn administrative expenses next year underlines that more could have been done earlier. Problems in mainframes mask promising performances in mid-range business and personal computers. How that value can be realised is another matter. Mr Akers has already loosened the corporate grip on the constituent parts of the empire, with no obvious effect on profitability. More radical solutions may be required. There are formidable obstacles to any demerger, not least IBM's large integrated sales force. Having watched the shares underperform by 80 per cent since 1985, though, shareholders are running out of patience.</p>

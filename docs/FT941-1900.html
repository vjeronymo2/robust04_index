			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Secure Trust edges ahead to Pounds 7.6m Secure Trust, the financial services group, yesterday reported a 4 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.32m to Pounds 7.61m for 1993. Net interest income rose to Pounds 4.01m (Pounds 3.42m), helped by the group's acquisition of Peoples Bank during the year, which is estimated to have contributed some Pounds 500,000 in interest income. Fees and commission income rose to Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 13.9m). The group's main activities comprise its household cash management service, its banking service, and motor and general insurance business. Provisions for bad and doubtful debt fell sharply from Pounds 382,000 to Pounds 296,000. The board proposes a final dividend of 10.5p per share, which gives a total of 15p (13.5p) for the year, an increase of 11 per cent. Earnings per share rose to 35.8p (34.3p). Mr Henry Angest, chairman and chief executive, described the profit growth as steady rather than spectacular. He envisaged future growth coming from the group's banking activities, through developing facilities such as the cheque book and cash card currently available to Peoples Bank customers. The group is also looking to expand its geographical spread beyond the Midlands and Bradford where it is based at present. Mr Angest acknowledged that administrative expenses, at Pounds 10.16m (Pounds 9.21m) against an operating income of Pounds 18.54m (Pounds 17.31m), were high, but attributed this partly to the cost of meeting regulatory requirements. In December the group launched a telephone-based motor and household insurance service - SecureDirect - in response to inroads in its business from other telephone insurance services.</p>

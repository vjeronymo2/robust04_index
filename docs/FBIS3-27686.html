But Russia has recently  indicated to the West that the settlement of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina issue is impossible without Russian  participation.    As a traditional ally of the Serbs on the Bosnia-Herzegovina  issue, Russia has always objected to armed threats from the West  against the Serbs. After NATO's announcement of its ultimatum  against the Serbs, some Russian officials made threats, saying  that if NATO really carried out air attacks, a crisis would  break out in the relationship between Russia and the West.  Worrying about Russia's possible use of its veto in the UN  Security Council, the United States insisted that NATO's  ultimatum should conform with the relevant UN resolution.    When diplomats from the 16 NATO countries discussed and  decided the ultimatum, no one thought of notifying NATO's  decision to Russia. Russian President Yeltsin and Foreign  Minister Kozyrev were "extremely unhappy" about this. Thus, a  "crisis" occurred in the relationship between Russia and the  West.    Under such circumstances, German Chancellor Kohl insisted on  the need to take into account Russian efforts for peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, regardless of U.S. objections. German  mediation facilitated Russian influence on the Serbs and played  a major role in preventing NATO from implementing its planned  air attacks. The U.S. and Russian stand on the  Bosnia-Herzegovina issue began to change from antagonism to  cooperation.    On 17 February, Serbian leader Karadzic, and Churkin, the  special Russian envoy on the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue, reached  an agreement under which both sides agreed that Russia should  send peacekeeping troops to Sarajevo, while the Serbs would  withdraw their heavy weapons from the areas surrounding Sarajevo  or would let UN troops control these weapons. Thus, the  Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis began a turn for the better. As  reported, Russia did not inform the United States before it  announced its agreement with the Serbs. Despite its  dissatisfaction over what Russia had done, the United States  could not but praise in public that Russia had made an  "important contribution." When the Serbs began to withdraw  their heavy weapons from the Sarajevo area, on the one hand  Churkin claimed that the turn for the better in the  Bosnia-Herzegovina situation was due to Russian efforts; on the  other hand, he continued to criticize the West for threatening  air attacks, while the United States attributed the change in  the Bosnia-Herzegovina situation to NATO's "determination" and  "leading role" of the United States.    In the last few months, the United States and Russia have  time and again engaged in disputes over major issues. At the  end of last year, the U.S. Government considered accepting  former nations of the Warsaw Treaty as NATO members, with the  exception of the former Soviet Union. This evoked strong  dissatisfaction in Russia. To alleviate its contradictions with  Russia, the Clinton administration introduced a transitional  "peaceful partnership" program.    Not long after Clinton's visit to Moscow in January, Russian  Foreign Minister Kozyrev stressed that Russia would maintain its  military presence in the Baltic Sea. Obviously, this ran  counter to the Russian commitment to withdraw its troops from  the Baltic as soon as possible--a commitment made to Clinton  while he was in Moscow. For this reason, the United States  reacted strongly and demanded a Russian explanation.    These disputes between the United States and Russia are not  accidental. The United States has always been wary of  developments in Russia, and its diplomatic strategy hopes that  Russia will play a role which corresponds with U.S. intentions.  Although Russia is experiencing economic difficulties and its  international position is declining, it is not willing to act as  a "co-star" in international affairs. This is even more the  case when something involves its strategic interests.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary appreciates the concern of the commenter that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution terminated for misuse of Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds ought not be permitted to continue to handle those funds,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even for a limited period. The Secretary, however, considers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the honoring of commitments made to students is equally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important and, provided that the institution continues to offer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education, insists that those commitments be honored. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary can also take additional steps to safeguard these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remaining funds when appropriate. The institution remains liable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the proper handling of Title IV, HEA program funds even after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its participation is terminated. Naturally, should the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution reapply for participation in a Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or should a person with substantial control over the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also have substantial control over another institution, the way  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the terminated institution complied with the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section will be a factor in determining the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> readmission into the programs or the person's continued role in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the administration of the programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary needs assurance that if an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in a Title IV, HEA program ends, the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will make arrangements for a final audit of the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of the program. A letter of engagement provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary authoritative notification that the institution is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carrying out its responsibility to end its participation in a way  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that will allow the Secretary to determine whether any further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities or corrective action is required. Generally accepted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> auditing standards and the GAO's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Standards for Audit of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Governmental Organizations, Programs, Activities, and Functions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do not prohibit this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters recommended that the Secretary expand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the exception for institutions that close as a result of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> natural disaster. They suggested that the exemption apply to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution that closes as a result of fire, a weather emergency,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or other causes beyond the control of the institution. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter suggested that an institution that is closed or stops  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing educational programs for fewer than seven instructional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days should remain a participating institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary adopts the exception for closures as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of a natural disaster because this event is readily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verifiable. The Secretary acknowledges that other circumstances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may require an institution to close on a temporary basis, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not consider these other circumstances sufficient to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish additional exceptions to the requirements of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, because the period of closure will be too short. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most such instances, the institution has recourse to other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies, such as the arrangement for the use of other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities. Indeed, the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> academic year <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes actually recognizes that a week of instructional time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can include a number of days in which instruction does not occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart G_Fine, Limitation, Suspension, and Termination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proceedings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.81&blank;Scope and Special Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters believed that the appeal procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section should apply to institutions that were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisionally certified if the Secretary revokes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's provisional certification. Many commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed that the appeal procedures of this section should apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to institutions if the institution's period of participation has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expired. Several commenters suggested that the Secretary limit,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspend, or terminate the eligibility of a third-party servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to contract with an institution only to those services and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs for which the servicer has been found to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be in violation and only to those institutions on whose behalf  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the servicer committed the violation. The commenters claimed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the servicer's activities and the Secretary's sanctions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> might sometimes concern violations would have no material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship to the servicer's ability to provide other servicing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functions to institutions which it serves and to other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions unaffected by the original violations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  See discussions under the section of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments and Changes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that address certification procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (&sect;668.13). The Secretary does not agree with the commenters'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestion that the Secretary should limit, suspend, or terminate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the eligibility of a third-party servicer to contract with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution only to those services and Title IV, HEA programs for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the servicer has been found to be in violation and only to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those institutions on whose behalf the servicer committed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation. The Secretary imposes a sanction against a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer for a violation of a Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement for a specific reason, to protect the integrity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Title IV, HEA program. The Secretary, if necessary, must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reserve the right to limit, suspend, or terminate a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer's eligibility to administer any aspect of the Title IV,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA programs for any institution to ensure that further harm does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not occur to one or all of those programs. However, where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate, any limitation, suspension or termination action may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be limited in scope as suggested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.82&blank;Standard of Conduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter believed that individual employees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not be responsible for actions beyond their control;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instead, they should be held responsible for actions that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable. For example, to be held responsible for accounting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> errors of other departments may be going beyond what is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable. Two commenters argued that the servicer is merely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under contract to provide particular services, and is in no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> position to monitor the institution's compliance with other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fiduciary matters. They also claimed that establishing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fiduciary standard also would establish enormous liability for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas beyond the servicer's control. These commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that clarification is needed in the regulations to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that a third-party servicer could only be held to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fiduciary standard for funds under that servicer's direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary holds a third-party servicer to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fiduciary standard of care and diligence only in the exercise of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the servicer's Title IV, HEA program responsibilities that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer has contracted with the institution to perform. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary does not expect a third-party servicer to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for aspects of administration of the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs or funds attributed to those programs that the servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has not contracted with an institution to administer. With  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to the comment on the responsibility of individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees, the Secretary notes that these regulations apply a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard of conduct only to the third-party servicer itself;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual employees are not held accountable under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision. However, the Secretary expects a third-party servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to train its employees to perform their duties consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the servicer's fiduciary obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter was concerned that the provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governing a third-party servicer's fiduciary duty would limit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer's ability to acquire its servicing fees from funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administered by the servicer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

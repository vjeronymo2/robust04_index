			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Contest for your conversation: Cable companies and BT are in fierce competition in the UK telephone market Telephone calls in the UK are becoming as competitive as soap powders - and the difference between rival 'brands' is about as great. Last week saw the launch of two long-distance telecommunications networks. Energis and NTL join Mercury and BT in Europe's most competitive long-distance phone market. But competition is also opening up for the first time the local telephone market as across Britain cable companies dig up the streets, laying combined cable television and telephone networks. What does this rapid rise of cable telephony mean for the consumer? And does it spell serious trouble for the future of British Telecommunications, which until a decade ago had a complete monopoly over the UK's phone service? BT proclaims the cable companies to be its most serious long-term threat. Mr Michael Hepher, BT managing director, says: 'Whereas with Mercury we lose the long-distance revenue but keep the line connection, with the cable companies we lose not only the revenue but also the connection - and with it the opportunity to sell and market all our services.' His fears have foundation. The cable companies now boast more than 500,000 telephone customers, double the number a year ago. Although the cable operators are generally called 'cable TV companies', this is a misnomer since telephony is almost as important to them as television. They are marketing the two services hand-in-hand, and revenue from both is critical to the economics of laying a second cable into the home. Of the three largest cable operators in the UK, Nynex is a regional phone operator in the US, while the other two, Telewest and Bell Cablemedia, are joint ventures between telecommunications and cable companies. Analysts predict that by 2000 the cable companies will have installed nearly 5m phone lines - against BT's current total of 26m. Some cable operators already have more telephone than TV subscribers. Nynex, the second largest operator, claims that 25 per cent of the homes within its Portsmouth network area now take cable telephone, against 22 per cent taking cable TV. A year ago, 58 per cent of new customers were taking both products; now it is up to 70 per cent. The social make-up of cable customers is changing too. In the early days, when cable was clearly TV-led, it had strongest appeal in areas of low-income housing, where the extra TV channels were especially popular. Telephony is broadening cable's appeal. 'At the prosperous end of the demographic continuum we are now selling well above average,' says Mr Peter Lynch, director of residential marketing at Nynex. Sales are below average among older residents, 'but it is more a concern about change, not a clear socio-economic divide', he believes. In response, BT has set up 'cable defence' teams to target urban areas where cable companies are building their networks. It has also launched a high-profile campaign to persuade the government to lift the ban preventing it from carrying broadcast television across its network into homes. BT executives are additionally concerned that, as price competition with cable companies intensifies, BT will not be able to vary its prices regionally as the cable companies do. BT is required by its licence to charge the same for a local call in Portsmouth as in the large London calling zone. Yet BT probably protests too much. Take prices. Cable companies invariably claim to be cheaper than BT. In reality, however, they are often more expensive. Many customers are seduced by initial savings on line rentals, which are invariably cheaper with cable than BT, and by cable operators' claims that they are cheaper for a 'typical' residential phone bill. Since the cable companies have different tariffs, it is impossible to generalise. The chart compares the weekday residential tariffs of Videotron, a cable operator covering much of London and Hampshire, with those of BT and Mercury. Videotron is more expensive than BT for many national calls made during the day. Mercury - accessed through a BT line - is far cheaper than Videotron for all long-distance calls. Moreover, Videotron's cheap rate starts much later in the evening than that of BT or Mercury - an hour later for local and national calls and two hours later for European calls. So Videotron customers may unwittingly find themselves paying more than twice the BT rate for a call unless they look at the detail behind the company's claim to be 'at least 10 per cent cheaper' than BT for a 'typical' bill. BT is being forced to slash its prices by Oftel, the UK industry regulator. In the process it is putting greater pressure on its competitors as they seek to maintain price differentials. As the existing differential narrows, so does the incentive for customers to switch from one supplier to another. AT&amp;T, the largest US operator, has made great play of the trifling savings to be made by switching to its competitors - and its discount plans, available to most customers, are cleverly designed to boost loyalty. BT, which last year forged an alliance with AT&amp;T's principal rival, MCI, is fast learning the tricks of the US pricing and marketing trade. The numbers of cable subscribers cited above also need to be put in perspective. BT still has 85 per cent of the UK's telecoms market. It is currently adding new lines at a faster rate than the cable companies: its net monthly growth is about 60,000 lines, against less than 40,000 for the cable companies. BT's mobile phone offshoot, Cellnet, has 1.2m subscribers - more than twice as many as all cable phone users put together. Furthermore, the ban on BT carrying entertainment is unlikely to endure indefinitely. The House of Commons trade and industry select committee recently urged the government to set a firm date of 2002 for lifting the ban nationwide. The Cable Television Association accepts that the cable industry has little to gain from continued uncertainty and supports an eventual end to the ban. The challenge for the cable companies is to become more than 'cheap BTs' in their role as telecoms suppliers. On the residential side, pay-per-view and video-on-demand services across telecoms wires are being tested, with operators promising commercial services in the near future. If the cable companies can provide interactive services giving customers access to Hollywood movies and home shopping soon, they will steal a march on BT. But dates are vague, and prices have yet to be revealed. At the outset, cable operators concentrated on the residential market, where joint marketing of TV and telephony appeared to have most to offer. However, they are now also taking the business sector seriously. London's operators have come together in a 'London Interconnect' consortium, offering data communications services. Videotron, which holds a telephony franchise in Westminster and the City, has launched a desktop television/information service, upgrading personal computers with a card that gives users access, on their screens, to TV channels and information databases such as a new Reuters service. But the corporate sector is the fiercest part of the telecoms market. It will be an uphill struggle to win a big share of business against the many new operators - most of them US-owned - building networks and offering services. That leaves the residential sector, where the cable companies are the only phone operators besides BT with their own fixed networks. For the domestic consumer, competition means greater downward pressure on prices and in time a wider range of services - some compensation for the bulldozers blocking the pavements.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                COST OF A CHAT - HOW THE COMPETITION COMPARES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Weekday 3 minute call (pence)              Videotron            Mercury                BT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LOCAL Daytime        12.3                   -                14.8 Evening         4.9 (after 7pm)*      -                 4.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- OVER 35 MILES Daytime        33.6                 24.7               29.6 Evening        18.0 (after 7pm)     14.1 (after 6pm)   19.7 (after 6pm)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LONDON-PARIS Daytime       102.2                 95.5              108.6 Evening        64.6 (after 8pm)     79.7 (after 6pm)   88.8 (after 6pm)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Free for calls between Videotron subscribers  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Mitsotakis case to be dropped Greece's Socialist government is planning to drop charges of illegal telephone tapping and accepting bribes against Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the conservative former prime minister. Mr Mitsotakis is due to be tried by a special court on January 23 for allegedly ordering phone-taps of political opponents. In a separate case he is accused of accepting a Dollars 22.5m (Pounds 13.7m) bribe in the sale of Heracles General Cement to Calcestruzzi of Italy in 1992. The Socialists appear to be arranging a political trade-off in which Mr Mitsotakis and other backbenchers in the opposition New Democracy party would back the government candidate in next spring's presidential ballot. If the Socialists fail to find the 10 extra votes in parliament needed to elect a new head of state, they face an early general election.</p>

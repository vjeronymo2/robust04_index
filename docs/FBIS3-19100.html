In a hard-hitting lecture to Manchester Business School, Mr  Davies said the dramatic upheaval over the past decade required  better training, a radical shake-up of the tax and benefits  system and policies to help the long-term unemployed back into  work.    The leader of the employers' organisation distanced himself  from the laissez-faire approach followed in the 1980's and urged  action to cope with the sharp increase in joblessness among  unskilled men.    He said the widening gulf between rich and poor had not been  matched by a universal increase in living standards. Over the  past 10 years "the poorest 10 percent and some others have  become absolutely poorer." The Government has always argued  that all income groups have become better off in the past 15  years.    Mr Davies said the 1.3 million increase in jobs during the  1980's was entirely accounted for by part-timers, mostly women.    Mr Davies canvassed the idea of a negative income tax, which  would top up the pay of those on low wages and thereby drag them  out of the poverty trap.    Despite giving guarded support to the Chancellor's attack on  excessive boardroom payouts, Mr Davies concentrated on the  changes lower down the income scale. "It is clear that, for a  combination of reasons not by any means all under our control,  British society is becoming more unequal," he said.    The CBI chief said society was being transformed in four  distinct ways -- a greater prevalence of divorce, increased  participation in the workforce of part-time women from generally  better-off households, widening income distribution and higher  poverty. "These four changes have occurred quite rapidly and  the cumulative effect of them is enormous."    As a result, Mr Davies said Government and industry needed  to  rethink their attitudes to training, child care, benefits and  working practices. "We must try to upskill workers displaced  from traditional industries. And we start from a long way back,  with a workforce which is endowed, on average, with  significantly lower skills than our competitors."    In his 18 months at the CBI Mr Davies has been no stranger  to  controversy, causing a flurry in government circles last autumn  when he warned that business was unhappy about the anti-Brussels  rhetoric from ministers at the Conservative party conference.    The CBI chief said he was pleased that the paper prepared by  the Treasury and the Department of Employment for next week's  Jobs Summit in Detroit had stressed the need for a close look at  ways of using the tax and benefits system to improve incentives  to work.    "But what will the `close look' signalled by this paper  produce? Are we ready to accept that the tax and benefit system  should be integrated more closely, with concepts such as  negative income tax? Or is that too much like socialism?"    Mr Davies defended management from blanket attacks on their  pay increases, saying there was little evidence that overall  there was "one law for the rich and one for the poor."    But he added: "It is -- sometimes -- difficult to understand  the rationale for packages which include high basic pay, large  bonuses and big tranches of options, all at the same time. And  when I say it is difficult, what I mean is, it is too difficult  for me and I am not even going to try."    He added that income inequality was greater in some of the  world's most dynamic economies such as the U.S. Many people  would accept greater inequality if the concomitant was a dynamic  economy in which everyone's living standards rose. "But in the  last decade that is not the way it has been."    Mr Davies said that during the 1980's the average income of  the top tenth of earners rose by 62 percent, the bottom 10  percent saw a fall of 14 percent. The numbers on income support  had risen from 3 million to 4 million. "The new poor are  heavily concentrated among one-parent families and the long-term  unemployed."</p>

Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ICC is the commodity clearing subsidiary of The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC''). ICC commenced operations in 1985 as a ``clearing organization,'' as defined in the rules promulgated under the Commodity Exchange Act, <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  and therefore is subject to oversight and regulation by the CFTC. ICC guarantees, clears, and settles futures contracts, options on futures contracts, and commodity options which are traded on those contract markets that have designated ICC as their clearing organization. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') Rule 1.3(d) [17 CFR 1.3(d) (1993)] defines clearing organization as the person or organization which acts as a medium for clearing transactions in commodities for future delivery or commodity option transactions or for effecting settlements of contracts for future delivery or commodity option transactions for and between members of a contract market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, ICC acts as the clearing organization for the Amex Commodities Corp., the New York Futures Exchange, Inc., and the Philadelphia Board of Trade. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the economic similarity between certain securities products and certain commodity products created opportunities for intermarket hedging and arbitrage, ICC and OCC developed a program to offer cross-margining to joint members of ICC and OCC. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  The original cross-margining program between ICC and OCC required a joint member to transfer positions in securities options eligible for cross-margining from its OCC account to its account at ICC. Such options positions and futures contracts eligible for cross-margining were margined at ICC based upon the net risk of the combined positions. ICC held all positions, margin deposits, and clearing fund deposits with respect to the cross-margining program. ICC was obligated to OCC to perform a participating joint member's obligations with respect to short positions in securities options held in the joint member's ICC cross-margining account, and OCC remained obligated to collect and pay all premiums for transactions in securities options and to effect settlement of all exercises. Because securities positions were held and were margined at ICC and because ICC held all the margin deposits and clearing fund deposits with respect to cross-margined positions, ICC believed that it could possibly be viewed as being within the Act's definition of a clearing agency <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  and therefore registered with the Commission as such. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 26153 (October 3, 1988), 53 FR 39567 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;86&hyph;17] (order approving OCC/ICC proprietary cross-margining program) and 30041 (December 5, 1991), 56 FR 64824 [File Nos.

On April 5, 1990, October 3, 1991, and April 2, 1993, the Commission extended ICC's temporary registration for additional eighteen month periods (Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 27879 (April 5, 1990), 55 FR 39556; 29781 (October 3, 1991), 56 FR 50959; and 32098 (April 2, 1993), 58 FR 18277). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Following regulatory approval of the cross-margining program between ICC and OCC, OCC entered into cross-margining arrangements with several other commodity clearing organizations. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  Pursuant to those later cross-margining programs, instead of transferring all cross-margined option and futures positions into an account held at one clearing organization, cross-margined option positions are held at OCC and cross-margined futures positions are held at the participating commodity clearing organization. OCC and the participating commodity clearing organization share information regarding the positions held in their cross-margining accounts and treat the cross-margining accounts as being combined for purposes of calculating margin requirements. Collateral deposited to satisfy margin requirements is subject to the joint control of OCC and the participating commodity clearing organization. Members electing to participate in a cross-margining program must grant OCC and the participating commodity clearing organization cross-liens on option positions maintained at OCC and on futures positions maintained at the participating commodity clearing organization. Under this later cross-margining structure, a participating commodity clearing organization is not considered to be within the Act's definition of a clearing agency and therefore is not required to register with the Commission as such. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> E.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 27296 (September 26, 1989), 54 FR 41195 (order approving OCC/CME cross-margining program for proprietary positions); 29991 (November 26, 1991), 56 FR 61458 (order approving expansion of OCC/CME cross-margining program to include positions held for market professionals); 29888 (October 31, 1991), 56 FR 56680 (order approving OCC/Board of Trade Clearing Corporation cross-margining program for proprietary positions); 32681 (July 27, 1993), 58 FR 41302 (order approving expansion of OCC/BOTCC cross-margining program to include positions held for market professionals); 30413 (February 26, 1992), 57 FR 7830 (order approving OCC/Kansas City Board of Trade Clearing Corporation [``KCBOTCC''] cross-margining program for proprietary positions); and 32708 (August 2, 1993), 58 FR 42586 (order approving the expansion of the OCC/KCBOTCC cross-margining program to include positions held for market professionals). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Recently, the cross-margining program between ICC and OCC was restructured so that it parallels the cross-margining programs between OCC and other participating commodity clearing organizations. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  ICC believes that under the restructured cross-margining program it will no longer be acting as an intermediary in making payments or deliveries in connection with securities transactions and therefore will not be a clearing agency under the Act. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  Accordingly, ICC requests that its application for permanent registration with the Commission as a clearing agency be withdrawn. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33342 (December 22, 1993), 58 FR 67885 [File Nos.

Previously, a joint member was able to select either ICC or OCC as its designated clearing organization (``DCO'') for the purpose of settling its cross-netted obligations. The clearing agency selected as DCO was to act as the agent of the other clearing organization in effecting the cross-netted settlements. ICC has never been selected as a joint member's DCO, and pursuant to the recent approval of rule changes filed by ICC and OCC, members are no longer able to select ICC as their DCO. For a more detailed description of the proposed rule changes, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34088 (May 19, 1994), 59 FR 27303 [File Nos. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;94&hyph;01 and SR&hyph;ICC&hyph;94&hyph;01] (order approving proposed rule change related to restructuring of cross-netting agreement between ICC and OCC). Accordingly, ICC believes that it will no longer be performing any activity with respect to cross-netting that would bring it within the definition of a clearing agency under the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II.

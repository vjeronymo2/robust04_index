			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FRESNO;  </P> <P> LAO AGENCIES DENY EXTORTION CHARGES  </P> <P> Leaders of local Lao Family organizations in Fresno and Garden Grove have  denied that their agencies are involved in "shakedowns" of ethnic Hmong  refugees to fund a resistance movement in Laos. Officials of the Civil Rights  Bureau of California's Social Services Departments are recommending that  funding of Lao Family refugee assistance programs throughout California be  halted after an investigation in San Bernardino and Riverside counties revealed  the assistance programs were involved in extortion and discrimination against  Hmong refugees who don't contribute to the anti-communist resistance movement  in Laos.  </P> <P> The resistance is headed by Gen. Vang Pao, a Hmong leader who lives in Garden  Grove. The state contends Lao Family employees in San Bernardino County acted  as "shakedown artists" for Vang Pao's resistance movement, telling refugees  they could not return to their ethnic homeland in the hill country of Laos  unless they contributed to his cause. But Tony Vang, head of the Fresno Lao  Family program, said the Social Services probe assumed "the Lao Family  throughout the state is doing the same thing. That is not right. And they  actually jeopardize their own position on civil rights. They are using one  brush to brush everybody's face."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xiao Rui (5618 3843)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 20 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--A monthly  report on the economic situation issued by the State Statistics  Bureau today shows that, in December 1993, the growth rate of  China's industrial production increased considerably; commodity  sales in the domestic market were brisk; the range of rise of  commodity prices was relatively wide; and the pressure of  inflation increased.    Because many more loans were granted in the third and fourth  quarters last year, the situation of enterprises being short of  funds was eased. In December, the growth rate of industrial  production across the country increased considerably, showing an  increase by 29.8 percent as compared with the same month in the  previous year and close to the highest point before the work of  macro regulation and control was strengthened.    Sales were brisk in the domestic market. In December, the  total volume of social commodity retail sales was 35.3 percent  higher than the same month in the previous year and was up 29.7  percent over November last year. The volume of grain, edible  oil, and household electric appliance sales increased sharply.  That month, the sale of grain was 1.41 million tonnes over the  same month of the previous year, constituting a sharp contrast  with the accumulated decline of 18 percent in the volume of  sales during the first 11 months. Sales of color television  sets were up 82.1 percent over the same month of the previous  year. The volume of sales of cassette recorders and  refrigerators also increased by a relatively large margin. The  sales of the means of agricultural production began to increase,  and sales of commodities such as chemical fertilizer,  pesticides, and plastic for agricultural use also increased  greatly.    The range of the rise of commodity prices in December was on  the high side. Daily living expenses in 35 large and medium  cities rose by 23.9 percent, of which the prices of consumer  goods rose by 17.2 percent and service charges by 38.6 percent.  Inflationary pressure increased further.    On the whole, the situation of economic operations is  basically normal at present. In the next stage, it will be  necessary to do a good job in work to give explanation to  reform, improve the operation of reform, and make efforts to  guard against marked inflation while ensuring the smooth  progress of reform in various aspects.</p>

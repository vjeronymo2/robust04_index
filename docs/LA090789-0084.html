			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MOBIL EFFORTS DISCLOSED TO PREEMPT TORRANCE'S AUTHORITY  </P> <P> Mobil Oil Corp. has been pressing for legislation that could preempt the city  of Torrance's authority to require a risk management plan for extremely  hazardous chemicals stored at the company's refinery.  </P> <P> But Frederick Taugher, a Mobil lobbyist, said Wednesday, after The Times began  to make inquiries about the proposal, that he had been told by Mobil management  that the company would not proceed with pressure for any legislation.  </P> <P> "We had been in preliminary discussions, but they made the decision not to  pursue those any further," Taugher said.  </P> <P> In an earlier interview, Taugher said he had talked to the offices of at least  two lawmakers, Assemblyman Richard Floyd (D-Carson) and Sen. Art Torres (D-Los  Angeles).  </P> <P> Floyd said Wednesday that he does not plan to help Mobil, partly because the  Legislature is scheduled to adjourn for the year on Sept. 15. "It's too late in  the year to do anything," Floyd said. "They should have been doing something  earlier."  </P> <P> A source close to Torres indicated that the senator declined to champion  Mobil's proposal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stepped-Up Lobbying  </P> <P> Mobil, upset with city efforts to regulate the refinery after a November, 1987,  hydrofluoric acid explosion and two-day fire drew attention to the facility,  has recently stepped up its lobbying efforts in the Capitol.  </P> <P> The Torrance refinery, which supplies 12% of Southern California's gasoline,  uses hydrofluoric acid to boost octane levels. Mobil has estimated that it  would cost $100 million to switch to sulfuric acid, the catalyst used by most  other major refineries.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Mobil acknowledged that it was considering seeking  legislation to preempt Torrance's regulation of the lethal chemical.  </P> <P> In the past week, according to several legislative sources, Mobil has  intensified its efforts by pitching a proposal to curb the ability of small and  medium-sized cities to require businesses to prepare a risk management report.  The reports, authorized under state law, spell out the dangers of extremely  hazardous materials at industrial sites and the procedures for protecting the  public.  </P> <P> Taugher said Mobil has had "some discussion, . . . more exploratory than  anything" with staff in the offices of Floyd and Torres. He said the talks had  been partly to determine if it was feasible to expect any legislation to be  introduced and enacted into law this year. He declined to provide details of  his proposal.  </P> <P> "There is a considerable problem of cities in the same general area developing  different standards for the use of hazardous materials," Taugher said. "What  one city does . . . affects neighboring cities."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Initiative Cited  </P> <P> Taugher also cited a Torrance ballot initiative aimed at forcing Mobil to stop  using hydrofluoric acid in the city as another reason for pressing for  legislation. The measure is scheduled to be on the ballot next March.  </P> <P> In addition, the city filed a lawsuit against Mobil in April alleging that the  refinery is a public nuisance and seeking the authority to regulate it.  </P> <P> Before Mobil decided to drop its legislative proposal, Taugher said:  "Obviously, the election is of concern, but as I say, nobody has made a  decision about doing anything."  </P> <P> Assemblyman Gerald Felando (R-San Pedro), who said he discussed the matter with  Floyd on Tuesday, said he would have "opposed it vigorously. The constituents  in that community have the right to decide what's going to happen with Mobil  Oil. Nobody else (does). . . ." Felando, whose district includes Torrance,  added: "I don't believe another legislator should meddle in another  legislator's district."  </P> <P> Infuriated Torrance officials characterized Mobil's lobbying effort as an  attempt to end-run their efforts.  </P> <P> "It's another example of them trying to subvert a process and get around a  safety problem," said Councilman Dan Walker, who sponsored the ballot measure.  "The industry and Mobil have watered down the risk management requirements to  such an extent that they're almost useless now, and then to try to take  Torrance out of it. . . It's underhanded."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Hatchet Work'  </P> <P> Walker said he doubts that Mobil would have found a sponsor even if it had  decided to continue its lobbying efforts.  </P> <P> "I can't imagine anyone doing Mobil's hatchet work for them," he said. "Mobil's  got to understand that they've got to start working with people and stop trying  to subvert the process."  </P> <P> Under current law, cities and counties have the option of requiring businesses  to perform a risk management assessment to catalogue the dangers of hazardous  materials they handle, partly to help health and fire departments prepare  emergency plans.  </P> <P> The Mobil proposal, according to two legislative sources, sought to prohibit  cities with populations under about 200,000 from being able to require such a  program. The population of Torrance is 141,500.  </P> <P> "I think that's outrageous," Mayor Katy Geissert said. "I understand what their  practical logic is, but what is their public logic? Are they trying to say that  people in smaller cities are less susceptible to the effects of hazardous  substances? . . . This would put cities like Torrance at the mercy of big  government and the power of well-heeled lobbyists."  </P> <P> Last March, a Mobil study, required under present law, concluded that continued  use of hydrofluoric acid at the Torrance refinery poses almost no risk to the  public. The study also concluded that there is less than a 1% chance each year  of a single death occurring in the community from the use of the lethal acid.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Negotiations Going On  </P> <P> Since Mobil turned in the study, Torrance hazardous materials analysts have  been negotiating with refinery officials to make the document more detailed and  bring it into line with state regulations.  </P> <P> Torrance Fire Chief Scott Adams said Mobil's risk report was one of the first  such studies prepared under the new state laws allowing cities to require them.  </P> <P> Because basic state guidelines for putting together such a study continue to  change and had not even been completely written when Torrance ordered Mobil to  begin work on its document, the fine-tuning could take several more months,  Adams said.  </P> <P> Once the Mobil study has been completely reviewed, Adams said, Torrance intends  to seek risk management assessments from other companies in the city.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fine-Tuning Bill  </P> <P> Mobil sounded out Floyd about his interest in its proposal partly because he  has introduced a bill to fine-tune the risk management program, according to a  Floyd aide. Among other things, Floyd's measure would require local agencies to  force businesses with the highest risk of an accident to prepare risk  management programs ahead of other businesses.  </P> <P> Floyd minimized the significance of his staff's discussing Mobil's revisions to  his bill, which is pending in the Senate.  </P> <P> "Everybody gets all excited because we discuss things," Floyd said. "That's  what we're here for. . . . My door is open. We listen to everybody and all  their problems, and we look at options."  </P> <P> Floyd said he was unsure of the details of the Mobil proposal. But, in apparent  reference to the cost of switching to sulfuric acid for refining, Floyd said:  "It's a $100-million problem to them," so it's natural for Mobil to seek  legislative relief.  </P> <P> But losing the right to require risk management programs would harm Torrance's  ability to regulate companies besides Mobil, City Atty. Kenneth Nelson said.  </P> <P> "We are an industrial city, and the (risk management) process is a very  important element in protecting the health and safety of the public in this day  and age," he said. Attempts to limit the rights of smaller cities "would be  discriminatory," Nelson said.  </P></p>

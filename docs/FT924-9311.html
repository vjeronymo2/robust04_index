			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Japan set to agree package of aid to Vietnam: A window of opportunity for an expansion of trade and investment THE Japanese government is today expected to approve the resumption of official aid to Vietnam, signalling to eager Japanese companies that the way is clear for a rapid expansion of trade and investment. In deference to US sensitivities, Japan has maintained a ban on official economic links to Hanoi since 1979, and urged trading houses and industrial companies to adopt a low profile in their bilateral dealings Sensing that the US may soon lift its economic embargo and having secured informal approval from the US State Department, the Japanese cabinet is today scheduled to consider a loan package of Y45.5bn (Pounds 230m). The loans may be announced later by Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, who is planning a trip to Vietnam in coming weeks. About six Japanese banks including Bank of Tokyo, the country's main foreign exchange bank, provided bridging finance of about Y23.5bn to the Vietnamese government on Wednesday in what was apparently the first commercial bank transaction between the two countries since 1975. These funds will be used to cover Vietnam's arrears on Japanese loans from the 1970s, paving the way for the government to announce the aid package. Meanwhile, most leading banks are negotiating with Japan's Ministry of Finance over the opening of representative offices in Vietnam. Sakura Bank, the country's second largest bank by fund volume, sent a delegation of 21 officials to the country late last month. Trade between the two countries has surged over the past year. Japan's exports to Vietnam in the first nine months rose by 133 per cent over the same period last year, while imports from Vietnam are 27.8 per cent higher. The true level of exports is unclear, as Japanese goods have been transferred through subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Bangkok to avoid antagonising the US. But the flurry of commercial activity has prompted words of caution from some Foreign Ministry officials who fear the rush to Hanoi could become a point of contention with Washington. These officials suggest that Vietnam still has a poor human rights record, with dissidents and religious groups routinely harassed. There is concern that the Clinton presidency could both lift the embargo against Vietnam and stress the importance of human rights, in a two-pronged policy similar to that in place for China. Officials in Tokyo generally agree that the incoming administration is likely to increase pressure on China, which could increase friction between Tokyo and Washington. After a successful China visit by Emperor Akihito last month, the Japanese government hopes the wartime scars have healed and the two countries can develop a more forward-looking relationship, a prospect relished in Beijing, which senses, in the longer term, that Tokyo could be played off against Washington. But these geo-political concerns are not restraining Japanese companies, which feel, for the first time in a decade, confident enough to express publicly their enthusiasm for the economic potential offered by a reforming Vietnam. The Keidanren, the country's main business federation, said the 'countdown has already begun' until the lifting of the US embargo, and 'everyone in Japan' is pleased that Tokyo's official development assistance (ODA) programme is on the verge of resumption. 'There is so much potential in Vietnam. The labour costs are low, and they have very skilled workers with a good work ethic. There is oil and high quality coal, and the country has excellent sea access,' a Keidanren spokesman said. Mr Toshihiko Sekimoto, general manager of Asian business planning at Itochu, the leading trading house, said his company has had offices in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City since last November researching potential investments. 'There needs to be improvement of the infrastructure, but we are very interested in projects involving agriculture, marine products, and textiles. The skill level of the workers is very high.'</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Underwriters enjoy big rise in insurance rates Underwriters who have survived the recessionary shake-out in the London insurance market are enjoying the best trading conditions for at least five years. Rates for most of the lines of aviation, marine, reinsurance and other commercial insurance, in which both the Lloyd's market and London-based insurance companies specialise, have risen sharply in the past two to three years. This follows a period of intense price competition in the late 1980s and a string of heavy losses. During the past six months capacity shortages - which made it difficult for brokers to place business - have eased, partially because of the successful introduction of corporate money to Lloyd's. Institutional and retail investors provided more than Pounds 800m in capital, helping Lloyd's to increase its capacity this year from Pounds 8.7bn to at least Pounds 10.5bn. After suffering losses of more than Pounds 6bn in the past five years, Lloyd's underwriters are expecting to post handsome profits for last year, when accounts are finalised in two years' time in line with the market's three-year accounting system. Investors have also been attracted by improvements in efficiency and hopes that moves to contain billions of pounds in liabilities from US claims - mostly stemming from asbestosis and pollution awards - will be success-ful. The biggest worry is that the recovery, especially in the high-risk catastrophe reinsurance market, may have been too quick. Competition, particularly from new Bermuda-based companies, could soon lead to price-cutting. Prices are expected to fall by up to 15 per cent in the next six months, when many of the biggest Australasian and Japanese insurers renegotiate their reinsurance policies.</p>

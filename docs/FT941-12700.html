			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Income at Cummins surges as truck market strengthens Cummins, the US diesel engine manufacturer, capitalised on the improving North American market for heavy-duty trucks by nearly doubling its profit in the fourth quarter. The Indiana-based company yesterday revealed net income of Dollars 47.1m, or Dollars 1.26 a share, for the final three months of last year. The result compares with net income of Dollars 24m, or 63 cents, in the corresponding period of 1992. In both quarters, the company took a Dollars 5.5m charge for the early retirement of debt. The sharp rise in profits, up 96 per cent year-on-year, reflected more than just solid growth in revenues, which climbed about 10 per cent to Dollars 1.12bn, against Dollars 1.02bn a year earlier. The North American truck industry has completed a banner year in which output jumped by 33 per cent, a rise that filled Cummins's order book to near capacity. This saw improved efficiency and higher productivity during a year in which the company held its position as the market's leading supplier, with a 35 per cent share. Sales of power-generation equipment, the company's second-largest business, and mid-range engines were also buoyant. For the full year, Cummins posted net earnings of Dollars 177.1m, or Dollars 4.79 a share, reversing a net loss of Dollars 189.5m, or Dollars 6.01, in 1992. Last year's result, however, included one-time charges of Dollars 256.6m for the adoption of new accounting standards and other costs. On an operating basis, 1993 earnings were Dollars 182.6m, against Dollars 67.1m in the previous 12 months. Annual sales of Dollars 4.2bn were a 14 per cent improvement over 1992 revenues of Dollars 3.7bn. International sales, as a percentage of the total, slipped by 2 points to 44 per cent, largely because of sluggish conditions in Mexico and most of Europe, with the exception of the UK. By contrast, sales in the Asia Pacific region were well ahead of 1992 levels.</p>

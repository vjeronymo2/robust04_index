			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Property: Make a home at the office - London is awash with empty business space. Now, some of it, especially in Mayfair, is being converted to residential use The second world war blitz saw many houses in Mayfair, an exclusive district in the heart of the West End, converted into offices as parts of the City - London's financial heart - were destroyed by Luftwaffe bombs. Only now, 50 years on, is the process of returning those offices  - many covered by so-called Temporary Office Permissions (TOPs) - to residences starting to have an effect. This is a small part of a big change affecting London, which is full of unused office space: blocks of the 1960s, '70s and '80s sit empty, built when demand looked limitless. Making flats of them is an alternative use, which can have the added benefits of creating a more vital city and allowing more people to live near their work. Regalian Properties' purchase (in association with the Sincere Company Ltd of Hong Kong) of Alembic House on the Albert Embankment, SE11 (for about Pounds 5m, through Cluttons London Residential Agency), looks shrewdly timed. This 14-floor block, built in the 1960s and (reputedly) used by the intelligence agency MI6, meets the top requisite in property: its location on a bend of the Thames, with long views up and down river, including the houses of parliament, is excellent. Best-selling author Lord (Jeffrey) Archer already has a flat on the top two storeys and Regalian is to convert the other floors into luxury flats. Office space available in central London amounts to about 31m sq ft, according to an estimate by property analyst APR (Applied Property Research), and millions more square feet are in the planning pipeline. But where are the businesses to fill them? Walk around London and everywhere you see vacant offices. Interest is a huge cost, draining a developer's funds. Then again, maintenance for a 20,000 sq ft block costs an estimated Pounds 15,000 yearly, plus Pounds 70,000 for 24-hour security and, say, Pounds 200,000 for rates, according to a Home Office report issued last year by APR with chartered surveyor Cluttons, quantity surveyor Gardiner &amp; Theobald, and architect GMW. To escape rates you must 'decommission,' which is a drastic step involving removing the stairs and lift. The building, of course, deteriorates at once - and the community with it. Clerkenwell, Shoreditch and the South Bank, on the fringes of the City, contain much of the surplus but spare blocks lurk all over inner London. And this 'creeping dereliction,' as the report calls it, sits uncomfortably with the need for more homes in the central area. The causes of the surplus are easy to understand. Until the end of the 1980s, developers' returns on offices far outmatched those on residential buildings. With a peak capital value of Pounds 1,000 a sq ft, their zest to build offices was matched only by the anxiety of the banks not to miss out on the boom. Then came their come-uppance: the financial crash, about 18 months after the residential market had collapsed. Prospective tenants vanished and rents fell, even in the City. Thus, a change to residential use looks attractive, even if it poses difficulties for planning authorities that have not included the possibility in development schemes they began at the height of the boom and which now are being completed in the recession. But even if office use picks up, as it must with recession easing, it can never mop up the space available (although, if a council thinks there will be a lack one day, it can give temporary permission to change a building's use). There is 'very little difference now in the capital values,' according to West End estate agent Anthony Lassman. He says office rents are running up to Pounds 400 a sq ft in the heart of London; another agent, Peter Wetherell, estimates Pounds 300-400 a sq ft for residential values. And while offices have improved slightly from three or four months ago, residential could be the best option for many blocks. Indeed, several conversions are already in the pipeline in the area near Victoria station. What changes of use are possible? Flats for a start, as at Alembic House. Or the block could become a hotel, or a student hostel (for which the report estimates a gross return per room of Pounds 50 a week for 40 weeks a year, making Pounds 2,000). The problems, however, are many. A hotel needs a drive-in and flats require parking space. If there is no basement car park, can streets cope with parking for residents? Is there enough daylight? (light requirements differ for offices and homes). And, most importantly, is it proper living accommodation? As a Westminster city council spokeswoman said: 'We have been fighting bad housing for the past 50 years.' In the Mayfair section of Westminster, the long-lived TOPs, mostly on the Grosvenor estate, are a separate issue but slot into the general pattern. During the war, houses were requisitioned in Mayfair for embassies and emigre governments. TOPs continued this trend. They saved money for aristocratic owners, who stayed in the country (and moved to cheaper Knightsbridge, Kensington and Chelsea if they did need a town house). TOPs had to be renewed every 10 years. But although Westminster council's aim was to return buildings to residential use, there was a fog of uncertainty, especially when buildings had been remodelled extensively as offices. Late in the 1980s, however, the council decided TOPs would end in 1990. Building by building, negotiations began with the Grosvenor estate - which had 84 TOPs in Mayfair - to see how suited each was for conversion back to residential use. Fifteen of the TOPs needed early decisions, which resulted in 29,100 sq ft being declared offices and 97,160 residential. Another 12 were omitted because of various special circumstances. The remaining 57 were settled in a package, with 132,295 sq ft declared offices and 184,497 residential. So, in total, there are 161,395 sq ft for offices and 282,107 residential (with 106 flats in apartment buildings, 15 flats in office buildings, seven houses, and 12 existing flats). Since the agreement, Mayfair has been full of builders and skips and now we are starting to see the changes. No 106 Park Street has been made into 11 luxury flats and there will be about 17 in Brook House on Park Lane, which used to house property company MEPC. The former headquarters of the Rank Organisation at 38 South Street has been sold and will revert to being a house, while 7 Upper Brook Street has already been converted back and is now on the market for a second time. The result is a gradually changing Mayfair with a central residential enclave 'on a par with Belgravia,' says agent Kevin Ryan. Shops are mostly on the edges, but South Audley Street has become an up-market village high street. Of course, it will be a while yet before the area really gets a 'homey' feel. By the millennium, however, that could have come.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 15 (KNS-KCNA) -- A symposium took place  in Tokyo under the auspices of the Society of Koreans in Japan  for Social and Legal Studies under the Association of Korean  Social Scientists in Japan to expose the essence and injustice  of the Japanese authorities' crackdown on Osaka and Kyoto  organizations of the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan (Chongnyon).    Speakers at the symposium were unanimous in saying the  crackdown cases were by no means accidental and they were  absolutely deliberate and premeditated human rights abuses  committed against the background of their malicious anti-DPRK,  anti-Chongnyon campaign, and illegal acts of political  suppression, and a typical national chauvinistic crime.    They said there is no change in the Korea policy of the  Japanese government authorities resorting to anti-DPRK moves to  isolate and stifle it on the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear  issue" and that the Japanese authorities' suppression of  Chongnyon organizations was completely illegal from the legal  point of view.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 29 Mar (EFE) -- Bomb attacks were carried out  here today against a bank and a Peruvian Telephone Company (CPT)  office in the wake of an unsuccessful attempt to cause a  blackout in the Peruvian capital. This new, weak terrorist act  caused only damage.    The attacks caused heavy damage, which has yet to be  assessed, to a Credit Bank office in the Victoria district and  to the CPT office located in the San Luis district.    Several blasts, which were initially believed to be bombs,  were also heard simultaneously in several points of the city.  These blasts, however, turned out to be dynamite sticks that  went off in the air.    Shortly before the attacks, there was a power surge  apparently caused by an unsuccessful attempt to sabotage the  power transmission line that supplies Lima.    Terrorist attacks have declined markedly since Shining Path  leader Abimael Guzman was captured in 1992 and have declined  further since Guzman admitted his defeat and sought to negotiate  with the government in September 1993.</p>

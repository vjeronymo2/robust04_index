			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Overseas sales behind 32% improvement at Domino STRONG OVERSEAS sales helped Domino Printing Sciences, the Cambridge-based manufacturer and distributor of industrial ink-jet printers, increase pre-tax profits by 32 per cent, from Pounds 3.43m to Pounds 4.54m, in the six months to April 30. Turnover rose 17 per cent to Pounds 30.9m, although UK sales were flat at Pounds 5.25m (Pounds 5.29m). Domino said the corresponding period had benefited from strong legislative-driven demand for new food labels, and buying decisions had been delayed in the run-up to the general election. Order levels had since improved and a contract to supply the Royal Mail with ink-jet machines starts in July. Elsewhere in Europe, the growth pattern had generally been very positive. Business in Germany, France, Spain and Italy continued to be encouraging in spite of reduced legislation-driven demand. US sales grew by 23 per cent, mainly from further commercial printing installations. The range of JetArray Elan and JetAddress printers had sold well, with one customer placing a Dollars 2.3m (Pounds 1.2m) contract for delivery of 37 JetArrays before September of this year. So far a limited part of last September's Pounds 15.5m rights issue has been applied to the development of the German business and setting up support offices in Singapore and Dubai. The group had also examined a number of acquisition opportunities, but none had proved sufficiently attractive. Mr Gerald Dennis, chairman, said: 'The growth achieved in the first half is continuing into the second half. The order book is very strong and both assembly plants are working extra hours.' Interest income was Pounds 876,000 compared with a payment of Pounds 19,000 last time. Earnings per share rose to 11.46p (10.58p). The interim dividend is lifted by 14 per cent to 2.4p (2.1p).</p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: Nervousness over Mexican election - The Emerging Investor With less than six weeks before Mexico's presidential election, investors in the country's stock and money markets are uneasy. The governing party may be the clear favourite to win, but many fund managers seem unwilling to commit money to the market before knowing the result. While equities have recovered a little this month, they were down nearly 9 per cent in June and, over the year, the principal index has lost 19 per cent in dollar terms. In recent weeks volume has been unusually low, and several large and arguably ill-timed equity offerings have had to be postponed or priced at heavy discounts, casting a further cloud over the market. The exchange rate has come under renewed pressure, with the peso trading at 3.40 to the dollar, its upper limit. One Mexican money manager reckons that some Dollars 100m a day is leaving the country because of election fears. The weakness of the peso has caused short-term interest rates to edge up to 16.5 per cent, back to the level of early June. 'People are staying on the sidelines' says Mr Stefano Natella of CS First Boston. 'They do not want to buy ahead of an election when there is some uncertainty over what will happen.' The electoral doubt has coincided with the rise of US interest rates and poor performance on Wall Street, both of which have helped pull the Mexican bolsa further down. Foreign investors account for the greater part of trading in Mexican securities, making the stock market particularly vulnerable to jitters in the US. 'The US situation is the ultimate cause of a lot of the volatility', says Mr Geoffrey Dennis of Bear Stearns. Higher US interest rates have added to the pressure on the peso, and along with the election uncertainty, explain the rise in domestic rates. While the opposition has only an outside chance of winning the presidency, the election is certainly closer than many had expected. After winning Mexico's first ever television debate in May, Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the centre-right National Action Party closed the gap in opinion polls with Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the ruling party candidate, although recently his support has slipped again. While Mr Fernandez generally supports the pro-market economic policies of the current administration, he and his party have no experience of government, and there is tremendous uncertainty about how he would manage the country in the event that he won the election. After 65 years of continuous rule of the PRI, the handover of power to another party would not be easy. Even if, as likely, the PRI wins, any indications of electoral fraud or voting irregularities could provoke a wave of electoral protests from the opposition that might cause a serious political crisis. The 1988 presidential election was marred by widespread reports of fraud, with Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, then as now the principal candidate of the left, claiming there had been a coup d'etat by the ruling party. With the political system already reeling from the Zapatista revolt in Chiapas at the New Year, and the March assassination of the PRI's presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party's ability to withstand such protests is much reduced. Says one PRI official: 'We have little margin for manoeuvre. Our victory will have to be credible or there will be difficulties.' The awkward domestic and international environment and the related increase in interest rates has squeezed economic growth this year. In the first quarter, the economy barely grew compared to the same period last year, and the consensus forecast of growth for the year is about 2 per cent. Last year the economy expanded by just 0.4 per cent. The low growth and weak exchange rate, which has forced Mexican companies to report large losses on their foreign debt holdings, has led to a sharp decline in the forecast earnings growth of Mexico's leading companies. Baring Securities has recently reduced its estimate of the average real growth in earnings per share for Mexico's largest 36 companies from 20 per cent to 13 per cent. If the political uncertainty continues some analysts expect that the government will have to devalue the currency. In spite of the low economic growth, Grupo Moneda, a financial research house in Mexico City, reckons that the current account deficit will reach Dollars 25.6bn this year, or 7 per cent of GDP. Even with real interest at close to 10 per cent, capital inflows are unlikely to cover such a large deficit, forcing the central bank to run down its reserves. 'There is a huge overvaluation of the peso' says Mr Rudiger Dornbusch, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 'It is crazy to postpone the day because of concerns of the foreign debts of Mexican companies. The state of siege will only go away when the peso is devalued.' Mr Dornbusch says that a 20 per cent devaluation would be sufficient to allow a cut in interest rates, and a resumption of growth. In spite of such warnings, many analysts are advising their clients to buy on the grounds that most of the bad news has been discounted by the market already and that, after the election, the situation will improve. Mexico's stock market is currently trading at about 13.8 times this year's earnings, and 11.1 times 1995 earnings, according to Baring Securities, making it exceptionally cheap by historical and international standards. 'If you believe that Mr Zedillo is going to win, and that the situation will return to normal after the elections then the market looks very attractive' says one Mexican money manager; 'but after what has happened this year, investors are not taking anything for granted.'  ------------------------------------------------------------------- TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -------------------------------------------------------------------                                       8/7/94                                       dollars   Week on week change Stock                       Country   close      dollars     %  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Brisa                        Turkey   0.1542     0.0454    41.70 Banco do Brasil (Pfd)        Brazil   0.0234     0.0063    36.81 Petrobras (Pfd)              Brazil   0.1251     0.0298    31.27 Light Servicos De Eletricade Brazil   0.2828     0.0660    30.47 Cukurova Elektrik            Turkey   0.3453     0.0701    25.46 Banco Itau (Pfd)             Brazil   0.2121     0.0412    24.09 Companhia Cervejaria Brahma  Brazil   0.2719     0.0519    23.59 Ege Biracilik                Turkey   2.7301     0.4901    21.88 United Microelectronics      Taiwan   4.4894     0.7756    20.89 Goodyear Tyres               Turkey   0.3935     0.0655    19.95  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source:  Baring Securities  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

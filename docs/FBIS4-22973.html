A.

This article describes an algorithm to  automatically trace contours directly from a differentiated  image. This algorithm was developed to obtain information on the  dimensions of spheroidal objects from half-tone images. A test  image is proposed to study this algorithm. An example of contour  tracing of an object on an X-ray image is presented. The  differentiation process is described. Contour tracing begins  with the operator indicating a contour point or a point in  direct proximity to a contour. Subsequent points are found  automatically as the algorithm analyzes the vicinity around the  point. Backtracking along the contour is eliminated. The radius  of examination can be tuned. The least squares method is used to  check how closely the algorithm has succeeded in tracing the  contour. It is found that the algorithm may be used for  relatively simple X-ray images. The lines of tracks and  oscillograms can be traced directly from the initial images.  Figure 1; table 1; references 2 (Russian).</p>

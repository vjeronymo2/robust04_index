			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 30 Mar -- The situation in the defense  industry sectors remains extremely serious. This was confirmed  by the participants in a conference here today of leaders of  Russian defense enterprises.    The avalanche-like nature of conversion and the reduction in  state orders and state budget funding are the main reasons for  the sharp slump in production. According to Viktor Glukhikh,  chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for the  Defense Branches of Industry [Goskomoboronprom], production has  slumped over the past three years by 78 percent.    The committee's action plan for the coming two years is  intended to help rectify the situation in these sectors that  possess a high scientific-technical potential, modern  technologies, and a powerful manufacturing base. The plan was  brought to the attention of the enterprise leaders. It is a  document of almost 90 pages, which deals with practically all  spheres of the defense industry and envisages the development of  six major programs in the industry and their handover for  government consideration. It also contains recommendations on  improving the legislative base.    The enterprises should themselves also seek a way out of the  complex situation more energetically, Viktor Glukhikh thinks.  There are considerable prospects in this area, in his view,  linked with the development of programs for defense industry  enterprises that take deeper account of the interests of regions.    Those taking part in the conference said that priority  measures should include increasing the preliminary payment for  state orders from 20 to 75 percent, the financing of new  developments, and the length of state order periods from one  year to five years.</p>

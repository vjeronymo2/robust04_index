			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolle Ivesi article: "Gjader Military Airport May Become </F> a Base for CIA Spy Planes"]    [Text] It has now been decided. Two CIA spy planes, a  radio station, and 12 experts will shortly arrive in Albania.  We make it clear that this equipment and these experts belong  to the U.S. secret service and not the U.S. Defense Department.    We have nothing against this idea of Defense Minister Safet  Zhulali, or maybe of Berisha, except that the fact that the U.S.  secret service is poking its nose in here, and not, as would be  more acceptable, the U.S. Defense Department or NATO, makes one  suspect the purpose of this "operation." It is the same as if  the Albanian National Intelligence Service, i.e. Gazidede, were  to establish such a base in the United States. Even more  disturbing is the fact that Italian Defense Minister Fabio Fabri  himself opposed the establishment of this base at an Italian  airport, because it would pose serious problems for Italy if the  spread of the war in Bosnia were to lead Serbia to respond with  missiles against the site where CIA-commanded GNAT spy planes  were based. Italy, although a NATO member, therefore did not  agree, while we did immediately. The Albanian authorities have  made no statement about the siting of these planes. The problem  of their deployment is worrying, because, as foreign news  agencies report, these spy planes, if they explode in the air or  have defects, are very dangerous for the civilian population of  the areas where they are based. If the Defense Ministry is soon  going to position them, as is thought, at the airport at Gjader  near Lezhe, will it ask the local government representatives of  these areas, when these aircraft are known to be dangerous to  the lives of local inhabitants?!</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / DTI may widen export project The Department of Trade and Industry may expand the 'export promoters' initiative which recruits private-sector executives to the DTI to help companies win business in world markets. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday that the DTI had reached its initial target of 100 private-sector secondees and he was looking at proposals to seek a second wave of recruits. Mr Heseltine said the scheme, started 18 months ago and intended to raise UK sales in 80 of the world's most important markets, was starting to 'run into constraints'. He believed the only option was to increase the scale of the operation. Recruits are seconded for two years and continue to be paid by their employers. The DTI initiative, regarded by Mr Heseltine as an important element in his department's efforts to forge a working partnership with industry, has involved more than 8,000 UK companies. He said the scheme had provided tangible results in helping companies to find new markets and to finalise contracts. Mr Heseltine added: 'The promoters are forging closer ties between government and the private sector, making business more aware of the help available from government and enabling us to discover what it requires in return.' He said it was impossible to quantify the benefit to the balance of trade but he believed it could help to reduce the deficit significantly. The initiative offered 'open-ended benefits' to UK trade which the government was determined to exploit. The DTI said yesterday that, in addition to the export promoters scheme, it planned to enlist a further 70 private-sector recruits to its nationwide chain of Business Link centres. They will provide access for local exporting businesses to the export promotion resources of the DTI and the Foreign Office.</p>

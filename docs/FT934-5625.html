			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / World Bond Markets: FRN sector is fashionable again - International The floating-rate note (FRN) market, which has enjoyed a spectacular recovery over the last two years, is expected to continue to flourish in 1994, especially if forecasts of a rise in US interest rates come true. Volume of Eurodollar FRN new issues has risen to Dollars 43bn so far this year from Dollars 25.4bn in the whole of last year. This compares with just Dollars 4bn in 1991, when the market was still suffering from the after-affects of a crisis in the perpetual FRN sector in the late 1980s. The crisis, and the subsequent sell-off, severely dented investor confidence in the FRN market and caused liquidity to dry up. In addition, the start of the bull run in the US Treasury market gave investors another reason to continue to avoid the market. However, sentiment towards the FRN market has improved substantially over the past year. Syndicate managers say that one of the main factors has been a fall in swap spreads against US Treasuries over the past year. This has limited the number of arbitrage opportunities. As a result, it has often been difficult for borrowers to issue in the fixed-rate market and swap the proceeds into a floating rate below the London interbank offered rate (Libor). Therefore, an increasing number of borrowers has returned to the FRN market, where attractive funding rates are available. At the same time, there has been a rise in demand for FRNs from institutional and retail investors. Both categories of investor have been attracted by the yield spread over Libor which the notes offer. Banks hungry for assets have been keen buyers of FRNs, while FRNs issued by sovereign borrowers have been bought by central banks. In addition, the low interest rate environment has increased the attraction of FRNs in the eyes of retail investors wanting to preserve their income. Syndicate managers say if US rates do rise next year, as many economists predict, the investment appeal of FRNs should increase. This in turn should enable the market's liquidity to continue to improve. The defensive nature of the notes should provide investors with a greater degree of capital protection than fixed-rate bonds, when interest rates are rising. Since the coupon on the notes is linked to Libor and is re-set every three months, the coupon will rise in line with yields in the market. The strong investor demand has contributed to the improvement in the spreads which borrowers have to pay over Libor. It has also enabled the notes to perform well in the secondary market. For example, the spread over Libor on Italy's Dollars 2bn offering of five-year FRNs has tightened to around 19 basis points from just over 30 basis points at the launch in June. As well as Italy, Sweden and Denmark have raised relatively large amounts in the FRN market this year. Syndicate managers say the return of sovereign borrowers has helped to restore credibility to the market. 'The jumbo issues of this year show that sovereign borrowers are now able to get decent sub-Libor funding in decent size,' says Mr Tim Skeet, senior vice-president on the syndicate desk at Kidder Peabody, one of the leading players in the FRN market. Syndicate managers believe that spreads will continue to tighten over the next year, and that sovereign borrowers should be able to raise funds below Libor minus  1/8 , the benchmark established by Denmark in August when it raised Dollars 1bn through an offering of four-year FRNs. The only potential problem looming over the market is a lack of fee discipline among the investment banks, especially those who are keen to pick up market share now that FRNs have become fashionable again. 'The market is definitely back, but not to the extent that Commerzbank can sell notes at Libor plus one basis point,' says one FRN specialist at an American bank.</p>

Moscow's Peacekeeping Efforts: Useless Fuss"]    [Text] The resumption of fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh late  last week once again brought to naught Russia's peacekeeping  efforts. Neither did the participants in the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly manage to make their contribution to  the normalization of the situation, as they failed to persuade  Azerbaijan's representatives to soften their demands on the  withdrawal of the Armenian troops as a necessary condition for  the resumption of dialogue with the Armenians. As for Geydar  Aliyev's statements made on national television on Sunday, they  generally put in doubt chances for the sides' reconciliation.    Having termed the combat operations by the Azerbaijan Army  as  just and liberating, Aliyev actually called upon his fellow  countrymen for war till victory -- until "Armenia's troops of  occupation leave all the occupied lands." Diplomatic efforts,  including those of Moscow, in his opinion, should be aimed at  achieving this goal.    The main points of Aliyev's Sunday address were repeated  later in the day, in his own interpretation, by Ara Saakyan,  first deputy chairman of the Armenian parliament. He stressed  that normalization was possible only if fighting stops and  Karabakh's legal status is determined. Without this, in his  opinion, it is senseless to speak about any separation of the  opposing sides. Saakyan simultaneously stated Yerevan's  intention to turn for help in the settlement of the conflict to  states of Europe and the United States, which attests to the  fact that the idea of internationalizing the conflict is  increasingly gaining popularity in the capitals of the opposing  sides.</p>

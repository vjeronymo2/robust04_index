			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["r.r." report: "Segni: Never Any Alliance With Italian </F> Social Movement; Fini: Popular Party a Carbon Copy of Occhetto"]    [Text] Rome -- [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni  confirmed and stressed that the Pact (together with the Popular  Party [PPI]) does not intend to form alliances with the PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left], the League, or Forza Italia,  "still less" with the MSI [Italian Social Movement]. According  to the Pact leader, "it is possible that after the elections  these forces will fall apart and that a stronger and more united  center will thus have a greater ability to attract centrists  from either side." Segni stressed that he does not intend to  maintain "political relations" with [PDS Secretary] Occhetto  ("we will never join a government with the PDS, unless it is an  institutional government") or with the right-wing front.    He received a polemical response from National Alliance  coordinator Gianfranco Fini in Gorizia: "Center voters must  realize that by voting for the PPI, they are voting for a carbon  copy of Occhetto's party."    But Segni went further than that, accusing [Forza Italia  leader] Berlusconi on the one hand and the PDS on the other of  maintaining a similar stance with regard to their  conflict-ridden relations with the judiciary. Segni, speaking  at a public rally with [Italian Republican Party Secretary]  Giorgio La Malfa, cited the statement submitted by Silvio  Berlusconi to the head of state to criticize the action of the  Milan judges, describing it as "a serious matter, a very serious  matter." He added: "Occhetto used to praise the judges when  they arrested his adversaries. The moment he is affected in  some way, he starts attacking them. Berlusconi, however,  started right away. You have to decide: Either you respect the  judiciary or you do not. We do respect them, and we act in such  a way as to enable them to do their job freely." This elicited  an immediate response from PDS headquarters: "Segni, that soul  in torment, has decided to step into old Forlani's shoes. But  apart from being a diehard Forlani-like man, he is also a liar.  And you cannot build anything on lies."    "If Berlusconi feels that he is under attack, he can respond  however he likes," Giorgio La Malfa commented, "but he must  realize that these are the pains of political life. Perhaps,  being a businessman, he is not accustomed to this kind of  atmosphere."    Mino Martinazzoli reaffirmed his fear that "some coarse  victor may imagine that the issue of the power of the judiciary  can be resolved by reducing their autonomy and independence."    The Popular Party secretary stressed: "When the hunt for  Christian Democrats began, everything was fine, because the  judicial instrument was being used in the political struggle.  We never indulged in insults and invective, so we are entitled  to express amusement at the fact that certain other people start  shouting the moment any initiative impinges on their territiry."</p>

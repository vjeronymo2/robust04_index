			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: NEW LINE BUCKS THE SUMMER ODDS  </P> <P> New Line Cinema, the little studio that proved it could -- by unleashing  "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" -- will attempt to make another splash this  summer amid the waves of big-budget studio pictures with their mega-marketing  campaigns.  </P> <P> New Line's three summer entries:  </P> <P> * "Metropolitan," the social comedy from new director Whit Stillman, about a  group of upper-crust Manhattan debutantes and their dates.  </P> <P> The New York Times' Vincent Canby dubbed it the "unequivocal hit" of the  Sundance U.S. Film Festival. "We'll definitely be using reviews to find our  audiences, who'll be yuppies who want something different than crash-bang  movies," says marketing president Sandra Ruch.  </P> <P> * "Chicago Joe and the Showgirl," a period drama about the "Bonnie and  Clyde"-type adventures of an American GI and a British showgirl, starring  Kiefer Sutherland and Emily Lloyd. New Line looks forward to following  Columbia's "Flatliners" and Fox's "Young Guns II" -- both of which co-star  Sutherland. "If they're successful," says Ruch, "audiences will want to see  more of Kiefer."  </P> <P> * "Pump Up the Volume," stars Christian Slater as a high schooler who starts a  pirate radio station. The company's widest release, it will open in 800  theaters in late summer. New Line is working with teen magazines to help  capture the targeted audience of 15- to 18-year-olds, with heartthrob Slater  doing some interviews. There are also plans to exploit the film's pirate radio  theme with radio station promotions. New Line is up against major competition  and odds, but isn't worried. Says Ruch, "They don't call our company lean and  green for nothing!" Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

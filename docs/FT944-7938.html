			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Black ink leaves Canadian banks red-faced - Profits at the 'Big Six' are likely to be almost too good this year Even the most inhibited public company can usually be relied on to trumpet record earnings. Not Canada's 'Big Six' banks, which today start their annual reporting season for the fiscal year to October 31. Several of the banks are expected to announce the highest profits in their history. Royal Bank of Canada, the biggest, is almost certain to become the first Canadian financial institution to post annual earnings of more than CDollars 1bn (USDollars 730m). Yet the banks want to make their performance seem as unexceptional as possible. In an internal memo, Royal Bank suggests that its public relations department should encourage the media to 'look beyond the total dollar amount and use standard financial measures of profitability like return on assets, return on equity and return on business to realise our profits are very reasonable'. According to Mr Peter Godsoe, Bank of Nova Scotia's chief executive: 'If there is a problem, it's probably that things look too good.' The banks' sensitivity is understandable. Often portrayed as corporate fat cats, the Big Six have not merely improved their financial performance over the past two years, but have tightened their grip on Canada's financial services industry. Deregulation in 1987 opened the door for each of the banks to buy an interest in a large securities dealer. Mr Alan Hibben, analyst at Richardson Greenshields in Toronto, estimates that securities subsidiaries contributed 9.7 per cent of total bank profits in the second quarter of fiscal 1994, and about 5.4 per cent in the third quarter. The banks have also become powerful forces in the mutual-fund industry. Royal Bank is Canada's second-biggest mutual-funds distributor. Although they took heavy write-downs during the 1990-92 recession, the bigger problems suffered by other institutions have given the banks an opportunity to spread their wings. They picked up the pieces of the imploding trust and loan industry, which was unable to withstand the slump in the North American real estate market. Most recently, several banks have begun to move into insurance after the collapse of Confederation Life, Canada's fifth-biggest life insurance company, offered a cheap entry into the sector. Business conditions have improved dramatically in the past 18 months. In contrast to the difficult days of 1990-92, the banks now have the wind behind them. 'The economy is doing well, inflation is low, companies are producing profits which reduce loan-losses, and retail borrowings have been relatively strong,' Mr Godsoe says. 'Banking across the board in Canada is a pretty good business right now.' The banks are also benefiting from closer attention to costs. Royal Bank, for instance, cut its payroll by 7 per cent and closed 132 branches and other offices in the first nine months of 1994. The outlook for the year ahead is more of the same. Canada's economy is set to grow by about 3.5 per cent, and loan-loss provisions charged against income will almost certainly be lower in 1995 than in 1994. Although real estate remains a headache, most of the banks' other problems - notably the forest-products industry - are receding. Mr Hibben estimates that Bank of Nova Scotia will more than double earnings to CDollars 3.60 a share in fiscal 1995. He expects that Bank of Montreal, which will be first out of the blocks today with its 1994 earnings report, will lift earnings per share to CDollars 3.25 from CDollars 2.82. There is one wrinkle in these rosy forecasts, however. The loosening of ownership barriers and other regulatory curbs is gradually eroding the monolithic facade of the Canadian banking industry. Instead of marching in lockstep, as they tended to do in the past, the banks are each carving out a character of their own. Royal has put the emphasis on personal financial services, mainly through its purchase last year of foundering Royal Trust, the second-biggest trust company. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) has made the most energetic moves away from traditional lending to investment banking. Through a fast-expanding presence in New York, CIBC is aiming to join the top league of players in international derivatives markets. Bank of Montreal is the only Canadian bank with a strong full-service presence in the US, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Harris Bankcorp of Chicago. BoM aims to expand its mid-West base to the point where half its total earnings come from the US. Last month, it became the first Canadian bank to list on the New York stock exchange. Alone among the Canadian banks, Bank of Nova Scotia sees a future in the emerging markets of Latin America and Asia. Through acquisitions and joint ventures, it has secured footholds in the Philippines, Chile, Mexico, Malaysia and, most recently, Argentina and India. As these divergent strategies take hold over time, the individual banks' performance may vary more widely. Some may even have cause to celebrate their achievements without a red face.</p>

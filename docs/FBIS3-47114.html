			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Commenting on the allegation that Thailand is  supporting the Khmer Rouge in the fighting between the Cambodian  Government and the Khmer Rouge faction, Foreign Minister  Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri said this comment was made by  people who are ignorant of the facts and that it is not  constructive. He said Thailand has not supported the Khmer  Rouge since the peace agreement was signed in Paris.    [Begin Prasong recording, in progress] ...not supporting any  party. Our support for the tripartite faction was suspended  when the peace agreement was signed in Paris. Those people at  the local level in Cambodia who are responsible for such  allegations should think about making more constructive  comments. Thailand wants to see reconciliation among the  Cambodian people so that national reconstruction can be  achieved. Comments that are not constructive only cause  misunderstanding. [end recording]    Touching on the Thai prime minister's upcoming visit to  Cambodia, the foreign minister said they would discuss  Thai-Cambodian relations with the Cambodian leaders.    Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan, meanwhile, granted  an interview to reporters concerning the call made by Prince  Norodom Sirivut, Cambodian deputy prime minister and foreign  minister, for Thailand to clarify with Cambodia its position  regarding the Khmer Rouge during the Thai prime minister's  upcoming visit to Cambodia on Wednesday. Minister Surin said he  did not think Thailand would make any clarifications, because  the matter is over and Thailand's position is clear. Concerning  the weapons arsenal, the deputy foreign minister admitted that  Cambodia wanted the weapons left over in Thailand, but this is  not the Thai Government's policy.    [Begin Surin recording, in progress] ...support from  outside.  Whatever happened inside Cambodia, we never interfered. We  support and recognize only one government; that is, the elected  government in Phnom Penh. Concerning the leakage of weapons,  this could happen. But we will try to correct the situation.  The Thai Government has a clear position and has never deviated  from that policy. You can be sure of that. And I believe the  world in general has a correct understanding of that issue.

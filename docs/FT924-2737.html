			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Building faith in EC anti-trust system - Competition policy reform IN THE anguished debate over subsidiarity, few EC officials tread a more delicate line than Sir Leon Brittan. As competition commissioner, he has a pivotal role in policing the single market. Yet the job's far-reaching legal powers also make it a natural target for those who accuse Brussels of unwarranted intervention in EC member states' affairs. This week, Sir Leon attempted to strike a fresh balance by seeking more authority in one area while offering concessions to critics in others. Whether or not he remains in his current job beyond the end of this year, his proposed reforms appear intended as a blueprint for the future evolution of EC competition policy. Sir Leon wants to expand the Commission's authority over mergers to cover smaller deals. That would require approval by member governments, which will review the workings of the two-year-old EC merger regulation next year. At the same time, he promised to devolve to national authorities more responsibility for handling EC competition cases, and to accelerate Brussels' notoriously long-winded procedures for dealing with anti-trust cases which fall outside the merger regulation. In theory, this last proposal could have substantial and immediate consequences for European business. It also represents Sir Leon's most concrete response yet to arguments that the Commission's methods are too slow and opaque, and that its responsibilities should be transferred to an independent EC competition body. Commission investigations into cartels, illegal pricing agreements and other monopolies cases rarely take less than 18 months, and often much longer. Furthermore, many companies which voluntarily seek Brussels' opinion on the legality of business arrangements never receive a reply. 'Accelerated procedures are desperately needed,' says Mr Richard Coles, solicitor at ICI, the UK industrial group, which waited several years in the 1980s for the Commission to clear a joint PVC venture with Enichem of Italy. It is the Commission's efficient handling of cases under the merger regulation that has prompted increased complaints about its shortcomings in other areas of competition policy. The regulation is administered by a special task force, which must say whether it objects to a deal within a month after it is notified. If it does, it then has a further four months to make an in-depth investigation. Sir Leon now proposes to extend this 'two-stage' deadline system to the rest of the EC competition directorate's work. The new regime will start on January 1 for joint venture inquiries and on April 1 for all other types of case. But will the roughly 100 Commission anti-trust experts who will be charged with making the new system work be able - or willing - to deliver? Some outside experts say they detect evidence of bureaucratic resistance within the competition directorate. In any case, the new deadlines, unlike those imposed by the merger regulation, have no statutory force. Sir Leon says that to make them legally binding would require extra cash and personnel which, he admits, EC governments are in no mood to provide. Some lawyers in Brussels also believe the deadlines may increase still further the competition directorate's workload by encouraging more companies to submit pro-posed business agreements for anti-trust clearance. Nonetheless, senior competition officials are cautiously optimistic about their ability to cope though, as one admits, the new regime is 'more like an indication of best endeavours'. They point out that, in practice, a certain amount of flexibility will be built into the system. For instance, the clock will only start ticking once companies have supplied all the information needed to start a preliminary investigation. Some legal experts, while applauding Sir Leon's initiative, are openly sceptical about how much will change in practice. Mr Christopher Bright of City solicitors Linklaters &amp; Paines also argues that the reforms do not address a more fundamental concern about the Commission's methods. This arises from the discrepancy between the pragmatic and reasoned approach to cases taken so far by the merger task force and the more doctrinaire attitude displayed by other parts of the competition directorate. Others, however, argue that Sir Leon has put Brussels' moral authority over competition policy on the line by setting out to satisfy critics that it is capable of exercising its powers fairly and efficiently. If the Commission fails to live up to that self-imposed challenge, it risks fuelling demands that it either cede some of its jealously-guarded prerogatives to national authorities, or be compelled to transfer them to an independent cartel office.</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / International Company News: Saffa chairman hits out at 'unreliable' KIO managers THE Kuwait Investment Office's most important foreign partner in Spain has accused the KIO management of being 'unreliable' and 'more interested in their own internal quarrels than running their companies'. Mr Carlo Bonomi, chairman of Saffa, the Italian industrial group which took minority stakes in two KIO subsidiaries in Spain in early 1991, warned that losses on the holdings could wipe out his company's profits this year. Saffa, Europe's second-biggest producer of cardboard for packaging, became involved with the KIO following a complex deal in which it sold its paper interests to the Kuwaitis in return for a Spanish cardboard mill, cash and minority stakes in two KIO subsidiaries. The shares in these two groups - Prima Immobiliaria, a property group, and Ebro, a leading Spanish foods concern - have fallen steeply. Failing a recovery before year-end, Saffa faces a significant write-down on the value of its holdings, Mr Bonomi warned. Saffa owns around 6 per cent of Prima and 5 per cent of Ebro, making it the biggest shareholder after the KIO in both cases. The Kuwaitis control more than 70 per cent of Prima and around 42 per cent of Ebro. 'Prima's shares have plunged to around Pta600 (Dollars 5.55) now from Pta7,600 when we came in, while Ebro has fallen to Pta1,000 from Pta3,200,' Mr Bonomi said. The collapse in Prima's shares stems from the withdrawal of Kuwaiti support for various development projects currently under way, according to Mr Bonomi. 'The assets are good, but development costs are high,' he said. Mr Bonomi said Saffa had approached the KIO with a proposal to buy out its stake in Ebro but it had received 'no clear answer'. Attempts to group together with other minority shareholders in order to put pressure on the KIO were complicated by the fact that shares in both Prima and Ebro were widely dispersed, with few big institutional investors, he said. 'The new management at KIO seem more interested in fighting with the old management,' Mr Bonomi said. The new KIO leadership, which has frequently accused its predecessors of mishandling a Dollars 3bn investment programme in Spain, was not available for comment yesterday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 24 (CNS)--The levying of  value-added tax on land is not something new in China as there  have been precedents at home and even in Hong Kong, Taiwan and  foreign countries, the former director of the State Land  Administration Mr. Wang Xianjin said today. He noted that such  tax was regarded as a necessity in the regulation of the real  estate market because it could effectively curb land speculation  and unreasonable profits, a move playing a guiding role in the  placing of investment.    Promulgation of the provisional ordinance on value-added tax  on land, according to Mr. Wang, received a strong reaction from  the real estate sectors at home and in Hong Kong and Taiwan as  well as overseas with many saying that the taxation rate was too  high. Mr. Wang said that some of the opinions expressed were  worth taking notice of by the authorities when working out  details on the value-added tax on land.    Mr. Wang said he believed that a price rise and investment  risk should be taken into account when calculating the added  value, a common practice employed in Hong Kong, Taiwan and  overseas. It is, however, yet to be decided what weight the  risk factor should be given.    Preferential treatment should be given to some transactions  involving the transfer of real estate, especially housing units  approved by the government for their construction and sold at a  price set by the government. Such housing should be exempted  from the value-added tax. The tax should be cut by the half for  sales of real estate resulting from planning by the government  while sales of residential units should be subject to the  value-added tax on land. Tax refunds are, however, possible for  sellers of housing who buy another flat for their own use within  a specific time. Real estate donated to the government or to  charitable groups should be exempted from the value-added tax.  Donated real estate should be turned over to the government in  cases of disbandment of a particular charitable group which had  received the donation. Transfer of land without any development  following its sale should be subject to the value-added tax and  such cases should also be dealt with in accordance with law.    Mr. Wang said that the regulation set earlier on real estate  developers that they must undertake construction of welfare  housing which must make up 20 percent of their total volume of  their real estate development should be rescinded because such  practice was not in line with the market mechanism.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / International Company News: HK paper waits for sale details HONG KONG'S stock market regulators blocked resumption in trading of South China Morning Post shares until the company clarifies the state of negotiations for the sale of News Corporation's 50 per cent stake, writes Simon Davies in Hong Kong. SCMP's company secretary, Daniel Doo, said: 'In light of the rumours that have appeared since the suspension of trading, it is considered appropriate to continue the suspension until a definitive statement can be made.' It is expected that the sale of the stake to a consortium led by Robert Kuok will be announced this week.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Canada's election landslide THE 'first-past-the-post' electoral system can produce bizarre results when more than two parties get significant shares of the vote, especially if some of them have supporters scattered throughout the country while others have solid regional strongholds. Witness the fate of the Progressive Conservative party, which until yesterday formed the government of Canada but now finds itself reduced to a mere two seats in the House of Commons. Unquestionably, the Conservatives would have lost the election under any system. Yet they actually won a larger share of the total vote than the Bloc Quebecois, which with 54 seats will now form the official opposition, and about the same share as the Reform party which won 53 seats, almost all in the western provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. It would therefore be wrong to take the apparent annihilation of the Tories at face value, or to assume that it will be permanent. They retain control of two provincial governments and half the seats in the upper house. They remain the natural political home of Canada's business elite, and the only party which can credibly present itself as a nationwide alternative. Ms Kim Campbell, the outgoing prime minister, who lost her own seat, cannot escape responsibility for her party's debacle. No doubt the main factor was Canada's floundering economy, with unemployment at 11.2 per cent. But Ms Campbell succeeded by an inept campaign in turning defeat into headlong rout. Since one of her main blunders was to warn that unemployment would stay high until the end of the century, the sad lesson is that democracies do not reward leaders who tell them unpalatable truths. Familiar dilemma The incoming Liberals present themselves as economic 'pragmatists' somewhat in the Clinton mould. Mr Chretien is pledged to create jobs by pumping money into the economy, but his room for manoeuvre is limited by the markets. The federal deficit is already large, and if the new government risks increasing it by any significant fiscal stimulus it will either have to increase interest rates or let the dollar slide. It is a familiar dilemma, which will probably make for less spectacular changes in economic policy than electoral rhetoric suggested. Similarly, not too much should be made of the danger to the North American Free Trade Agreement. There is a strong free-trade wing within the Liberal party, which would not be happy if Mr Chretien risked scuppering the treaty with unrealistic demands for renegotiation. He will no doubt ask for 'clarification' on certain issues such as anti-dumping and dispute resolution. Perhaps he will even take a leaf out of Mr Clinton's book and ask for one or two symbolic 'side agreements'. But the fate of the treaty as a whole will be decided not in Canada but in the US Congress. Firmly committed Most interest will focus on the constitutional consequences of Monday's vote. It is certainly not an outright victory for separatism. The Liberal party, which won seats in all 10 provinces, is if anything even more firmly committed to the federation than were the Conservatives; and the victory of Mr Lucien Bouchard's Bloc Quebecois (BQ) in Quebec should be seen as an expression of protest rather than a settled determination to secede. More ominous, perhaps, is the victory of the Reform party in the west, reflecting in part a mood of exasperation with Quebec's insistence on special treatment. The Liberals may feel they have to cater for this mood by a more rigid federalism, which in turn would provide the BQ with new grievances to play on. Mr Bouchard could yet be propelled into independence on a wave of English-speaking impatience. All in all the result reflects the worldwide reassertion of national or communal identities in the face of globalising economic and cultural trends. The Liberal victory is in part an expression of Canadian nationalism, faced with the economic dominance of the US, while the BQ represents a French-speaking particularism that would rather deal directly with Washington or New York than have to work through Ottawa. European spectators should feel at home.</p>

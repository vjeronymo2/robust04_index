			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Republican Party Secretary Giorgio </F> La Malfa by Edoardo Segantini; place and date not given:  "Government Adrift Without the Center" -- first two paragraphs  are L'INDIPENDENTE introduction]    [Text] Rome -- Thanks partly to people such as his father,  Ugo La Malfa, who in the fifties fought for the opening of the  frontiers against the left-wing opposition, Italy has not sunk  further into decline. Fortebraccio, the legendary L'UNITA  commentator, dubbed La Malfa senior "the Fernet [Branca, bitter  digestive drink] of Italian politics." A caustic, brilliant,  prophetic, impenitent, suspicious, and rather bothersome  nonconfessional -- more than a Fernet, rather a drop of  Angostura bitters that made the very indigestible cocktail of  the First Republic less impossible to drink. The old man led a  force that was numerically insignificant but of noble quality,  using his huge personal charisma.    Giorgio La Malfa resembles his father physically, but lacks  his stature. Recent judicial developments have damaged his  political image, without harming his personal image of  unquestionable honesty. His return from a year's exile, spent  partly in Rome and partly at his seaside house at Capalbio, was  not exactly a major event. His decision to transfer to the  center of Italian Popular Party [PPI] Secretary Martinazzoli and  [Pact for Italy leader] Segni split the Italian Republican Party  [PRI], which is now clinging to Occhetto's Democratic Party of  the Left [PDS], with the little party's "grands bourgeois," from  Visentini to Ayala, in the role of the progressive front's  elders.    [Segantini] You declared total war on your friends who sided  with the progressive forces. And now you find yourself alone at  the helm.    [La Malfa] I am not waging war on anyone. I merely asked the  national court of arbitration to rule on a matter of discipline.  A party's orientation is binding on everyone. When some  members, however authoritative, decide otherwise, the secretary  has no choice but to report a possible violation.    [Segantini] But how did this split come about?    [La Malfa] We proceeded from a shared analysis but reached  different conclusions. The starting point was anxiety over the  growth and danger of the right in Italy, which both I and  Visentini consider a very major threat. But although this is  our diagnosis, it does not make sense to force center political  forces to adopt a left-wing stance, casting them into the  embrace of the PDS, Communist Renewal, or the Rete.    [Segantini] In what way is the right dangerous, in view of  the fact that not even [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema is worried  about it? On the one hand, we have two forces citing  liberal-democratic values, albeit differently -- the Northern  League and Forza Italia. On the other hand, we have an alliance  -- i.e., [leader of the National Alliance and secretary of the  Italian Social Movement, MSI] Fini's -- that declares itself to  be closer to [French Rally for the Republic leader] Chirac than  to [French National Front leader] Le Pen. What does this mean?    [La Malfa] Of the three right-wing components, the one with  which I would like to succeed in conducting a dialogue is the  Northern League. Leaving aside his language, which I do not  like, I did establish political relations with [Northern League  Secretary] Bossi at a time when no one wanted to have anything  to do with him. And I have never changed my opinion -- that the  League represents a liberal protest in a country that very much  needs it. Both its appeal for decentralization and its appeal  for a protest against the tax system are legitimate and just  forms of protest against an excessively oppressive state.    [Segantini] What about the National Alliance?    [La Malfa] I have formed a negative assessment of it. It has  made no real revision of the past. Fini has merely said that  fascism is dead. But that coroner's report is not enough.    [Segantini] Unless I am mistaken, you do not seem equally  strict in putting Occhetto to the democratic test.    [La Malfa] That is different. Occhetto has behind him a  lengthy process of deliberation which began with [former  Communist Party leader] Berlinguer, the split that produced  Communist Renewal, and a clear verdict on the harm done by  communism in the Soviet Union. These assessments clearly  condemn the communist phenomenon...    [Segantini] But it would have been very difficult not to  express those assessments.    [La Malfa] Yes, yes, of course, and indeed that explains my  cautiousness in my relations with the left. But if I am  assessing democratic reliability, the PDS has no problems from  this viewpoint. The real trouble with the PDS is its doubtful  ability to govern a Western country in such a way as to  encourage the market forces.    [Segantini] But in the event of a victory by the right, do  you really think that the National Alliance will have a major  role to play?    [La Malfa] Well, this is the crucial issue in the election  debate. Both Occhetto and [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, but  above all Bossi, are giving us to understand that they had to  form electoral alliances with groups with which they disagree  politically, that is, the communists and fascists. They imply  that after the elections these latter forces will go into  opposition. My question is this: With whom will you form a  majority, the majority that would enable you to consign them to  the opposition?    [Segantini] And so?    [La Malfa] Both moderate components of the two alignments  presuppose the existence of a center; they need an interlocutor.  But unless there is a center, a third stance that will permit  the division of the two electoral alignments and the orientation  of the extremes in the opposition, Italy will have a Fini or  [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti government. So we risk  having as prime minister representatives of an old communist  tradition that would prompt an outflow of capital or a right  that would be dangerous because of domestic or international  consequences.    [Segantini] What is dangerous about Forza Italia? Are they  subversive, too?    [La Malfa] Berlusconi is the proof that everyone should deal  with their own business.    [Segantini] Let the voters decide...    [La Malfa] I am sure that his entry into politics will  increase Italy's problems rather than resolve them. This,  because the left- right polarization is a good thing, but only  if it does not cause the extremes to prevail.    [Segantini] But Forza Italia's proposals seem a long way  from  any kind of extremism.    [La Malfa] The fiscal part is demagogic, and the rest is  characterized by common sense. The problem is a political one:  If Berlusconi had formed his alliance with the League and  isolated the MSI on the right, that would indeed have made sense.    [Segantini] But if the center does emerge strong from the  elections, with whom will you ally?    [La Malfa] Look, with the first-past-the-post system, this  question cannot be answered. Under the new rules, the aim is to  achieve an absolute majority. If none of the groupings achieves  a majority, the president will probably establish a provisional  government with the task of completing the transformation of the  electoral mechanism.    [Segantini] That is, a short-lived government with an  institutional mission.    [La Malfa] It would, however, have a limitation -- the same  one that affected the Ciampi government. Namely, that a  government without a real majority cannot engage in politics.    [Segantini] Could you see [Senate speaker] Spadolini  performing such a task?    [La Malfa] I find it embarrassing to say so, since he is a  member of my party, but obviously I would be pleased.    [Segantini] Is it true that [Fiat President] Mr. Agnelli's  position influenced your decision to opt for the center?    [La Malfa] I have not met with Mr. Agnelli for several  months. Be that as it may, I hope that this political  orientation will be appreciated by the sector of the business  world that pays most attention to the other Western countries'  assessments of us.    [Segantini] What is your opinion of Italy's major  entrepreneurs?    [La Malfa] Italy's tragedy is that we have no major  industry.  This is because the Catholic world and the left, and sometimes  even the League, are opposed to big business; they regard it as  harmful in some way. Growing up in an unfavorable environment,  our industries have faced greater difficulties than their  foreign competitors.    [Segantini] Do you not think that the various Agnellis and  De  Benedettis have also made mistakes in the management of their  enterprises, despite the major aid received from the state?    [La Malfa] Well, if they have made mistakes, they are now  starting to pay for them too. Look at the Feruzzis: Their sad  fate is a punishment decreed by the market. And they are not  the only ones. Things have changed for Fiat too, with the  latest increase in capital, albeit rather neatly: The family's  influence has diminished in favor of that of the banks.    [Segantini] But you are now in danger of proving to be your  own party's liquidator.    [La Malfa] You have no idea of the efforts that I made to  persuade Visentini, Gualtieri, and Giovanni Ferrara not to break  our unity. But it was all in vain.    [Segantini] Are you not afraid of being sidelined by a  Martinazzoli-Occhetto axis?    [La Malfa] As I have already said, I believe that the next  legislature will be a brief one, devoted to completing the  electoral reform. After that there will be another election.  It is to be hoped that something will be done to make the  executive more stable, and I am in favor of the direct election  of the prime minister. In order to carry out these reforms, it  is likely that a government ranging from the League to the PDS  will be formed.</p>

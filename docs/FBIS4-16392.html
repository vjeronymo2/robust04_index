			<p>BFN     [Text] A special session of Saeima (Latvia's parliament) on  terms for the withdrawal of Russian troops, scheduled for April  15, will not take place. A decision to this effect was adopted  by the Saeima's presidium at a request from President Guntis  Ulmanis and Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs.    The decision notes that "there is no legal ground" for such  debate since a meeting between the presidents of the two  countries slated for April 20 has been put off indefinitely  after an incident with Yeltsin's ruling on a military base in  Latvia. The Latvian leadership insists that Yeltsin officially  revoke the document, which has been repudiated by Russian  foreign and defence ministry officials already.</p>

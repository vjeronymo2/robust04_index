			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan in Guangzhou] </F>   [Text] Senior officials in Guangdong yesterday expressed  concern that their battle against inflation might fail this  year. Speaking at a special session with about 30 delegates to  the Guangdong People's Political Consultative Conference at the  state Zhudao Guesthouse yesterday, Executive Vice-Governor Lu  Ruihua, admitted they faced a tough battle. Representatives  attending the annual conference session, however, still pressed  the senior leader to keep inflation down.    In his Government Work Report tabled at the Guangdong  People's Congress last week, Guangdong Governor Zhu Senlin said  the Government hoped to keep inflation within 12 percent this  year. Last year's inflation rate stood at 18.6 per cent.    Mr Zhu last year insisted that this year's target could be  achieved if strenuous efforts were made. But the Governor's  right hand man, Mr Lu, said the government was shorthanded to  keep prices down to that level. He told conference delegates  the government felt it was sandwiched between enterprises and  consumers in its fight against inflation. The Vice-Governor  said while some enterprises pressed the government to take a  hands-off approach, consumers wanted more aggressive measures.    The Government faced an awkward situation because it was  obliged to raise prices of farmers' harvests to protect their  interests but also had to keep prices of staple food at a  reasonable level. In addition, the Vice Governor admitted the  value-added tax introduced by Beijing had led to price hoarding  in some areas, further deepening the inflation crisis. But he  reiterated the Government would take every possible means to  ensure a stable market and keep the prices of vegetables, grain,  and oil down.    But Mr Lu's assurances apparently failed to satisfy some of  the representatives, who kept urging the Government to strike a  better deal with Beijing on fiscal arrangements. A Guangdong  Industrial and Commercial Bank representative said Guangdong  should forge one step ahead of other provinces in reforming the  banking sector. He feared that Guangdong might lose its  competitive edge because Beijing has indicated it will give  priority to key infrastructure projects and large state owned  enterprises in 1994.</p>

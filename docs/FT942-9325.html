			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Indonesian bank loan trial begins A former official of an Indonesian state bank went on trial yesterday in a massive loan scandal that has provoked a public outcry and student demonstrations questioning the role of senior officials in the case, AP reports from Jakarta. Mr Maman Suparman, 48, former manager of the Jakarta branch of the state-run Bank Pembangunan Indonesia, was charged with corruption and abuse of power. The loss to the state from an initial Dollars 430m (Pounds 287m) loan in 1991 to ethnic Chinese businessman Mr Eddy Tansil by the bank has swelled to Dollars 448.8m, including unpaid interest, the Central Jakarta Court was told. Newspapers put the amount as high as Dollars 650m. Mr Mohammed Yamin, state prosecutor, told the South Jakarta District Court the bank official received bribes of 256m rupiahs (Pounds 79,000) from Mr Tansil for helping to arrange the credit. He said Mr Suparman illegally converted a letter of credit submitted by Mr Tansil. Prosecutors have said the aim was to permit Mr Tansil to use the loan money without in fact buying machinery for which it was intended. If convicted, Mr Suparman would face between 20 years and life in prison. Mr Tansil, 40, went on trial separately last week. He is charged, among other things, with diverting part of the loan for his personal use. On Saturday, Mr Gani Djemat, who leads Mr Tansil's four-lawyer defence team, told the court that the charges should be dismissed and that the case should be treated under civil law, not criminal law. Mr Djemat acknowledged, however, that his client faces difficulties in repaying the loan. Thousands of students demonstrated in several large cities last month, demanding resignation of two senior officials over the loan case. Some called for interrogation of President Suharto's son, Mr Hutomo Mandalaputra.</p>

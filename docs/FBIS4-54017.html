			<p>BFN     [Text] Details of a report, prepared by a  telecommunications policy department of the Telecommunications  Council (chaired by Fumio Watanabe, adviser to Tokyo Marine and  Fire Insurance Co., Ltd.), an advisory panel to the posts and  telecommunications minister, were disclosed on 23 May. The  council has been studying how the government should build a  foundation for the information telecommunications system for a  multimedia era in the 21st century. The report says that an  optical fiber network, which can transmit a large amount of  information, should cover all offices and homes in the nation by  2010 and thereby create a social system adoptable to a  full-scale multimedia era. The report also proposes that the  government should aim at reforming people's lives and the  national economy for the 21st century. To do that, the report  sets three stages, proposing that the optical fiber network  should be created to cover metropolitan areas and prefectural  capitals by the year 2000, all cities with a population of  100,000 or more by 2005, and all cities in the nation by 2010.  Moreover, the report points out the need to utilize the private  sector's vital power as much as possible by allowing the project  to be carried out mainly by the private sector. The report will  be submitted to a general meeting of the council for  deliberation on 31 May. After that, it will be submitted to  Post and Telecommunications Minister Katsuyuki Hikasa.    The report comprises seven chapters. The first and second  chapters present a vision of upgraded communications based on  the optical fiber network serving as a key to solve pending  problems, including the aging of society and decentralization of  the population. Moreover, the report predicts that creation of  new multimedia-related businesses to serve the network would  produce a 123 trillion yen multimedia market and about 2.43  million jobs by 2010.    In the third chapter, which explains concrete plans for the  network construction, the report says a total of 33-53 trillion  yen would be needed to construct the optical fiber network. If  the cables are placed underground, an additional 42 trillion yen  will be necessary, the report predicts. To reduce the financial  burdens of private companies that create the network, the report  urges the government to consider setting up zero-interest loans  and special tax relief.    The report sets the year 2000, when Japan's population is  expected to peak, as a target for completion of the optical  fiber network. The report emphasizes that introduction of the  network in public institutions nationwide, including schools,  libraries, hospitals, town halls, and welfare facilities, should  be completed by 2000 and that the network should be used as a  means to trigger demand for the network, especially in  depopulated local communities.    In regard to construction of the network, the report clearly  states a plan designed to carry out the project mainly by the  private sector. As for the government's role, the report says  that it "should be limited to creating a favorable environment  for private companies and to keep gaps between localities at a  minimum to secure consumers' interest."</p>

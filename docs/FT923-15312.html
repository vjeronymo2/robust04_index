			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: Banesto to sell cement group for Pta60bn CORPORACION BANESTO, the Spanish industrial holding group, is to sell Sanson, Spain's second-biggest cement group, for Pta60bn (Dollars 623m). The Spanish group said that it would make a consolidated profit of Pta8bn on the disposal, the third major industrial sell-off in the past 18 months. Sanson was Corporacion Banesto's most profitable company last year. Sanson is being sold to Apax, a Liechtenstein affiliate of Unifund, a Geneva-based financial holding company. Unifund, whose owners are Egyptian, controls Siam Cement, Thailand's biggest cement manufacturer, Cementos Lima of Peru and has banking interests in Mexico. A senior Corporacion Banesto official said last night that Unifund had first expressed an interest in investing in the conglomerate a year ago and had signed a letter of credit for an option to buy Sanson last weekend. Unifund is being advised by JP Morgan of the US. The surprise decision to sell Sanson comes two months after Banco Banesto launched a Pta12.1bn public share offering for the 40 per cent of Sanson that it did not already own. Mr Arturo Romani, chief executive of Corporacion Banesto, said at the time that the conglomerate intended to strengthen its position in the cement industry. Corporacion Banesto said that the agreement with Unifund has been conducted 'with enormous speed'. The conglomerate offered Pta10,000 per share to the minority equity holders compared with the Pta20,012 per share which Unifund paid for the group. The cement company's earnings fell 36 per cent to Pta1.1bn in the first quarter of this year. However, this was double the amount returned by Acerinox, Corporacion Banesto's next largest earner. Last year, Corporacion Banesto's net consolidated profits fell by 48 per cent to Pta12.6bn. In the first three months of this year, the conglomerate's top five companies lost Pta5.9bn, against 1991 first-quarter profits of Pta1.6bn.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Salah al-Mukhtar: "Clinton's Decline"] </F>   [Text] Bill Clinton, who had seemed to to be courteous and  flexible enough and about to take a more realistic approach than  the bloody criminal Bush, is increasingly unmasking a face no  less ugly or filthy than Bush! Clinton had set himself apart  from George Bush a few hours before taking office when he said  he would be prepared to engage Iraq in dialogue. His advisers  had leaked suggestions he would pursue different policies toward  Iraq when he assumed power.    We, therefore, feel disgust toward a man who started off  with  a human face but later turned into a ferocious beast! In his  early youth, Clinton joined protest marches and took a hostile  stand toward his country's military engagement in Vietnam. But  he is now pursing even more criminal policies than Richard Nixon  and stands readier than Bush to become a monkey and effect a  complete aboutface.    Is there anything so base as the president of the greatest  nation on Earth turning himself into a monkey that turns its  backside to amuse spectators in the hope of making a dime or  two? The rash and nervous Clinton of today is not the sober and  cool Clinton of yesterday! One who loses one's balance and  falls captive to one's passions and crises is bound to be caught  up in lies and further crimes!    On the day before yesterday, he sent a new letter to the  U.S.  Congress's official spokesman in which he stooped even lower and  repeated lies about Iraq. Clinton opened his letter by stating  his extreme alarm by contradictions and the questions that  remain unanswered in the area of chemical weapons. It was  important, his letter said, to ensure effective and  comprehensive inspection.    Clinton knows that such statements to the Congress are sheer  lies, for the simple reason that the UN commission's reports,  including those submitted by Rolf Ekeus, head of the Special  Commission, testify that Iraq has met its obligations and that  the chemical weapons file is closed.    Beyond that, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz and  Lieutenant  General 'Amir Rashid recently showed, supported by evidence and  figures, that Iraq has implemented its commitments in the area  of chemical weapons. Clinton and his aides have had access to  these facts. To call him liar, therefore, is not to do him an  injustice.    Clinton has stooped to such depths as to blackmail Ekeus  into  dereliction of his duties and abandonment of his convictions.  The American President quotes Ekeus as saying he does not  expect his report about Iraq's compliance with its commitments  to be ready before the end of the year at the earliest. Clinton  goes on to comment: We strongly advocate Ekeus' line and reject  the drawing up of a timetable.    These statements are clearly meant to pressure and threaten  Ekeus. They amount to orders as to what he should and should  not do. Clinton thus chooses to forget that he is in breach of  UN Security Council Resolution 687, especially Paragraph 22,  which stipulates that the council will lift the sanctions once  Iraq has honored its obligations, which Iraq has done, as  evidenced by reports submitted by UN commissions and Ekeus  himself.    Clinton goes too far with his show of his meanness,  reaching the level of a professional liar. He quoted a  fabricated story, previously denied by a neutral investigation  conducted by a UN committee, to the effect that southern Iraq is  exposed to repression. Does this mean the UN committee's  investigation is based on lies? Doesn't this mean that the  President of the United States is a liar? In an attempt to  incite the Congress against Iraq, he spoke about investigating  Iraq's war crimes and violations of human rights in Iraq. This  proves once again that Clinton is not only a liar with double  consciences and double standards, but that he also does not have  the memory to protect him from saying anything that is easy to  refute. Every day, the world discovers anew that the U.S.  Administrations' crimes in the field of human rights are the  worst, the meanest, in mankind's modern history. Based on U.S.  information, since its establishment the United States has  carried out more than 200 large-scale military interventions  against other nations and peoples, without any justification or  legal right. As a result, hundreds of thousands of people died  and cities and cultural sites were destroyed. Among these crude  interventions were the U.S. aggression against Korea in the  fifties, the aggression against Vietnam in the sixties, the  aggressions against Grenada and Nicaragua in the eighties, and  the aggressions against Panama, Haiti, Iraq, and Somalia in the  nineties. The world is now convinced that America is the most  hostile state in history, and that it has encroached the most on  the most important of human rights, namely, the right to live  freely in a sovereign, independent state.    Before this, the United States was the first nation in  history to use, unnecessarily, a nuclear weapon that killed  hundreds of thousands of people. Later, the United States was  one of the most prominent states that turned its own people into  guinea pigs and injected them with chemical and nuclear  materials, which led to many years of torture for them, although  laws prohibited the experiments.    America's record of disdain for human rights is endless. It  is the country that discriminates the most against other ethnic  groups and races. It even reached the point where the non-white  were considered equal to dogs and animals.    So, does a state whose human rights record is this black  have  the right to speak about human rights and war crimes? Mankind  is looking forward to the day when peoples will succeed in  condemning those who were the first to use nuclear arms against  people; chemical weapons against revolutionaries, freedom-loving  people, and civilians; those who assassinated the leaders of  liberation movements and spread vice and drugs in the world; and  those who, with unmatched brutality, attacked civilian shelters  and annihilated hundreds of thousands of children as a result of  a shortage of medicine and malnutrition due to the blockade  clamped on Iraq.    When he speaks about Iraq's Kurds, as the one who defends  them, Clinton looks like a circus clown who knows he has become  a means to make his viewers laugh. The whole world knows,  particularly the Kurds, that the most hideous persecution the  Kurds had ever been exposed to is the one taking place now under  the protection and blessing of Clinton. Turkey is carrying out  a war of annihilation against its Kurds with Clinton's blessings  and under his protection. However, concerning Iraq's Kurds,  Clinton, just as his predecessor criminal Bush, also exposes  them to annihilation, but in a different way. They are  suffering from starvation, a lack of security, and the  deliberate spread of disease and the destruction of the unity of  the family.    America's appointment of the thieves, smugglers, and killers  of the Talabani and Barzani gangs, rulers of Iraq's Kurds, is in  itself a systematic destruction of the Kurds' life. How can  Clinton have the audacity to accuse Iraq of doing something that  is a small part of what he does?    The crimes America has perpetrated, and is perpetrating,  against mankind requires that international observers be  appointed at the Pentagon, the U.S. State Department, and CIA  headquarters, in Indian reservations, the black cities, and the  quarters of Hispanics exposed to ethnic and economic persecution  and social discrimination.    Clinton told Congress that "the Security Council member  states are unanimous that Iraq has not complied with Security  Council resolutions." Clinton's statement contradicts UN and  other reports that made the international community change its  attitude. This change was even apparent at the Security Council,  when three permanent member states and eight nonpermanent member  states, including some U.S. allies, have acknowledged that Iraq  has largely complied with UN resolutions.    Is there a fool in the whole world who would believe this  nonsense? Is Clinton unaware that most nations now understand  Iraq's view and are uncomfortable with U.S. custodianship?    Speaking about the embargo, moreover, Clinton said: "The  Iraqi Government distributes humanitarian supplies to its  supporters and to the Army." This contradicts hard reality that  supplies reach even the isolated autonomous region. This also  contradicts international and U.S. reports prepared by  committees that visited Iraq and admired the ration card system  as a comprehensive system that covers all citizens, and not only  a faction of the people.    Finally, Clinton discussed the false story about the  assassination of foreigners in the autonomous region, saying:  "Documented reports show that the Iraqi Government is offering  financial rewards for terrorist operations." We will not  elaborate on this lie. We will only cite the fact that the U.S.  State Department spokesman said the United States is checking  this information. Also, a report by the United Nations did not  make any accusations in this regard. So how can Clinton be so  sure in his letter? Is this not a kind of falsification and  deception of the highest legislative authority in the United  States?    Has Clinton forgotten that the warlords in northern Iraq,  such as Talabani and Barzani, trade accusations about murder,  theft, lack of security, and spread of vice? Is the CIA so  incapable of knowing that there is no security in northern Iraq  and that this allows for all kinds of crimes, including crimes  against foreigners?    Another thing. Why does Clinton find it strange for a German  reporter to be killed and two others to be injured in a region  where there is no security when dozens are killed daily in New  York, as well as in other American cities. The last such  incident was the killing of two Japanese people in America.    Finally, we would like to tell Mr. Clinton the following:  First, you are lying and you know that you are lying. This  shows your dreadful moral decline, especially since you were an  advocate of freedom. Second, you are lying to mislead Congress.  This is a crime punishable by the U.S. Constitution and U.S.  law. Third, you are helpless and driven to do all of this  because hellish episodes have placed you in the middle of a hell  of financial and sex scandals. You were shown a picture that  condemns you and were asked to choose either killing and  devouring the flesh of mankind so as to satisfy the urge of  capitalism for theft in return for covering your deviations or  facing scandal and receiving slaps from Hilary Clinton, the lady  who makes your decisions, when these pictures are sent to her  showing her the story of your romance before and after becoming  president. Fourth, the lies you are telling today will result  in killing more Iraqi children and elderly people and expose the  Iraqi people to further pain and suffering. You are well aware  of that. Therefore, you are a strong candidate to become a war  criminal that can be easily guided toward organized crime.    But you are mistaken, Mr. Clinton. The world is changing.  The voices of freedom are getting louder, and you know that  too. This is clear in your stupidities and nervousness that  prove you are aware that the United States will be defeated and  Iraq will triumph, just like all nations struggling for freedom,  independence, and honor will triumph.</p>

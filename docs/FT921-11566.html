			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / World Trade News: ABB gains Dollars 255m cable contract ASEA BROWN BOVERI, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, is to supply Dollars 255m (Pounds 140.8m) of equipment for a planned high-voltage direct current link between southern Sweden and northern Germany. ABB has reached agreement with Baltic Cable, jointly owned by Sydkraft and Preussen Elektra, two Swedish and German utilities, to supply two converter stations and a 250km submarine cable. The HVDC cable is claimed to be the world's longest and technically most advanced of its kind. The two converter stations will be built south of Malmo and in the Lubeck area in Germany. A definitive contract will depend on Baltic Cable receiving permission for building the HVDC link. ABB was awarded a DM40m (Pounds 13.9m) contract for the modernisation of three 400mw turbine generator units at the Planta Centro Power Station, 200kms west of Caracas.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Restaurants: There is such a thin as a free lunch - How to obtain 25 per cent off a meal out and win a free dinner More than 2,500 restaurants in the UK and the US are taking part in the 1994 Financial Times restaurant promotion. FT readers will be entitled to a 25 per cent saving on food and drinks consumed at lunch and dinner for six months. All who take part between January 24 and February 11 will be entered in a draw for 1,000 free lunches (or dinners) for two offered to launch the scheme. This follows last January's successful two-week restaurant promotion, Lunch for a Fiver, which offered fun and unbeatable value in the UK. This year we offer a deal on an international scale that will last longer. The key to the Financial Times 1994 restaurant offer is the Financial Times/Transmedia restaurant charge card. You can apply for it, free of charge, by writing to the address on the application form at the bottom of this page. After that, all you require is a valid Access, Visa or Delta charge card and a first class stamp. Once you have sent this information off you will receive a live FT/Transmedia restaurant charge card which you can use in any restaurant that accepts the Transmedia card as you would any other credit card. You will also receive the Transmedia directory of 2,400 US restaurants which accept the card plus a listing of the British restaurants. As the number of British restaurants which accepts this card is growing quickly we will be providing updates of the participating restaurants on the food and drink page of the Weekend FT. What are the benefits for the FT reader? The most obvious is the 25 per cent saving on food and beverages (excluding service and vat) to which the card entitles you. This saving applies to all the restaurants taking part whenever they are open for business. But there is more. The attraction of this particular offer is the scope and number of the participating restaurants. If you live in London you may well be able to use it daily - for business entertaining or meals with friends or family. If you live outside London, and there is currently no Transmedia restaurant nearby, you can still apply for the card and use it when travelling. This also applies to FT readers living outside Britain. You can apply for an FT/Transmedia card and use it when business or pleasure brings you to London, Edinburgh, Bath or Bristol. Or to the US when a business or holiday trip takes you to New York, Washington, Chicago, San Francisco or Los Angeles. Transmedia is also planning to open a Paris office later this year. How does it work? For readers of most newspapers such an extraordinary offer would need no further explanation but FT readers will doubtless be curious about its mechanics. Transmedia advances unsecured cash to a restaurant which it then markets to Transmedia cardmembers. The advance is repaid on a 2 for 1 basis via the food and beverage credits which Transmedia card members consume at these restaurants. To encourage its members to use these restaurants more frequently Transmedia passes on a 25 per cent saving on food and beverage back to the card member via his or her Access, Visa or Delta card. Since it was established in 1984 Transmedia estimates that it has advanced more than Dollars 130m to the American restaurant industry and, during the same period, made total savings of around Dollars 28m for its card members. What makes Transmedia attractive to so many restaurateurs is that it has found a niche in the market, filled it and then adapted itself to keep its restaurants busy. A restaurateur can put the unsecured cash to whatever use he or she chooses. Banks have never understood the restaurant industry, sometimes with good reason, but often because restaurateurs offer little in the way of security. A lease is normally a restaurant's main asset and, frequently, the terms of a lease can preclude a change of use if the restaurant fails. None of the restaurants which join Transmedia are working with such large margins that they can afford to reduce their prices for ever. But each has a different commercial need and can see a positive use for an interest-free advance: to repay a bank overdraft or directors' loans or to redecorate or re-equip and improve service. The managing director of one highly popular wine bar has joined because, after 14 years of packed houses, she feels the building needs a bit of a facelift and Transmedia can provide the necessary capital. Transmedia takes the risk of advancing cash to the restaurant industry and minimises this risk by marketing and promoting the restaurants. During the late 1980s many US restaurants joined Transmedia as the recession affected demand and high interest rates made bank borrowing to finance promotion or publicity unthinkable. But, as the US economy improves, there has been no slacking in the call for Transmedia's services. The reason for this is something that is now being learnt and applied by British restaurateurs. The high prices of the 1980s have disappeared and we are all demanding value for money whether it is business or social entertaining. This means lower prices. To compensate for this, and rising overheads, restaurants are opening longer and later. The most costly item today is not an extra waitress but an empty table. One restaurateur, who plans to open a large brasserie later this year in London's West End, estimates that to break even his turnover will have to be at least Pounds 2.5m - and that is before the builders have left the site. A number of restaurateurs have successfully been able to keep their restaurants busy enough to make them profitable and Ed Guinan, Transmedia's European chairman, is aware that Transmedia may not be for every restaurateur. But for those keen to increase volume and turnover - and the British restaurateurs who have already joined Transmedia will soon have the benefit of increased business from visiting US cardmembers - Transmedia may provide an effective solution. As Seth Lewis, food and beverage manager at the Grosvenor House, on Park Lane, central London explained: 'Business is considerably better than it was a year ago but it is still only good 40 weeks a year. 'My job now is to make it good 52 weeks a year.' Two of his hotel's restaurants now accept the Transmedia card. How do you take advantage of the FT/Transmedia card? The key to where you can use your card and the secret behind Transmedia's success in marketing and promoting its member restaurants lies in the compact Transmedia Directory of Restaurants which is mailed to all its card members every six weeks. If you wish to keep the card after six months you will be charged an annual card fee of Pounds 35. This fee will be refunded if you wish to cancel your membership of the scheme during the first year. 1,000 free meals draw. To enter the 1,000 free meals draw use your FT/Transmedia Restaurant card at any of the participating restaurants in the UK from Monday January 24 to Friday February 11. You will be automatically entered in the draw (there are no alternatives to the prizes offered). The more you use your card the better your chance of winning] To encourage readers who enjoy commenting on restaurants the FT will be offering 200 Winesavers, for storing wine leftovers, to readers who send the bestaccounts of their meal. We will also send a case of pink Champagne to the outright winner. Send your stories to me at the FT.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Minister Delegate of European Affairs Alain </F> Lamassoure: "From Blind Egotism to Enlightened Egotism"]    [Text] Mr. Maurice Allais does not deal gently with the  European statesmen of the second half of this century. (Footnote  1) (See the three articles by Maurice Allais on "Rethinking  European Integration" published in the "Opinions" section on 26  April, 3 May, and 9 May 1994.) In the belief that they had been  won over to what he calls a "pro-free-trade" mentality, he  regards them as "personally and directly responsible" for  innumerable miseries, as the "heroes of a vast mystification,"  and as the "gravediggers of European integration." Finally, he  says, even if they are "ignorant and thoughtless, they are  nonetheless responsible and blameworthy." The context suggests  that this is as applicable to de Gaulle, President Mitterrand,  Valery Giscard d'Estaing, Helmut Kohl, Sir Leon Brittan, and  Margaret Thatcher as to Jacques Delors.    The excessive passion of the author of this polemic should  not be allowed to obscure the real questions this economist is  posing. And his renown should not prevent us from answering  these questions. As a contribution to this end, I would like to  recall certain facts and pose certain questions.  <H5>  Reestablishing the Facts </H5>   1. None of the French leaders of the past 40 years, whether  socialist or liberal, Gaullist or centrist, has defended a  "pro-free-trade" ideology. They have tolerated the gradual  opening up of our markets, parallel to the actions of our  European partners, first of all, and those elsewhere  subsequently. Where the Anglo-Saxons are concerned, the French  view of international trade has always favored trade that is  "free but fair." For us in France, freedom is differentiated  from anarchy by the existence of rules, penalties, and judges.    2. The "free-trade" theory is the doctrine of the  econometricians, whom Mr. Allais has indeed a right to attack,  but the term does not reflect the real situation in current  international trade relations.    From the origins of the GATT to the beginning of the Uruguay  Round, or in other words from 1947 to 1986, only two issues were  dealt with. They were the progressive lifting of import quotas  and the reduction of the rates for the customs duties imposed on  industrial goods. There many other obstacles and distortions  that have as yet been dealt with only imperfectly, even within  the single European market, and were only partially broached for  the first time in the Uruguay Round. They include technical and  health norms, national and local public markets, legal or de  facto monopolies on imports, systematic recourse to  counterfeiting, denial of the right to establish businesses in  foreign countries, discriminatory subsidies or tax systems,  foreign investment regulations, etc.    3. The GATT agreement remains incomplete and imperfect. But  it marks a turning point in world trade policy, one particularly  favorable to the interests of our country.     -  Not only does it  not challenge Community preference, but, for the first time in  the GATT negotiations, it recognizes its legitimacy. The  mechanisms of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) are valid,  as is our French and European aid for cinematographic and  audiovisual development ("the cultural exception"), as well as  the subsidies we allocate to our least-favored regions or for  technological research.    -  This agreement deals with several of the  new trade distortions, beginning with counterfeit goods, on  which penalties will be systematically imposed. Our protected  regional designations of origin, our textile and clothing  industries, and our luxury industries (47 percent of the world  trade in this sector) will be the first to benefit from these  measures. Also, the United States will no longer be able to use  its system of federalism to justify its refusal to open up its  public markets to European competition. Our public-sector  businesses will be able to submit bids in Massachusetts or in  California--and France is one of the "giants" in the  civil-engineering sector.    -  The "family circle" of GATT members is  broadening, as is the scope of its regulations. The newly  industrialized countries, which have to date only participated  to the extent of 20 percent of their trade, will henceforth have  an involvement extending to more than 75 percent. And so,  finally, our business will have access to the Asian markets  where we have only been selling five percent of our  exports.    -  Better still, the GATT, an Anglo-Saxon concept, will  cease to exist, giving way to a veritable World Trade  Organization (WTO) with a French concept and name for which we  won acceptance against the initial American position. The member  countries of this organization undertake not to have recourse  within the organization to unilateral legislation like Section  301, and in world trade, there will finally be a real judge--an  independent authority protecting the weak against the abuses by  the strong or the those willing to cheat.    -  Finally, this  organization has already placed action on "ecological dumping"  on its agenda. And we have also obtained the support of the  United States itself for the inclusion on that agenda of the  problem posed by the countries that refuse to respect the  conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO) on the  basic rights of workers.   <H5>  An Armed Peace </H5>   As we have no desire to ignore reality, we know that the  commercial peace negotiated in this way will remain an armed  truce for a long time yet. That is why we have further  strengthened the capacity of Europe as a deterrent force by  providing ourselves with a more flexible and efficient  antidumping apparatus. Without waiting for the implementation of  this provision, for example, we have already reduced the import  quota for Chinese footwear by 40 percent, imposed antidumping  fees of 100 percent on Japanese television sets, and persuaded  the Americans to reject the "buy American" requirement with  regard to the public- sector market.    All of this has been accepted by 117 countries. We did not  have the power to force their agreement, but we were able to  persuade them. Who could hope for more, in France or elsewhere?  To the extent that we think within the national framework alone,  alternative policies are possible, and insofar as we confine  ourselves to the world of ideas, there is no limit on  flexibility. To be sure, one can dream of a an imaginary  republic--an administrative autarchy according import quotas on  a discretionary basis to the more civilized or the more  barbarian nations. However, harsh international realities force  us to move from the realm of pure reason to that of practical  reason.    Of course, we are not naive. We know that there are ulterior  motives everywhere, and that goodwill is not universal. We are  all too aware that the U.S. Congress is not enthusiastic.  Everything will depend on the capacity of the Europeans to  remain united in implementing the agreement, just as they were  united in negotiating it, and on the determination of our  governing leaders. Edouard Balladur's government will not flag.  <H5>  The Debate on Jobs </H5>   So much for the documents. Let me proceed to the questions  we  are all asking ourselves.    In the past 40 years, world trade has developed more rapidly  than world production. Exports have been the permanent motive  force behind growth, particularly for the European countries.    However, would trade with the countries characterized by low  wages destroy jobs? Yes, unless we were capable of resisting  this competition. But if that is the case, how can it be that  our country has an enduring surplus with almost all of the  countries with low income levels?    Even within the EEC, we have a surplus with Spain--more than  15 billion! The same is the case with Portugal, Greece, and  eastern Germany, while there is a serious deficit with western  Germany, despite the fact that the wages there surpass ours by  22 percent.    Let us turn toward the east. We have a surplus with the  countries of Central and East Europe, whose deficits with us  have even doubled in the past three years.    Let us look southward. Despite our purchases of hydrocarbons  from Algeria, we have a surplus of eight billion francs in our  trade with the Maghreb.    Turning to the Far East, we have a surplus, overall, with  regard to the Asian "dragons," including South Korea. China,  which boycotted our products for political reasons, is the sole  notable exception.    And so, all in all, a reduction in our trade with the  countries characterized by low wages would destroy a substantial  number of jobs in France. Fortunately, the United States did not  suffer in the 1950's from the blind egotism that is urged upon  us today. At the time, the per capita income of a Europe in  ruins was only a third the figure in America. After the  protectionist misconstructions of the 1930's, the OECE  [Organization for European Economic Cooperation] and the GATT  brought about the rebirth of a more or less fair trading system,  which proved of tremendous benefit to all the participants  therein.  <H5>  New Consumers </H5>   Let us dwell for a moment on the position of America as the  richest country in the world, one technically capable of  producing everything better than the others can. If one were to  follow the theory of sacred egotism, it could be claimed that  the United States should not trade with any other country, since  any imports would destroy jobs there. Obviously, this is absurd.  Unless the term "ignorant and thoughtless" is applicable to  Messrs. Bush and Clinton, who agreed to a free-trade agreement  with Mexico, as did the members of the Congress who ratified it.    But how can it be, in fact, that with a given level of  growth  in production and/or foreign trade and/or the trade balance, the  same apparent effect on jobs is not produced in all countries?  Why is it that for 10 years, Switzerland, Sweden, West Germany,  and more recently, Great Britain--all neighboring countries with  economies comparable to ours, and equally open to the world  economy, have had substantially lower unemployment rates? Why is  unemployment among the young a specifically French malady?    Rather it would appear as if the changes in the job  sector--the pairing of job elimination and job creation--depend  on three main factors. On the one hand, there is technical  progress, and on the other, the social and administrative  rigidity that slows the adaptation of our productive system to  this progress. And, finally, there are the changes in society  itself that affect either the active population (rates of  activity among young people or women) or the distribution of  services within the market economy (meaning jobs for which the  market provides remuneration), public intervention (meaning the  jobs financed by taxes), and, finally, family solidarity  (meaning activities outside the official economy).    If this is the case, how can one deny that international  trade is one vehicle, among others, of progress? And that the  emergence of Asia and Latin America from underdevelopment thanks  to trade is good news for all of mankind, including ourselves,  since it means hundreds of millions of new customers for our  manufacturers of automobiles, trains, planes, telephones, and  even luxury products, as well as for our highway, port, and  airport engineers, and for our suppliers of banking and software  services. In short, for everything that we do better than others  do.    On one proviso, obviously a basic one. And that is that the  trade conditions be equitable and fair. This is why we wanted  the GATT replaced by the WTO.    When I was in grade school, the blue on the atlas indicating  French possessions covered half of Africa, part of Asia, and  could be found on all five continents. As a world power, France,  like Great Britain--pink in the atlas--could dictate conditions  to its trade partners, which occupied an inferior, indeed a  subordinate, position.    Times have changed. There is just one world economy, and all  of the partners are equal in dignity. The population of the  planet has tripled in one generation. The leading motive dynamic  force is no longer (for the time being?) to be found on our  continent. Moreover, we need allies, even for the defense of our  vital interests. This is indeed the leading purpose of European  construction. Now, while we no longer control the economic game,  it is a fact, on the other hand, that the institutions we have  devised to regulate world regulations, beginning with the new  World Trade Organization, are accepted as legitimate by all the  actors on the stage.    Let us be wise enough to make the best use of this fact. Let  us not blame the poorly-paid Polish worker for the miseries that  are due first and foremost to our own very French rigidity. Let  the demagogues claim that the ailment should be treated by  making the germs illegal, and that the unemployment problem  should be resolved by putting the agents who punch tickets back  on the stagecoaches. Let us also leave to them the monopoly on  invective toward the scientists and statesmen who are  courageously pleading the case for progress, minor but  essential, in human relations. Let blind egotism yield, little  by little, to enlightened egotism.</p>

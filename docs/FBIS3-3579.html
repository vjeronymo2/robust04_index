The land-locked province, whose economy has for long been  hindered by inconvenient communications, neighbors Vietnam, Laos  and Myanmar (Burma), having a border of 4,060 km.    Officials said that the past 15 years have turned Yunnan  into  one of the frontiers of China's reform and opening-up. It has  so far opened two-thirds of its counties to foreigners and  established eight state-level and eight province-level outlets  on the border.    International cooperation in economy, science, technology,  culture, education, sports and public health resulted in the  approval of 509 foreign-invested enterprises in Yunnan last year.    Using self-collected funds and cooperating with Myanmar, the  province's border areas last year built and upgraded highways to  three important towns in north Myanmar, much improving  communications between them.    In Ruili and Wanding business people from outside the two  countries are arriving in surges.    By the end of last December the three towns of Hekou,  Tianbao  and Jinshuihe on the Sino-Vietnamese border reopened.    The provincial capital of Kunming is now linked by highways  with the important northern Vietnamese port of Haiphong, via the  border town of Hekou.    China's only state-level outlet on the border with Laos was  also opened in Yunnan last year.    Two-way border trade between Yunnan and the three countries  has been increasing by large margins to reach more than 2.87  billion yuan-worth last year.    The Mekong River, which winds through China, Laos, Myanmar,  Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, has turned out to be an economic  bond among the countries.    Since 1990 China and Laos have repeatedly launched  inspections, and experimental sailings, of the river. Last year  China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand surveyed 360 km of the river  during the dry season, obtaining abundant data on dredging and  navigation.    In January this year experts from the four countries  sponsored a conference here to study the prospects of official  navigation of the river.    The two ports of Jinghong and Simao along the Lancang River,  the name of the part of the Mekong in Chinese territory, have  been approved as state-level outlets designed to promote the  local economy.    The Yunnan provincial government has reached agreements with  Laos, Thailand and Myanmar to build two highways connecting the  two countries. The highways will then be extended to Malaysia  and Singapore.    Meanwhile, a local railway line in Yunnan is being extended  to Dali in the western part of the province and is expected to  eventually link up with the railway network of Laos.    Yunnan's plans to connect itself with neighboring countries  by water, road and rail have aroused interest of the Asian  Development Bank, which has provided loans for these  communication projects.    Kunming airport has become a major international airport in  the region, as it has opened direct air routes to Rangoon,  Bangkok, Chiangmai, Singapore, Vientiane, Kuala Lumpur and Hong  Kong. The city also envisages developing routes to Phnom Penh  and Ho Chi Minh City.    Currently the province is building and upgrading other  airports, including those at Zhaotong, Lijiang and Dali. Seven  of the airports will open to traffic by the end of this year.    Meanwhile, Yunnan is making efforts to improve the highways  connecting Kunming and the outlets on the border, such as Hekou  and Xishuangbanna. Officials said major highways within 200 km  around Kunming will have been upgraded by the end of next year.    To date, Yunnan has established trade and economic ties with  more than 100 countries and regions worldwide. Last year the  province registered a two-way trade volume of over 1.21 billion  U.S. dollars- worth and received more than 400,000 overseas  visitors.    Provincial Governor He Zhiqiang said that Yunnan is keen to  consolidate and expand cooperation with Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam,  Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, as well as to develop  cooperative channels with the Republic of Korea, Australia and  Indonesia.    He said his province also intends to initiate economic ties  with Cambodia, the Philippines and Brunei, while engaging in  promoting friendly relations with India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.    During the first Kunming export commodities fair last  August,  Governor He vowed to turn the annual event into an influential  international fair as a measure to promote Yunnan further in the  global arena.</p>

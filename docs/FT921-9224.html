			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Ilva sells steel can subsidiary ILVA, the Italian state-owned steelmaker, has sold its subsidiary, Capolo Gestioni Industriali, to a group of investors in one of the country's biggest leveraged buy-outs. Separately, Capolo is merging with Carlo Secchi, a company specialising in lithography on steel, which is a key step in printing on steel strip used for cans. Capolo is Italy's second biggest producer of steel cans for the food industry and general packaging, with turnover of around L194bn (Dollars 162.61m) last year. Together, the combined group will have sales of around L225bn a year. The transaction is a further step in Italy's privatisation programme. It may also reflect the drive by Ilva, which is one of the government's main candidates for partial privatisation, to reduce debt and produce a profit for 1991. Italian stock market rules require a company to show three straight years of profits before an initial public share offering can be made. Although Ilva had strong earnings in 1989 and 1990, last year was much tougher, and the company has been making a number of disposals to boost its extraordinary earnings. The deal was organised by LBO Italia, the Italian arm of the big LBO France group, with Akros, the Milan merchant bank, advising the vendors. The majority shareholder in the privatised Capolo is Europe Capital Partners, a big LBO fund. Meanwhile, Ilva will retain a stake of around 18 per cent in the new company.</p>

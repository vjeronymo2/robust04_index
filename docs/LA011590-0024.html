However, McGrath, displaying a strong  backhand, hit a passing shot to force a tiebreaker.  </P> <P> "At the beginning of the tiebreaker, I though I was in really good shape," the  second-seeded McGrath said. "After she came back, I knew I had to start playing  aggressively."  </P> <P> McGrath, a freshman who reached the U.S. Open mixed doubles final last year,  broke Laux's serve early and dominated the first set. However, she was unable  to dominate the second.  </P> <P> Laux, a junior, opened the second set by breaking McGrath's serve and was up,  2-0. McGrath then won the next five games before Laux won four in a row.  </P> <P> "I just tried to be more patient and force her more," Laux said. "I warmed up  as the match went on, (but) not fast enough."  </P> <P> In the men's final, unseeded Conny Falk of Miami (Fla.) defeated top-seeded  Jonathan Stark of Stanford, 6-3, 6-2.  </P> <P> Falk, playing an aggressive baseline game, broke Stark in the fifth game of the  first set. After each held his serve, Falk closed out the first set when Stark  double-faulted in the ninth game.  </P> <P> "My game wasn't very sharp today," said Stark, who along with partner Alex  O'Brien lost in the semifinals of the doubles. "The pressure of being top  ranked got to me."  </P> <P> The second set was much like the first, as Falk broke Stark twice. After  breaking Stark in the sixth game, Falk won the next game at love to go up, 5-2.  </P> <P> "I hadn't been playing well, except this tournament," Falk said. "This was the  first time I had felt good."  </P> <P> Stanford's third-seeded team of Sandra Birch and Debbie Graham defeated  top-seeded Mamie Ceniza and Stella Sampras of UCLA, 6-1, 6-3, for the women's  doubles title. USC's Byron Black and Kent Seton beat Shige Kanroji and Trevor  Kronemann of UC Irvine, 1-6, 6-1, 6-3, in the men's doubles.  </P></p>

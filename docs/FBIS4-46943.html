			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed item from the FINANSOVYE IZVESTIYA section: </F> "Chinese Bankers in Moscow Want To Influence Trade"]    [Text] The Bank of China in Moscow (Elos) is a joint-stock  commercial bank. It was founded by three financial institutions.  The Bank of China is the principal shareholder. Along with it,  blocs of second-rate shares are held by the most significant  members of the Bank of China group in Hong Kong and  Macau--Jincheng and Xinhua. The Bank of China owns 100 percent  of the stock of the latter banks; therefore, it is possible to  assert that the Moscow institution is a subsidiary bank of the  Bank of China in Russia.    The statutory capital of Elos comes to $10 million. Mr. Du  Wan You, vice president of the Bank of China in Moscow, observed  self-critically that "by Russian standards, we are a small  bank." However, the potential of the Chinese institution in  Russia hinges on two factors.    Direct relations with the Bank of China are the first  factor.  The bank was founded at the beginning of this century. Although  it remained in quite a lamentable condition until the end of the  1970's, by the end of 1992 the Bank of China came to rank 19th  in the world. The Bank of China has 448 foreign branches in the  main financial centers of the world with a staff of more than  16,000. Correspondent relations have been established with more  than 4,000 banks in 150 countries of the world. A few hundred  banks maintain relationships with the Bank of China on the basis  of the continuous mutual transfers of funds.    The Bank of China in Moscow operates in close contact with  the head office, amounting in fact to its branch in Russia. This  makes it possible for Mr. Du Wan You to say that his bank would  transfer monetary funds to any point in the world within one to  three days, depending on the time zone.    Active commercial relations between the two countries are  the  second factor strengthening the position of the Bank of China in  Russia. Suffice it to say, the Bank of China (Elos) is the only  Chinese financial institution in Russia. Out of a multitude of  Russian banks, only the Foreign Trade Bank operates in China at  present. The Bank of China is owned by the state. For this  reason, it now operates within the framework of Beijing's  official policy, which is geared toward expanding the trade in  Chinese products in Russia in every way possible.    Mr. Du Wan You stressed: "As a bank, we must generate  profits. However, our main objective is to solve the problem of  bilateral settlements and facilitate economic cooperation." This  is understood full well in the Russian power structure, which  explains the ease with which the Bank of China obtained all the  necessary licenses in April of last year." [quotation marks as  published]    Chinese companies and trading firms have become the main  clients of the Bank of China in Moscow. Elos has already begun  extending credit to Chinese legal entities. At present, the  Central Bank of Russia is considering the issue of performing  ruble-to-yuan conversion operations. There are virtually no  Russian firms among the clients of the Bank of China.    At present, Elos accepts deposits in U.S. dollars and  effects  currency transfers and exchange. A special subdivision exists  that provides consulting services aimed at finding partners in  the Chinese and Russian markets. In the long term, the Bank of  China intends to embark on investment, fiduciary, and leasing  operations, as well as operations with securities.    As of now, the Bank of China has established correspondent  relations with two dozen Russian banks. Mr. Du Wan You noted the  quite warm attitude toward the Chinese bank on the part of  Russian commercial banks. In his opinion, market adaptation is  proceeding quite successfully.    Thirty people work for the Bank of China in Moscow, of whom  only 10 are Russians. This circumstance, which is rare in  foreign banks, explains a certain delay in the development of  services. The management of the bank continuously notes that at  present its employees are mainly getting used to the Russian  market and studying it. In particular, a lack of knowledge of  the situation hinders the beginning of credit extension to  Russian firms.    For the time being, the Bank of China is not planning to  open  branches in other cities of Russia for the same reason. In  principle, it is necessary to open branches in St. Petersburg  and the Far East. However, this is not expected in the  foreseeable future. At present, the Bank of China has a  representative office in Kazakhstan.</p>

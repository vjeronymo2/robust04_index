			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Bundesbank in firing line over rate cuts EUROPEAN monetary policy makers are becoming increasingly disenchanted with the Bundesbank's refusal to lower Germany's interest rates and are questioning whether the European monetary system can continue to survive in its present form. In meetings last week, officials criticised the central bank for its high interest rates and for taking too optimistic a view of German growth and employment prospects in the second half of this year. The bank's policies were queried when officials from the leading industrial countries met last Tuesday in the secretive Working Party Three committee at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris. Concern was expressed earlier among officials attending the annual meeting last week of the Bank for International Settlements that Germany's high interest rates could lead to conflicts among members of the European exchange rate mechanism and possibly to a new crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism. One central bank official said: 'What we're seeing now replicates what happened in the early 1970s when the Bretton Woods system (of fixed global exchange rates) was breaking up. We are trying our hardest to patch up the existing system, though thinking all the time we may not succeed.' Some central bankers wonder whether the ERM will have to be replaced by a more flexible system of exchange rate stewardship which allows currencies to fluctuate by wider margins against each other. Behind such thoughts are: The reduced role of the D-Mark as the ERM anchor. With the D-Mark having declined substantially against other currencies, faith in the Bundesbank as the arbiter of interest rates throughout Europe is starting to wane. Increased power of financial markets. Semi-fixed exchange rates may be harder to defend against the ability of the Dollars 1,000bn-a-day currency market to switch money around the world in response to changing perceptions about policy or events such as elections. Likely reluctance by governments to shift ERM parities when under pressure. Since last year's turbulence, European governments have stepped up efforts to discuss how economic fluctuations affect currencies, with a view to anticipating the need for devaluations. However, one central bank official said: 'A devaluation will still be seen as a political defeat, no matter how great the discussion beforehand.' Lack of credibility in the ERM, with the pound and the Italian lira operating outside the mechanism after last year's strains. Neither of these currencies appear likely to re-enter in the immediate future. In public, central bankers say they are generally confident that the ERM is working well. Mr Maurice Doyle, governor of Ireland's central bank, says further realignments are unlikely over the next one to two years on the grounds that 'everything seems to be in equilibrium'. However, German policy and the recent decline in the D-Mark on foreign exchange markets are causing alarm elsewhere. Although some analysts expect that figures this week will show a slowdown in the growth of German broad money, there are fears the German authorities will continue to resist any further easing of monetary policy because of the weak D-Mark. That would put new strains on the ERM where France, in particular, would like to lower interest rates to revive its economy and quell criticism of rising unemployment and the link between the franc and the D-Mark. Although French money market rates have been cut below German levels, the authorities in Paris are unwilling to approve a sharp easing of monetary policy without the Bundesbank moving first.</p>

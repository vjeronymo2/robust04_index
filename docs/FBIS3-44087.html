Speaking  in Johannesburg on Monday, negotiations services division  director David Hartridge said the terms of tariff preferences  for developing countries in GATT had been exaggerated.    "Those developing countries which have grown fastest are  those most exposed to world markets," he said. "Preferences can  be withheld from any country and can be withdrawn at any time,  and they have tended to be least generous for products where  developing countries are competitive suppliers."    South Africa has considered seeking a reclassification of  its  GATT status as a developed-country to a developing-country as  its economy is heavily dependent upon primary exports and  imports of capital goods. However, he said that some sectors of  the country's economy were highly competitive, and it had  advanced infrastructure and strong financial and educational  institutions.    The United States and other developed countries have  resisted  South Africa's reclassification as it is one of the world's top  30 trading nations. Mr Hartridge said instead South Africa  should seek to integrate itself more fully in the world economy  through increasing trade liberalisation.    "The best strategy might be to strengthen bilateral  relationships with major trading partners... rather than to rely  on developing-country status as a claim to preferential  treatment." The country would not only enjoy better access to  foreign markets but also, more importantly, the beneficial  effects of competition and stable trade policies on the  efficiency of the economy.    The GATT Secretariat has estimated South Africa's average  tariff reduction, according to its offer, would be 28 per cent  and the tariff structure considerably simplified. Mr Hartridge  said this would greatly benenfit the country's manufacturing  sector: "It is very hard to plan and cost production when the  price of essential imports can be raised at any time in response  to demands for protection from inefficient local suppliers."</p>

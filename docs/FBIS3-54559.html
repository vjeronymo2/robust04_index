			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, Jan 28 (AFP)--Israel and the PLO failed to  make sufficient progress toward launching Palestinian self-rule  at negotiations here this week, PLO chief negotiator Nabil  Sha'th said Friday [28 January] on the eve of crucial talks in  Switzerland.    "Some progress was certainly made during 36 hours of  negotiations, but it was insufficient," Sha'th told AFP.    PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon  Peres are due to meet in Davos, Switzerland, on Saturday in a  new effort to break the deadlock. They will examine 12 points  of disagreement drawn up by the negotiators.    Stressing the Palestine Liberation Organisation's  "attachment" to the autonomy accord signed in Washington on  September 13, Sha'th said the PLO "insists that the Israeli  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho ends on the date set by the  accord" -- April 13.    "We will not accept any delay," Sha'th added.    Israeli troops were to have begun withdrawing on December  13.    Sha'th said he would attend the Davos talks with PLO  economic  department chief Ahmad Quray' (Abu-al-'Ala').    The two sides are trying to resolve differences over control  of border crossings and the size of the future autonomous  Jericho area in the West Bank.    The PLO representative in Cairo, Sa'id Kamal, said that if  'Arafat and Peres ironed out the differences in Davos,  negotiators would meet in Egypt's Red Sea resort of Taba to  prepare the text of an agreement.    'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin would then  sign the agreement, he added.    However in Jerusalem, Peres said Israel and the PLO still  had  much work to do before launching Palestinian self-rule.    "Although I am generally an optimist I cannot promise that  an  accord will be reached in Davos," Peres said before leaving.</p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> HOBBLED GLENDALE OPENS CONFERENCE PLAY  </P> <P> The Glendale College basketball team gets an early Western State Conference  test when the Vaqueros play host to defending conference champion Santa Monica  on Saturday night.  </P> <P> Glendale (12-6) opened WSC play Wednesday against West Los Angeles without  starting forward Justin Lord, who sprained an ankle last weekend in the Palomar  tournament. Results of the Glendale-West L.A. game were not available at press  time.  </P> <P> Lord, the Vaqueros' tallest starter at 6-foot-6, is also expected to miss the  game against Santa Monica. He is averaging 13 points a game.  </P> <P> "We were playing really well when he (Lord) got hurt ," said Glendale Coach  Brian Beauchemin, whose team had won seven consecutive games before losing to  Mt. San Jacinto in the second round of the Palomar tournament. "I felt like we  were just getting ready for conference.  </P> <P> "Right now, we're kind of in quest of some back-line people until he gets  better."  </P> <P> The search got tougher earlier this week when Chris Cooke, a 6-8 freshman who  often was the first player off the Glendale bench, injured his foot in  practice.  </P> <P> In Santa Monica, Glendale will meet a team that is 16-3 and coming off a win  last weekend over top-ranked and previously unbeaten Rancho Santiago.  </P> <P> The Corsairs, who went 15-0 in WSC play last season, are led by forwards  Cornelius Banks and Mark Moten. Banks, a freshman, is averaging 15 points and  eight rebounds. Moten, a sophomore, is averaging 15 points and seven rebounds.  </P> <P> Glendale competes in the WSC Southern Division, which includes Santa Monica,  Valley, Canyons, West L. A. and Bakersfield.  </P> <P> Ventura, Oxnard, Santa Barbara, Moorpark and Cuesta compose the Northern  Division.  </P> <P> Sharpshooter: Laura Oki, who helped lead Marshall High to the City Section 3-A  Division girls' basketball championship last season, looks like she might have  a good shot at repeating as 3-A Player of the Year if she continues at her  current pace.  </P> <P> Oki, a senior guard, is averaging 22 points a game for Marshall (8-2) and  scored a season-high 36 points last weekend in a 63-62 loss to Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> "She's just burnin'," Marshall Coach Wendy Triplett said. "She's hitting the  three-pointers like crazy."  </P> <P> Indeed, Oki had eight three-point baskets against Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> For openers: Glendale-area boys' basketball teams begin Pacific League play  Friday with Hoover playing host to Crescenta Valley and Glendale visiting Muir.  </P> <P> Pasadena and Muir are, once again, considered the teams to beat in the Pacific  League. Crescenta Valley, Arcadia and Glendale are expected to contend for  playoff berths.  </P> <P> Crescenta Valley (8-4) is coming off a disappointing showing in last week's  Hart tournament. The Falcons beat Glendale and lost to East Bakersfield and  Canyon. It was the first time in three years -- and six tournaments -- that  Crescenta Valley had failed to make the final.  </P> <P> "I hope we can snap this," said Crescenta Valley Coach John Goffredo, whose  team began the season 7-2. "We're playing really poorly right now."  </P> <P> Glendale (6-7), also struggling, will meet Muir and Pasadena in its first two  league games without the services of forward Scott Tillman, sidelined because  of a broken thumb.  </P> <P> "It was a tough vacation for us," Glendale Coach Bob Davidson said. "We haven't  played real well. But I think if we can start shooting like we're capable,  we'll be in the running for a playoff spot."  </P> <P> Onward and upward: Three Glendale College football players have committed to  four-year schools and will transfer at the semester break in a few weeks.  </P> <P> Running back Sean Hampton will attend Utah State. Hampton rushed for 760 yards  and seven touchdowns last season and also caught 11 passes for 147 yards and  two touchdowns. In 1988, Hampton gained 1,150 yards and scored 13 touchdowns  and was an All-Western State Conference selection.  </P> <P> Wide receiver Pat Lynch, who had 39 receptions for 581 yards and five  touchdowns this season, will attend San Jose State.  </P> <P> Mark MacMillan, an all-state defensive back for the Vaqueros in 1988, chose  Alabama over USC.  </P> <P> Bowled over: The Glendale College football program was well-represented in bowl  games during the holidays as five former Vaqueros participated.  </P> <P> Bill Schultz, a former All-American offensive lineman at Glendale, started for  USC in the Rose Bowl victory over Michigan.  </P> <P> Brian Greenfield was the punter for Pittsburgh in the Panthers' John Hancock  Bowl victory, Sal Velasco was the kicker for Hawaii in a loss in the Aloha  Bowl, defensive lineman Dave Ewing played for Fresno State in a California Bowl  win, and defensive end Antoine Mitchell of Oregon participated in the  Independence Bowl.  </P></p>

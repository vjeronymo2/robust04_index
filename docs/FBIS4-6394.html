			<p>BFN     [Text] Iran has urged UN Secretary General Butrus Ghali to  immediately submit his resignation from the world body. Iranian  Majles Speaker 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, who is currently on an  official visit to Malaysia, stated that Mr. Butrus is incapable  and has failed in his duty to end the massacre of Bosnian  Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Speaking at a news conference in Kuala Lumpur at the end of  his three-day visit, he said the secretary general of the world  organization should immediately tender his resignation. Mr.  'Ali also condemned the United Nations for its failure to play  its role as a peace mediator in an effort to end the Serbian  atrocities on Bosnian Muslims. He urged all Muslim nations to  unite and strongly pressure the international community to act  against the Serbian atrocities and massacres, particularly in  Gorazde. He also expressed regret over the world organization's  attitude of rejecting Iran's offer to send 10,000 of its troops  to Bosnia while at the same time accepting Russia's offer.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SUCCESS RELATIVE FOR DUO;  </P> <P> TENNIS: MOORPARK COLLEGE'S MOTHER-AND-DAUGHTER COMBINATION MAKES FOR A WINNING  SET.  </P> <P> Watching Moorpark College's No. 1 doubles team play is sort of like seeing  those old soap commercials -- look at their backhands and decide which player  is the mother and which is the daughter.  </P> <P> Their relationship isn't always apparent to opponents, but it quickly becomes  clear the first time Elise Nakawatase looks at Patti Nakawatase and says, "Nice  shot, Mom."  </P> <P> This unlikely pairing of college freshmen, a 45-year-old mother and her  18-year-old daughter, was as unexpected as it has been successful.  </P> <P> Patti, who never had competed in school-based athletics, already was planning  to take some classes at Moorpark when Elise asked her to join a tennis team  badly in need of players.  </P> <P> "I didn't really realize what I got into," Patti said.  </P> <P> Patti and Elise have been more than a novelty, winning seven of their 11  doubles matches. In singles, Patti is 8-1 at No. 6, and Elise is 9-6 at No. 1.  </P> <P> Their doubles team is among those receiving a first-round bye for the Western  State Conference tournament, which begins today and continues through Sunday at  Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> "It's been a little hectic and stressful, but I've enjoyed doing it," said  Patti, who didn't go on to college after graduating from Venice High in 1962.  "It's been fun to play with them. They're all so nice, but they hit so hard and  never get tired."  </P> <P> Patti and Elise had played together before, usually when Patti needed a  substitute for her social matches, but Elise played parent-child tournaments  with her father. As might be expected, mother and daughter have a certain  kinship on the court.  </P> <P> Elise's powerful strokes and speed complement Patti's doubles acumen. Playing  in three club leagues as well as frequent doubles matches with friends has left  Patti versed in the nuances of doubles play, recondite knowledge for college  players accustomed to singles.  </P> <P> "They play well together," Moorpark Coach Nancy Stewart said. "Patti knows the  court real well. Elise is very athletic."  </P> <P> Patti's specialties are poaches, lobs and off-speed shots, but Elise says her  mother hits the ball hard enough that "I know I don't have to worry about  getting the ball slammed in my face.  </P> <P> "What I like is my mom can hold her own most of the time," Elise said. "I know  they tend to pick on her more because she's the older one, but my mom pretty  much shows them."  </P> <P> Elise and Patti recently showed their moxie against WSC power Santa Barbara.  After falling behind, 4-1, Nakawatase and Nakawatase battled back to win the  first set, 7-6, and the match, 7-6 (7-5), 6-7 (6-8), 6-0.  </P> <P> "I feel good on the court with her because she'll hold up her end and sometimes  mine," Patti said. "We get along better on the court than we do anywhere else.  </P> <P> "When we're on the court, we're partners, but anywhere else it's  mother-daughter."  </P> <P> The two are amicable on the court, with each other and their opponents. Their  relaxed demeanor and easy friendliness are a departure from the days when Elise  wouldn't let her mother watch her juniors matches because having Patti on the  sidelines made her too nervous.  </P> <P> "We've gotten closer now since we've been playing," Elise said. "We have more  to talk about now. Before we didn't get along as well."  </P> <P> This spring, Patti and Elise have metaphorically walked a mile in each other's  Nikes.  </P> <P> Elise now has to cook some meals for her father and younger brother because  Patti has night classes, and Patti better appreciates Elise's life as a  student.  </P> <P> "I think it's made us understand each other much better," Elise said.  "Personality-wise I'd say we're about the same. Attitude-wise and study  habit-wise we're different."  </P> <P> "She's more organized. Me, I take it as it comes."  </P> <P> The most difficult aspect of college athletics for Patti has been fitting all  the time demands into her schedule.  </P> <P> Patti juggles her 12-hour class load, which she needs to stay eligible for  athletics, with a 15-hour-a-week job at a Westlake Village accounting firm and  with keeping the family's Agoura Hills household humming.  </P> <P> In addition, she has standing commitments for several matches a week in leagues  and with friends.  </P> <P> Too busy to practice with the team, Patti said she nonetheless feels  comfortable on the squad.  </P> <P> "She's a lot of fun," said Amy Perry, a member of Moorpark's No. 2 doubles  team. On trips, "she always sits up front with the coach, and they usually talk  the whole time. The other girls sit and gossip, and they talk 'mom-stuff.' "  </P> <P> Cathleen Clark, another member of the No. 2 doubles team, admitted the players  sometimes "have to watch what we say; we kind of whisper sometimes," but added,  "She's just like one of the girls."  </P> <P> Yet Patti has a different perspective on college athletics than the rest of the  team.  </P> <P> Elise hopes to parlay her Moorpark experience into a spot on a four-year  college team, but for Patti, the experience has been an end unto itself.  </P> <P> Patti says she would have to quit her job to play next season, a sacrifice  she's not eager to make. She's still concentrating on completing this season,  which could last into mid-May.  </P> <P> If Elise and Patti win their first WSC tournament match, they'll be in the  final eight, which will automatically qualify them for the Southern California  regional of the state tournament.  </P> <P> If they do advance to regionals, which begin next Friday, they'll have to be  considered dark-horse contenders.  </P> <P> The last day of the regionals is, after all, Mother's Day.  </P></p>

Son Song-pil, DPRK  ambassador to Russia, spoke at the new conference. He briefed  Pyongyang's position in connection with the North-South talks  for the exchange of top-level special envoys.    Station reporter (Aleksey Kolony) who attended the news  conference reports: The DPRK ambassador quoted a DPRK Foreign  Ministry spokesman's 13 March statement. The statement  indicates that North-South dialogue held to discuss the issue of  exchanging top-level special envoys has encountered a serious  barrier recently.    Ambassador Son continued to say: "As you know, in the  DPRK-U.S. contact held recently, an agreement was reached in  conducting the four-point joint actions simultaneously. That is  to say, the two sides agreed to put the four points into action  simultaneously. They are: First, the United States announces  the suspension of the Team Spirit joint military exercise.  Second, we receive an inspection to ensure the continuity of  safeguards. Third, we hold North-South working-level delegates'  contact for the exchange of special envoys. Fourth, the DPRK  and the United States hold the third round of the DPRK-U.S.  talks."    Saying that Pyongyang is ready to abide by all problems  which  have already been agreed upon, the DPRK ambassador briefed on  the current situation in North-South dialogue.    [Son] "However, the persons in authority of South Korea,  unlike the attitude they took in the early days of their  assumption of power, opposed the exchange of special envoys  simply because we proposed it. They opposed [words indistinct].  However, giving in to our strong demand and the Korean people's  pressure calling for holding North-South dialogue, they  reluctantly responded to the working-level contact for the  exchange of special envoys.    Proceeding from our will to create a good atmosphere for the  realization of the exchange of special envoys, we proposed the  following four demands at the fourth working-level contact:  First, the suspension of all large-scale nuclear military  exercises. Second, the renouncement of the international  alliance system in connection with our so-called nuclear  problem. Third, the suspension of the plan to deploy Patriot  missiles to South Korea. Fourth, the cancellation of the remarks  by the person in authority in South Korea that he cannot shake  hands with a counterpart who possesses nuclear weapons. We  proposed the above because we believed these issues should be  resolved first in order to provide favorable circumstances for  the working-level contact on the exchange of special envoys to  proceed amid an atmosphere of mutual trust between the North and  the South."    In conclusion, responding to the station reporter's question  about the prospects of the North-South dialogue, DPRK Ambassador  Son Song-pil said: "Problems seem complicated. However, they  are actually not complicated. Who complicates problems? It is  precisely the South Korean authorities and the United States.  The pressing issue that should be solved between the DPRK and  the United States at present is the nuclear issue. As I said  earlier, the South Korean authorities are not in a position to  edge themselves into this issue.    What the U.S. side needs to do is withdraw U.S. nuclear  bases  and nuclear weapons from South Korea and renounce its  large-scale military and nuclear threats and hostile policy  against us. In return for this, we will receive nuclear  inspections. Thus, the United States and we should resolve  problems, and others should not be involved in this. Therefore,  the issue of solving the nuclear issue through a package  settlement should be solved first through the talks between the  United States and us. If the United States removes its nuclear  weapons from South Korea, thereby removing the nuclear threat  against us, a package settlement of the nuclear issue will be  realized and the basic issues between us and the United States  will be eliminated anyway."</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Hambros warns of sharp profits fall: Merchant bank hurt by downturn in bond market - 'No hedging is perfect' Hambros yesterday followed SG Warburg in warning of a sharp fall in profits in the six months to September 30 because of a deterioration in securities markets. The merchant bank forecast that its interim pre-tax profit would fall to Pounds 18m-Pounds 23m from Pounds 41.1m in the first half of the 1993-94 financial year. Although Hambros said it would maintain its interim dividend at 4.5p, its announcement further drove down share prices in a sector already hit by Warburg's profit warning on Monday. Hambros itself, which fell 11p on Warburg's news, lost another 22p to close at 226p. Schroders, another merchant bank, ended the day at 1285p, down 50p over one day and down 93p over two. Warburg made up some of the ground it lost on Monday but still closed 90p down over two days at 580p. Hambros blamed the deterioration in first-half results in part on the downturn in the bond market that has already affected Warburg and several US investment banks. Sir Chips Keswick, joint deputy chairman, said he was 'delighted' that the company had maintained profitability in the bond business in the first half. He said Hambros had experienced lower profit margins in primary bond issues. It had not been able to use derivatives to hedge all its positions in the secondary bond market against price movements. 'No hedging is perfect,' he said. Sir Chips said Hambros had no immediate plans to shed many employees or to reconsider its involvement in bond markets. 'I am certainly not going to rush off and fire people at the wrong end of the cycle,' said Sir Chips. 'We believe that this is a blip and if it is not a blip we will assess our commitment to bond markets.' Analysts nevertheless lowered their forecasts for the full year, predicting profits would fall by about a third from the Pounds 90.5m reported in 1993-94. Of the Pounds 20m estimated drop in interim profits, Hambros attributed about Pounds 10m to the bond business and a fall in net interest revenue. Hambros had continued to lend to corporate clients, but margins had narrowed. Hambros said provisions were expected to rise by Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 7.5m, against the trend for commercial banks. Analysts questioned the bank's control of costs. Increased overheads because of recruitment and investment in new business areas accounted for Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m of the expected profit fall. Analysts had expected Hambro Countrywide, the estate agency 50 per cent owned by Hambros, to boost results as the housing market recovered. But Hambro Countrywide reported a deficit of Pounds 700,000 for the six months to June against a profit of Pounds 13.3m in the first half of 1993. Lex, Page 24</p>

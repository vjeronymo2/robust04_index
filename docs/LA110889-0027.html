			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA COMPOSERS IN SPOTLIGHT AT GINDI  </P> <P> Californian composers were the focal point of Monday night's Los Angeles  Philharmonic Chamber Music Society concert at Gindi Auditorium. And, sure  enough, it was this native music that received the most sympathetic and  idiomatic readings.  </P> <P> The exotic and inventive Varied Trio (1986) for violin, piano and percussion by  the Northern California-based Lou Harrison opened the concert.  </P> <P> In this engaging five-movement, 15-minute work, Harrison's simple, repetitive  melodies and harmonies are given subtle, soft color through an imaginative  variety of instruments and techniques. The mechanical flavor of the pulsating  second movement is captured by the use of violin pizzicato, a mallet thumping  on the wood of the piano and chopsticks clanking against water-filled rice  bowls.  </P> <P> The finale is a rambunctious Middle Eastern dance -- Igor Stravinsky in Baghdad  -- using tambourines, tom-toms and, effectively, baker pans. Philharmonic  veterans Raynor Carroll (percussion), Zita Carno (piano) and Rochelle Abramson  (violin) performed with attentive bravado and calm assurance.  </P> <P> Ingolf Dahl, who spent the greater part of his life teaching at USC, was the  other Californian represented.  </P> <P> His "Concerto a Tre" for violin, cello and clarinet is a playful bit of 1940s  neo-classicism a la Stravinsky. David Howard, exceptional on clarinet,  violinist Barry Socher and cellist Gloria Lum were the crackerjack soloists.  </P> <P> The anti-climactic closer was a poorly tuned, scrappily played rendition of the  Piano Quintet, Opus 81, by the non-Californian Dvorak.TIMOTHY MANGAN  </P></p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Anger at plan for job cuts in army ARMY OFFICERS serving in Bosnia could be among the more than 600 to be handed compulsory redundancy notices today, Mr Archie Hamilton, armed forces minister, admitted in the Commons last night, David Owen writes. Under questioning from Mr John Reid, the Labour defence spokesman, Mr Hamilton told MPs: 'There is a possibility that a small number of serving officers in Bosnia may be made compulsorily redundant.' It was also possible that serving officers in Northern Ireland could receive similar notices. Mr Hamilton had earlier come under pressure from Tory backbenchers after he rejected the recent call by the cross-party defence committee for all infantry battalion amalgamations and disbandments to be cancelled. To do this, he said, would cost Pounds 200m a year, as well as distorting the balance between the infantry and other army branches.</p>

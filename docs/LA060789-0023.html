			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANIMAL ACTIVISTS' ACTIVITIES LIMITED  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Abby Soven has issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting  harassment of UCLA faculty members at their homes and other disruptive  activities by Last Chance for Animals, an anti-vivisection group opposed to the  use of animals in scientific research.  </P> <P> The injunction issued May 26 specifies that Last Chance for Animals and six of  its leaders cannot threaten, intimidate, harass or annoy UCLA faculty at their  homes; break into or block UCLA facilities; interfere with or obstruct the  teaching, research or other functions of the Westwood campus, or destroy any  property belonging to the regents of the University of California.  </P> <P> UCLA spokesman Richard Elbaum said the group has broken into campus  laboratories where research involving animals has been under way and has  harassed faculty members who conduct such research.  </P> <P> Christopher Rose, president of Last Chance for Animals who was named in the  injunction, said the ruling is "a direct infringement of our constitutional  rights" that "just goes to show the power of these institutions."  </P> <P> "They can dictate their own law," he said. "But in no way will this deter us.  We will prevail."  </P></p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / QVC makes Dollars 4.8bn cash offer to control Paramount QVC NETWORK, the US television home shopping busi ness, yesterday formally launched a hostile takeover bid for Paramount Communications, the entertainment company, with a Dollars 4.8bn (Pounds 3.17bn) cash tender offer for 51 per cent of Paramount's shares. It also announced that it was taking legal action against the Paramount board. QVC, which proposed a Dollars 9.5bn cash and shares takeover of Paramount last month, has been frustrated at the company's refusal so far to open discussions, while Paramount proceeds with plans for an agreed Dollars 7.6bn cash and shares takeover launched by Viacom, a cable television company. The tender, due to begin by October 27, maintains QVC's cash and shares offer at Dollars 80 per Paramount share, but it increases the amount of cash from about Dollars 30 a share to Dollars 40. It moves the bid from the status of a proposal, to be discussed with Paramount's management, into a hostile act to be considered by its shareholders. Analysts said it was likely to force Viacom into improving its offer for Paramount. It may also push Paramount's board into speedier consideration of QVC's offer. Paramount has argued that it needs to proceed with caution lest it violate the terms of its Viacom agreement. QVC said it was going ahead with a cash offer for 51 per cent of Paramount's stock at a price of Dollars 80 a share. If that succeeded, it would then launch a second-stage tender in which it would acquire each Paramount share for 1.42857 QVC shares. The combined value of the offer would be about Dollars 9.5bn, the same as its original takeover announcement, although only Dollars 30 a share of the initial proposal was in cash and the rest in QVC shares. Viacom's offer contains only Dollars 9.10 a share in cash. QVC added that it was launching legal action against both Paramount and Viacom for breach of fiduciary duty. It accuses Paramount of giving undue advantage to Viacom. It asked the court to void agreements under which Paramount must pay Viacom Dollars 100m if its bid fails, and Viacom's option to buy 20 per cent of Paramount's shares at Dollars 69.14.</p>

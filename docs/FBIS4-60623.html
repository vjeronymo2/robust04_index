			<p>BFN     [Text] In wake of recent reports about the possibility of  starting to collect weapons from Palestinians in the autonomy  areas soon, Fatah Central Committee Member 'Abas Zaki said  during a dialogue with the press in Damascus today that the  Palestinian command has not yet made a decision to collect  weapons from the Palestinians in the autonomy areas, especially  since there is an armed enemy and weapons are in the hands of  the settlers.    Zaki said a PLO delegation will visit Damascus for talks  with  the Syrian officials and the Palestinian opposition. However,  he did not say when the visit will take place.    Zaki, a moderate opposer of the Palestinian-Israeli  agreement, arrived in Damascus yesterday and held talks today  with Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front  for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], and will also meet with  George Habash, the secretary general of the Popular Front for  the Liberation of Palestine, and Ahmad Jibril, secretary general  of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General  Command.    After meeting Zaki today, Hawatimah said the DFLP and all  the  other nationalist and democratic forces will pursue the struggle  against the occupation and against the settlers who carry  120,000 weapons. Hawatimah said: That's why we rejected all  calls seeking to disarm the sons of the intifada. Hawatimah  warned the Palestinian police against crossing the red lines.</p>

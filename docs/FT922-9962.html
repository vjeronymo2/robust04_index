			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Europa board favours Brierley SHAREHOLDERS IN Europa Minerals, the UK mining finance house, have been urged by their board to support the financial rescue offered by companies associated with Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur, rather than rival proposals from Austmin, an Australian exploration company. However, Mr Guido Staltari, managing director of Austmin, which is Europa's biggest shareholder with 14.3 per cent, said that by last weekend he expected proxies representing 45 per cent of the votes to be lodged in favour of his company's scheme. Europa's board reported that it had sold off one of its two remaining UK coal properties for Pounds 50,000. This resulted in a book profit of about Pounds 359,000, after expenses, as the company had been able to release a provision against closure costs of Pounds 317,000. It was negotiating the sale of the other coal property and 'significant progress has been made in agreeing new facilities with Europa's two principal bankers'. In a circular to shareholders the Europa directors recognised that the Austmin proposals represented a smaller discount to the share price prior to the announcement of an open offer and placing by GPG and Mid-East Minerals, companies in Sir Ron's orbit. 'This is significant for shareholders who do not take up their entitlements, but for those who do, this would not be an issue,' the circular reads. In addition, the MEM offer of warrants would allow present Europa shareholders 'to participate in the company's potential upside without financial commitment at this stage'.</p>

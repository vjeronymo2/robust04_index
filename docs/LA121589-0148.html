			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA;  </P> <P> NURSING CARE FOR BOY TO BE EXTENDED  </P> <P> Jason Goldberg, a 9-year-old quadriplegic who was in danger of losing the  round-the-clock home care he needs, has won a guarantee of continued care for a  few more months, the family's lawyer said Thursday.  </P> <P> The Orange County Development Disabilities Center has agreed to continue  nursing care for Jason 16 hours a day, said attorney Catherine Blakemore.  Jason's mother, a registered nurse, takes over the other eight hours of the  day.  </P> <P> Jason, who is blind, deaf, retarded and afflicted with cerebral palsy, must  breathe medicines and have his chest pounded five times a day to keep his lungs  clear. He must be repositioned in bed regularly.  </P> <P> Jason's parents, Russ and Monica Goldberg, sued the center last month to force  the agency to continue the 16-hour-a-day nursing it has provided since the  family moved to Orange County from Culver City in October. The center contended  that it could not afford to keep up the care and offered 32 hours a month  instead.  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge ordered the center to continue the 16-hour-a-day care  until a hearing today. But in the meantime, the agency agreed to maintain the  nursing care until a full hearing can be held on the dispute, Blakemore said.  That hearing will probably not be scheduled until March, 1990, she said.  CATHERINE GEWERTZ  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PEARY'S CLAIMS IN DOUBT;  </P> <P> RALPH PLAISTED IS NO LEGEND, BUT DATA SHOWS HE WAS 1ST TO NORTH POLE  </P> <P> When a researcher interpreting long-closed documents concluded recently that  the legendary Robert E. Peary was not the first explorer to cross the shifting  Arctic ice to the North Pole, it came as no surprise to Ralph Plaisted.  </P> <P> "We knew Peary didn't do it. All the members of our expedition knew it," said  Plaisted, who led a group of nine do-it-yourself snowmobile explorers to the  pole in April, 1968, in the first "indisputable" conquest by surface.  </P> <P> Still, Plaisted was an asterisk in the record books behind Peary until last  fall, when original navigational records, uncovered from Peary's 1909 dog-sled  voyage, indicated that the renowned explorer probably never got closer than 121  miles from the pole.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Peary Claim Certified  </P> <P> Though Peary's record has been in doubt from the day he returned, a Senate  committee and the influential National Geographic Society, which co-sponsored  the Peary expedition, certified his claim in 1911. Peary was promoted to rear  admiral in the Navy and retired on a comfortable pension.  </P> <P> "He became wealthy from books and lecture fees, but I didn't," said Plaisted,  now 61, sitting in a study adorned with clothing, photographs and memorabilia  from his expedition in the large mobile home he shares with his wife.  </P> <P> Plaisted said his own difficulties in the Arctic, including a failed expedition  in 1967, convinced him that Peary's claim was only wishful.  </P> <P> "He said he went to the North Pole in 37 days and came back over the same trail  in 16, and we knew that couldn't happen because the roads we built were gone in  a few hours," said Plaisted. "Up there, there're 5 1/2 million square miles of  ocean, and it's moving constantly."  </P> <P> His own expedition took "43 days, 2 hours and 30 minutes."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inner Contentment  </P> <P> For 20 years, Plaisted and his crew, which included a schoolteacher, a lawyer,  a doctor and a movie cameraman, had to content themselves with knowing inside  that they were first.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Plaisted ran his own insurance agency until 1971, when he and his  family built a log cabin near a remote lake in Saskatchewan and lived for a  year on moose and caribou meat, fish and canned food. He and his wife now run a  small fishing camp at the site for spring and summer vacationers.  </P> <P> "If I had started 20 years ago and tried to promote myself and say, 'I know  Peary didn't do it, and I know I did, and I should be in the history books  instead of Peary,' they would have said: 'It's just sour grapes. He doesn't  have any proof,' " Plaisted said.  </P> <P> Proof that Peary never reached the pole came when Baltimore astronomer Dennis  Rawlins unearthed and analyzed Peary's navigational observations from the day  he claimed to have been at the pole.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Calculations Don't Jibe  </P> <P> The notes, sealed for 50 years, didn't jibe with real observations, according  to Rawlins.  </P> <P> "The sun is virtually steady at the North Pole, whereas here we have it rising  rapidly," he said. "The position I've calculated from the data is 88 degrees  and 15 minutes latitude, 14 degrees longitude, if his clock was correct.  </P> <P> "It means he was 105 nautical miles (or 121 statute miles) from the pole."  </P> <P> Even National Geographic, a champion of the Peary legacy for nearly 80 years,  has published an article indicating that Peary faked his greatest achievement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disputed Diary  </P> <P> Wally Herbert, a British polar explorer, wrote in the magazine's September  issue that Peary apparently inserted after his return the page in his diary  where he celebrated reaching "The Pole at last."  </P> <P> Though evidence suggests Peary perpetrated a hoax, Plaisted, Rawlins and  Herbert all say he was a great navigator with a noble goal and shouldn't be  judged too harshly.  </P> <P> "He's 53 years old, his feet are frozen and he knows he's never going to do it  again, and he's 121 miles from the North Pole," said Plaisted, referring to  Peary's loss of eight toes in six expeditions. "With his supplies, he knew, 'I  can get there, but I can't get back.'  </P> <P> "I know he didn't want to lie."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Eager to Go Back  </P> <P> Because of the dangers, Plaisted said he "wouldn't go back there if you put a  million dollars on my desk right now."  </P> <P> His group spent months in northern Minnesota training on snowmobiles, which had  just been invented. They wore $1,000 synthetic outfits based on Eskimo designs  and signed up 89 financial backers.  </P> <P> When the expedition reached the pole -- "one mass of jumbled ice not any  different from anywhere else up there" -- Plaisted's group spent the night  waiting for a U.S. Air Force plane to fly over and document their achievement.  </P> <P> "The next morning at 10 o'clock we had to move our tents some 2 1/2 miles so we  could be in the same position as the night before," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Indisputable Attainment'  </P> <P> Three types of Air Force navigational instruments confirmed the 90 degrees  North position, and the Plaisted Expedition became known in the Guinness Book  of World Records as "the earliest indisputable attainment of the North Pole  over sea ice."  </P> <P> The discrediting of Peary's claim means that Plaisted will take his place  beside such polar record holders as Roald Amundsen of Norway, who in 1911 was  the first person to reach the South Pole and in 1926 reached the North Pole by  airboat, and Joseph Fletcher, the first person to stand at the North Pole after  flying there in 1925.  </P> <P> "I've been called and told they're going to change the history books," Plaisted  said, laughing. "I said that and 50 cents will get me a cup of coffee."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Welcomes Recognition  </P> <P> But he acknowledges that the recognition is better late than never.  </P> <P> "Now I can write the book I want to write" about the expedition, he said. "To  write it before, it would just be sour grapes to the National Geographic, and  they'd shoot me down.  </P> <P> "I should be very grateful that people created this hoax long enough for me to  be born, grow up and raise enough money to make the expedition," Plaisted said.  </P> <P> "If they had said Peary didn't do it, then there would have been someone who  would have before me."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A secret Senate session was held on 1 June. Foreign  Minister Carlos Figueroa and Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat  explained to the Senate the Chilean stance toward the free trade  agreement with the United States. The two ministers went to  Congress to participate in a secret Senate session, called  specifically for this purpose.    Foreign Minister Figueroa confirmed that his policy in  general is to uphold our country's independence and seek  benefits for Chile.    Minister Aninat supplied a detailed and complete report on  the possibility of signing this agreement.    [Begin recording] [Figueroa] We have participated in a very  significant Senate session in which all the remarks made by the  senators were aimed at making our foreign policy and the  international economic negotiations a state policy.    [Aninat] This was a very useful session because we gathered  remarks, comments, safeguards, and risks. Concerning this issue,  some senators believe in the possibility of incurring risks.    We have taken note and taken into account all the safeguard  elements the Senate has supplied us so that they will be taken  into account in future negotiations. [end recording]    During this session between the ministers and the senators,  it was confirmed that it is necessary for the Senate to keep  permanently posted on all NAFTA negotiations, bearing in mind  the U.S. Senate's significant role in all issues linked to  international trade agreements.</p>

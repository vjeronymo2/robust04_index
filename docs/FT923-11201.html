			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Council and UN chief make peace A ROW between the United Nations Security Council and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary-general, over peacekeeping in Bosnia-Hercegovina was resolved last night after long private consultations. Having decided a week ago that the UN should supervise the collection of heavy weapons from each side in the Bosnian conflict, the council accepted Mr Boutros Ghali's objections that conditions did not yet exist for the operation. The council invited him to contact all member states, particularly in Europe, to get personnel, equipment and logistic support for such an operation. He could then undertake 'the further preparatory work needed' for the supervision. The EC has also been invited to co-operate more closely with the secretary-general in an effort to resolve the Yugoslav conflict. In a report to the council on Wednesday he said the supervision plan approved in the recent London agreement had been adopted without consulting him and that, in effect, the EC tail was trying to wag the UN dog. The Community has been asked to consider broadening and intensifying the conference on Yugoslavia to help the search for peace. A UN recovery team yesterday reached a UN relief convoy which was stranded for 24 hours in a Bosnian minefield and both were on the move to safety, officials told Reuter in Sarajevo.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IF THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN CONTINUES THROUGH 1991, I WOULD . . . . . . PUSH  EDUCATION, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ROBUST TRADE OPPORTUNITIES AND CULTIVATE THE  PUBLIC-PRIVATE LINK.  </P> <P> Economically, California's future can be bright. But we cannot sit on our hands  and expect to provide jobs for our people if we cannot compete in the new world  economy.  </P> <P> Education is the golden key to the future of our people and our economy.  </P> <P> California must produce a skilled work force, because our economy is becoming  more specialized and requires skills to produce. I do not fear recession as I  do the failure of our students, schools and parents. We must recognize the  value of education, with a leader to point the way.  </P> <P> My way is early childhood education, performance standards for promotion and  graduation, full implementation of Proposition 98, more classrooms and  teachers, and pride in teaching and learning.  </P> <P> My first educational priority will be to begin a "California Jump Start"  program to provide an outstanding preschool education for every four-year-old  who needs it. The Safe Streets Act on the November ballot, which I am  supporting, provides some of the funding needed for this program. Additional  money would come from increasing education's share of proceeds from the  lottery.  </P> <P> We know that early childhood education makes a real difference in students'  lives. Studies have shown that children who attend preschool programs are 40%  less likely to drop out of school and 60% more likely to find a job once they  leave school.  </P> <P> If we are serious about reducing our high dropout rate and educating our future  work force, early childhood education is an important first step.  </P> <P> With the fall of the Iron Curtain, vast opportunities for world trade are  opening. In addition, California's location on the rim of the Pacific and its  30-million-person consumer market offer robust opportunities.  </P> <P> As governor, I will actively work to promote the sale of California's products,  both nationally and internationally. We can place a new emphasis on action by  consolidating the state's international trade programs, currently divided among  five different agencies, into a single agency reporting directly to the  governor. We also must expand our overseas trade offices into aggressive sales  representatives for California.  </P> <P> As mayor, I led several trade and cultural missions to Pacific Rim nations,  which increased port, airport and general business opportunities in San  Francisco. As governor, I would actively sell this state as a place of  tremendous opportunity for business and a source for quality products to be  sold abroad. Agricultural products, including the huge California wine  industry, need new markets, and I intend to go after them. I believe in free  trade and will do all I can to discourage restrictions, no matter how subtle,  on California's products.  </P> <P> In order for our business community to thrive and to continue to create new  jobs for California's workers, we must see that taxes on businesses are as low  as possible. I will veto any frivolous programs that would unfairly affect  California's business communities.  </P> <P> California needs a coordinated economic plan, so that government can be a  better partner for business. To this end, I intend to create a joint venture  for government, academia and business. This "California in the 21st Century"  effort will both plan and implement. It will provide the ongoing public-private  link to:  </P> <P>  -- Ease the impact of defense cuts on our economy by aggressively seeking new  non-defense-related contracts for California.  </P> <P>  -- Expand worker retraining and job referral services; consolidation of the 22  separate job training programs into a single agency could be cost-effective.  </P> <P>  -- Recommend infrastructure packages that can ease siting of new manufacturing  ventures. I am also exploring the possible benefits that would flow by  increasing the responsibility of Caltrans for the coordination of land, sea and  rail transport to ensure speedy movement of goods, and to see that our ports  compete with ports outside of California rather than each other.  </P> <P>  -- Do more to take advantage of innovative research and undertake new efforts  to encourage the transfer of new technology from the laboratory into the  workplace.  </P> <P>  -- Seek out and link up American and foreign companies similar to the New  United Motor joint venture between Toyota and General Motors. I want foreign  investment that provides jobs for Californians and new management know-how  rather than real estate speculation that buys up California.  </P> <P> Because of California's diversified economy, we can weather any potential  recession, as we have in the past. The main job of the governor is to ensure  the economic and social well-being and safety of the people of this state. I  intend to do my utmost to keep our economy pumping vigorously so that our  people can be employed. I intend to lead a campaign to make education and the  development of a skilled work force a statewide priority. And I will personally  promote California as a good place to do business, and see that we back that  promise up with action.  </P> <P> </P> <P> AN OP-ED DEBATE  </P> <P>  Recently The Times invited gubernatorial candidates Dianne Feinstein and Pete  Wilson to participate in a number of issue discussions on this page. Today's  question is: If the economic downturn continues through 1991, what are the  three specific things a new governor could do about it? Subsequent topics, to  appear in the coming weeks, will be the budget, drugs, the environment and  education.  </P> <P> </P></p>

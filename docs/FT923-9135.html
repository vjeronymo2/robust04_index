			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / People: Hartstone's Alan Cohen retires at 47 Hartstone, the acquisitive leather goods and hosiery company that has recently provoked some market uncertainty with its rapid growth, said yesterday that Alan Cohen, chief executive of the European leather goods division, is retiring. He is 47. Chairman Stephen Barker, who was previously boss of Albert Fisher before turning to tights and leather, says Cohen - whose family leather goods business Symphony International was bought by Hartstone for around Pounds 10m in 1989 - wishes to take a 'lower profile'. Cohen has built up the European division to sales of around Pounds 40m, and had already handed over the UK side - which forms the bulk of that division at present - to Jeffrey Nash six months ago. Barker added that Cohen's wishes suited the company's restructuring plans, according to which Trevor Brentnall, 45, chief executive of the North American leather goods operation, assumes responsibility for those products worldwide. Brentnall, previously a partner with City solicitors Turner Kenneth Brown before he joined Hartstone in 1990, is reckoned to have done a good job in starting the integration of last year's two big US acquisitions, Michael Stevens and Etienne Aigner. 'As companies grow, so the management structure evolves,' explains Barker. Cohen, with his father, built up Symphony over a period of 20 years; he will now act as a consultant for Hartstone on the organic development of its leather goods business across continental Europe in what Barker calls 'a fairly full capacity for at least a year'. Cohen is on holiday and was unavailable for comment. The other piece in Barker's new management jigsaw is American Robert Chavez, who was president of merchandising for the East Coast division of R H Macy, the large US department store which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January. He joins as ceo of Etienne Aigner which needs more attention than the fast-growing Michael Stevens. 'We have been courting him for the past six months and he has eventually decided to join us,' says Barker of Chavez.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GIANTS' MEGGETT ARRESTED ON CHARGE OF SOLICITING SEX  </P> <P> New York Giants running back David Meggett was arrested today and charged with  lewdness and soliciting a prostitute after allegedly offering to pay an  undercover female police officer for sex, police said.  </P> <P> Three days after scoring a touchdown in the NFL's Pro Bowl game, Meggett, 23,  was arrested around 11:45 a.m. by vice officers in the Fells Point area of  Baltimore, said city Police Agent Arlene Jenkins.  </P> <P> Fells Point is a restored waterfront area popular for its nightclubs and  restaurants.  </P> <P> The Baltimore Evening Sun said Meggett was arrested after he stopped his car  and allegedly called over to the undercover officer. When she asked what he  wanted, he said he wanted a date and was willing to pay $40, Jenkins said.  </P> <P> After a brief conversation, the officer signaled to other officers who were  watching and Meggett was taken into custody, Jenkins said.  </P> <P> Meggett gave police a home address in North Charleston, S.C. He was to have a  bail review hearing this afternoon. Both charges are misdemeanors.  </P> <P> As a rookie with the Giants, Meggett was voted to the Pro Bowl after finishing  fourth in the NFC among punt returners, averaging 11.4 yards per return, and  ninth among kick returners with a 20.5-yard average.  </P> <P> Meggett was the Giants' fifth-round draft choice in 1989, the 132nd player  chosen, after finishing third in the nation among NCAA Division I-AA players in  all-purpose yardage, averaging 179.1 yards per game at Towson State University.  </P> <P> He was voted to the NFL Pro Bowl after a rookie season in which he ranked  fourth in the NFC in punt returns and ninth in kickoff returns.  </P> <P> Meggett scored a touchdown in the third quarter of the Pro Bowl in Honolulu on  Sunday that gave the NFC a 13-7 lead. The NFC won the game, 27-21.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GALLERY ARTICLE COLLECTS KUDOS AND CRITICISM  </P> <P> As a gallery owner in Orange County who is committed to showing works by  emerging local artists, I would like to address some of the assumptions made in  Cathy Curtis' article in the May 28 Calendar ("Collecting Art in Orange County:  You Can't Always Get What You Want").  </P> <P> The black-and-white judgment that a gallery must either be a slave to the New  York/Los Angeles model or it must be "commercial" and completely without  artistic integrity or validity. What works in major urban centers is not  necessarily the best system for other areas of the country.  </P> <P> The unwillingness of the local media to give new galleries a chance to grow and  experiment. One commercial show and the gallery is seemingly banished forever  from serious critical consideration.  </P> <P> The shining examples of TLK and Jack Glenn galleries, which, no matter how  aesthetically successful they were, failed as businesses and are no longer any  use to the artists they represented or the collectors who supported them. Using  their owners and just a few other recurring sources for information on what is  happening in the Orange County art scene limits the view that the general  public perceives, and tends to perpetuate the gloomy atmosphere.  </P> <P> The assumption that unless a contemporary artist is working in a style that is  currently trendy or on the "cutting edge," the work has no meaning. By this  standard, no musician need ever interpret a Mozart concerto again -- after all,  it's been done before.  </P> <P> The artists that I represent are serious, full-time painters who depend on  sales made through this gallery for their livelihoods. If I must occasionally  show more commercial work to subsidize the exhibitions of more challenging  artwork, then I will. Exposing the gallery to more people has always directly  led to sales and new appreciation of works by the lesser-known artists that I  represent. This is what seems to work in Orange County.  </P> <P> PAUL C. JILLSON  </P> <P>  Jillson is the owner of the Pacific Edge Gallery in Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Mean streets Indonesia is sticking to its promise to sweep the normally teeming streets of Jakarta clean of transvestites, prostitutes, street vendors and beggars in honour of the Apec summit. Transvestites and prostitutes have been chased off the streets while vendors' food carts have been barred from the city centre. On-the-spot push-ups are being revived as punishment for jaywalking, though there have been no reports of foreign visitors being ordered to do push-ups. An American oil executive recently panicked when a transvestite dived into his car. Only after much shouting and 50,000 rupiah (Dollars 22) later could the oilman drive off unaccompanied.</p>

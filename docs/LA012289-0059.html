			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIETITIAN IN THE HOUSE  </P> <P> I write in reference to an item that appeared on Jan. 8. This was a small  question-and-answer item entitled "Medication, Changes in Diet Help Combat High  Blood Pressure" by Dr. Neil Solomon.  </P> <P> The question related to discontinuing blood pressure medication after a  normalized pressure was achieved. I believe Solomon did well to recommend  advice from a physician prior to making such a change, and to advise a diet and  exercise program.  </P> <P> What Solomon failed to do was to recommend the counsel of a Registered  Dietitian for assistance. Many people believe they have reduced their sodium  intake, but are unaware of hidden sources of sodium in our diets. The aid of a  qualified nutrition professional is helpful in developing a dietary regimen.  </P> <P> As an example, in a typical McDonald's lunch consisting of a Big Mac, a  chocolate milkshake, French fries and an apple pie, the public may be under the  impression that the shake and pie are OK, while the burger and fries would  contribute more sodium to the meal. While the burger is indeed highest in  sodium (979 mg.), the pie comes in second (398 mg.), the shake third (300 mg.),  and the fries have the lowest sodium content in this meal (109 mg.).  </P> <P> JENNIFER JENSEN,  </P> <P> Nutrition Counselor  </P> <P> Registered Dietitian  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

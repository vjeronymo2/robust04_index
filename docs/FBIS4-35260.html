			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 29 May (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak  received Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah at the  Presidential Palace this morning. Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  also attended the meeting. After the meeting, Musa said that  the Yemeni minister conveyed to President Mubarak a message from  Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. They also discussed the  Yemen situation as Basindwah reviewed the current situation.    During the meeting, President Mubarak emphasized the  importance and necessity for an immediate cease-fire and an end  to all military operations in Yemen, both in the south and north.    Musa noted that they also reviewed the current situation in  the United Nations and the Security Council, which will meet  Tuesday to discuss the situation in Yemen in an attempt to  foster an atmosphere to resume dialogue and encourage stability  inside this fraternal Arab country.    Basindwah said that he conveyed an oral message from  President Salih on the leadership's stance in Sanaa vis-a-vis  the ongoing events in Yemen. He said that the Yemeni people  greatly appreciate President Mubarak's deep concern to stop the  bloodshed in Yemen. He said that a cease-fire must be reached  within the framework of recognizing Yemen's unity and abolishing  any resolution to secede because it is illegal and to have a  recourse to the Yemeni Republic constitution.    Basindwash said that any measure taken by the Security  Council regarding the events in Yemen must emphasize the  importance of safeguarding the Yemeni unity and decomcratic  development, particularly because the general elections that  were held in Yemen on 17 April were the object of world  admiration. He stressed that Egypt is a big, leading, and  pioneering country in the whole Arab region, noting that  President Mubarak gave us advice and instructions that we  appreciated and were eager to listen to. If we do not seek  Egypt's help, whose else can we seek?    Answering a question on imposing unity by force in Yemen,  Basindwah said that unity had been established voluntarily in  1990, therefore unity already exists, so how we can impose a  thing that already exists. He stressed that the party that  resorted to force is the one who wants secession. Here Musa  interrupted and stressed that regardless of who started the war  the point on which we agree is that the continuing use of force  is not in the interest of Yemen, its unity, or stability.    Basindwah pointed out that they did not demand that all  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders surrender but some of them,  especially 'Ali Salim al-Bid, because he is the person primarily  responsible for current events in Yemen. He said: We still  recognize the YSP and wish to continue the dialogue with the  moderate leaders and those who believe in Yemeni unity.    Responding to proposals put forward by certain parties to  form a confederation as the best solution for the coming stage,  Basindwah stressed that Yemen has never been two countries or  two peoples. Proof of this is that when two states existed in  Yemen, they were called the two parts of Yemen. Confederation,  he said, is out of the question because there are no minorities  in Yemen and but one Muslim Arab people.    Musa stressed that Egypt demands first a cease-fire and from  there things can proceed on a positive rather than negative  course. He noted the role of the Security Council's proposed  meeting on a cease-fire resolution, to which Sanaa has agreed.  He pointed out that safeguarding unity through war is a losing  game and that unity itself is a demand that cannot be criticized  or assailed and must be preserved through the Yemeni people's  freely accepting this unity. Musa said that the dialogue will  take place among the parties of the crisis and if Egypt is asked  to play a role, we will be ready but we will not impose it.</p>

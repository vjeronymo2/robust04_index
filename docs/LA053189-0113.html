			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> 3-A SOFTBALL;  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO REACHES FINAL WITH 6-2 VICTORY  </P> <P> Mission Viejo High School took advantage of four first-inning errors to score  four runs Tuesday en route to a 6-2 victory over Ramona in a Southern Section  3-A softball semifinal at Alicia Park in Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> Michele Daugherty tripled home one run and scored another in the inning.  </P> <P> Ramona (22-8), which finished the game with six errors, cut the Diablo lead to  4-2, thanks to an error by second baseman Keri McDaniel and a run-scoring  single by Sarah Parry. But Mission Viejo came back with two more runs in the  fourth.  </P> <P> The Diablos (18-8) scored once on four consecutive hits -- capped by Jennifer  Ward's run-scoring single -- and got their second run of the inning when, with  the bases still loaded, Ramona first baseman Jennifer Sandoval threw wildly to  the plate after fielding Renee Pina's squeeze bunt.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo's Erin Fitzgerald (12-4) gave up eight hits, six coming in the  first three innings, but she was helped by a number of timely defensive plays.  </P> <P> "We got to them right away," said Mission Viejo Coach Jeff Cunningham, whose  team will play Covina, a 7-2 winner over Saugus, in Saturday's 5:30 p.m. 3-A  championship game at Mayfair Park in Lakewood.  </P> <P> "We played a little bit tentatively after we scored the four runs, and Erin got  a little unsettled in the early going. But she settled down after the first few  innings and pitched a good ballgame,"  </P> <P> Said Ramona Coach Angela Melander: "The first inning really killed us. You  can't make as many errors as we did in an inning and expect to beat a good team  like Mission Viejo. The errors we made were not typical of the way we have been  playing all season and it's a shame for us to end the season on this kind of  note."  </P> <P> While Ramona pitcher Angel Jaramillo (14-6) was being victimized by her team's  erratic play, Fitzgerald was getting help from her defense.  </P> <P> In the fourth inning, Ramona's Lisa DeGarmo reached first on first baseman  Renee Pina's fielding error, but shortstop Ward made a diving stop of Shelli  Chimelewski's hard grounder and touched second base with her bare hand to force  DeGarmo.  </P> <P> Then, with runners on first and second and two outs in the inning, Mission  Viejo center fielder Amy Bond made a diving catch of Rachel Heyse's sinking  liner.  </P></p>

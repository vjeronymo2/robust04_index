			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / The Hualon Project: Big assumptions made on costs and demand Hualon says its proposed plant near Belfast aims to compete with Asian producers' exports of polyester, polyamide and polycotton fabrics to Europe. The plant is to be built in four phases. It will initially dye and finish imported fabric, then weave and finally spin the yarn for fabrics to make low-cost clothes. However, the plant's viability and claimed benefits for the Ulster economy depend on questionable assumptions: That Hualon can compete with Asian producers on price. That there will be a sufficient market for its products. If the plant is to undercut Asian producers, its costs will need to be lower than theirs. But although its start-up costs are being subsidised, it is hard to see how this will be achieved. Savings on transport costs will be negligible because Hualon plans to import its raw materials from its own plants in Asia. And while Ulster's Industrial Development Board says the plant's technology will make it one of the most efficient producers in Europe, the same technology is already used by Hualon and many other producers in Asia. Meanwhile, the plant's labour costs will be considerably higher than its Asian equivalents. The British Textile and Apparel Confederation, which opposes the Belfast plant, estimates that with the proposed technology and output levels it would require only 950 jobs, rather than the 1,800 promised in the case that was put to Brussels. A 1993 index of labour costs in the spinning and weaving industry showed the Irish wage cost per operator hour to be 80 per cent of that in the UK. But in Taiwan, Malaysia and Vietnam the labour costs were only 57 per cent, 12 per cent and 4 per cent of those in the UK. Other producers have relocated output to other sites such as Turkey, Hungary and Egypt, where labour costs are 26 per cent, 16 per cent and 4 per cent respectively of the UK's. On the demand side, the odds also seem stacked against Hualon. European consumption of woven fabrics is contracting rapidly as clothing manufacturers, which buy most of the industry's output, move production to lower-cost countries. In the six years to 1993, total consumption fell 14 per cent. The decline is likely to gather pace after the recent deal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to end the Multi-Fibre Arrangements, which have long restricted cotton textiles and clothing imports from low-cost countries. Furthermore, the market appears to be contracting fastest at the low-cost end of the clothing industry, where Hualon has chosen to compete. European producers have tried to fight competition by offering greater flexibility and speed of delivery. Hualon will find this difficult because of its bulk-run production methods, which cannot be tailored to particular orders without raising costs considerably.</p>

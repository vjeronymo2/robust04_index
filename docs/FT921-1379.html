			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Ex-BAT chief to take chair at Cannon Street CANNON Street Investments, the industrial holding company undergoing a financial reorganisation, is to appoint a new chairman as it prepares for further disposals to bring down borrowings. The company is expected to announce on Thursday, when it publishes its results, that Mr Tom Long, a former director of BAT Industries, is to become chairman. He will replace Mr John Maclean, who took over the chair in December. Mr Long's appointment follows pressure from institutional investors who had wanted to see an independent non-executive chairman. He helped BAT to repel Sir James Goldsmith's unbundling attempts in 1989 and is a former chairman of Foseco, now part of Burmah Castrol.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Strategic Point at Straza Seized"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday a team of NOVA MAKEDONIJA journalists went  near a zone that has been occupied by members of the regular  Yugoslav Army, 250 meters into Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] territory. They also control a  strategic point on Mount Straza near Kriva Palanka, including 50  additional meters of territory, and therefore there is all  together 300 meters of territory under their control.  Macedonian Army patrols are being turned away from this area  with the following words: "Do not approach -- this is Serbia."  Members of the U.S. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] also took  up their positions yesterday. However, it is evident that the  Serbian Army does not have any intention of withdrawing.    For the chief of the Yugoslav Army General Staff, Momcilo  Perisic, the events on the Macedonian-Serbian border are nothing  but a media lie. Moreover, Perisic stated that Macedonia  accepted the UN forces, within which the Americans are the most  numerous, not for the sake of protecting the Macedonian people,  but for the sake of forming their own base.</p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Upheaval in prospect for the Canadian political landscape WILL he stay or will he go? Whenever the talk in Canada turns to politics these days, that question is asked of two of the country's most prominent and long-serving leaders, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa. Depending on what they decide, their plans could radically alter Canada's political landscape within the next two or three months. Mr Mulroney's resignation would throw new uncertainty into the general election, which will probably be called in late summer or early autumn. Mr Bourassa's departure would re-ignite the issue of Quebec's place in Canada just as it seemed to be dying down in the wake of the constitutional referendum last September. The shadows over the political future of the two men come from entirely unrelated sources. In Mr Mulroney's case, the pressure to step down is political. A strong body of opinion, inside and outside the Progressive Conservative party, believes that it would be better off entering the election campaign with a fresh face at the helm. Mr Mulroney, 53, who has been party leader for 10 years and prime minister since the Tories took office in September 1984, has been unable to shake off English-Canadians' visceral dislike of him. Although his government has trodden cautiously over the past year or two, Mr Mulroney's reputation remains dogged by the still-stagnant economy, by such policies as free trade with the US, and by his own public image as a sanctimonious wheeler-dealer. One recent opinion poll gave the Tories the support of only 18 per cent of decided voters, compared with 44 per cent for the opposition Liberals. Mr Mulroney is favoured as prime minister by fewer than one in seven voters. Mr Mulroney and his aides are giving no clue to his intentions, leaving political commentators to read their tea leaves. A cabinet shuffle this month was interpreted by some as evidence that he was staying, by others that he had decided to go. The latter view has been boosted by a series of patronage appointments in recent weeks, bringing back memories of the flood of jobs handed out by Mr Pierre Trudeau in the dying days of his federal premiership nine years ago. On the other hand, Mr Mulroney has chosen the very non-political chief of Canada's armed forces, General John de Chastelain, for the plum post of the ambassadorship in Washington. The question mark over Mr Bourassa is his health. He disclosed this month that the melanoma (skin cancer) first diagnosed in 1990 has spread to a lung. He recently underwent surgery in the US and may begin experimental cancer therapy next month. Mr Bourassa, 59, has postponed a decision on his future at least until the therapy starts. But that has not prevented Quebec's political temperature rising in anticipation that, even if he stays on for the time being, he will vacate the premiership this year. With a provincial election due in 1994, Mr Bourassa's political friends and foes, not to mention the media, have begun speculating on a possible successor. The big question is whether one can be found who matches both his popularity among voters and his shrewdness in holding together the federalist and nationalist wings of the Quebec Liberal Party. The only certainty about either Mr Mulroney's or Mr Bourassa's departure is that it would create greater uncertainty in assessing the political outlook for Canada. Few doubt that Mr Mulroney's successor would bolster the Conservatives' electoral chances in the nine English-speaking provinces - at least initially. The current front-runner is Ms Kim Campbell, a bright Vancouver lawyer whom Mr Mulroney recently shuffled from the justice ministry to the defence portfolio. As party leader, Ms Campbell or another westerner might have a good chance of outflanking the Alberta-based Reform Party, which has drawn many unhappy Conservatives on the prairies and the west coast with its populist, right-wing platform. Less sure, however, is whether another Tory leader could repeat Mr Mulroney's success in the past two elections in his native Quebec. The francophone province provides more than a quarter of the 295 members in the federal parliament in Ottawa, and its voters tend to rally around a single party at federal elections. The Conservatives now hold 56 of Quebec's 75 seats. A good showing in the francophone province is thus essential if the Conservatives are to have any hope of forming a third majority government. Although Ms Campbell is bilingual, she is virtually unknown in Quebec and has no power base there. For the Conservatives to have any hope of doing well there, a new leader from English Canada would need a strong Quebec lieutenant. The name most often mentioned is that of Mr Jean Charest, the up-and-coming but still lightweight environment minister. The prospect of Quebec losing two of its most influential federalist voices has already emboldened the province's separatists. Mr Lucien Bouchard, head of the Bloc Quebecois, which has eight MPs in the House of Commons, predicted this week that the number could rise to 60 at the next election.</p>

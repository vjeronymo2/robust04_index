			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: No mystery lurking behind employment statistics Sir, In his letter (August 19), John Wells raised concerns about the failure of the Department of Employment's statistics to show an increase in jobs to match the fall of 340,000 in claimant unemployment in the last 18 months. The employment data, derived from employer surveys, have long been subject to doubts about their reliability. The Labour Force Survey of households provides an alternative measure of both employment and unemployment trends. The five most recent quarters of data available from this source show unemployment has fallen by 260,000 and employment has risen by 230,000. There is still a discrepancy - albeit a smaller one - explained by a continuing, but modest, fall in labour force participation rates for men. As Mr Wells notes, labour force participation rates fall in recessions, but should improve in recoveries. However, this process operates with a lag. It takes time following the beginnings of a recovery for individual discouraged jobseekers to react to the signs of improvement and begin to re-enter the active labour force. Comparing the last two quarters, male labour force participation rates steadied and the balance between employment growth and unemployment decline was more equal. If the recovery were to continue and strengthen, labour force participation rates for men and especially women would begin to rise, and further falls in unemployment would indeed have to be matched by significantly greater increases in employment. It is not clear then from the LFS that anything particularly unusual or suspicious is happening. Mr Wells is, however, quite right to draw attention to the unsatisfactory nature of the official employment figures derived from employers.

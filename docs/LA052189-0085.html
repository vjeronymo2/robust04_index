			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUY WILLIAMS TRIBUTE  </P> <P> Guy Williams, who died this month, was talented, handsome and charismatic --  the perfect Zorro, with a subtle touch of humor and fencing finesse.  </P> <P> I first saw him as Zorro in 1957-59 when I was about 12. I rediscovered him 15  months ago when I got the Disney Channel.  </P> <P> Like the legend he portrayed, he will live on. In his films he will bring  enjoyment to yet a new generation 30 years from now.  </P> <P> Adios, amigo!  </P> <P> ANTOINETTE GIRGENTI LANE  </P> <P> San Pedro  </P></p>

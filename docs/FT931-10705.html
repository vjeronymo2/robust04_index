			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Travel: Where the Buddha's image takes shape - Justin Wintle discovers one man's Thai treasure trove IN Phitsanulok, a crossroads town 375 kilometres north of Bangkok, on the periphery of the mighty Menam basin, I had the good fortune to meet Sergeant-Major Dr Thawi-Pim Buranakhet, owner of the Buranathai Buddha Image Foundry. This came about because I had the good sense to visit the Sgt-Major Dr Thawi-Pim Buranakhet Folklore Museum, on the opposite side of the Wisutkasat Road. Sgt-Major Dr Thawi-Pim Buranakhet, one might say, is a man of many hats. He is also, given his many achievements and his status of national cultural treasure (human category), astonishingly modest. The museum, opened in 1982, is an old(ish) wooden house with just half-a-dozen rooms, although the 4,000-piece collection will soon be transferred to a modern purpose-designed concrete job which Thawi-Pim is funding from his own pocket and which will be opened to the public free of charge. It contains a wide variety of artefacts, including cooking utensils, clay pots, ceramics, handmade toys, simple weaving looms, puppets and, a little incongruously, an array of rusting phonographs. But the room Thawi-Pim takes most pride in is the room full of traps and snares, each designed for its specific prey and usually constructed out of bamboo. There is a bamboo funnel for placing over snake-holes, which the snake cannot wriggle out of; a bamboo pot that cockroaches fall into, prior to being boiled, and a very nasty iron thing for putting paid to porcupines. There is also a simple anti-ant device to thread on the hanging strings of cooking pots. How each of these contraptions works Thawi-Pim demonstrated with skill and measured glee. For some reason I was reminded of Q in the James Bond films, and his infernal instruments. The difference, though, lay not so much in the degree of ingenuity, which was controlled by the required task, but by the laboratory conditions in which Thawi-Pim's gadgets had been created, for they were all machines he had found in jungle villages. He told me that the collection represents a lifetime's search for the homespun expedients that Thawi-Pim believes embody the spirit and creative heritage of Thailand's peasantry - a heritage evolved over many centuries and now threatened by the spread of mechanisation. It is his aim, he said, to save what can be preserved of forgotten ancestors. Thawi-Pim was born into a poor family deep in the forests of Phitsanulok province. As a child, one of 12, he had to learn to hunt and forage. His farmer father, however, was also a painter, and from him Thawi-Pim acquired the rudiments of sculpture and drawing. When he joined the army, his commanding officer became aware of his talent and arranged for him to go to college. That education was eventually put to use across the road. When Thawi-Pim quit the military he began a Buddha image-making factory, now the largest and probably most respected in Thailand. His inspiration was the great Chinnarat Buddha, at the Mahathat Temple in Phitsanulok, a hugely venerated, somewhat austere bronze statue cast in 1357. In 1984 Thawi-Pim was awarded an honorary PhD by the local university. The foundry consists of a cluster of sheds in which the several stages of Buddha-making are carried out. With Thawi-Pim's help, I was inducted in the process. Each image is first modelled, under the Sgt-Major's supervision, in a dull maroon beeswax mixed with animal fats or coconut oil and tree resins. The model is then covered with a mixture of clay, sand and water to form the cast, and left to dry in the sun. Next, the encased image is oven-baked. After the re-usable wax has run out, the cast is left to cool before being fired in a kiln for 12 hours. It is now ready to be filled with molten bronze. Again, the ensemble is left to cool before the cast is chipped off. But the resultant statuette is nowhere near finished. Instead, it must be laboriously filed down and sometimes beaten. It is at this stage that much of the fine ornamentation is added, either with a chisel or from pre-moulded parts - such as the flame of enlightenment that adorns the top of the Buddha's head. Even so, the surfaces are not yet smooth enough. To achieve the desired finish, red and black lacquers are carefully painted on. Finally, the whole is dressed in gold-leaf. Only then is the image ready to be transported to a temple, where, in a ceremony that involves breaking lacquer seals added over the eyes, it will be blessed by saffron-robed monks. Each image takes up to a month to complete. Depending on the state of its order books, Thawi-Pim's foundry, employing 25 skilled craftspeople, produces between 100 and 300 a month. The average size, costing Dollars 1,200, is around 2ft high, with a pyramidical base. The largest, made in two main segments, reaches 12ft, while the smallest, at 4ins, sits comfortably in the hand. They are commissioned or bought by temples and private individuals, although Thawi-Pim's most regular customer is the Fourth Army, stationed on the city's outskirts. It is a technique that, in its essentials, has remained unchanged since the middle ages. The Chinnarat Buddha was created by the same process. To watch it in action is to discover how metallic ores found in rocks can become the objects of profound devotion - species-specific traps for the human mind.</p>

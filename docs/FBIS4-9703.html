			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 20 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Central American  leaders today praised the designation of Ernesto Zedillo by the  ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) as candidate for  the Mexican presidency, replacing Luis Donaldo Colosio.  Zedillo, a former secretary of planning and budget and of  public education, was campaign manager for candidate Colosio,  who was killed last week by two shots in the city of Tijuana, in  northwestern Mexico.    In a statement for NOTIMEX via telephone after learning of  Zedillo's designation, Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon  Carpio called for "strengthening relations with Mexico based on  respect for sovereignty and self-determination." Meanwhile,  Obdulio Chinchilla, president of the Finance Commission of the  Guatemalan Congress, said should Zedillo win the Mexican  elections on 21 August "there will be an opportunity to  restructure more dynamic commercial relations with Mexico."    In Managua, Nicaraguan President Violeta de Chamorro,  through  government spokesman Luis Rivas Leyva, expressed hope that the  PRI decision will continue maintain the normal course of the  Mexican electoral process.    Panamanian President Guillermo Endara commented in Panama  City that Zedillo's appointment was "a good selection."    Costa Rican Vice President German Serrano Pinto said "Mexico  has shown it has overcome the recent unfortunate events and  continues on the democratic path."    Nils Castro, one of the vice presidents of the Permanent  Conference of Latin American Political Parties (COPPPAL)  expressed his hope that the new presidential candidate "will  continue the same campaign program and the same government  platform" as Colosio.    In San Salvador, Ren Figueroa, deputy of the ruling  Nationalist Republican Alliance, said that "we do not doubt  Zedillo will follow the same path as Colosio, as he was one of  his closest collaborators."    Ciro Cruz Zepeda, secretary general of the Salvadoran  National Conciliation Party (PCN), said the new PRI presidential  candidate "is the best man" to assume that responsibility.</p>

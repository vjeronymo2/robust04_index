			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> QUESTIONS RAISED OVER GRANTING OF COMPUTER ACCESS TO BANE'S WIFE  </P> <P> The wife of Tarzana Assemblyman Tom Bane has been granted a privilege  ordinarily reserved for lawmakers and their staffs: her own terminal and file  in the Assembly's taxpayer-financed computer system, according to the Assembly  Rules Committee.  </P> <P> With authority to use the state computer, Marlene Bane, a top Democratic  fund-raiser not on the Assembly payroll, can correspond electronically with  Assembly members, write memos and research legislation and constituent  complaints as if she were an employee or lawmaker.  </P> <P> Bob Connelly, chief administrative officer of the Assembly Rules Committee,  said she was given the authority earlier this year at the request of her  husband's office. He said she may be the only legislative spouse authorized to  tap into the computer's data bank, although several other relatives of  lawmakers could also have access to the system.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Software Controversy  </P> <P> "It really isn't that big a deal," Connelly said, adding that 15 to 20 unpaid  volunteer staffers or Assembly interns also have computer accounts.  </P> <P> Three years ago, a controversy erupted about Marlene Bane's interest in Data  Plus Imagination of Van Nuys because her husband was urging the Assembly to  purchase its software. She reported selling her stake in the firm to avoid a  conflict of interest.  </P> <P> Now, two Republican assemblymen have questioned her use of the computer.  Assemblyman Richard L. Mountjoy of Monrovia, a critic of the Assembly's  computer system, said: "I don't know why she would be privileged to have  access" to the system, maintaining that the arrangement looks bad.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Gil Ferguson of Newport Beach said that if Marlene Bane is merely  helping her husband respond to constituent problems, she probably is not acting  improperly. Ferguson cautioned that to use the Assembly computer "for fund  raising would be illegal, as well as plain wrong."  </P> <P> Marlene Bane has emerged in recent years as a major fund-raiser for her  husband, a veteran Democratic lawmaker, and for Assembly Speaker Willie Brown  (D-San Francisco). With an aggressive team of solicitors, she has funneled  millions of dollars to Democratic candidates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scoffed at Criticism  </P> <P> But her husband, chairman of the Assembly Rules Committee, scoffed at the  criticism of his wife, maintaining that she uses the computer only for  legislative affairs. "What else would we use it for?" Bane asked in an  interview. "If there was anything improper about it, we wouldn't do it."  </P> <P> Bane called the services performed by his wife, who has a cubbyhole office  inside his Capitol office, a bargain for taxpayers. As an unpaid staffer, Bane  said, his wife "takes better care of my constituents . . . than anyone else  does."  </P> <P> Bane declined to allow his wife to be interviewed, insisting that "her opinions  and mine are the same."  </P> <P> Further minimizing Marlene Bane's access to the computer, Connelly said "it's  just a matter of time" before the public will also have access to some of the  material in the Assembly computer. He stressed that Marlene Bane must abide by  regulations that prohibit Assembly employees from using the system for  political or personal business.  </P> <P> Marlene Bane first attracted attention as a political mover and shaker in 1986,  when a dispute erupted over her ties to the firm that was marketing computer  software which her husband was urging Assembly members to buy as a means of  responding to constituent inquiries and mail.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Elaborate Index  </P> <P> The software grew out of an elaborate card file index that Marlene Bane  developed to track the reason each constituent contacted her husband's office.  A former Bane staffer said the idea was to put letters bearing the  assemblyman's name in constituents' mailboxes. "Even routine problems would  generate five or six letters," he said.  </P> <P> The Banes and Mike P. Shulem created Data Plus Imagination, which developed a  computerized version of the card file system. In part to avoid conflict of  interest, Marlene Bane sold her 25% stake in the firm for $1,700 to Shulem. Her  husband has said he insisted on the $1,700 price tag "because I didn't want  anybody questioning whether or not there was a profit made on the problem."  </P> <P> Later, another Shulem-controlled firm -- Monarch Constituent Services of Van  Nuys -- was among half a dozen successful bidders for Assembly software  contracts. Monarch has an increasingly large share of the Assembly software  market -- more than half of the Assembly's 80 members. In the past two years,  the Assembly has spent at least $1.3 million for computer software, including  $567,000 paid to Monarch.  </P> <P> During that time, Marlene Bane has remained active as a consultant on computer  issues, prompting some legislative sources to wonder whether she still has a  stake, personal or financial, in the success of Shulem's software.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sought Her Out  </P> <P> Among other things, in the past year, state Sen. Henry J. Mello (D-Watsonville)  and the staff of state Sen. Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk) have sought out Marlene  Bane to discuss how to use software to respond to constituents.  </P> <P> Mello said that from his perspective, "she was probably the most knowledgeable  person" about software. "She really did me a favor. We talked for about two  hours" about software and how it is put together, Mello said of his meeting  with Marlene Bane.  </P> <P> In addition, two legislative sources familiar with the Assembly computer system  say she participated last spring in at least two private meetings at which  problems with Monarch's software were raised.  </P> <P> Bane acknowledged that his wife took part in one session in which complaints  about the computer system were discussed. He said Assembly computer users  talked about problems at the meeting, which he believes Shulem also attended.  "We had problems with  </P> <P> our system, and she came in and explained the problems," he said.  </P> <P> Mountjoy said he is unaware of any Republicans present at the meeting. "We're  not invited to those. . . . We, as the minority party, are working in the  dark."  </P> <P> Mountjoy said Marlene Bane's access to the Assembly's computer underscores her  role as one of the most influential legislative spouses. As one lobbyist put it  two years ago, "She gets the power of an assemblyman without having to be  elected."  </P> <P> More recently, she has drawn attention to herself as chairwoman of a state  health panel that awards state research grants on lupus, a debilitating and  potentially fatal autoimmune disease.  </P> <P> Bane, his wife and other members of the state lupus board are being sued by a  coalition of lupus support groups which are charging that more than $1 million  in state funds appropriated for research has been illegally diverted to  non-lupus projects. At the same time, the state attorney general's office has  been auditing allocations by the lupus board and by a nonprofit lupus  foundation run by Bane.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Venezuelan Credit Bank has requested its  withdrawal from the National Banking Association because it does  not agree with statements issued by its official spokespersons.  This was announced by Venezuelan Credit Bank President Garcia  Mendoza, who described the National Banking Association's  communique on the way in which the Executive Branch has handled  the financial crisis as disrespectful.    Mendoza also did not agree with what National Banking  Association President Jose Bouza Izquierdo said, because  criticism is not among the duties of that association. Mendoza  also said that he does not understand how the National Banking  Association claims it works on behalf of the depositors during  financial crises because the bankers acted contrary to this.</p>

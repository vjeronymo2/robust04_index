			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [INTERFAX report: "State Duma Committee Rejects Proposal </F> for Increasing Budget Expenditure"]    [Text] The State Duma Committee on the Budget, Finances,  and Banks has not supported the Economic Policy Committee's  proposal for increasing expenditure in the draft 1994 federal  budget by 28.6 trillion rubles, Budget Committee chairman  Mikhail Zadornov said. In his words, today, when the budget bill  will be considered by the State Duma in the second reading, an  overwhelming majority of the budget committee members are going  to stick to the key stances on the budget deficit, revenue, and  expenditure that were outlined when the bill was discussed in  the first reading.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NEW GENERATION OF FAMILIES JUGGLE LOVE AND CAREERS UNDER THE BIG TOP  </P> <P> Laurie Reker, with the greatest of ease, fell for Jid Gutty on the flying  trapeze.  </P> <P> Marcia and Luis Palacio domesticated one another; now, the two lovebirds train  tigers together.  </P> <P> Circus performers traditionally have kept their acts in the family, handing  down taming, teetering and tight-wire techniques for many generations. Now,  "outsiders" -- performers who weren't born into circus dynasties -- are  juggling love and careers under the Big Top, too.  </P> <P> At the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, such acts include The  Palacios; The Flying Guttys (He's "circus," she's "outsider"); Tommy and Tammy  Parish, natives of Neodesha, Kan., who love to clown around together; and  American-Canadian animal act Lee and Judith Stevens, who consider themselves  parents of 16: two kids and 14 baboons.  </P> <P> "Before, when a child was born into a circus family, it was taken for granted  they would continue the act," Judith Stevens said. "Now, you're here because  you are very good -- not just because you were born here."  </P> <P> "My father worked 43 years at something he couldn't stand," her husband added.  "We're here because we want to be."  </P> <P> The Stevenses met in Canada in February, 1985, while working at a different  circus. They married four months later; two years after that, they took the  baboons on their "honeymoon" -- a working trip to Bermuda.  </P> <P> "We're just normal people doing unusual jobs," Judith said. "In a lot of ways,  it can be real hard; we never go home from work."  </P> <P> The Stevenses often travel with their sons, Alexander, 3 1/2, and Sebastian, 2.  In all, 20 children -- newborn to 14 years old -- tour with this  community-on-wheels, which employs 150 performers and 200 other workers.  School-age children study twice a day with Natalie Osbourne, a dancer and  certified teacher. Younger kids can stay at the traveling day-care center.  </P> <P> "It's a special day for a child to go to the zoo or the circus; my kids have  that every day," Judith said.  </P> <P> Alexander sometimes appears in the baboon act. "He loves to do it," his mother  said.  </P> <P> But the Stevenses are no stage parents. Judith fantasizes that her sons will  grow up to be doctors or lawyers: "Isn't that always a mother's dream?"  </P> <P> Marcia Palacio's mother never dreamed that her daughter would work in a cage  with three tigers, two lions, three leopards, two bears, two hyenas and a wolf.  Neither, for that matter, did she.  </P> <P> "My father's never seen the circus," said Palacio, who is from Staines,  England. "When my mother saw me work, she went through two packets of  cigarettes. I heard her scream."  </P> <P> It all started nine years ago, when the former ballet dancer, then known as  Marcia Spence, met animal trainer Luis Palacio, a native of Tijuana.  </P> <P> First, they became a couple; then, they became co-workers. Marcia started  tending baby animals, learning the ropes from Luis, who had worked for circuses  since he was 11 years old. In 1988, she stepped into the cage with her husband  and the big beasts.  </P> <P> "I was terrified," she recalled.  </P> <P> But she went into it with her eyes open.  </P> <P> On July 18, 1986, during another circus in England, Marcia Palacio had watched  in horror from outside the cage as a lion bit and slashed Luis. The badly  mauled trainer finally returned to work in May, 1988, with a jagged scar across  his jugular.  </P> <P> "Marcia went through the whole thing," Luis said. "She was there when it  happened and there through the surgery. She nursed me and learned to change the  tracheotomy and do injections."  </P> <P> After he recovered, Ringling had an opening for a two-person act. Despite the  job hazard she had witnessed, Marcia wanted to try it.  </P> <P> Now, Luis performs with several animals at the front of the cage while Marcia  controls the remaining animals at the rear. At the finale, Marcia rides a tiger  around the ring.  </P> <P> "It's very difficult to separate the relationship inside the cage and outside,"  said Luis. "Sometimes, when she makes a mistake, I scream at her; that's how I  was taught. But I'm growing."  </P> <P> The two relax by sightseeing. But even a brave lion-trainer has fears. Asked if  they saw the Empire State Building while working in New York City, Luis  shrugged.  </P> <P> "We'd have to go up," he said. "I don't like going up."  </P> <P> Going up is no problem for Jid and Laurie Gutty. Flying 32 feet above the floor  is their equivalent of a day at the office.  </P> <P> Laurie had just graduated from high school in Pompano Beach, Fla., nine years  ago when she saw Jid, a native of Bogota, Colombia, practicing his trapeze act  at an Orlando campground. At first they were just friends; it was the trapeze  that made her heart flutter.  </P> <P> "I fell in love with it," she said. "Something told me it was a way for me to  do something special."  </P> <P> The first time she flew, "I cried. I was very scared of the height. But I knew  in my heart I could do it somehow," she said.  </P> <P> After years of physical conditioning, Laurie became the only American woman to  master a triple aerial somersault.  </P> <P> Now, Jid is her husband, as well as her catcher. His face lights up when he  talks about the circus -- and about his wife's accomplishments.  </P> <P> "I love what I'm doing," he said. "When an audience responds, when people like  me, I feel proud. And I'm proud of what she's doing too."  </P> <P> How do they balance the demands of living and working together?  </P> <P> "You have to communicate a lot," he said. "You need to talk to each other all  the time on the trapeze."  </P> <P> "It's very hard," said Laurie. "You have to separate your personal life from  your professional life. And you still have to trust each other: Even though  you're arguing, you still know he's there to catch you."  </P> <P> The danger is even present for Clown Alley veterans. Tommy Parish ticks off  accident stories involving stilts and a runaway elephant cart.  </P> <P> "Nothing serious -- a few broken bones," said Parish, whose clown cowlick and  bulbous, red nose belie a modest, shy personality.  </P> <P> But the pratfall is no pitfall for a two-clown couple. The Parishes became  hard-core circus fans while growing up together in Kansas.  </P> <P> Twelve years ago, Tammy Parish was attending "regular-people college" when her  husband-to-be went to clown college in Florida and won a job with Ringling. She  followed his career path a year later. Since then, they estimate that they have  played to more than 55 million people.  </P> <P> Their clowning carries over into their personal lives.  </P> <P> On Valentine's Day, Tammy sang her undying love for Tommy, accompanied by an  original accordion arrangement. Then, she hit him with a pie that was hidden in  a big, red heart. "I can't carry a tune in a bucket, but Tom was touched  anyway," she says.  </P> <P> The Parishes say they have it better than other circus couples. When tempers  flare, noted Tammy, "We have access to foam hammers."  </P></p>

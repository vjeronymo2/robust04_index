			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Company News: MoDo slides into the red MODO, Sweden's third-largest pulp and paper company, has posted a SKr335m (Dollars 58.3m) loss for the first four months of the year, writes Robert Taylor. This compares with a SKr433m profit in the 1991 period. MoDo said yesterday that it feared that it would incur heavier losses over the rest of the year. The deterioration in MoDo's position began in the second four-month period of last year, when it reported a SKr102m loss. Mr Bernt Lof, president, said that rationalisation measures had lowered costs and that the company hoped to have saved SKr500m by 1994 as a result. 'My judgment is that the forestry industry has reached the absolute bottom of the business cycle,' he added.</p>

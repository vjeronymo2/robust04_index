			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Italian referendum campaign nears end THE final phase of a lacklustre campaign begins this week to convince Italians to vote in eight separate referendums that range from changes in the electoral laws to depenalising the use of drugs. The referendums, due to be held on April 18 and 19, underline the inability of the Italian parliament to carry out comprehensive constitutional reform. The outcome will determine whether Italy drops proportional representation in favour of a majority voting system in future elections. The campaign is being headed by Mr Mario Segni, the leader of the referendum movement who decided to end his 16-year membership of the Christian Democrat party two weeks ago. He has been the driving force behind the most politically significant referendum proposal - to abolish the existing system of proportional representation for electing the Senate. He is proposing that two thirds of the Senate is elected by a majority vote and the remainder by proportional representation to safeguard minority parties. Although the proposal does not apply to the chamber of deputies, if it is backed parliament will be obliged to extend the majority vote principle to the lower house. The other referendum proposals are: Abolition of the ministries of agriculture, tourism and state shareholdings; Removal of environmental controls from local health authorities; Ending state funding of political parties; Decriminalising personal drug use; Abolishing state control of bank/savings board nominations. Two other proposals have been removed by the constitutional court in the past two weeks since the government has already introduced compatible legislation. These cover the ending of state aid to the Mezzogiorno and the direct election of local mayors. All the main parties are now backing the Yes vote. The four party coalition government in particular does not wish to be seen as anti-reform. Opinion polls, never very accurate in establishing Italian voting behaviour, are agreed that the Yes vote will win. However, the percentage varies from 76 per cent to 58 per cent. The extent of support for the Yes vote will help determine the composition of the government after the referendum. A large vote in favour of the reform is likely to put pressure on President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to appoint a government with new faces and a distinct reformist stamp. Another factor likely to influence the outcome of negotiations to form a government is the promise of further revelations this week about alleged links between Mr Giulio Andreotti, the veteran Christian Democrat politician, and the Sicilian mafia.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Teksid joins Alcan in US joint venture TEKSID, the metallurgical products subsidiary of Italy's Fiat group, and Canada's Alcan Aluminium company are forming a US joint venture for the automotive industry. The new company, Altek Automotive Castings, will be based in Detroit and will include Alcan's automotive castings plant in St Catherines, Ontario. The joint venture excludes Teksid's aluminium facility in Tennessee, which has already established a strong position selling aluminium products to the big three US car producers. The joint venture will aim to develop and manufacture cast and composite aluminium components for the car industry. Alcan is one of the world's largest aluminium producers, while Teksid is a leading foundry group specialising in products for the automotive industry. Group sales amounted to L1,160bn (dollars 730m) last year. The joint venture will focus on the North American market. Altek's initial activity will involve making cast lower control arms for Ford's new Lincoln Continental model.</p>

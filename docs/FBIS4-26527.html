			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Guangdong Utilizes Over $4 Billion of </F> Foreign Capital in the First Five Months of This Year"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 12 Jun (TA KUNG PAO) -- Guangdong  Province has utilized almost $4.1 billion of foreign capital  over the first five months of this year, an increase of 40  percent over the same period last year. Guangzhou, Huizhou,  Zhanjiang, Shantou, Zhaoqing, and Jieyang Cities have registered  an increase of more than 50 percent. The exports of  foreign-invested enterprises throughout the province have  amounted to $1.9 billion. Foreign businessmen have actually  invested almost $3.5 billion, or 80 percent of the foreign  capital utilized by the province. During this period, more than  1,100 contracts have been signed with wholly owned  foreign-invested enterprises, each contract comprising $2.48  million in foreign capital.    According to statistics provided by the Guangdong Provincial  Economic Commission, investment in tertiary industries has  continued to rise, but investment in the real estate business  has been slowing down. In the first quarter, 597 of the newly  approved three type foreign-invested enterprises engaged in  tertiary industrial production, and percentage went up from 1 to  2 percent as compared with the same period last year. The real  estate business began to slow down following the rapid  development of the last two years. From January to March, there  were 159 newly approved projects throughout the province, a  decrease of 28 percent compared with the same period last year.    In the first quarter, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan  investments accounted for 94 percent, a decrease of 1.5 percent  compared with the same period last year. In the newly approved  enterprises during the same quarter, there were 19 British  enterprises, 62 U.S. enterprises, and three French enterprises,  an increase of more than 50 percent over the same period last  year. Regarding foreign capital actually utilized, Thai capital  increased by almost 50 percent, Australian capital went up 85  times, and U.S. capital 15 times.    The Guangdong Provincial Government has proposed a basic  idea  on the utilization of foreign capital in the future.    First, aiming at the basic realization of modernization in  20  years and utilizing foreign capital in a multidirectional  manner, Guangdong will strive to utilize foreign capital of $190  billion in the coming 20 years. Primary, secondary, and  tertiary industries will be opened to foreign capital, except  some special undertakings prescribed by the state. With the  exception of basic industries and monopolized undertakings with  state controlled stocks, foreign investors are welcome to wholly  operate other undertakings and projects or to control the larger  parts of their stocks.    Second, Guangdong will use the industrial policy to guide  investment orientation, so as to change the previous practice of  orientating policies to certain regions. By implementing a  preferential industrial policy, it will gradually switch the  foreign investment focus from processing industries to  infrastructure construction, basic industries, tertiary  industries, and hi-tech industries.    Third, the province will improve the results of foreign  capital utilization by strengthening management. Under the  conditions of a socialist market economy, it will establish a  mechanism by which the government can exercise macromanagement  over all enterprises, including foreign-invested firms.  Guangdong will formulate the relevant laws and regulations to  deal with the increasing disputes in three type foreign-invested  enterprises and to protect the legitimate rights and interests  of both management and labor.    Apart from this, as renminbi is currently in relatively  short  supply, foreign investors will be allowed to control large  portions of stock through direct investments. In addition,  Guangdong will fully use the internationally practiced BOT  [build-operate-transfer] method, investments by international  financial firms, and investments by loan foundations.    Viewing the new developments in foreign capital utilization,  Guangdong will integrate the use of foreign capital with pillar  industries. It will focus its efforts on developing energy,  transportation, and telecommunications facilities as well as  ethylene, automobile, electronics, textile, clothing, and  pharmaceutical industries. Moreover, it will encourage the use  of foreign capital in hi-tech industrial development, the high-  supplementary-value export processing industry, and foreign-  exchange-creating agriculture. Foreign capital will be  introduced in banking and retail businesses on a trial basis for  gradual popularization. In real estate, foreign capital will be  primarily used for industrial land development, the renovation  of old houses, and the construction of ordinary apartments. In  mountainous or slowly developing regions, foreign capital may be  transferred in an echelon formation; for the present, foreign  capital can still be used for labor-intensive industrial  development.</p>

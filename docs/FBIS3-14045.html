It is to be expected that a small community living in  exile with little hope of returning soon to its home should be  overwhelmed in equal measure by anger and sorrow. The squalor  and humiliation of life in ramshackled refugee camps, the  break-up of families, the loss of jobs and property and the  abiding fear about the disappearance of their culture must all  evoke widespread sympathy for the Kashmiri Pandits. What is  remarkable about the gathering is that in the midst of so many  depressing circumstances the true spirit of `Kashmiryat'  survives. Many delegates were able to rise above their pain and  anguish to urge the restoration of communal harmony and a  multi-ethnic, multi-religious society in Kashmir.    Let there be no mistake about it. It takes exceptional  courage and wisdom on the part of those who have suffered most  since the ascendancy of militancy in Kashmir to cling to such a  vision of the future. There were those, of course, who demanded  a separate homeland where Kashmiri Pandits could feel secure. No  one will want to blame them for this after what they have been  through. The sense of betrayal they experienced as a result of  the Central government's bungling on Kashmir over the years is  also a major impetus for the feeling of separateness that has  spread through the community. It must be hoped that in time and  with the redressal of many of their grievances in exile and an  improvement in the situation within Kashmir, all Kashmiris will  learn to put their faith once again in a multi-cultural state.  Some may, for political reasons, pander to the feeling of  Kashmiri Pandit separateness but such counsel should be rejected  as dangerous and self-defeating. As is evident from many parts  of the world where ethnic conflict rages, the effort to create  separate entities out of communities which have intermingled for  centuries ends in terrible tragedy and the most inhuman  suffering for all.    Initiatives like the World Kashmiri Pandit conference are  important. Not only do they provide a forum to bring scattered  Pandits together to air their problems and anxieties, but they  are necessary to draw national and international attention to  the plight of the exiles. Little is known, for example, about  how much Pandit women have suffered in the last few years. There  is much work to be done on the world stage. One can think of no  better mechanism than a standing committee of World Kashmiri  Pandits to inform the outside world about conditions in Kashmir  under rampant militancy aided by Pakistan. A more important role  would be in broadcasting to a largely ignorant western world the  Kashmiri Pandit version of Kashmir as a harmonious, multi-ethnic  society which Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Gujjars and many other  communities can call their home.  *</p>

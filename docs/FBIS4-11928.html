			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Council of Ministers held a session today  chaired by Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali. The  council reviewed the agreement signed in Cairo recently between  the PLO and Israel regarding the security of Hebron, as well as  the broad outlines in the agreement regarding the implementation  of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement.    Following the session, Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of  state  for Prime Ministry affairs and minister of information, told the  Jordanian news agency that the government considers this  agreement a positive step on the road to a comprehensive  peaceful solution that leads to the restoration of the basic  rights of the Palestinian Arab people on their national soil and  territory.    Dr. al-'Anani added that the Council of Ministers asserted  that the security measures agreed upon between the PLO and  Israel, namely, the temporary deployment of international  observers from Norway, Denmark, and Italy, will contribute to  the protection of the city and its holy sites, since these sites  are part of Arab and Islamic heritage. This is in addition to  the right of citizens to worship without any restrictions.    Dr. al-'Anani said that as a result of the massacre  committed  by the settlers in Hebron and the consequent martyrdom and  injury of dozens of people in the city, the Jordanian Government  asserts that the security measures will not be complete unless  the Israeli Government evacuates the Israeli settlers from the  city of Hebron. This is meant to return basic rights, after  settlements were established in the city, and so as to prevent a  repeat of the acts of violence that have claimed the lives of  innocent Palestinians.    Dr. al-'Anani said the PLO is about to undertake major  responsibilities in light of the expected developments -- the  Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories, and the PLO's  takeover of the territory from which Israel is going to  withdraw. The government would like to express its support for  the PLO so that it will be strengthened and so that can assume  its responsibilities in the best possible manner so as to  restore the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and so  that the Palestinian people can attain their rights in full.

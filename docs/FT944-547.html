			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Settlement row in West Bank Groundwork on a new suburb for 500 families in the West Bank Jewish settlement of Efrat, south of Bethlehem, has thrown the Israeli-Palestinian peace process into doubt. The Arabs of the neighbouring village of Khader claim they have grown vines on the disputed hillside for centuries; the settlers retort that they bought part of the 125 acres involved and that the rest was government land. To the Palestinians, the suburb looks more like a new settlement that an expansion of Efrat, which houses 1,000 families. Two of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's ministers have questioned the wisdom of building it when Israel is negotiating peace through territorial compromise. The decision will be reviewed at a cabinet meeting next Sunday. After violent clashes yesterday between the villagers and the Israeli army, Mr Sa'eb Erakat, the Palestinian Authority's local government minister, protested: 'This is the graveyard of the peace process.' Mrs Shulamit Aloni, Israel's outspoken communications minister, was the first to condemn the project. 'What has been done here,' she said, 'is theft by force of arms. We have to decide if we want to go forward towards peace, or if we want to go towards unending terror.' Mr Moshe Shahal, the police minister, agreed. Israeli forces yesterday arrested 45 Arab demonstrators and Israeli peace campaigners, who joined their sit-in on the hillside. After the protesters had been evicted, two bulldozers began levelling the ground.</p>

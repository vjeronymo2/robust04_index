			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: Top banks held back by loan-loss provisions TWO LEADING New York-based retail bank groups, Chemical Banking Corp and Manufacturers Hanover, have reported substantial declines in first-quarter earnings, largely due to continuing problems with loan portfolios. Chemical's earnings fell to Dollars 87m, or 74 cents a share, from Dollars 151.7m, or Dollars 1.55, a year earlier. Net of a restructuring charge and a gain from the disposal of a Florida banking group, last year's earnings were Dollars 101.7m. Earnings at Manufacturers dropped to Dollars 78m, or 87 cents a share, from Dollars 96m, or Dollars 1.21. Chemical's net interest income grew by almost 14 per cent due to the impact of lower interest rates on margins and a higher level of outstanding credit card balances. However fee and other non-interest income fell by 4.3 per cent as a result of lower trust revenue following the disposal of some businesses late last year, and of lower loan service charges. Loan write-offs, excluding third world loans, jumped to Dollars 120.9m from Dollars 59m, and loan-loss provisions rose to Dollars 135m from Dollars 70m. Non-performing loans, excluding third world debt, stood at Dollars 2bn on March 31, a 6.2 per cent increase since December. Manufacturers' loan-loss provisions have doubled in the past year to Dollars 144m. Although several of the bank's businesses have continued to perform well, its overall earnings have also been dented by higher deposit insurance premiums, investment in retail banking systems and the impact of the strong dollar on overseas expenses. Mounting loan loss provisions, especially in the troubled property market, have also pushed down first-quarter earnings at two leading California-based banks, Security Pacific and Wells Fargo. SecPac's earnings tumbled by almost a half to Dollars 96.5m, or 71 cents a share, from Dollars 188.4m, or Dollars 1.54, a year earlier. Wells Fargo's income dipped to Dollars 152m or Dollars 2.86, from Dollars 160m, or Dollars 3.04, last time. The one bright spot in SecPac's results was a 16 per cent jump in fee and other non-interest income. However this was more than offset by a 3 per cent drop in interest income, a 7 per cent rise in operating expenses, and a near-doubling in credit loss provisions to Dollars 271.1m, from Dollars 139.7m. SecPac's first-quarter provision was Dollars 97.9m higher than actual loan losses, excluding third world debt. Losses of Dollars 173.2m in the latest three months were substantially down from the Dollars 367.1m in the fourth quarter of 1990. Non-performing loans were Dollars 2.3bn on March 31, up from Dollars 2.1bn in December and Dollars 1.7bn a year ago. The increase is centred on commercial property business in Britain and the US, outside California, as well as other domestic loans. Wells Fargo's net interest income climbed to Dollars 631m from Dollars 560m, while fee and other non-interest earnings rose to Dollars 204m from Dollars 200m. Loan loss provisions, however, rose to Dollars 85m from Dollars 75m, and loan write-offs moved up to Dollars 67m. Wells Fargo's portfolio of problem loans, including non-accrual and restructured credits, totalled Dollars 1.1bn on March 31, up from Dollars 1bn three months earlier, and Dollars 752m on March 31 1990. Mellon Bank Corp, of Pittsburgh, said its higher first-quarter net income reflected increases in net interest revenue and service fee revenue. This was partly offset by increases in operating expenses and the provision for credit losses, as well as lower trading revenues. Net earnings rose to Dollars 68m from Dollars 65m.</p>

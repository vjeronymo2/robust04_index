			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) To cover the administrative costs incurred by the Secretary in implementing and administering this Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1208.51  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Influencing governmental action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No funds collected by the Council shall in any manner be used for the purpose of influencing legislation or government action or policy, except to develop and recommend to the Secretary amendments to this subpart. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1208.52  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Charges for late payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any assessment due the Council pursuant to &sect;1208.50 that is not paid on time shall be increased 1.5 percent each month it remains unpaid beginning with the day following the date such assessment was due. If not paid in full, any remaining amount due, which shall include any unpaid charges previously made pursuant to this section, shall be increased at the same rate on the corresponding day of each month thereafter until paid. For the purpose of this section, any assessment that was determined at a date later than prescribed by this subpart because of a failure to submit a report when due shall be considered to have been payable by the date it would have been due if the report had been filed when due. The timeliness of a payment to the Council shall be based on the applicable postmark date or the date actually received by the Council, whichever is earlier. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1208.53  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Adjustment of accounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Whenever the Council or the Secretary determines through an audit of a person's reports, records, books, or accounts or through some other means that additional money is due the Council or that money is due such person from the Council, such person shall be notified of the amount due. The person shall then remit any amount due the Council by the next date for remitting assessments. Overpayments shall be credited to the account of the person remitting the overpayment and shall be applied against amounts due in succeeding months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1208.54  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Refunds of assessments and escrow account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Any qualified handler may demand and receive from the escrow account, subject to the limitation on such payments provided in paragraph (c), a one-time refund of any assessments paid by or on behalf of the handler if the handler requests the refund before the initial referendum on this subpart is held and this subpart is rejected by the voters when it is submitted to the referendum in accordance with &sect;1208.60(a). Such a refund will be paid only if all of the following conditions are met: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The handler has paid the assessments sought to be refunded and has submitted proof of such payment; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The handler does not support the program established under this subpart and so states in the handler's demand for a refund; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The handler's demand for a refund is made on a form specified by the Council and filed not less than 10 days prior to the date when the initial referendum, conducted pursuant to &sect;1208.60(a) to ascertain whether this subpart shall remain in effect, is scheduled to begin; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) This subpart is not approved by a simple majority of the votes cast by qualified handlers in the initial referendum. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The Council shall establish an escrow account to be used for assessment refunds, as needed, and shall place into the account an amount equal to 10 percent of the total amount of assessments collected during the period beginning on the date this subpart becomes effective and ending on the date the results of the initial referendum are issued and the initial referendum is completed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) If the amount in the escrow account is not sufficient to refund the total amount of assessments demanded by all qualified handlers determined eligible for refunds and this subpart is not approved in the referendum, the Council shall prorate the amount of all such refunds among all eligible qualified handlers that demand the refund. If there is any amount in excess of the amount needed to pay refunds and expenses, it shall be returned pro rata to those who paid assessments. If this subpart is approved in the referendum, there shall be no refunds made, and all funds in the escrow account shall be returned to the Council for use by the Council in accordance with the other provisions of this subpart. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1208.55  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Postponement of collections. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The Council may grant a postponement of the payment of an assessment under this subpart for any qualified handler that establishes that it is financially unable to make the payment. In order that a qualified handler that is financially unable to pay an assessment may have the opportunity to petition the Council to postpone payment of such an assessment, as provided in the Act, the Council shall develop forms and procedures for this purpose as expeditiously as possible and submit them to the Secretary for approval and issuance after notice and an opportunity for public comment thereon. Such procedures shall, among other things, require that the handler demonstrate the handler's inability to pay through the submission of an opinion prepared by an independent certified public accountant (at the handler's expense) and any other documentation specified therein to the effect that the handler is insolvent or will be unable to continue to operate if the handler is required to pay the assessment when due. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The procedures for obtaining a postponement of payment to be developed by the Council for submission to the Secretary shall also include provisions with respect to the period of postponement, the conditions of payment that may be imposed and the basis, if any, on which further extensions of the time for payment will be granted so as to appropriately reflect the demonstrated needs of the qualified handler. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1208.56  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Determinations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The Council is authorized to make the determinations required by this subpart as to the status of persons as qualified handlers and exempt handlers including determinations of the status of persons as qualified wholesale handlers, distribution centers that are qualified handlers, producers that are qualified handlers, importers that are qualified handlers, as well as such other determinations of status and facts as may be required for the effective administration of this subpart. Based on such determinations, the Council from time to time shall publish lists of exempt handlers who are not required to pay assessments, and lists of qualified handlers who are required to pay assessments under this subpart. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

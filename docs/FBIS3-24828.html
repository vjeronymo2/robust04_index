The soldiers' armored cars had white flags symbolizing  peace,  and the movement of the artillery from the hill to the (Ha  Rakamose) Army Base was monitored by the Commonwealth special  envoys, diplomatic staff, and church leaders.    Speaking to the media, an army officer, Lieutenant  (Malefetsane Mabuluka), said the army has made a concession  regarding their previous demand for a 100 percent salary  increase. He said they will accept any reasonable increase the  government will make but appealed it should be in line with the  present rate of inflation in the country.    In his brief remarks at both Makoanyane and (Ha Rakamose)  Barracks the honorable minister of foreign affairs, Mr. Molapo  Xhobela, said he will inform his majesty King Letsie III and the  right honorable the prime minister, Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle, that the  mission toward the rebuilding of peace and hope in the country  has been accomplished. The minister also commended both  factions of the country's defense force for agreeing to lay down  their arms saying it is an encouraging step in the direction of  peace and tranquility in the country.</p>

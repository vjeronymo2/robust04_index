			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / The Markets: Aluminium plan under review - Commodities The aluminium industry will be hoping that niggling doubts about Russia's commitment to its output cutting programme can be removed at an international meeting in Canberra, Australia, on Wednesday and Thursday. Australia, Canada, the 12-nation European Union, Norway, Russia and the US will be reviewing progress with the scheme they agreed in January to reduce output by between 1.5m and 2m tonnes for two years so as to bring the market back into balance after a period of soaring stocks. Prices have risen strongly since then and stocks have begun to fall, but there are worries that those very facts may weaken the resolve of some companies to see the plan through. Russia, in particular, is giving cause for concern as it is believed to be well behind schedule with the second tranche of its promised cuts. Further concern has been caused by the news that Russia is not sending to this week's meeting the same senior negotiators who represented it at earlier talks. It has been suggested that one is not coming because he has been promoted. Other delegates will be hoping that is all there is to it. There is some disappointment that big producers outside the group, like those in Brazil, Venezuela and the Gulf states, have not emulated the cuts and that it has not proved possible to induct them into the group because of anti-trust worries. Progress with the cuts is being monitored by the International Primary Aluminium Institute, which is releasing June output figures for its members on Wednesday. Also on Wednesday, the US Department of Agriculture will be issuing its latest agricultural outlook report, and in Denver the US Cattlemen's Association will begin its three-day, mid-year conference. On Tuesday the privatisation committee of Minero Peru, the state mining and metals concern, is scheduled to announce the successful bidders for three big gold concessions.</p>

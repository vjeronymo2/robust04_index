			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BIG MIX;  </P> <P> CHINESE VIDEOS REINFORCE CULTURE  </P> <P> Don't let the video-jammed racks and posters of ravishing Asian starlets fool  you. A Chinese-American video rental shop is a lot like the communal well of a  traditional Chinese village.  </P> <P> The only difference is that the Southland's rapidly growing Chinese community  gets its juicy stories told on magnetized tape instead of by word of mouth.  Still, customers, shop owners and distributors agree, these videos from home  reinforce Chinese language and culture with a wide array of choices, including  Hong Kong detective thrillers, Mandarin-subtitled Japanese soaps and Tai Chi  Chuan exercise videos.  </P> <P> Just how many Chinese video shops are there in Southern California? It's hard  to figure.  </P> <P> Helen Soo, manager of San Francisco-based Hong Kong Video Programs Inc., a  distributor of Hong Kong-produced TV shows and movies, said her company  supplies 20 licensed distributors in Los Angeles who handle Cantonese-language  movies and serials. International Audio Visual Communication Inc., distributor  for Taiwan's three commercial television stations, supplies Mandarin-language  videos, mostly TV serials, to 25 licensed shops in the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> However, Soo said, there are also an indeterminate number of video shops, many  of them Vietnamese-operated, which exist by pirating videos.  </P> <P> S. C. Dacy, an independent film producer and avid Chinese movie fan, has a  simple way of evaluating Chinese videos -- he lumps them into two piles: the  "lousy" majority of TV soaps and the superior, action-packed, kung-fu feature  films produced in Hong Kong.  </P> <P> "From the perspective of world cinema, they (Hong Kong movie producers) are per  capita the best action movie-makers on the planet," he said about a genre of  detective-martial arts thrillers where the operative concept is dangerously  realistic stunts.  </P> <P> "In 'A Better Tomorrow II,' they have Chou Yun Fat -- a combination Chinese  Eddie Murphy and Tom Cruise -- walk out a house as they blow it up three feet  behind him," Dacy said. "Their stars are stunt men. If the Chinese want to see  a bunch of overpaid stars fake it, they can see American films."  </P> <P> After their near extinction during the early '70s, Hong Kong-made features made  a meteoric comeback in the '80s and are once again dominant with movies such as  "A Better Tomorrow" being dubbed into Mandarin, Cantonese and other Asian  languages.  </P> <P> But when it comes to sheer heart-rending delight, Ramona Bee, a mortgage banker  from Arcadia, said nothing matches the Mandarin-language soaps produced in  Taiwan. In fact, the 40-year-old Taiwan native is so addicted that she will sit  through 20 hour-and-half-long episodes in a five-day span each time the latest  soap comes to town.  </P> <P> Nor can Hollywood soaps such as "Dynasty" replace her Taiwan-made favorites.  "The American soaps are all about sex or drugs and power struggles," Bee said.  By contrast, she said, Taiwanese soaps are more sentimental and preoccupied  with Chinese family values and situations. They remind Bee of home and  childhood because they're based on pulp novels she read while growing up as a  girl in Taiwan.  </P> <P> "It's a Misty Future" is the quintessential Chinese soap, she said. It features  a Cinderella-like young wife who must stand up to a duplicitous mother-in-law.  </P> <P> "The girl is from a poor family and she marries into a rich family. But the  mother-in-law can't stand the girl. She has one face when the son is around and  another when he's gone. So finally, the girl leaves her daughter behind and her  husband goes blind.  </P> <P> "Then she comes back 10 years later as a private tutor. But (her blind husband)  can tell from the voice that it's her, but she denies it. Finally, it has a  happy ending. They are so melodramatic. I cry and everything."  </P> <P> Comedic ghost movies are another Hong Kong staple. But in contrast to kung-fu  fare, films such as "Rouge" -- a 1987 feature about a stage-struck prostitute  who comes back to haunt two jaded Hong Kong journalists -- are deeply rooted in  China's ancient Taoist belief in an ancestral spirit world. This fascination in  the afterlife can have some hilarious twists. For example, in one recent movie,  Dacy said, the protagonist prevents a ghost from reincarnating by hanging  woman's undergarments over the specter's head.  </P> <P> Some stores, such as Paul Chang's Video Land in Monterey Park, offer  pornographic videos produced in the Philippines, Singapore and Hong Kong that  appeal to non-Asian customers.  </P> <P> "I think it's curiosity," Chang said of his non-Asian customers. "They think  the Asian woman is different. Everybody is curious of the other person's back  yard. It's human nature."  </P></p>

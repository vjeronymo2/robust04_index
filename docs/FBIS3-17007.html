In view of the  success achieved at the interstate talks and the wishes  expressed by Latvian leaders, the group's command has decided to  hand over a number of military airfields and the assets of two  military schools to the Latvians by 1 April. There are still  161 Russian Army installations on Latvian territory. They are  manned by roughly 13,000 servicemen.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Regulator's plans may restrict Railtrack profits Tough curbs could be imposed on the profits of Railtrack, the company which has taken over British Rail's track and signalling, if proposals unveiled yesterday by the rail industry regulator are put into effect. Mr John Swift QC, the rail regulator, suggests in an assessment of the proposed access agreements to be signed between Railtrack and the train operating companies, that commercial pressures could require Railtrack to reduce the value of its assets and the level of return it made on them. He says: 'The combined effect might be to impose a significant reduction in Railtrack's profitability post-privatisation.' The tone of his 50-page paper suggests that Mr Swift will adopt a rigorous approach to Railtrack's efficiency and profitability. Its detail indicates the extent to which many practical issues involved in rail privatisation have still to be solved. Mr Swift questions whether the 8 per cent return on assets set for Railtrack by the Treasury is sustainable, because private-sector returns have fallen in recent years. He suggests that valuing Railtrack's assets on the basis of what it would cost to replace them may not be realistic and that their value would be set much lower in the commercial market place when the company is privatised. Mr Swift is seeking comments on the document, and on a second paper which looks at the question of increasing competition on the railway, by the middle of August. He plans to publish policy statements in November and April. Once agreed, a formula would apply for five years. Railtrack did not comment yesterday on the detail of the proposals but welcomed the start of the consultation process and the news that agreements would last for five years. Mr Swift said it was not the intention of his proposals to make Railtrack more difficult to float on the stock market. But he wanted to resolve the regulatory issues before the privatisation of BR was completed rather than waiting until afterwards as had happened with the water and gas industries. The consultation document says that in the early years Railtrack will have an incentive to improve its operating efficiency as its required return rises from 5.1 per cent to 8 per cent, but after that incentives related to the retail prices index may be needed. The company would be required to hold cost increases to a percentage figure below the retail prices index. The regulator will also want to see that the figure which Railtrack charges to depreciation in its accounts relates to actual spending on track and station replacement. He will also look for efficiency improvements in infrastructure maintenance. In a second document on the subject of competition Mr Swift says that he expects exclusive rights to run trains on a particular stretch of track to be granted only in exceptional cases and for limited periods. The government is keen to open the rail tracks to independent train companies operating alongside the franchised companies but this could make the franchises less attractive.

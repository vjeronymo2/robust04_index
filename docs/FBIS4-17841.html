			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mykola Slyusarevskyy, director of the </F> Scientific-Practical Center of Political Psychology at Ukraine's  Academy of Pedagogical Sciences, and Vadym Vasyutynskyy, head of  the Laboratory for the Psychology of Masses and Organizations:  "KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA `Experts' Are Free From Truth"]    [Text] KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA has published a bewildering  article by "an independent expert group" under the expressive  title "`Probable' Plans of Improbable Enemy." This probable  enemy of Russia is, as it turns out, Ukraine.    Since the article mentions our center and refers to the  results of our "secret" (classified) sociological research, we  want to clarify some points and make the "secret" open.    Thus, the Scientific-Practical Center of Political  Psychology  at Ukraine's Academy of Pedagogical Sciences (until quite  recently, it was attached to the Institute of the Psychology at  this Academy) has actually prepared and conducted a large-scale  poll among Ukraine's citizens living in different regions of the  country. From the very beginning, this research was not secret.  The preliminary and final results (not all, because even up to  now they have not been analyzed in full) were many times  publicized in the media (in the press and on the radio) and  presented at a scientific conference. In addition, the research  was carried out on our own initiative, according to plans of  scientific work, and not as "Kravchuk's assignment", as it was  stated for some reasons by the authors of the KOMSOMOLSKAYA  PRAVDA article.    We were amazed by the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA passage stating  that from 50 to 80 percent of population in Ukraine's southern  and eastern regions "support unification with Russia or transfer  to Russia's jurisdiction."    In fact, the direct question whether Ukraine should be  independent was answered in the affirmative by 60.5 percent,  with 18.4 percent undecided, and 21.1 percent opposed. These  results come from the entire Ukraine.    In three eastern oblasts (without Donbass) --  Dnipropetrovska  [Dnepropetskov], Zaporizka, and Kharkivska, 49.2 percent of  votes supported the independence, 18.5 percent were undecided,  and 32.3 percent were opposed. In two Donbass oblasts --  Donetska [Donetsk] and Luhanska, the vote distribution was 40  percent, 22.9 percent, and 37.1 percent respectively. In the  southern oblasts -- Mykolayivska, Odesska, and Khersonska, the  support for Ukraine's independent status proved to be still more  stronger: 52 percent voted "yes", 23. 5 percent remained  undecided, and 24.5 percent voted "no." Even in the Crimea, the  situation does not looks as it was presented by the authors of  "independent expertise" -- Ukraine's independence was accepted  by 37 percent of those polled and opposed by 31.5 percent, while  31.5 percent remained undecided.    We would draw attention of these respected "experts" to one  more fact. The idea that Ukraine will overcome its crisis only  if it is divided into federal lands (here is a suitable  opportunity for the transfers to Russia's jurisdiction!) was  accepted by 8.9 percent of those polled throughout Ukraine.    Now, we will present the responses of residents of those  regions which "are striving to escape Ukraine for Russia." In  the three eastern oblast, this opinion was accepted by 16.9  percent of citizens (unaccepted by 46.9 percent); in Donbass --  12.1 (51.7); in the south -- 6.9 (62.8); and in the Crimea --  3.7 (53.7). Thus, even if the Crimean sticks by to its poll  results, it is not the way, in which some would like to do.    Still, from where have our unknown "colleagues" collected  such "interesting" data? It is possible that they interpreted  -- in their original way -- the fact that Ukraine's  participation in the CIS economic union was supported by 58.4  percent of those polled, in particular, in the east -- 69.8  percent, in Donbass -- 83.2 percent, in the south -- 74.8  percent, and in the Crimea -- 81.5 percent. If one identified  the CIS with "the single and indivisible" [Russia -- words in  quotation marks in Russian], one would conclude that not only  the south and east, but entire Ukraine is striving to embrace  "elder brother," whereas the referendum on 1 December 1991 was  only an unpleasant misunderstanding. Is this not the point of  which KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA "independent experts" were trying to  convince us?</p>

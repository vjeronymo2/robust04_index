			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Ratner cousins share in Pounds 1m pay-off MR GERALD Ratner, the man who built Ratners into the world's largest jewellery group, and his cousin Victor shared pay-offs for loss of office of more than Pounds 1m last year, according to the company's annual report. For Mr Gerald Ratner, who sowed the seeds of his own downfall by describing one of the company's products in a speech as 'crap', the compensation was in addition to the Pounds 456,000 pay he received for his final 10 months as chief executive - making a total last year of more than Pounds 900,000. He was fined Pounds 160 for a driving offence in January after magistrates at Thame, Oxfordshire, ruled he had a disposable income of only Pounds 20 a week. He stepped down as chairman in January 1992, but remained as chief executive until November when he resigned after pressure from bankers and shareholders. His cousin Victor resigned as deputy managing director after a management reorganisation in February 1992 instigated by Mr James McAdam, the newly-appointed chairman. Ratners said yesterday that the cousins shared pay-offs totalling Pounds 1.01m, with Gerald receiving 'just under Pounds 500,000'. That was made up of one year's basic salary of Pounds 375,000, as quoted at the time of his resignation, plus pension, car and other benefit payments. Victor, who was on a longer, five-year contract, received slightly more than Pounds 500,000. Mr McAdam was paid a slightly more modest Pounds 288,000 for the year to January 30, including a Pounds 35,000 pension contribution. Mr Gerald Ratner is returning to retailing as an adviser to developers trying to convert Tobacco Dock, the failed shopping centre in London's Wapping, into a factory outlet centre where manufacturers sell surplus stock directly to the public at large dis-counts. His cousin has opened a jewellery shop in Kingston-upon-Thames, and plans more.</p>

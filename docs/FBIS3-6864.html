			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hungary has urged Thai commercial banks to open  their representative offices or invest in setting up commercial  banks in that country.    According to the Department of Information, Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, to invest in setting up a bank in Hungary  requires a capital of at least U.S. $10 million. Hungary agreed  to consider easing various constraints to pave the way for the  setting up of branch offices in Hungary by Thai commercial  banks. The country also wants to sell several industrial  products to Thailand, such as railway tracks, crop godowns, and  cooling system cables. Thailand asked Hungary to buy more Thai  products in return.    During the recent visit to Hungary by Deputy Prime Minister  Suphachai Phanitchaphak, Thailand proposed that Hungary use  tapioca as an ingredient for animal feed production. Hungary  asked Thailand's advice for the use of tapioca in animal feed  production. The country also agreed to serve as an agent to  bring frozen pork from Thailand for further distribution to the  commonwealth independent state.</p>

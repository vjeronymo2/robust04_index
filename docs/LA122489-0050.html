			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THREAT TO BALANCE OF FAIRFAX AREA  </P> <P> Bravo to Sam Hall Kaplan in capturing the essence of the Fairfax neighborhood  and the threat to its "sense of place" as we've known it ("Sensitivity Needed  to Retain Fairfax Area's Sense of Place," Dec. 17).  </P> <P> While it has been the soul of L.A.'s Jewish community for more than five  decades, the Fairfax area has also been home to a mixture of age groups and  income levels, all living in the same neighborhood. This is a unique phenomenon  in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> In particular, Fairfax has provided a "senior-friendly" environment for a  growing elderly population and affordable housing and social services have been  the area's mainstay. It has also been a neighborhood in which young couples and  families have chosen to start their lives together.  </P> <P> Through the years, there has been a delicate balance between the availability  of affordable housing and the pressures of gentrification, which prices low-  and middle-income persons out of their homes and apartments.  </P> <P> There has also been a balance between neighborhood-oriented commercial shops  (e.g. Fairfax between Beverly and Melrose) and regional needs such as the May  Co. Wilshire store or the old Ohrbach's. It is this balance that is  fundamentally threatened by the two development projects being proposed by  Farmers Market and Forest City Dillon (Park La Brea).  </P> <P> Clearly, a major new regional retail mall, three high-rise office buildings,  two new hotels, and more than 2,300 new residential units in Third and Fairfax  area would be a mortal blow to one of the great neighborhoods in the United  States.  </P> <P> Fairfax area streets cannot possibly absorb the added 50,000 automobile trips  that would be generated, and the socio-economic balance of the neighborhood  cannot survive the pressures of gentrification which would ensue.  </P> <P> The city, the neighborhood and the developer of these two projects need to plan  the future of these properties together and with sensitivity toward that which  makes Fairfax unique. To accomplish this, the developers must first set their  sights much lower as to what is the appropriate intensity of development at the  strategic corner of 3rd and Fairfax.  </P> <P> ZEV YAROSLAVSKY  </P> <P> Councilman, 5th District  </P></p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Seville and World Expo '92 (5): Gems from the wreckage - Medieval palaces are being restored MANY visitors to the Expo over the next six months will want to stay to see the older sites of a city that still has a remarkable beauty and a very distinctive architecture. But they will have to look hard for a sense of the past in a city that has, more than many of the other great cities of southern Spain, already suffered the ravages of the late 20th century. Compare Seville with the more intact cities of Cordoba or Granada and the differences are sadly obvious. Looking back at old engravings of Seville and even early photographs of the 19th century and there is a city intact behind medieval walls with tall towers and great gates. Today, those walls have gone and the visitor to Expo will have to search hard for ancient Seville. The reopening of the river and canal system of the Guadalquivir in 1971 brought visual disaster as well as industrial blessings to the city. It is hard to believe that Triana on the left bank of the river was once as picturesque as Rome's Trastevere or Florence's Oltranto. Seville's suburbs are featureless and the high rise blocks of the Los Remedios area have damaged much of the skyline. Tourists naturally flock to the great gothic cathedral where Columbus is presumed to lie in his giant sarcophagus. Around the cathedral in the small streets and gardens of the Barrio de Santa Cruz the visitor can find something of the old atmosphere that is strongly Moorish. Narrow streets of whitewashed houses lead to the shaded courtyards, filled in summer with orange blossom, roses and the heavy scent of lilies. But do not be too taken in by this area because many of the streets that lead to the Plaza Santa Maria and the Plaza de Dona Elvira were entirely rebuilt as recently as 1924. The real Barrio lies beyond this area of pastiche, from Santa Maria la Blanca to Plaza de las Mercerias. Here the visitor will still find the 17th century palaces of the Dukes of Bejar and the Marques de Marchelina. There are also churches incorporating the remains of mosques such as San Esteban and if you look hard there are relics of Roman buildings that are now parts of much later structures. The interesting thing about this area is that right up to the 19th century builders followed the rules - tall windows, iron balconies and cool enclosed courts. It was the development of the tower blocks of Los Remedios that caused the emptying of much of this quarter and led to its decay. This movement of population from the inner city coincided with planning laws passed during the Franco era which favoured speculation and led to excessive demolition and insensitive redevelopment. There was a reaction in Seville to the steady erosion of the older parts of the inner city, largely led by an organisation called Pro Sevilla. The initiative came mainly from the Duke of Segorbe who drew up a charter to encourage the participation of many of the leading Spanish banks including the Banco Hispano-Americano and the Banco Occidental. The Duke of Segorbe's family, the Medinaceli, played an important part in the history of Seville and their palace - the Casa de Pilatos  - is one of the city's most beautiful places. Pro Sevilla was unusual in the world of conservation because it set out to be commercial and to show that investment in real estate need not be incompatible with the conservation and careful urban renewal. In the early 1980s the organisation owned some 130 buildings in the areas of San Bartolome and Santiago. Some of these decaying houses and tenements were restored by Pro Sevilla itself, using traditional methods right down to old limewash techniques for painting the walls to ensure that they fade to the right colour. One of the most recently completed restoration and renewal projects is the creation of an apartment hotel known as Las Casas de la Juderia, in a section of the city that was for a long period home to the Jews. Many of the houses belonged to the Duke de Bejar and were palatial in scale. The conversion of this particular hotel shows that it is entirely possible to keep the best of the old and refurbish it so that it is a commercial proposition. Particularly well done are the internal arcaded courtyard gardens. Each apartment has either a courtyard or a terrace and the interiors are very sympathetically decorated. The restoration work of Pro Sevilla is exceptional because the organisation does not believe in the creation of pastiche architecture. Instead it commissions new elements for older buildings from the best contemporary architects. One tiny 16th century barber shop on Plaza de San Lorenzo (perhaps the haunt of Figaro himself?) is now a house with a spectacular modern interior. The Italian architect Aldo Rossi was commissioned to carry out the conversion of the Corral del Conde - his design to turn this building into flats is modern but conforms in scale and fenestration to its neighbours. Throughout Seville this year the example of Pro Sevilla seems to be catching on and there is a mass of scaffolding, building repair and cleaning. Behind the restored facade are new spaces for work and leisure that demonstrate the vitality of the old city. The political decision to pour money into the Seville region for Expo has benefited both old and new parts of the city. These funds cannot rebuild the medieval city but they are helping to retain the best of old Seville and give it new life.</p>

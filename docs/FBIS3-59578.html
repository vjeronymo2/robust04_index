			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bettina Weberling: "Grenades in the Blood </F> Vessels"]    [Excerpts] They are so small that they can wander through  arteries, veins and the smallest pipes. Like worms--supplied  with a long umbilical cord--the tiny machines crawl through the  human body or through motors, cutting or grating here and  widening there.    Micromachines such as these, which take over the maintenance  work in bodies or in machinery or independently carry out  environmental monitoring, are still utopian. But tiny individual  parts for these micromachines are already being developed.  [passages omitted]    Until now this field has been dominated by rigid endoscopes,  through which even simple, mechanically remote-controlled tools  can fit such as scissors, knives or hooks with which to catch  stones, for example. Such systems are offered by the  medium-sized companies Karl Storz GmbH and Co. in Tuttlingen and  Richard Wolf GmbH in Knittlingen, among others, each of which  has a world market share of about 30 percent.    But the next generation, with which small surgical tools can  find even better application, is already announcing itself:  semiflexible endoscopes, such as from Fujinon (Europe) GmbH in  Duesseldorf.    Unlike rigid tubes, the semiflexible endoscopes can be aimed  more precisely at the target in the body. Jochen Cramer, sales  director for Europe at Fujinon, estimates the existing world  market for such systems at DM 70 million, of which market leader  Olympus Optical Co. Ltd. in Tokyo has assured itself of 85  percent.    Such flexible endoscopes are also attractive when looking  for  damage in engines and drives. While conventional diagnosis of  heavy truck engines takes almost 10 hours because the engine has  to be disassembled into individual parts, with the endoscope the  analysis is done in a little over 30 minutes. As in the medical  field, the goal for the microtechnology developers is the  independent mini-machine, which undertakes externally controlled  repair work either by itself or with a joystick.    Before using it in the human body, however, the researchers  must still solve the energy question. While most micromachines  that pass through veins, those which so far have been presented  as prototypes, need power as an energy source, Wolfgang Menz,  head of the Institute for Microstructure Technology at the  Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center (KfK) is concentrating on the  fluidics, that is to say gases or fluids under pressure. "If we  use carbon dioxide or a physiological table salt solution, that  is harmless to the human," according to Menz.    Over the next few years he wants to develop an intelligent  endoscope subsidized by the Federal Ministry for Research and  Technology: A tiny robot which moves like a submarine in the  body's passages. It is equipped with a video camera which  transmits live pictures on the surgical video screen. The  operator who controls the submarine can manipulate various tools  when needed: A router removes deposits that could lead to heart  attacks on the walls of the blood vessels, a rotating knife  removes diseased tissue and a needle guided by the robot hand  sews up the fresh wound.    Among the first users of this technology could be Raimund  Erbel, head of cardiology at the University Clinic in Essen, who  has specialized in prevention of heart attacks. In theory  Erbel's micromachine is already perfect: a miniaturized,  rotating ultrasound head which scans the interior walls of the  heart and coronary vessels. The pictures from a person's inside  allow for much more precise conclusions regarding the danger of  heart attacks. "Right now we can only detect deposits once the  vessels are already up to 40 percent closed," says Erbel. "With  the ultrasound head we can see them even at five percent."    Furthermore, the type of deposit can be seen. This  determines  the choice of tool: a diamond-equipped router, which  mechanically eliminates the obstruction, or a laser which  vaporizes them. The tissue waste left behind by the miniature  drill is considered critical by many experts, but Erbel regards  it as harmless. The tiny pieces of calcium and fat, according to  the heart specialist, cannot endanger the patient.    But it will be years before Erbel has to deliver proof of  this. Microsystems cannot be used in the human body until after  extensive tests. This gives Menz, the researcher in Karlsruhe,  time to, as he hopes, develop equipment that works even more  targeted and less brutally than a router.    "After all, it has the effect of a hand grenade tossed into  the arteries," he says with vivid criticism of the vein drill.  For that reason Menz is concentrating on intelligent diagnostic  capsules which can be swallowed and on their way through the  body search for cancer, for example. Such a submarine could  then, according to the scientist's ideas, be immediately loaded  with the appropriate medicines for combating the degenerated  cells.</p>

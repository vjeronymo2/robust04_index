			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Observer: Prior warning As if John Major hasn't got enough problems with his backbench 'devils', he is also having to cope with stroppy businessmen. There was an unseemly incident at Heathrow when industry captains travelling to Tokyo with him boarded the British Airways chartered DC10. Some of the captains of industry were unhappy to discover they were expected to pass the 12-hour flight in business class accommodation, while the prime minister's party travelled first class. The most vigorous complaints were made by Lord Prior, chairman of GEC and former cabinet minister, who got himself upgraded to first class. But only at the expense of a secretary travelling with Richard Needham, the trade minister, who was unceremoniously shunted back down the aircraft. The seating was not the only shock for Major's flying compatriots. While the prime minister's party was given the usual red carpet treatment on arrival, the businessmen had to find their own way onto the tarmac, many carrying their own bags. The entire experience came as a bit of a shock to some. Lord Young, chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless, was good humoured about it all, even though he was obviously missing the red carpet treatment he got as Mrs Thatcher's trade secretary. Nothing like a bit of bag-carrying to keep one's feet on the ground.</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Prison officers back Strangeways bid PRISON OFFICERS at Strangeways, Manchester, have agreed to limit their right to take industrial action in an attempt to keep the management of the prison in the public sector. Rival bids from the public and private sectors to run the rebuilt Strangeways, severely damaged in riots three years ago, will be submitted to the Home Office today. The public sector bid will contain a procedural agreement between the Prison Officers Association (POA) at Strangeways and the present prison management. It guarantees that if the bid succeeds, standards set out in the management contract with the government would be maintained during industrial action. This would rule out all-out strikes and other highly disruptive forms of industrial action. Ministers have in the past characterised the POA as a militant trade union that has resisted change in the prison service. POA members at Manchester hope to prevent this reputation becoming a barrier to the public sector bid succeeding. Wolds, Britain's first privately managed prison, opened on Humberside last year and the new Blakenhurst, in Hereford and Worcester, will open under private management soon. The contract to run Strangeways - part of the government's programme of market testing public services - is, however, the first time the public and private sectors have bid against each other to manage a prison. The public sector bid to retain management of Strangeways is expected to face competition from about five private sector bids, with a final decision in midsummer. The deadline for Strangeways bids comes at an awkward moment for ministers in terms of another element of the policy to open up the criminal justice system to the private sector - private management of court escort services. Four prisoners escaped or were wrongly released last week during the first few days of privately managed escort duties by Group 4 Court Services. Group 4, which also manages Wolds prison, said it released one of the prisoners on the orders of a court. It is to meet the director general of the Prison Service to discuss the situation. Conservative backbenchers are concerned that further escapes might embarrass ministers over plans to extend the scheme. Staff seek to capture Strangeways, Page 10</p>

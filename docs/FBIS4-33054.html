			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 31  May.    Approximately 25,000 enterprises in Zulia State have been  thrown into a recession because of the latest fluctuations of  the bolivar. One business sector representative explained that  the dollar auction mechanism is hurting Venezuelan businessmen.  He said inflation and the lack of imported supplies are two  short-term consequences of the instability in the exchange rate.  He predicted there may be long-term mass layoffs and company  closures as a result of the economic decline. (Caracas Union  Radio Network in Spanish 0200 GMT 22 May 94)    Energy and Mines Minister Erwin Jose Arrieta has announced  Venezuela will obtain an additional $120 million as a result of  higher prices on the international oil market. He explained that  higher oil prices resulted in $70 million in additional revenues  last month. Arrieta attributed the increase in oil prices to  temporary conditions, such as repairs in North Sea oil  facilities, Nigeria's domestic situation, the conflict in Yemen,  and increased consumption by industrialized nations. (Caracas  Union Radio Network in Spanish 2200 GMT 26 May 94)    Venezuelan exports to Andean Group countries increased by  40.6 percent in the first quarter of the year, going from $195  million in the first quarter of 1993 to $275 million in 1994,  according to estimates by the Cartagena Agreement Board.  According to the figures, Venezuela replaced Colombia as the  largest exporter in interregional trade. The estimated value of  interregional trade amounted to $698 million.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Henryk Kunik, chairman of the Board of </F> the Katowice Chamber of the Metallurgical Industry and Trade, by  correspondent Henryk Nykiel; place and date not given]    [Text] [Nykiel] The past year was not the worst that the  Polish metallurgical industry has know to date. Does this mean  that it is on the way up from its worst depression?    [Kunik] Unfortunately not. Although it is true that, after  a few years of recession, we have noted a slight increase in the  output of steel and rolled steel products, as well as some  improvement in the industry's economic situation, the condition  of our sector is still critical. Our steel mills face the  threat that the banks will block their accounts and that their  supplies of power, gas, coal, and scrap metal will be  discontinued. The majority of our steelworks show an adverse  balance of payments. Exporting their goods often proves  unprofitable, while the chances of selling them in the domestic  market decrease steadily because there are not enough  potential--and solvent--customers.    [Nykiel] Are there no better prospects for 1994?    [Kunik] There are no indications of any surge of activity in  investment projects. Unless this happens, it is certain that we  will witness a decrease rather than an increase in production.  Sales dropped already in both January and February. In  addition, our steelworks have found themselves caught in a  costs-and-prices dilemma. The prices of energy and raw  materials, which influence the costs of production, are dictated  by official state monopoly-holders. Consequently, to balance  their accounts, steelworks are forced to raise the prices of  their products. But, by the same token, they become less  competitive and lose potential clients in both the free domestic  market and abroad.    [Nykiel] We also hear of the danger of competition from  outside....    [Kunik] ...which is most serious. Despite all of its  official declarations, the government still does not treat the  metallurgical industry as a strategic sector of the economy.  There is practically no protection extended to the internal  market (because imports tariffs alone are decidedly  insufficient). As a result, the domestic market is swamped with  cheap products from former CEMA countries as well as similar  goods from Western countries. At the same time, the European  Community, acting through Eurofer [European association of steel  companies], imposes on us trading quotas that serve exclusively  to protect the interests of EEC states. The EC's declared  interest in restructuring the Polish metallurgical industry is  more ostentatious than real, and it is largely restricted to  making empty promises clothed in winsome gestures. In reality,  major steel concerns have been preparing aggressive sales  programs in order to reinforce their position in the Polish  market by setting up whole networks of agencies selling their  steel products here.    [Nykiel] Is the Chamber of Metallurgical Industry and Trade  unable to force the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the  government to make and implement decisions that would allow you  to throroughly restructure and modernize your sector?    [Kunik] We notified successive ministers and prime ministers  many times of our alarm at the deteriorating condition of our  sector; we told them of the dangers threatening the  metallurgical industry, and, at the same time, we suggested  possible solutions that could avert these dangers. The central  administration arrogantly left all of our messages and alarm  signals unanswered. Recently, acting in conjunction with  individual steelworking plants, our Chamber prepared a  restructuring and modernization project, complete with a  timetable of recommended implementation and consistent with all  of the provisions written into the ministry's own study  document. We submitted this project to the Industry Ministry  and the government. We also drafted a proposal for setting up a  dedicated institution that could direct the implementation of  the project, as well as a separate proposal for creating a  strong organization, Polish Steel SA [joint-stock company], to  be endowed with the necessary powers and decisionmaking  competence to protect the interests of the Polish metallurgical  industry. Again, we have had no reaction at all to our  proposals. This silence is surprising even to certain bodies  within the European Community, which certainly expected the  Polish Government to demonstrate greater readiness to help one  of their more important state industries.    [Nykiel] We often hear allegations that Polish  steelworkers demand huge sums of money from the  government--money the government simply does not have.    [Kunik] That is not true. The main sources of funds for the  financing of our restructuring operations will be bank loans and  steelworks' own resources. We are first and foremost interested  in persuading the government to introduce appropriate tax and  investment policies and securing government guarantees on our  loans because, without such guarantees, we will be unable to  obtain funds for modernization and development from foreign  banks. On the other hand, we pin our hopes on obtaining the  necessary funds for social welfare provisions associated with  restructuring the employment profile of the sector from both the  budget and the World Bank--as we were promised according to a  provision written into the ministry's study document. We  estimate that, during the next six years, some 80,000 employees  will leave the metallurgical sector. This problem cannot be  solved by individual plants and their management on their own.  The only thing is that we do not know who will end up with that  particular milestone tied to his neck and dragging him into deep  water.</p>

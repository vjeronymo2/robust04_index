			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Loan loss provisions hit profits for World Bank THE World Bank has reported a sharp drop in last year's profits as a result of higher provisions against the risk that loans to the former Yugoslavia would not be paid back. Net income fell to Dollars 1.13bn (Pounds 750m) for the year ending June 30, against Dollars 1.65bn the previous year, after the bank increased its loan loss provisions by Dollars 610m to Dollars 3.15bn. The bank announced in May that it would increase its loan loss provisions from 2.5 per cent of loans outstanding to 3 per cent, citing 'a deterioration in the outlook for the collectibility of loans to, or guaranteed by, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina'. Yugoslavia was one of the World Bank's biggest borrowers, with Dollars 2bn of loans outstanding last year. While Croatia and Slovenia are paying their portions of this debt, Serbia-Montenegro, Bosnia and Macedonia are not. Bad debts from these republics, together with those of Congo, Iraq, Liberia and Syria, amount to 2.4 per cent of the World Bank's outstanding loan portfolio. The bank also increased its target ratio of reserves to loans from 11 per cent to a range of 13-14 per cent over the next two fiscal years. At the end of June its reserves amounted to Dollars 11.7bn, or 11.4 per cent of loans. While the World Bank is not a conventional profit-seeking corporation, its net income is important to its financial solidity, which enables it to borrow in the capital markets at keen rates. It also provides part of the money for the International Development Association, the subsidiary which offers low-cost loans to the poorest countries.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / World Trade News: US group near pact on Bangkok telecoms venture NYNEX, the US telecommunications group, is in the final stages of concluding a joint venture to build and run a network with 2m lines for Bangkok, Thailand. The total investment in the venture, in which the US company will take a 10 per cent stake, is estimated at Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.39bn)-Dollars 3bn. At one stage, it seemed as though the foreign partner in this venture, which has a controversial history, would be BT, the UK telecommunications operator. But the nature of the concession from the Thai government was altered after last year's political upheaval in the country. The intention is that Nynex will join forces with the Charoen Pokphand Group, the Thai agro-industrial conglomerate, to build a modern network for Bangkok. The agreement is expected to be finalised in the next few weeks. CP Group will own 90 per cent of the joint venture, TelecomAsia. As well as owning the remaining 10 per cent, Nynex will appoint senior executives and offer its experience in operating networks in densely-populated cities such as New York. Mr Fred Salerno, Nynex's vice-chairman, said Thailand was a growth area in telecommunications. In Bangkok alone, there was a waiting list of more than 1m lines, meaning an instant market opportunity. The network will be financed by means of a mix of equity, financing from equipment suppliers and income from customers. Nynex refused to divulge the size of its equity investment. Mr Salerno said Nynex hopes to do more business in Thailand, where concessions are due to be awarded for providing networks in other parts of the country. His company was also 'keeping an ear to the ground', looking for opportunities in Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Malaysia. Nynex already has projects to expand telecommunications networks in Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>

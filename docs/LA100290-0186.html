			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GE TO CUT APPLIANCE WORK FORCE  </P> <P> General Electric Co. said today it expects to put 450 to 500 hourly workers at  its major appliance manufacturing complex here on indefinite layoff by the end  of the year due to a softening economy.  </P> <P> The company cited declines in both the U.S. housing market and consumer  confidence for cuts in the production of washing machines and driers,  refrigerators, dishwashers and stoves.  </P> <P> "That downward trend is affecting our entire industry. The industry is down 3%  to 5% this year and we're projecting a 3% to 5% decrease in 1991," said GE  spokeswoman Laurie Simon.  </P> <P> The indefinite layoffs represent a 6% cutback in the hourly work force at the  Louisville complex, which employs 9,000.  </P></p>

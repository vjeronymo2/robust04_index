			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Brown sets out high-skill vision Britain needs to become a fairer society if economic efficiency is to be significantly improved, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, will argue today. Mr Brown will use a Fabian Society lecture to set out a vision of a highly skilled Britain in which all forms of privilege and discrimination have been removed. Building on remarks before last month's jobs summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Detroit, the shadow chancellor will argue that enhancing the value of labour is the key to Britain's future prosperity. This would require a programme of investment and training, including the creation of a university for industry modelled on the Open University. This should be accompanied by policies to reduce unemployment and reform the welfare system to ensure that it is geared to the modern labour market, rather than the one of 1945. Mr Brown will argue that the casualisation of the labour market over the past 15 years has produced a situation in which the root causes of unfairness in society are increasingly work-related. The government has falsely equated de-regulation with flexibility. Better regulation and not necessarily less regulation is what is needed.</p>

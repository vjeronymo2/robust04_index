			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Arts: Mixed feelings in 'Twelfth Night' - Theatre Part of what makes young Emma Fielding, the RSC's new Viola in Twelfth Night, so captivating is that she is made up of contrasts. She is elfin, tiny, vulnerable, with vast eyes; and yet she is forthright, living intensely in the moment, with an inquiring little nose that is a vital part of her profile, and an eager stance whereby her weight rests keenly on her toes. This mix of opposites is why she was so heartcatching as Thomasina when Stoppard's Arcadia was new; and no less so in Jonathan Kent's School for Wives at the Almeida. She is heartcatching again in Twelfth Night. Her voice is deep, strong, firm (though she does not always enter words cleanly enough), until in an instant some new thought renders it high, clear, light. This sudden illumination from within is what makes Olivia lose her heart, when in male disguise Viola tells her that she/he would 'call upon my soul within the house . . . And make the babbling gossip of the air/ Cry out 'Olivia]'' And it is what halts Orsino and confuses him when Viola/Cesario tells him that the history of her father's daughter is 'A blank, my lord. She never told her love . . .' She is surrounded here by a fine cast, but I am in two minds about the production that frames them. Ian Judge, the director, tells the play's story surely and briskly. Sometimes he is alert to its affecting shadows: the way we see both Viola and her brother Sebastian is potent, as is the moment of their final reunion. Sometimes, however, he treats it like the merest artificial farce. The funereal cypress shadows of the text are absent. And erotic affliction, which so possesses Orsino, Viola and Olivia, is never serious. Smiling charm abounds. The ending and the curtain-calls are as sweetly neat as a chocolate box. John Gunter's Elizabethan scenery is pretty but needlessly symmetrical and boxy: a tourist view of Olde England. And though Nigel Hess has written some fair songs, the taped muzak that he has provided at regular intervals makes Twelfth Night feel like a MGM musical. That it keeps turning back into a beautiful play, both robust and tender, is largely due to a superb cast. Desmond Barrit's Malvolio, a sour Welsh Frankie Howerd of unusual force, is a triumph of comic self-importance. Liverishly he fantasises about the day-bed 'where I have left Olivia' (pause, then, with lascivious delicacy) 'sleeping'. Bitterly he sobs out 'I thank my stars I am happy'. Tony Britton makes a touchingly noble Sir Toby Belch. The way he gently plants a line like 'She is a beagle' into the still air has the true Twelfth Night magic. There are excellent moments too from other players, notably Haydn Gwynne's elegant and eloquent Olivia. But the production lets her dwindle into an ignoble silly, and it never lets Bille Brown's Andrew Aguecheek grow from his hilariously absurd beginning into a three-dimensional study of perpetually feckless adolescence. Clive Wood is a commanding Orsino, both virile and narcissistic; but I never believed that either love or music had overwhelmed his senses. As Feste, Derek Griffiths projects his songs clearly; but his voice is far from mellifluous, and his manner the least charming onstage. I have the same mixed feelings about Ian Judge's Love Labour's Lost, currently at the Barbican. Truly mixed. In Twelfth Night, I love the way that, in the final scene, he suddenly beclouds the farce with Malvolio's fury. Then, after Barrit has hissed 'I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you,' the way he wipes a long strand of hair back across his bald pate returns us, ideally, to comedy in an instant. Just as fine are the thunder and lightning at the end, and the way Maria turns Feste out of doors - where he sings to us of 'the wind and the rain'. If Judge can build his understanding of these glorious moments into the whole fabric of a play, then he will be a great director of Shakespeare comedy. Right now he is a very good one who is sometimes not good enough. In repertory at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon</p>

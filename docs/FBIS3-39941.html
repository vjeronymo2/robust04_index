			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gilles Bresson: "Over Lunch, Chirac Gets Out His </F> Knife"]    [Excerpt] It just took a little drop in Edouard Balladur's  popularity to give some bite back to Jacques Chirac. The RPR  [Rally for the Republic] president, who used to be rather  reserved during the Tuesday [22 February] majority luncheons at  the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office], unreservedly  criticized Edouard Balladur's policy yesterday while enjoying  the cassoulet which was served.    According to a participant, the RPR president was "very  aggressive." He first criticized the prime minister, and more  especially [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard for not resuming  the nuclear tests. He explained to his interlocutors that in  their position he would have done so and that, technically  speaking, it was possible. He then wondered how Francois  Leotard could still have the courage to face public opinion  after lacking courage before the president of the republic.    Jacques Chirac, in brilliant form, did not stop there.  Taking the tone of "when will there be a decision on....," he  then demanded a reform of the electoral system for regional  elections. And he demanded a postponement of the municipal  elections until after the presidential election. On this last  point, Edouard Balladur gave him satisfaction. And Valery  Giscard d'Estaing acquiesced.    After these three fierce attacks, the mayor of Paris  attacked  Charles Pasqua. The interior minister is not in favor of the  RPR president's wishes with regard to the regional elections.  He thinks that there is no panic and he is extremely reticent  about regional constituencies. According to him, it would  amount to placing the other local communities under supervision  and would be a first step toward a Europe of regions. Valery  Giscard d'Estaing simply spoke of nothing but Bosnia.    The atmosphere at the luncheon, one leading member of the  majority said, "was strangely reminiscent of the `Gunslingers.'  The atmosphere was very heavy. They are now all firing on  Balladur. He is their target." The prime minister looked very  pale, seemed "completely cornered," and said virtually nothing.

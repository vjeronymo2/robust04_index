			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ground Self-Defense Force [GSDF] is now  maintaining 160 military bases (including sub-military bases)  across the country. The Ground Staff Office [GSO] of the GSDF,  which has studied ways to shape a new defense policy in tune  with the changes in the international situation, decided on 2  January to gradually reduce the 160 military bases to 99,  beginning in 1996 by closing or integrating 61 military bases,  or 38 percent of the total GSDF military bases. The scaleback  plans for the military bases are designed to enhance the  efficiency of the military bases across the country in parallel  with cuts in the fixed number of GSDF personnel. The GSO, which  has already established a principle of locating one military  base in one prefecture, plans to close or integrate military  bases in Kushiro, Hokkaido, Shinhatsuda in Niigata Prefecture  and Tsujiura in Ibaraki Prefecture.    The Defense Agency [DA], which plans to cut the fixed number  of GSDF troops from 180,000 to less than 150,000 when it reviews  the "Guidelines for the Defense Buildup Plan" which was  established as Japan's basic defense policy during the Cold War  era, has directed the GSO to study ways to shape a "desirable  defense policy."    While cuts in the GSDF troops are expected to cause an acute  shortage of personnel at many military bases, the reduction of  the defense budget is expected to force the GSDF to seek ways to  enhance the efficiency of military bases, and the GSO has  continued to work on the reorganization of GSDF units for more  than six months.    It has been pointed out that about one-third of the 160 GSDF  military bases are manned by less than 500 troops, progress in  upgrading their facilities remains sluggish, and the efficiency  of their management and maintenance remains extremely poor.  While sparsely populated areas near some military bases are  impeding normal education for children of GSDF members assigned  to the bases and hampering GSDF members from finding jobs after  separation, residents in urban areas are increasingly demanding  the closure of military bases.    The GSO believes it is indispensable to shut down or  integrate some military bases to resolve those problems. The GSO  has already unveiled plans to close small military bases and to  merge them into medium-sized military bases to be manned by more  then 1,500 men in line with the principle of locating one  military base in one prefecture while maintaining readiness for  emergencies.    Of 38 military bases in Hokkaido under command of the  Northern Army to prepare for the "threat from the North," 26  bases in Wakanai, Nayoru, Shimabe and Rebun will remain intact,  but 12 bases in Kushiro, Kuchian, and Kitageidei will be either  closed or merged into other bases in light of the need to cope  with emergencies.    At the time of the founding the SDF in 1954, GSDF military  bases numbered 102, but they have since continued to increase  during the 1960s and the 1970s because of administrative needs  to cope with sparsely populated areas and to send SDF members to  disaster-hit areas. The GSO's plans to close or integrate the  GSDF military bases are expected to draw a backlash from local  governments, which have vigorously lobbied to induce military  bases, and from legislators from constituencies where military  bases subject to closing and integration are located.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Confidence Debate Under Way"] </F>   [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 17 -- Sixty-one senators have put  their names down to speak in the confidence debate which resumed  in the Senate on Tuesday morning [17 May], official sources said.    Kicking off the debate today was Gianfranco Miglio, speaking  from the mixed group benches in his first address since breaking  away from the Northern League recently. Miglio said he would be  voting in favour of the new government, but went on to criticise  the government programme presented yesterday by Premier Silvio  Berlusconi, and the stance of the Northern League.    Describing himself as "disappointed and amazed" by that part  of the programme statement dealing with local autonomy, Miglio  said that the government was aiming not at "federalism which  guarantees liberty", but at "autonomy which covers centralism".    Miglio, until yesterday the Northern League's ideologue, is  in favour of dividing Italy up into three macro-regions in a  federative state.    The former Leaguer's defection from the governing Freedom  Front alliance enhanced fears of a confidence debate defeat in  an upper house where the ruling coalition controls only 155  votes, against the 164 needed. A no-confidence vote by Miglio  would have brought this down still further, to 154.</p>

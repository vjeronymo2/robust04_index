			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Wilson Bowden falls by a third WILSON BOWDEN, the housebuilder, estimated that it had earned almost 8 per cent of this year's expected turnover in 48 hours last month as buyers rushed to beat the deadline for the re-imposition of stamp duty. The rush came too late to benefit pre-tax profits for the first half of 1992 which fell by a third from Pounds 15.4m to Pounds 10.3m leaving earnings per share 35 per cent lower at 8.9p. Turnover fell from Pounds 65.4m to Pounds 62.2m. Mr David Wilson, chairman and chief executive of the Leicester-based group, said the group had shown resilience in difficult conditions; the interim dividend is maintained at 2.5p. It had made a good start to the second half mainly due to the rush to beat the ending of the eight month stamp duty holiday on August 19. Mr Wilson said: 'In two days we sold 100 homes worth about Pounds 8m. It is too early to say whether this will mean that there will be compensatory dip in September sales which would normally be expected to rise after the school holidays.' Housing profits in the first half fell by 35 per cent to Pounds 7.8m (Pounds 12m) despite selling 643 homes, only 7 fewer than in the comparable period. Mr Wilson blamed a 5 per cent drop in the average price of its houses from Pounds 80,000 to Pounds 75,700 for a fall in margins from 22 per cent to 16 per cent. Mr Wilson said that trading conditions, instead of improving after the general election, had worsened. As a result the group no longer expected to sell 1,600 houses this year. 'I shall be satisfied if we sell 1,300, the same as last year. At the moment we are running slightly ahead of achieving that target.' He said profits of Pounds 3m from commercial property sales of Pounds 13.5m, compared with Pounds 3.8m on turnover of Pounds 13.8m, was a good result given the general decline in the property market. In the past 12 months the group had increased its housing land bank by almost 30 per cent to 8,400 plots with planning permission using the proceeds from last year's Pounds 34.1m rights issue. It had also acquired 200 acres of land for commercial and industrial development around Leicester. At the end of June the group had net debt of Pounds 19m, subsequently reduced to Pounds 8m, compared with shareholders funds of Pounds 163m. The shares, which had fallen by 10 per cent in three days trading this week, yesterday recovered 22p to 248p.</p>

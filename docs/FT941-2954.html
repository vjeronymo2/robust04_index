			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Accountancy groups retreat from merger plan Growing signs of dissent are emerging among the UK's six principal accountancy bodies as they prepare a statement proposing a restructuring of the profession which could lead to a merger. At least half the bodies are expected to issue letters to their members in the next few days expressing disapproval of the statement or at the least failing to endorse its conclusions. The statement calls for the combination of the six bodies into three regional institutes of chartered accountants, with all members sharing the designation 'chartered accountant'. In an effort to present a single proposal for the future, none is expected to veto the statement when it is discussed on Monday by the consultative committee of accountancy bodies, which represents the six groups. It comes after nearly a year of talks in a working group chaired by Mr David Bishop, a partner with KPMG Peat Marwick. Each body will consult its members and report in November. The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants inflamed the debate last night when Mr Kenneth Duncan, its president, said at its annual dinner that an immediate merger would not work and called instead for closer co-operation under the existing structure. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland is opposed to a merger and has been angered by the Bishop group's failure to discuss its alternative proposals in detail. The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy is expected to take a neutral position on the statement. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants are mainly in favour. The statement, which contains 12 'principles', calls for common assessment standards and common entry standards for education and training. It says the three new bodies would co-operate closely on issues of common interest, such as international policy and education, through a successor body to the existing consultative committee. It recommends that this committee should include lay members for consideration of issues in the public interest such as practice regulation, ethics, discipline and professional standards.</p>

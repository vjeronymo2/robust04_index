			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- Japan's long-slumping  economy has gotten "much better" but a bottom to the recession  cannot be confirmed yet, the government's top economic planner  Yoshio Terasawa said Monday [13 June].    "The economy looks much better and I don't think the economy  will go much worse than it is now," said Terasawa, director  general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA).    But on whether the 37-month downturn has hit bottom, "I  should say that I don't know yet. All the figures I have are  six weeks old, seven weeks old," he said, answering questions in  English after a speech to foreign correspondents.    Of the uncertainties hanging over the economy, he cited the  dollar-yen rate and corporate capital spending, expected to fall  for a fourth straight year. "Should there be any signs that  equipment investments start increasing, then I really think the  economy...will catch up."    Terasawa said his agency is not more cautious on the economy  than the Bank of Japan. Yasushi Mieno, the central bank  governor, told lawmakers earlier Monday that the economy likely  has passed bottom and taken the first step toward recovery.    "Each agency here in Japan, being independent, can have its  own opinion," he said. But he added that he met Mieno during  the day and, "it seems that his view and mine are very very  close, if not almost exactly the same."    Terasawa continued his recent calls for deregulation and  reducing the "ridiculously profound disparities" between  Japanese and foreign prices.    Prices can be cut, regulations eased and multilayered  distributions systems simplified without severe unemployment,  asserted Terasawa, who spent more than 20 years as a businessman  overseas, much of it as a top executive for Nomura Securities Co.    But he did not explain how, offering only that there were  "too many go-betweens" in the Japanese economy and that some  people must "take disadvantages" in deregulation.    He rejected a suggestion that the nation's high prices  either  represent profiteering or are the cost of the traditional  lifetime employment system, saying, "it's not that simple."    Terasawa acknowledged that it is "not easy" to overcome  bureaucratic opposition to deregulation but said, "we have to do  it, no matter how difficult."    He declined to criticize the Ministry of Finance (MOF) when  prodded by charges that the ministry's powerful bureaucrats take  money out of citizens' pockets by pushing for tax hikes and  stifling attempts to cut prices.    "MOF is not our enemy, they're our friends," Terasawa said.  "I don't think MOF people are trying to dominate or trying to  lead the country" by insisting on fiscal rectitude.    Asked who would push for needed changes, the Japan New Party  upper house member chirped, "the Hata cabinet." He skirted the  question of how long Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's government  will last, but joked at the start of his speech that he hoped to  keep his job long enough to see his Monday comments in print.</p>

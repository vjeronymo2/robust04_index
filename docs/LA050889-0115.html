			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRAWL BETWEEN HENDERSON, HALL REPORTED  </P> <P> New York Yankees' teammates Rickey Henderson and Mel Hall brawled in the  training room at Comiskey Park on Saturday, according to a published report  today.  </P> <P> Henderson and Hall were joking before the Yankees' game against the Chicago  White Sox when the incident escalated into a brawl that had to be broken up by  Manager Dallas Green and other players, the New York Daily News reported in  today's editions.  </P> <P> Green rushed in from the manager's office at the other end of the clubhouse to  help stop the fight.  </P> <P> "You get that a lot in a clubhouse," Green said. "It doesn't bother me as long  as it's not serious. It's all forgotten today."  </P> <P> The outfielders are reportedly good friends.  </P> <P> Afterward, Henderson hit a game-winning three-run homer as the Yankees beat  Chicago 5-2.  </P> <P> Neither Hall, on the disabled list with a strained hamstring, nor Henderson  would discuss the incident. Before Sunday's 6-2 loss to the White Sox, both  were talking as if nothing had happened.  </P> <P> "Something like that starts out as fun," Green said. "They're fooling around,  and then it gets more serious as it goes along."  </P></p>

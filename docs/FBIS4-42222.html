			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Herbert Weber: "Kohl Catching Up Rapidly"] </F>   [Text] Six months ago it sounded like the purposeful  optimism of a potential loser. Confronted with devastating  opinion polls, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl felt obliged to  conjure up his own political upswing. Back then, not even his  friends in his own party expected him to win the 1994 Bundestag  elections. But the political compass May figures (conducted  exclusively for FOCUS by Basis Research) make his forecasts look  like prophesies: The economic outlook is viewed with growing  optimism, Kohl is catching up with his opponent Rudolf  Scharping, and for the first time since December 1993, the  CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] is  ahead of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] in the  traditional Sunday polls. Kohl's opponent has to make himself  familiar with the role of loser.    Never before have the Germans -- both east and west --  viewed  the general economic situation as positively as they have done  in May. Although pessimists still outnumber optimists, the  number of those answering "bad/very bad" to "How do you rate the  general economic situation?" has decreased since March (March:  49 percent, April: 43 percent, and May: 38 percent). Optimists  are experiencing the opposite trend. Their number has been  going up between January and May (from 15 percent to 23  percent). This is particularly significant as unemployment (60  percent), social policy (23 percent), and economic policy (21  percent) have been considered priorities.    With the number of people believing in an upswing  increasing,  confidence in the Federal Government and its leadership is  growing. Only 36 percent currently think that an SPD government  is competent enough to solve the existing problems, while the  figure was 43 percent last month. This means that the SPD is  only 2 percent ahead of the CDU/CSU in terms of economic  competence. The trend for the Union is clearly an upward one.    This also emerges from the Sunday poll. In the data  projected onto the actual voting behavior on 16 October, the  CDU/CSU comes out as winner in the political compass for the  first time. If there were Bundestag elections next Sunday, the  Bundestag would look like this: CDU/CSU 38 percent, SPD 37  percent, Alliance 90/Greens 9 percent, FDP [Free Democratic  Party] 6 percent, PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism] 4.5  percent, Republikaner 3.5 percent, and others 2 percent.    Asked for whom they would vote, if the chancellor could be  elected in a direct vote, voters expressed wide support for  Helmut Kohl. While the CDU chairman is supported by 38 percent  (April: 29 percent), Rudolf Scharping has plunged -- from 47  percent in April to 41 percent in May. In February, the SPD  chairman was still far ahead of Kohl at 52 percent over 24  percent.    One of the main reasons why the Social Democrat has lost  ground have been discussions in the SPD on its election campaign  and the supplementary surcharge.    The FDP is the problem child. The liberals are experiencing  a clear downward trend. They have lost another 0.5 percent over  April and would only be elected by 6 percent of the voters at  the moment -- the end of their time in parliament might be near.  It is doubtful whether the junior coalition partner will be  able to struggle to its feet again and will continue to tip the  scales. It does not have any outstanding personalities, and only  3 percent of those polled consider the FDP competent in the  traditional field of economic policy.    The parties will have to reckon with the PDS. The successor  party to the GDR's Socialist Unity Party has gained 0.5 percent  throughout Germany. This is all the more significant as it has  lost support in eastern Germany (from 15.5 percent to 14  percent). This means that support in the old laender has seen a  substantial increase: from 1 percent to 2 percent.</p>

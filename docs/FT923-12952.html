			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: US pulp and paper group breaks even for quarter GEORGIA-PACIFIC, the US forest products group, has reported break-even results for the second quarter, with a sharp drop in pulp and paper profits partly offset by a big rise in lumber income. The company announced earlier this month that its results would be 'slightly better than break-even' . This proved worse than analysts' expectations and produced a drop in its share price. The break-even figure, compared with net income of Dollars 29m, or 34 cents a share, in the second quarter of last year when the company was helped by a Dollars 29m after-tax gain on the sale of forests. Sales for the latest quarter, at Dollars 3bn, were unchanged from last year. The building products side reported operating profits of Dollars 163m, up from Dollars 132m, while paper and pulp dropped from Dollars 105m to Dollars 42m. Mr Marshall Hahn, chairman, said although pulp prices and demand had continued to improve, the company's communication papers, tissue and bleached board businesses continued to face excess capacity and depressed prices. Demand remained strong in container board. For the six months, the company reported net income of Dollars 5m, or 6 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 5.88bn, against a net loss of Dollars 44m, or 51 cents, last year on sales of Dollars 5.76bn.</p>

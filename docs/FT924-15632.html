			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (37): How to keep the clients happy - In its complex commercial operations, Arts Council Films can now track people, companies, events and the entire sales cycle / Arts Council Films; User view TO AVOID saying the wrong thing to sensitive and highly-valued clients, Arts Council Films provided its negotiators with a Market-Base sales and marketing database system. The organisation, a commercial department within the Arts Council of Great Britain, matches the arts programme requirements of the international television broadcasting industry with the plans and outputs of independent producers. Sometimes this leads to film purchases, at others it leads to funding for new films. The negotiators maintain two separate databases, one for broadcasters, the other for producers. Every significant detail of every conversation between Arts Council Films and its clients, on both sides of the fence, is recorded in Market-Base. This ensures that no-one makes the mistake of trying to sell a film that has already been rejected, or by pursuing a prospect who has little interest in the subject matter. Before the databases were created, the organisation relied on a collection of well-thumbed A4 notebooks. Mistakes happened and customers' confidence took a knock each time. Now, Market-Base ensures that such mistakes cannot happen. Even at an overseas show, such as the Cannes TV film festival, staff from Arts Council Films carry the databases around in a portable computer. Market-Base enables the sales team to plot every moment of a sales cycle, from initial interest to final purchase. Groups of records can be identified for mail shots. Something simple, like 'all men,' would be done automatically but something more complicated like 'all companies who would be interested in a programme about the Grateful Dead and modern composers' would prove more difficult. Because the databases contain only 1,000 people spread around 420 organisations, it is easier to tag prospects by hand. Whenever a new film or a proposal needs customers or sponsors, a master mailing letter is written within Market-Base and the mailing set printed automatically, getting name and address details from the tagged records. Before deciding on Market-Base, Arts Council Films seriously considered jointly developing a sales and marketing system with two other companies with similar interests. It also considered a Macintosh-based system. In the end, a consulting firm was hired to evaluate the organisation's needs and to identify the best product. Interestingly, the consultancy fee was much higher than the cost of implementing Market-Base. The four-user network version and a single user version for the portable machine cost Pounds 3,600. Market-Base was chosen because it most closely matched the organisation's need to track people, companies, events and the entire sales cycle. The other big benefit was that the Arts Council itself was able to tailor the screen and the reports to exactly meet its needs. Richard Gooderick of the Arts Council, who is responsible for buying the system, advises users to implement their systems piecemeal - 'some aspects of Market-Base have proved much more useful than I expected.' He adds: 'It doesn't matter how much time you spend beforehand, it's only when the system is working that you discover its real capabilities.'</p>

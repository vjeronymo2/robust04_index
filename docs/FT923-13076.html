			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Touche seeks BCCI papers THE HIGH COURT was asked yesterday to order the Serious Fraud Office to produce documents it has seized relating to the affairs of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The documents were sought by Touche Ross, liquidators of BCCI, which said they would speed up its work of winding up the bank. Mr Edward Bannister QC, for the liquidator, said most of the documents had been seized either from Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditors, or Control Securities, a company controlled by Mr Nazmu Virani and of which BCCI owned 5.2 per cent of the issued share capital. Other documents had come from the homes of Mr Agha Abedi and Mr Swaleh Naqvi, former officers of BCCI; from a safe deposit box in the name of Mr Zafar Iqbal, another ex-BCCI officer; as well as from the offices of Capcom, a broker through which BCCI conducted at least part of its operations. There was evidence that the Iqbal documents would be of very great importance to the liquidators, while the SFO had indicated that the flight log of a BCCI jet would be of use to them, Mr Bannister said. Mr Bannister said the SFO was willing to produce the documents but wanted the protection of a court order before doing so. He said it was estimated that there were upwards of 100m unfiled and unclassified BCCI documents available to the liquidators in 40 locations in the UK. So far Touche Ross was not halfway through sifting and collating them. The liquidators believed that the documents with the SFO would be of immense assistance, giving it speedier access to information. A large number of the documents related to work done by Price Waterhouse for an investigating committee initially set up by the government of Abu Dhabi. There were grounds for believing the documents contained information about what were called 'problem loans'. In particular, information about the relationship of certain companies and individuals who had dealt with BCCI in connection with problem loans. The case continues today. Mr Nazmu Virani, chairman and chief executive of Control Securities, who is charged with fraud in connection with BCCI, was yesterday further remanded on Pounds 1.25m bail until December 1 by City of London magistrates. Payments totalling Pounds 22m have been made by the Deposit Protection Board to 4,000 depositors of the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, disclosed in a written reply.</p>

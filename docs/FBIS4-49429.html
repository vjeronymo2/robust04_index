			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Zhaoguo, chief of the United Front Work </F> Department: "An Outstanding Achievement" -- first paragraph is  editor's note]    [Text] To give publicity to the CPC-led multiparty  cooperative and political consultative system, the relevant  department recently compiled the large picture album: "Famous  Democratic Party and Nonparty Personalities of China." For the  first time in China, this picture album comprehensively displays  the features of Chinese democratic party and nonparty  personalities, thereby portraying an angle of the success of  cooperation between our party and personalities outside the  party. Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the National Committee of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and chief  of the CPC Central Committee's United Front Work Department,  wrote the preface to the picture album.    The pace of history is advancing speedily toward the 21st  century. A review of this century makes us understand that the  main factors that have brought about profound changes in Chinese  society are reform and revolution. Hearing the clarion call of  the revolution, the predecessors and progressive forces of the  Chinese revolution, represented by Sun Yat-sen, overthrew the  reactionary rule of the Qing Dynasty, thus ending some 2,000  years of the feudal autocratic system in China. The Chinese  communists, represented by Mao Zedong, led the Chinese people in  overthrowing the three big mountains of imperialism, feudalism,  and bureaucrat capitalism, thus making China arise in the East.    In the historic choice for reform, the Chinese communists,  represented by Deng Xiaoping, have sought truth from facts,  emancipated their minds, unswervingly taken the road of  socialism with Chinese characteristics, and made world-renowned  achievements.    One of the most outstanding achievements in this great, epic  practice is the CPC-led multiparty cooperative and political  consultative system.    This achievement has enabled the CPC to unite with all  forces  that can be united and to enjoy the broadest possible sympathy  and support. This achievement has enabled a large number of  Chinese with lofty ideals to find the glorious path to serving  the motherland; participating in decisions on China's future and  in the formulation of major state policies; and contributing  their wisdom and efforts to the motherland's independence,  freedom, democracy, and prosperity.    A philosopher once said that history will not forget those  who created history. By providing pictures and explanations,  this large picture album being presented to readers has  collected for the first time the exploits of fanous Chinese  democratic party and nonparty personalities who have  participated in creating this glorious history, so as to display  their features to the whole country and the world. Without  question, this achievement will become richer and more  developed, and will shine with even more splendor in the  historic course of peacefully reunifying the motherland and  achieving the Chinese nation's great revitalization under the  leadership of the CPC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core.</p>

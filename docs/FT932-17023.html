			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: LWT advances 62% to Pounds 31m SIR CHRISTOPHER Bland, chairman of LWT (Holdings), said LWT would see significant growth in advertising revenue in the first quarter and that the outlook for the rest of the year was 'encouraging'. The optimistic forecast for 1993 came as Sir Christopher announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 30.6m for 1992, an increase of 62 per cent. If FRS 3 had not been adopted profits would have increased by 27 per cent year-on-year. In what Sir Christopher described as 'an extremely good year' LWT increased operating profit before Exchequer Levy by 6.8 per cent although advertising revenue rose only 3.9 per cent. The ITV company's profits were boosted by reduction in levy payments from Pounds 16.8m in 1991 compared with Pounds 10.5m last year. Fully diluted earnings per share increased 59 per cent to 18.9p. Net debt amounted to Pounds 5.4m, a reduction of Pounds 22m during the year with net gearing of 12.7 per cent. During the year, following a 50 per cent increase in the fixed preferred dividend with effect from July 1 1992 to 5.9p, fixed preferred dividends of 4.9p were paid to preference shareholders. The company said that it intended to move to a progressive dividend policy 'reflecting a level of payment and cover appropriate to LWT's performance and cash position.' LWT paid a relatively modest Pounds 7.58m bid to retain its London weekend franchise. The shares rose 23p to 378p.</p>

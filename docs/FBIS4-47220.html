			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KAZTAG: "Acquire and Dispose...."] </F>   [Text] To implement the president's Decree on Further  Improvement of Land Relations, the Cabinet of Ministers has  adopted the procedure for individuals and legal entities of the  republic to buy and sell the right of heritable life possession,  use, or lease of plots of land. The State Committee for Land  Relations and Land Development has been ordered to make the  necessary adjustments in the base rates of the appraised sale  value of these rights on the basis of the data of the state  statistical service on the overall level of inflation.    Heads of local administrations, individuals, and legal  entities (excepting state agricultural enterprises) of the  republic may be sellers of the right of heritable life  possession, use, or lease of plots of land, and citizens of the  republic may be buyers.    A right of heritable life possession of land is purchased  pursuant to Article 48, paragraph 3, of the republic Land Code  and point 5 of the president's 24 January 1994 decree "On  Certain Aspects of Regulating Land Relations." Legal entities of  the republic (excepting state agricultural enterprises) may also  purchase the right to use or lease a plot of land.    Foreign legal entities and individuals are granted plots of  land for temporary use on a lease basis pursuant to the  regulation on the procedure for granting the use of land to  joint ventures, international associations and organizations,  and foreign legal entities and individuals, to perform an  activity on the territory of the republic, as set forth in the  Supreme Soviet decree dated 3 July 1992.    Citizens of the republic are granted without compensation  the  right of heritable life possession of land to operate a peasant  farm or private farm, for market gardening, and for construction  of a private dwelling or dacha within the limits of the quota  established for the respective use, and the right of heritable  life possession of land in excess of those quotas may be  purchased from the head of the local administration.    Local representative and executive bodies fix the size of  plots of land to which individuals may be granted the right of  heritable life possession for these purposes without  compensation.    Individuals who, when the president's 5 April 1994 decree  "On  Further Improvement of Land Relations" took effect held plots of  land whose size exceeds that quota retain in all cases the right  of heritable life possession of the portion of the plot of land  that exceeds that quota.    Individuals who previously acquired heritable life  possession  of plots of land to operate a peasant or private farm, for  market gardening, or for construction of a private dwelling or  dacha may sell to other individuals and legal entities of the  republic their right of possession of plots whose size does not  exceed the established quota.    In cases when the total area of plots of land exceeds that  quota, before conducting a sales transaction individuals must  buy from the head of the local administration the right of  possession of the portion of the plot that exceeds the  established quota.    Individuals granted land to operate a private farm, for  market gardening, or for construction of a private dwelling or  dacha may sell the right of heritable life possession of a  portion of the plot. Use of that portion of the plot must  conform to current legislation.    Individuals and legal entities of the republic who have been  granted use of plots of land or have leased them for  nonagricultural purposes (except for the purposes of  construction of a private dwelling or dacha) may sell that right  to individuals and legal entities of the republic only when they  have purchased that right from the head of the local  administration.    On acquiring the right of ownership to immovable property,  including unfinished construction projects, the individual or  legal entity acquires at the same time, by virtue of the  purchase, the right of possession, use, or lease of the plot of  land on which the property acquired is located. In case of  privatization of immovable nonagricultural property, including  unfinished construction projects, the individual or legal entity  at the same time acquires the right of use or lease of the plot  of land on which the property acquired is located, pursuant to  the procedure established in a decree of the Cabinet of  Ministers dated 9 March 1994.    To conduct a sales transaction, the seller files with the  regional agency of the State Committee for Land Relations and  Land Development a statement of intent to sell his right to the  plot of land and the buyer a statement of his intent to buy that  right.    The regional agency of the State Committee for Land  Relations  and Land Development verifies that the landowner or land user  has documents certifying the right to use the plot of land,  measures more precisely the actual boundaries and area of the  plot of land, and also defines the terms of sale of the right  and its value. In cases of a discrepancy between the actual size  and boundaries of the plot and those indicated in documents, the  remeasurement data are duly submitted for consideration and  approval of the head of the local administration.    The costs related to determining the value and terms of sale  of the right of heritable life possession, use, or lease of  plots of land shall be paid by the purchaser at the current unit  rates for the jobs performed, payable to the special budget  account of the regional agency of the State Committee for Land  Relations and Land Development which did the appraisal of these  rights.    The transaction of the sale of the right of heritable life  possession, use, or lease of a plot of land between the seller  and buyer takes the form of a sales contract. The map (sketch)  of that plot is appended to the contract.    The right of heritable life possession, use, or lease passes  from the seller to the buyer when the regional agency of the  State Committee for Land Relations and Land Development  registers the notarized sales contract.    Transactions involving the right of heritable life  possession, use, or lease of plots of land may be conducted  provided there are no land disputes concerning the plots and no  other impediments to conclusion of the transaction established  by legislation.    Suits to invalidate the sale of the right of heritable life  possession, use, or lease of plots of land are taken up in the  courts.    When the right of heritable life possession, use, or lease  of  plots of land is sold, taxation and collection of the state duty  are governed by republic legislation.    The notarized sales contract is the basis on which the buyer  prepares and duly files the document certifying the right of  heritable life possession, use, or lease of the plot of land.    The purpose for which the plot of land is to be used may not  be altered without consent of the head of the local  administration. The document issued previously to the seller  certifying his right to the plot of land is terminated. The  decree has determined the appraised value of the right of  heritable life possession of a plot of land for operating a  peasant farm.    Plots located on land dedicated to agriculture in the steppe  and arid-steppe zones in the plains will cost from 28 to 11,100  tenge per hectare, depending on the soil quality rating.    Plots located on farmland in the semidesert, desert, and  foothill-desert areas are valued between 28 and 2800 tenge per  hectare, depending on the soil quality rating.    The appraised value of the right of heritable life  possession  of plots granted for operating a private farm, for construction  of a private dwelling or dacha, or for market gardening,  including land occupied by structures, is fixed at 300 tenge per  0.01 hectares.    The appraised value of the right of heritable life  possession  of plots of land located within city limits or a zone subject to  special urban planning regulation is multiplied by a factor of  1.2 in cities with a population from 100,00 to 250,000; 1.4 when  the population is between 251,000 and 500,000; 1.6 when the  population is between 501,000 and one million; and 2 when the  population exceeds one million.    Regional agencies of the State Committee for Land Relations  and Land Development have the right to double or reduce by half  the appraised value of the right of heritable life possession,  use, or lease of a plot of land depending upon its location, the  level of building-service equipment, and the level of public  amenities of the area, development of the sector of cultural and  everyday services to the public, the level of public health and  hygiene, and other factors.    The appraised value of the right of use or lease of a plot  of  land is determined in accordance with the procedure whereby an  individual or legal entity acquires the right of use or lease of  the plot of land when immovable property for nonagricultural  purposes is privatized, as set forth in the decree of the  Cabinet of Ministers dated 9 March 1994.    Proceeds which heads of local administrations realize from  the sale of the right of heritable life possession, use, or  lease of a plot of land shall be credited to the republic budget.    Individuals and legal entities transferring the right of  heritable life possession, use, or lease of plots of land as  their contribution to authorized capital of joint stock  companies, partnerships, or cooperatives, including those with  foreign participation, relinquish those rights unless the  charters of those organizations stipulate otherwise.    The right of heritable life possession, use, or lease of  plots of land is reassigned to the aforementioned joint-stock  companies, partnerships, or cooperatives, including those with  foreign participation, according to established procedure.    The donation or mortgaging of the right of heritable life  possession of land by individuals and the mortgaging of the  right to use land by legal entities shall conform to the  procedure established by the republics's Civil Code and Land  Code, and by the Law on Mortgages.</p>

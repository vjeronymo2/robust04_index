			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Luo Guanxing (5012 6034 2502), Central People's </F> Broadcasting Station reporter, and XINHUA reporter Zhang Sutang  (1728 1372 1016)]    [Text] Beijing, 10 Jun (XINHUA) -- Hu Jintao, member of  the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and Political Bureau  Standing Committee, held a discussion meeting today with the  comrades attending the ideological and political work conference  of Central Committee organs. He emphasized during the meeting:  The most fundamental task of ideological and political work  during the new period is to educate the vast number of party  members, cadres, and people in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. To perform the  task well conscientiously is the most important and effective  way to strengthen and improve ideological and political work and  to raise it to a higher level.    The meeting was held in the Huairen Hall at Zhongnanhai.  Nearly 100 people attended. They included Wei Jianxing, member  of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and Secretariat,  and department heads and full-time party secretaries of Central  Committee organs.    During the meeting, Tian Congming, Yang Xingfu, Cui Yuanxi,  and Sun Guozhi, persons in charge of relevant organizations,  gave reports on their organizations' ideological and political  work.    After hearing their reports, Hu Jintao pointed out: To build  socialism with Chinese characteristics is the common aspiration  of the people across the country and it is a task in the  people's fundamental interest. To accomplish it, we must rely  on the people across the country to display a pioneering spirit  and work hard in unity. We should now effectively seize  opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development,  maintain statability, and continue to advance toward the  splendid goal. Fundamentally speaking, to do so, we must rely  on the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic  line, on the strong party leadership, and on effective  ideological and political work to arouse to the maximum extent  the enthusiasm of millions upon millions of people and to fully  bring into play their wisdom and talents. Ideological and  political work is our party's fine tradition and political  superiority. During the historical period of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and during the present course of  establishing a socialist market economic structure, we must take  a further step to carry forward the tradition and give play to  the superiority. We must not weaken the tradition and  superiority even a little bit.    Hu Jintao said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always attached  great importance to ideological and political work. He has made  a series of expositions on the new period's ideological and  political work, which are the important contents of the theory  on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and are a  correct guidance for us to do ideological and political work  well in the new period. He has set a brilliant example for the  whole party in attaching great importance to ideological and  political work and in earnestly doing the work himself. We  should seriously study and understand Comrade Xiaoping's  expositions on ideological and political work and  conscientiously strengthen and improve ideological and political  work under the new situation.    Hu Jintao emphasized: To arm the whole party with Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is a longterm strategic task. We should proceed  from the characteristics of the organs under the Central  Committee to guide the masses into considering the new situation  and new tasks and adhering to the principle of integrating  theory with practice. Efforts should be made to study theories  and major practical problems thoroughly and to apply what has  been studied. As a result of the study, we should enhance our  understanding of ideological theories and policies, improve our  political quality, and make the organs under the Central  Committee play an even better role in serving the central  authorities, the grass-roots units and the people, and in  serving reform, opening up, and socialist modernization.    Hu Jintao pointed out: An important principle during the new  period is to do ideological and political work; implement the  party's basic line, principles, and policies; and accomplish the  party's central task simultaneously. The task of strengthening  and improving ideological and political work must be done in  conjunction with the general task of the whole party and the  whole country -- to "seize opportunity, deepen reform, open up  wider, promote development, and maintain statability." This is  a new demand set by the new situation and new tasks, a test for  party and government organs in ideological and political work,  and also an opportunity for them to further strengthen and  improve their ideological and political work. We should seize  the good opportunity to step up ideological education and  ideological guidance in light of new realities and to remarkably  improve ideological and political work.    Hu Jintao said: A party or government organ's ideological  and political work is linked to its party building work. When  the party organizations at all levels in the organ become  stronger, have a greater fighting power, and fully display the  party's superiority, they will promote the organ's ideological  and political work, as well as its other undertakings.    We  should continue to properly improve leading bodies' ideology and  work style. While holding democratic meetings regularly, we  should uphold and improve democratic centralism. It is also  necessary to persistently manage the party strictly and to  continually improve the contingent of party members' quality.  Communist party members in Central Committee organs should  continually undergo tests to strengthen their party spirit. At  their respective posts and while conducting various organ  activities, they should be models who resolutely implement the  party's basic line and its various general and specific  policies, and who safeguard and enhance the party's overall work  across China. They should be models who wholeheartedly serve  the people, who foster close ties with the masses, and who  conscientiously safeguard the masses' interests. Furthermore,  they should be models who do arduous and pioneering work; who  honestly and diligently administer; and who conscientiously  resist money worship, hedonism, and extreme individualism. In  addition, they should be models who study hard and who are  practical and creative.    Hu Jintao pointed out at the end: Leadership is the key to  intensifying and improving ideological and political work.  Major leading comrades in various departments in Central  Committee organs should take the lead in paying close attention  in this regard, should earnestly practice what they advocate,  and should realistically strengthen their leadership over  ideological and political work in their units. Various units  should include ideological and political work in their work  schemes and agenda, and should thoroughly study, examine, and  supervise the work. Party organizations in the organs should be  responsible for properly and regularly conducting ideological  and political work, and should actively and effective promote  ideological and political work through various activities.  Leading comrades in various organs and party organizations  should pay full attention to cultivating the growth of the  cadres contingent who handle political work. Comrades who  handle ideological and political work should further strengthen  their sense of responsibility; should continually promote the  spirit of making selfless sacrifices and actively forging ahead;  and should cautiously, conscientiously, and properly perform  their work so as to further propel departments' tasks to  progress to a higher level.    Also attending the meeting were comrades in charge of  various  units in Central Committee organs including Gu Yunfei, Li  Shuzheng, Wang Jialiu, Pang Xianzhi, Shao Huaze, Guo Chaoren,  Sun Jiazheng, and Li Keqiang.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Hu Hanying (5170 3352 5391)] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 24 May (XINHUA) -- Russian Minister of  Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov pointed out:  Sino-Russian economic and trade relations will become healthier  and more mutually beneficial, and have bright prospects for  further development.    Davydov made the statement during a recent interview with  this XINHUA reporter.    While reviewing the past, Davydov said: Since 1992, both  Russia and China have been implementing measures that encourage  bilateral trade. Consequently, Sino-Russian bilateral trade  value in 1992 was $5.862 billion, up 50 percent on the trade  value between the former Soviet Union and China in 1991. In  1993, Sino-Russian trade continued to grow, reaching $7.679  billion, an increase of 30.9 percent over that of 1992; out of  the total, Russian exports to China increased 41.4 percent, and  imports from China rose 15.2 percent. He said: In 1993, China  became Russia's second largest trading partner; Germany topped  the list.    The foreign economic relations minister frankly admitted: In  the first quarter of 1994, Sino-Russian trade value has slid  temporarily, down 43.5 percent over the same period of 1993.  Analyzing major reasons for the declined trade value, Davydov  said: Russian industrial output has been dropping; commodity  prices have been rising; and transportation expenses have  increased. All these factors have adversely affected the  commercial organizations' enthusiasm to export. Meanwhile,  fewer Russian resources for exports, higher customs duties, and  governmental supervision over the export of raw and semifinished  materials are other contributory factors that have led to the  lower trade value. Additionally, Russian consumer markets have  been relatively saturated with commodities imported from China.    Minister Davydov believed: The downward trend in  Sino-Russian trade is temporary, because further expanding  bilateral economic cooperation suits the mutual benefit of both  countries. He proposed: Bilateral trade issues that need to be  resolved most urgently at present are as follows: Both  countries should ensure smooth traffic on transportation routes.  In accordance with changed circumstances, both countries should  amend the original Sino-Russian bilateral trade agreements so  that they will be compatible with the new conditions. The  central banks of both countries should reach an agreement  whereby some trading transactions, other than state-level  trading transactions, can be settled with their own currencies.  Both countries should improve policies on bilateral trade that  is state-regulated. Furthermore, both countries should provide  reliable information for entrepreneurs and traders in the two  countries. They should also resolve debt issues remaining  between them from the past.    Davydov expressed his belief: Russian Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin's upcoming visit to China will facilitate  Sino-Russian economic and trade cooperation to develop in a  healthy and stable manner.</p>

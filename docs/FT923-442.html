			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (22): The inside guide to inside influence DEALING WITH WHITEHALL by Philip Connelly Century Business Pounds, 208 pages EVERY BUSINESS feels the impact of government, through decisions on economic policy, taxation, regulation and the like. Charities, pressure groups and trade associations have long sought to win advantages and fend off legislative threats. Yet only recently have businesses learnt to enter the political arena to ensure that their interests are not harmed by political decisions. The political battle over the future of Westland was one of the first occasions on which lobbyists were prominently working on behalf of the major protagonists. But the practice is fast spreading - so much so that when the Lord Chancellor proposed reforming the legal profession, the Bar Council employed a lobbying firm to defend the interests of barristers. Too often, however, businesses resort to lobbying only when a threat is perceived, rather than keeping abreast of political developments and pushing for favourable government decisions whenever their interests are affected. Parliament and Whitehall remain closed books for many business leaders. Lobbyist Philip Connelly sets out to remedy this in his guide to effective lobbying. The book offers much sensible advice on how to find out what is going on and influence the outcome. It also contains a wealth of information on the government machine, including helpful guides to the responsibilities of important government departments. Certainly there will be businesses which can use this book to do a spot of amateur lobbying (aided, no doubt, by the recent moves to open up the mysteries of government a little more). An intelligent young public affairs executive could use it to gather useful intelligence, though an up-to-date copy of Dod's Parliamentary Companion would be advisable given the speed with which the government machine changes. But the none-too-subtle message of the book is that high-level expertise is essential, especially if lobbying Brussels. Since only the largest firms can afford to employ such expertise in-house, that inevitably means using professional lobbying firms. Unfortunately, these can be immensely variable in quality. Some do little more than recycle information freely available to the public in reference books and from the House of Commons Vote Office for the benefit of clients who pay thousands of pounds a year for the service. A chapter on how to sort out the wheat from the chaff in choosing a lobbyist would be a valuable addendum to any subsequent editions.</p>

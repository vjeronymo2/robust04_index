			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: TEAM PLAYER  </P> <P> Sly Stallone has a prison pic, "Lock-Up," due in August from Tri-Star. But he's  not exactly Rambo-ish about taking on the summer competition. "Have you ever  seen so much hype? Definitely scary," Sly admits. "I figure I should stay low  profile. I'm purposely not going to be doing any sky writing."  </P> <P> The $24-million film, directed by John Flynn ("Best Seller") and shot largely  at New Jersey's Rahway State Prison, is now being rushed through  postproduction. ("We cut the film in just 12 days.") He calls it "the closest  thing I've done to 'Rocky,' in that it's really an ensemble piece. My character  is reliant on a lot of other people -- a support system." Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

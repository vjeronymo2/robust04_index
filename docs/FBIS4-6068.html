			<p>BFN     [Text] Security forces yesterday shot dead Aceh terrorist  leader T. Yun, who had been at large since 1989, following a  skirmish on Syia Kuala Road, Simpang Beuraweh, Banda Aceh.  Infantry Colonel Rudy Supriatna, commander of the 012 Teuku  Umar Military Resort Command, said the military personnel  intercepted T. Yun, who had twice sent Aceh terrorists for  training in Libya, thanks to information given by citizens who  did not want to be terrorized by his group. T. Yun had used  five pseudonyms. The shooting of the Aceh terrorist leader,  which was preceded by a pursuit by the military personnel on  Syia Kuala Road along the Krueng River, was witnessed by  thousands of people.</p>

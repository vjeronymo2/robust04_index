			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vadim Markushin article: "Who Is Inflaming the German </F> Imagination?"]    [Text] Among recent events, those which alarmed the German  public most of all were undoubtedly December's floods in Germany  and the results of the parliamentary elections in Russia.    In the first case the reason was clear. Losses occasioned by  the caprices of the weather have added, in a completely  unexpected way, to the enormous material costs connected with  the unification of the country. Once again the state coffers  are bare; German citizens have never understood the treasury as  something abstract; for them it is closely bound up with their  own pocketbooks.    The second issue is far more complex. Germany is probably  the only country in which the announcement of a victory for the  "right-wing persuasion" in Russia could electrify the political  atmosphere so completely. This topic has immediately come to  the fore, opening up clear and -- we must suppose -- long-term  work prospects for the multitude of experts on Russia. What is  most staggering for the Germans is the appearance in the Russian  political lexicon of the word "fascism," which used to be a  dirty word for Russians.    Without considering the extent to which voters who cast  their  votes for the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] were  genuinely linking that party with the possibility of fascism's  coming to power in Russia, or whether they are pursuing this  policy deliberately, certain circles in Germany are blatantly  inflaming the German imagination. Moreover, their efforts are  to a certain extent being helped along by some of the LDPR  leader's statements and his behavior.    Some people, for example, are already calling for the  Western  Group of Forces to be scrutinized more carefully. They are  saying that the forces are a small piece of Russia, and that  piece of Russia also contains Zhirinovskiy supporters. Are they  not likely to make contact with German extremists and thus  contribute to the cause of uniting Europe's right-wing radicals?  These fears are not emerging just anywhere, but in the Saxony  Land Department for the Protection of the Constitution.  Department head Frau M. Keller said as much to a staffer from  the Western Group of Forces Press Center: "The department is  checking to see whether German right-wing radicals have any  contacts with LDPR supporters in the Western Group of Forces."    It seems that those who support unrelenting efforts in the  military sphere will not miss this opportunity to exploit the  situation and draw more attention to the Bundeswehr. The  newspapers have instituted a trend of cursing the government for  its "lack of concern" in the defense sphere. In the opinion of  P. Wuerzbach, former under secretary of state at the Ministry of  Defense, the federal chancellor "is doing absolutely nothing to  resolve the financial problems facing the Bundeswehr" and he  "should say once and for all what he can offer the armed forces."    There is another curious point which may also be connected  with events in Russia. One in three German citizens sees  "nothing bad" about foreign troops being stationed in his  country. This is the conclusion reached by specialists who  consistently poll people on the issue. They claim that the  number of Germans who support the preservation of a foreign  military presence in the FRG is growing. The researchers  attribute this phenomenon not only to the traditional  unwillingness of inhabitants of specific regions to countenance  the material costs that would inevitably arise from the loss of  an additional reserve of jobs and stable consumers in the form  of foreign servicemen. It also has behind it the "NATOization"  of the consciousness of a population which has grown accustomed  to linking its own security with the strength of the Atlantic  alliance, and which particularly reflects on that strength at  times when there are indications of a threat.</p>

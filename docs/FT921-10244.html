			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Merrett falls 54% but holds dividend MERRETT Holdings, the Lloyd's underwriting agent and insurance services group, yesterday reported a 54 per cent fall to Pounds 3.21m in pre-tax profits for the year to September 30. Earnings per share were 10.25p (20.28p) but the dividend is unchanged at 6.25p. The result largely reflected the recent depression in the London insurance market, where Merrett manages insurance syndicates at Lloyd's of London, and increased costs, especially in the development of its loss adjusting activities. Total revenues rose to Pounds 23.7m (Pounds 22.3m), with income from insurance services increasing to Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 11.5m). UK loss adjusting activities expanded strongly despite better weather conditions which contributed to an increase in the volume of claims handled in 1990. Profit commissions paid by Names - the individuals whose capital backs the market's underwriting - fell to Pounds 3.16m (Pounds 6.34m), reflecting the downturn at Lloyd's in 1988, when the market as whole recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 510m. Income from agency salaries rose to Pounds 5.01m (Pounds 4.78m).</p>

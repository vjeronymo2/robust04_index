			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Panamanian economic developments monitored through 7  June.    Eduardo Linares, deputy minister of planning and economic  policy, has reported that international financial institutes  (IFI's) could "withhold approximately $300 million in credits if  the government fails to comply with various stringent conditions  imposed by these organizations." He added, "There would be a  $1.9 million deficit in 1994 budget if this money is withheld."  The government is expected to make several modifications to the  national budget to prevent the IFI's decision from negatively  affecting the budget. Planning Minister Delia Cardenas, Finance  Minister Victor Juliao, and Comptroller General Jose Chen Barria  are scheduled to meet on 6 June to discuss the issue. (Panama  City LA PRENSA in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p 1A)    A report issued by the Economic Commission for Latin America  shows that the Central American region registered an economic  growth rate of more than 4 percent in 1993, "which has generated  a moderate increase in the domestic GNP of each nation of the  region for the second year in a row." The report adds that  Central America "advanced in its goal of controlling inflation,  which in Costa Rica decreased from 17 percent to 9 percent, and  in Guatemala from 14 percent to 12 percent. In Honduras and  Nicaragua, however, inflation increased to 15 percent and 25  percent, respectively." Although Panama has not formally joined  the Central American region, its GNP increased 5.9 percent while  unemployment declined to 13.9 percent in 1993. (Panama City EL  PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p 4B)    According to a press release issued by the Israeli Embassy  in  Panama: "Israeli exports enjoyed a successful year in 1993.  Israel's international sales increased 11 percent, while in  Latin America, they rose 22 percent." Meanwhile, the increase  in Israeli exports to Panama was even higher, growing some 52  percent in just one year. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in  Spanish 1 Jun 94 p 4B)</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MEINERS OAKS;  </P> <P> NEW POST OFFICE MAY OPEN IN SEPTEMBER  </P> <P> A new contract post office could be operating in Meiners Oaks as early as  mid-September, postal officials announced.  </P> <P> The current station, operating in a television shop, will close Friday when  owners Calvin and Caroline Rush move their business to Ventura.  </P> <P> Postal officials in Santa Barbara decided to award a new contract station  rather than let the Meiners Oaks operations be absorbed by the Ojai and Oak  View post offices, spokeswoman Felice Cook said.  </P> <P> Eugene Howard, regional postmaster, agreed to open bids in two weeks for  private businesses interested in picking up the contract, Cook said.  </P> <P> The contract should be awarded in about six weeks, she said.  </P> <P> Caroline Rush, who has collected mail and sold stamps and money orders in  Meiners Oaks for five years, said, "It's basically a community service you are  doing for the people. We made a lot of friends, but it takes time away from  your business.  </P> <P> "I'm glad they decided to continue it," Rush said.  </P> <P> "People were very upset around here. It was going to be a terrible  inconvenience to a lot of people without a post office." THIA BELL  </P></p>

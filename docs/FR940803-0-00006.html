			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions now in effect, apricots and sweet cherries grown in designated counties in Washington, and fresh prunes grown in designated counties in Washington and in Umatilla County, Oregon are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rates specified herein will be applicable to all assessable apricots, sweet cherries, and fresh prunes handled during the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year, which began April 1, 1994, through March 31, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are about 55 handlers of Washington apricots, 55 handlers of Washington sweet cherries, and 30 handlers of Washington-Oregon fresh prunes subject to regulation under their respective marketing orders. In addition, there are about 190 Washington apricot producers, 1,100 Washington sweet cherry producers, and 350 Washington-Oregon fresh prune producers in the respective production areas. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An annual budget of expenses is prepared by each marketing order committee and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committees are handlers and producers of the regulated commodities. They are familiar with the Committees' needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local areas and are thus in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The budgets are formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assessment rate recommended by each Committee is derived by dividing anticipated expenses by the tons of fresh fruit expected to be shipped under the order. Because the rates are applied to actual shipments, they must be established at rates which will produce sufficient income to pay the Committees' expected expenses. Recommended budgets and rates of assessment are usually acted upon by the Committees shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred on a continuous basis. Therefore, budget and assessment rate approvals must be expedited so that the Committees will have funds to pay their expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

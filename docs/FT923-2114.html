			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Minding Your Own Business: In tune with musical history - Nick Garnett meets a man who rebuilt Beethoven's piano and dreams that Chopin is a client FOR A man brought up in the freeway-riven urban sprawl of Los Angeles, the view from David Winston's office still gives him some amusement. A straggle of ducks aimlessly waddles past the front door. In the field alongside, horses graze and rabbits gambol near the hedgerow. The remains of an ancient wooden hop press protrude from a clump of grass and weeds. In a converted oast house in the Kent countryside, Winston practises his esoteric yet practical trade. Winston and his team of three restore old and sometimes famous pianos and build reproductions of them, hand-crafting to the finest detail components rooted in early 19th century technology. On one floor of Winston's studio-workshop, a large central table is littered with technical drawings. These are being used to recreate - for two reproductions - the innards of a piano built in Vienna in 1823 by Joseph Brodman, one of whose apprentices, Bosendorfer, gave his name to an Austrian piano maker still in existence. In a corner stands an 1884 instrument made by the English maker, Broadwood and used by Chopin on his last tour of Britain. Part of it is in pieces. Another English piano, a Stodart made in the 1830s when Britain boasted the world's biggest pianoforte industry, is being restored at the far end of the studio for its owner, the National Trust. It was once owned by Mendelssohn. Downstairs, another 30 or 40 old instruments, most of them for sale prior to restoration, are in various states of disrepair. They include a peculiar looking cabinet piano - literally a grand standing on its head. There are no uprights. 'I do not consider them real pianos,' Winston says. 'Pianos like these are treated as antiques here. Plenty of people can install new components and the piano works, but it is wrecked as an original, leaving it with little value. Sometimes I will even say to a customer that if he wants an instrument's wood stripped and polished then I am not prepared to do it.' Winston took a degree in landscape architecture then trained in the US for seven years with first a violin maker and then a harpsichord maker. He married a British woman and set up his business in Britain in 1984 using Pounds 300 capital and renting an old stable. He moved into the quite sizeable oast house three years ago, paying Pounds 10,000 a year for the lease. 'In this business, you cannot make a living unless your overheads are low. If you have normal overheads you can forget it as a business. I would not be able to get the lease at this cost in London.' Winston says his venture, the Period Piano Company, has been growing at about 15 per cent a year but this year's expected turnover of Pounds 130,000 is well up on last year's Pounds 80,000. This is because he has shortened the waiting list, although it is still over six months, and increased margins. The recession has hurt the company's direct piano sales, most of which are instruments which Winston buys in various states of ill-health. He sells these battered pianos on the basis that the price includes restoration work. Restoring instruments is threequarters of his business, up from 50 per cent in the late 1980s. The company produces a pre-tax return of 15-20 per cent. This is after Winston and his wife, Amanda, who also works in the business, take out salaries allowing a 'modest' living. Winston drives a BMW estate. Winston was selected to restore the piano Broadwood gave Beethoven in 1818 and which the composer played until it nearly fell apart. Restoration of the instrument - insured for Pounds 5m and later owned by Liszt - was done in situ in Budapest. The reputation this brings helps Winston sell reproductions. His company is making two 'copies' of the Brodman, one selling for Pounds 17,000, the other, started later, for Pounds 25,000. Clients for such reproductions are usually professional musicians. Most of the business seems to arrive by word of mouth. 'The price for a reproduction compares with perhaps Pounds 40,000 and upwards for an original of this order in perfect condition. Some of the ones I have downstairs might sell for perhaps Pounds 10,000 or so after restoration. A brand new grand from Japan might cost Pounds 8,000 but that depreciates like a Lada. I think modern pianos are over-priced and mine are under-priced.' He would say that, you might think. But purchasing a restored or reproduction piano, apart from its retention value, also allows the buyer to pay in stages with an up-front payment of usually no more than Pounds 3,500. Reproductions are only made on commission. Winston travels to continental Europe to buy old instruments, sometimes paying no more than a few thousand pounds. Restoration and the making of reproductions bring Winston and his team into a micro-world of specialist component suppliers. Nineteenth century pianos use iron strings with a total pull of perhaps 4,000 kilos whereas modern ones use cast steel with a tension of maybe 15 tonnes. The work can be extraordinarily fiddly. Each of the scores of hammers and dampers in a piano are made of several components which have to be glued, pinned and, in places, covered with leather. The Period Piano Company uses a small number of powered working tools. Old pianos with their iron strings produce a clearer, more taut and less homogeneous sound. 'Part of the reason is that the strings are almost at breaking point.' But reproductions are often better, Winston argues. 'The frames of orginals can be distorted and twisted and their insides can be quite crude. There is often nothing fancy inside. The makers, after all, were businessmen. They had to make a living.' Winson says he too has learnt to be a businessman. 'Managing cash flow is difficult. If someone is late in making a payment I cannot put a piano into the bank account. The company is also labour intensive. I have learned to insist on rigid contracts with customers. Learning how to estimate costs takes time but I've now built up a book of jobs which I hold on computer.' One bonus of restoring famous pianos is the chance to mix dreaming with earning a living. 'I like to think Beethoven and Chopin and Liszt were clients of mine.' The Period Piano Company. Tel 0580-291-393.</p>

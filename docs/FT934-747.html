			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Review assists absent fathers Absent fathers facing big increases in maintenance payments will be able to pay the bills in stages over 18 months. Mr Alistair Burt, social security minister, yesterday announced the plans as part of several changes to the workings of the Child Support Agency. The changes follow a review of the agency after widespread anger regarding the formula used to calculate maintenance. The new arrangements, which will come into force in February, apply to those fathers already paying maintenance and who have second families. Among the planned changes are: An increase in the money absent parents can keep after maintenance is deducted. That rises from Pounds 8 above income support levels to Pounds 30. A reduction in the amount paid for children as they get older, by a quarter at the age of 11 and by half at 14. A cut in the additional amounts asked of absent parents who have paid the full amount of basic maintenance in cases where there are only one or two children involved. An increase in the additional proportion of income just above the protected minimum, which absent parents may keep to strengthen work incentives. Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons social security committee which recommended sweeping reforms to the workings of the agency, yesterday welcomed the changes as a 'good first move'. He warned that the committee would consider whether the proposed changes were adequate and was reviewing the 'clean-break' divorce settlements, under which a man leaves a property to his wife in lieu of maintenance payments. Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's shadow social security secretary, said the changes did not go far enough. They seemed to be a 'political solution to an awkward problem' rather than the required fundamental review.</p>

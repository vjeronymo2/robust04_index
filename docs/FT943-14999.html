			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Arts: Heroic years of American painting - William Packer reviews the work of Franz Kline So often it is by the smaller things - the shift of emphasis, the pattern recognised only at a distance - that we learn revolution is achieved. We may believe, for example, that painting and drawing are under siege, that the orthodoxies of conceptualism run triumphant in the halls of Tate and Hayward and the Councils of the wise. Indeed much of the current art-critical debate is set on just this premise of embattled truth. Yet suddenly we look about us and painting - good, solid, modern painting - is everywhere. From Bonnard to assorted Brits, the Tate, Hayward, the Serpentine and now the Whitechapel are full of the stuff. Franz Kline could hardly be shown to greater advantage than at the Whitechapel, with its high, open spaces and gentle light, where indeed we last had a proper view of him all of 30 years ago. The group of large, deceptively simple canvases with which the show begins, black abstract figures on white grounds, is spectacular. Here at once we confront a true artist in his pomp. It is an exciting moment. Kline was one of the leading figures of the New York School of painters of the 1940s and '50s, that we know collectively as the abstract expressionists. Such artists as Pollock, Rothko and de Kooning were his friends and, if he was not the greatest, he was certainly, in his time, the equal of any of them. But his fate was to die of a heart attack in 1962, a little short of his 52nd birthday, at just the time when the painting of which he was so conspicuous a champion was sweeping the world at last. It was no longer, then, a question of whether, as an artist, you were figurative or abstract, let alone modernist or academic. For a brief art-historical moment it was enough to be American and from New York. There were the abstract expressionists, and there were the rest. The pre-eminence that American criticism claimed for the abstract expressionists seemed to work against Kline simply by the accident of his no longer being there to enjoy, or perhaps be exploited, in the words of his present apologist, Stephen Foster: 'by the commercialisation of the avant garde'. He was neither the hero dead too soon - Pollock, Gottlieb - nor yet another 'greatest living painter' - de Kooning, Rothko, etc. Now revisionist criticism, it seems, is trying to detach him from his peers and claim him as a radical traditionalist all along - one who attempted 'to reject the entire modernist legacy'. That too would seem another doubtful favour. 'Art and the Structure of Identity' is the exhibition's sub-title, which shows what we are up against. 'I here understand Kline,' says Professor Foster, 'as one of the last in a long 20th century history of anti-modernist statements. He lays claim to our serious attention because of his successful transaction of a period without modernism's clear critical, theoretical, aesthetic or historical guidelines and without its inevitability, tradition, or aesthetic directionality.' What we are actually left with, once the critical heroics fall away, are paintings, monumental in their authority, extremely moving in their emotional charge, and very beautiful. The show covers the last 15 years of Kline's life, and shows us the steady and natural development of his work in that time, as it moved from the external, albeit abstracted visual reference, fraught with surreal and symbolic suggestion, towards something much purer, more simple and self-contained. This was a journey Kline took along with his fellows, arguing vociferously the while. From our vantage point it is clear that the truly heroic years in modern American painting were the 1940s, when this course was being charted, rather than later, when achievement became fixed as style and mannerism. But with Kline this later fixing never quite happened. Always there remained the implicit possibility change and surprise, even in the later, seemingly more formulaic works. The image, the calligraphic figure is a loosely-stated structure or compositional scaffold, laid on with great sweeping strokes of the broadest of brushes. The paint is vigorous and spontaneous in the act of painting, various in consistency and surface, and over-painted again and again, to leave the history of the making half-visible in hints of colour here, and changes of direction there. 'I don't decide in advance that I am going to paint a definite experience,' he said, 'but in the act of painting, it becomes a genuine experience for me.' It is as simple, and as imponderable, as that. Franz Kline: Whitechapel Art Gallery, Whitechapel High Street E1, until September 11, then on to Madrid and Saarbrucken. organised by the Tapies Foundation, Barcelona; sponsored by Morgan Stanley.</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market falters after sell programme THE much-heralded Lloyds Bank move against Midland Bank duly appeared first thing yesterday, but had only a marginal effect on an equity market showing signs of running out of steam after its recent strong performance. The FT-SE 100-share Index, although closing well above the day's lowest level, was 7.2 down at 2,651. Lloyds' statement that it intended to launch a hostile bid for Midland - at a price considerably above that offered three weeks ago by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking  - triggered a burst of excitement that drove Midland, as well as the market, up at the outset. The market, however, pounced on a number of pre-conditions in the Lloyds statement of intent and shares quickly moved into reverse. Midland, marked up to 396p after the bid news was made public, closed below that level. Early optimism that the Midland news could launch the Footsie towards a record high was dashed, partly by second thoughts on the latest developments in the takeover saga. Dealers also mentioned general profit-taking, the near 20-point overnight decline on Wall Street, and a rapid slide in the Footsie future shortly after trading commenced. From an opening level of 2,659.5, up 1.3, the Footsie quickly retreated to what proved to be the day's low of 2,635.6, down 22.6, at mid-morning, additionally weakened by a medium-sized sell programme, said to have been executed by one of the US broking houses as part of a Europe-wide selling operation. The programme was thought to have comprised a large number of second-line stocks, which can often prove difficult to place. Thereafter, the market stabilised and began to claw its way back, with buyers gradually moving in as the session drew to a close, prompted by a moderately encouraging CBI survey of business confidence. Wall Street failed to provide any real support for London, opening lower, staging a modest recovery and then moving down again. Dealers said there had been an element of nervousness ahead of today's biggest-ever gilts auction of Pounds 2.5bn worth of stock. Sterling turned off late in the session, closing easier against the dollar and unchanged against the D-Mark. Recent strong takeover speculation in other areas, notably in Tarmac and Pilkington, tended to die down, while there were again hints of heavy fund-raising via rights issues. Oil shares were very much in the limelight, with US buyers still chasing BP higher and vague takeover stories and hints of imminent asset sales boosting Lasmo, one of the market's best performers in recent days. Profit downgrades took their toll on British Gas, however. Old hands in the oil sector also recalled a failed market raid by Gas on Lasmo in the late 1980s. Property shares tumbled in the early part of the day but staged a late recovery. Turnover in equities rose to 604.7m shares from Monday's 518.4m, but there was disappointment with news that the value of business on Monday dipped below the Pounds 1bn level for only the second time since the general election.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jerusalem, June 13 (AFP)--PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat  has agreed to drop the stormy debate over Jerusalem "for the  time being", a senior foreign ministry official said Monday.    'Arafat had made the offer in a series of letters sent to  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin last week after a major rumpus over  the fate of the city both sides claim as capital.    "The PLO leader expressed his intention to smooth over  differences and reduce tension," the official told AFP. "He is  ready to withdraw the question of Jerusalem from the agenda for  the time being."    Arafat also urged Israel to respect the written undertaken  from Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres last October to allow  Palestinian institutions to continue operating in East  Jerusalem. [sentence as received]    Under the Declaration of Principles for autonomy, the  Jerusalem issue would not be raised until the third year of  Palestinian self-rule when negotiations on a permanent  settlement are set to be begin.    Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 war  and has declared the united city its eternal capital. The PLO  demands to share Jerusalem.    Meanwhile, the HA'ARETZ newspaper reported that the  government had decided not to allow 'Arafat to enter East  Jerusalem during his visit to the autonomous Palestinian areas  which is expected to take place sometime this month.    The army had voiced that 'Arafat's arrival in East Jerusalem  would lead to clashes between Palestinians and the Israeli  right-wing. Some extremists have called for 'Arafat to be  murdered.    Rabin said last month that the PLO leader would not be  allowed into Jerusalem for at least two years.</p>

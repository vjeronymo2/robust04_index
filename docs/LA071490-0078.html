			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4,000 HAPPY ALBANIANS REACH REFUGE IN THE WEST  </P> <P> The repressive curtain around Europe's most backward society was flicked aside  revealingly Friday for the first time in 45 years as about 4,000 grimy but  exuberant Albanians streamed ashore here to new lives in Western refuge.  </P> <P> The refugees emerged almost trance-like from an internationally sponsored  boatlift that transported them from a homeland wrapped in stubborn Stalinist  isolation since the end of World War II.  </P> <P> "We worked, the Communist leaders ate. I will go home again when Albania is  free," said unshaven factory worker Rudolph Hadahami, fingering the unfamiliar  plastic wrappings around a piece of cake.  </P> <P> As they came ashore in bright sunshine, the Albanians looked as though they had  stepped through a time warp.  </P> <P> The women wore plastic shoes and homemade dresses of cheap, shiny fabric in  styles long forgotten in Western Europe. Nearly all the men wore shapeless  sandals and flared trousers of 1970s inspiration.  </P> <P> "They were very frightened at first. You could feel their fear. Was it really  over? Or just a trick?" said Claudio Luksich, chief engineer on Espresso  Grecia, one of the four ships sent to Albania to bring the refugees here.  </P> <P> The four ferries chartered by Italy and West Germany brought 3,915 Albanians to  Brindisi after a four-hour, 85-mile passage of the Adriatic from the Albanian  port of Durres. A fifth ship, under French charter, was bound for Marseilles  early today carrying another 550 refugees.  </P> <P> Most of the arrivals were rough-cut, single young men, but the first Albanian  ashore here Friday, wrapped firmly in the arms of an Italian Red Cross nurse  sprinting for a waiting ambulance, was a three-day-old baby born at the West  German Embassy in Tirana.  </P> <P> In all, about 3,100 refugees had taken shelter at the German legation in the  Albanian capital. Within two hours of landing in Brindisi, they were  northward-bound aboard three 20-car trains staffed by the West German Red Cross  and unarmed Bavarian border police.  </P> <P> About 850 Albanians who had jammed the Italian Embassy in Tirana went by bus  from the port to clean beds, hot showers and restorative pasta at a disused  Italian army depot outside this port, about 335 miles southeast of Rome.  </P> <P> The Albanians came to Italy tired and travel-stained. Many were barefoot; some  had no shirts. Clothes slept in for a week or more had not aged well. Everybody  needed a bath.  </P> <P> As refugees, they were archetypal: Literally all they had was what they were  wearing when they voted with their feet against an Albanian regime that is the  last hard-line Communist government in Europe.  </P> <P> Beginning June 28, the Albanians -- alone on the spur of the moment, with  friends, with entire conspiring families -- had stormed Western embassies in  the capital seeking asylum from the repression and poverty of a country where  yearly per-capita income is less than $1,000 and the list of political crimes  is long.  </P> <P> "I love my country. It is terrible to leave, but for me this is a political  emigration. I want to study, I must be free," said a 25-year-old named Vilma  from Tirana whose carriage and hazel eyes brought photographers swarming.  </P> <P> "Albanians are still afraid of the police, but communism is finished. People  are rising up," said Gregor Posto, 34, bound for Germany with his wife and  three small children.  </P> <P> The boatlift was the fruit of long negotiations between Western governments,  the United Nations and the shaky, timidly reforming regime of Albanian  strongman Ramiz Alia.  </P> <P> While diplomats palavered, refugees said, conditions at the overcrowded  embassies went from bad to worse. Food was short, water precious.  </P> <P> "There was water only four or five hours a day. The government shut it off; it  was medieval, like living in a castle, surrounded," said Nuri Kercani, 27, an  economist and one of a minority of intellectuals among the refugees proud of  their learned-at-home Italian, English or French.  </P> <P> "The government sent spies into the embassies, saying we'd be driven out. We  hid from them, afraid that if we were identified, they would take reprisals  against our families," said a 20-year-old youth named Gentian who asked not to  be identified further.  </P> <P> Like many of the refugees, Gentian, whose complaints about Albania are as much  economic as they are political, hopes eventually to go to the United States.  </P> <P> Proud and sassy in a new purple T-shirt and yellow skirt, courtesy of the  Italian Red Cross, Gertruda Reka, 23, a factory worker in Tirana, sought out  American reporters in the swirling mob of journalists that tracked the  refugees' every step.  </P> <P> "Do you know Cela Hamide in Yonkers, New York?" she asked in slow, careful  English. "She is my grandmother. That is where I want to go."  </P> <P> Brindisi's welcome for Adriatic neighbors who have not been seen here for half  a century began promptly at 9 a.m. on a wind-whipped summer's day when the  white-over-mustard Espresso Grecia, a U.N. ensign at her forepeak, breasted a  harbor that once sheltered Imperial Roman merchantmen.  </P> <P> Worried by two tugs and an Italian Coast Guard launch, the ferry jockeyed for a  berth while 1,000 Albanians at the rails clapped and roared "I-tal-ia,  I-tal-ia!" just as they had heard soccer fans do on television broadcasts of  soccer's World Cup.  </P> <P> A few hours behind the Espresso Grecia came her sister ship Appia, and the  Greek ferries Ionis and Cefalonian Sky. Loaded at the same time but  Marseilles-bound was the Orient Star.  </P> <P> Under international diplomatic protection and tight Albanian police vigilance,  the refugees had been loaded onto buses in Tirana on Thursday night for the  20-mile ride to the port. The refugees agreed on that, but not on what happened  along the way.  </P> <P> "The streets were full of soldiers, but people applauded as we passed. You who  have liberty don't appreciate it, but we Albanians understand what freedom is,"  reported Paret Derani, 65, who said he spent 28 years in jail for political  offenses.  </P> <P> "People watched from streets and balconies in silence as we left. No one  clapped, no one shouted. It is impossible to shout in Albania," said economist  Kercani.  </P> <P> If the refugees came in relief and joy, a few came in unsuppressed anger at the  regime they had fled.  </P> <P> Nevres Tabaku, 59, breathed fire in impeccable Italian from the moment she  stepped ashore.  </P> <P> "We are known as the 100-year family," she said. "Do you know why? Because  family members have spent a total of 100 years in their jails. My parents died  there. We never saw their bodies. My mother, a mother of seven, was arrested  for the last time when she was 55.  </P> <P> "I have been in jail, my brothers, my sons. We owned a family business when the  Communists came. At first, they jailed us for no reason, and then for any  reason. Now, today, we, the whole family, is out. There was no reason any more  to remain silent. I can say what I want."  </P> <P> Tabaku added that she hopes to join relatives in New York or Florida.  </P></p>

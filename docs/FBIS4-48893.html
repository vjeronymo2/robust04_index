			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 29 (XINHUA) -- Mongolian  President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat said here today that the treaty  on friendly relations of cooperation to be signed between China  and Mongolia later today will lay a legal basis for bilateral  relations through the next century.    The president made the remarks during a meeting with Chinese  Premier Li Peng, who came here Thursday [28 April] for a two-day  visit.    Li Peng conveyed friendly greetings to Ochirbat from Chinese  President Jiang Zemin and extended Jiang's invitation for him to  visit China.    Li told Ochirbat that his talks this morning with Mongolian  Premier Puntsagiyn Jasray were fruitful and that he was  satisfied with them.    China and Mongolia are neighbors and they should maintain a  friendly relationship, Li said.    He called the treaty on friendly relations of cooperation to  be signed later today "a major event in the annals of  Sino-Mongolian relations" and said China is willing to have  friendly and good-neighborly ties with all its neighbors,  including Mongolia.    President Ochirbat said there is no unresolved issue of  principle between Mongolia and China. As to some minor  problems, the two countries will be able to solve them under the  principle of mutual respect, he added.    The president said Mongolia attaches great importance to  Premier Li's visit and regarded it as a continuation of contacts  between leaders of the two countries. The visit will have a  major significance to the development of bilateral relations.    He stressed that Mongolia supports China's foreign policies,  especially its proposal for the establishment of a new  international political and economic order.    China is a country of world influence, therefore, its  proposal will have a major significance for maintaining peace  and stability in the region as well as in the world, he said.    Premier Li Peng said the Chinese Government supports the  policies carried out by the Mongolian Government on maintaining  regional peace and security.    China respects the independence of other countries as well  as  their choices of their own political and economic systems.    He believed that relations between China and Mongolia in  political, economic and other fields will further develop.</p>

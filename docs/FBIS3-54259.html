The prime minister was speaking in  Jerusalem to a large group of rabbis from the United States. He  said agreement had been reached with the Palestinians on some of  the issues, but not on control of the crossing points. Jack  Katzenell reports:    [Begin recording] [Katzenell] Prime Minister Rabin said  Israel and the Palestinians are near an agreement on some of the  issues. For example, control of the roads to and from the  Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip. But, there was still no  agreement on the border crossing points. He said Israel must  retain control of the Jordan bridges to check for arms or  explosives and determine who is allowed to pass.    [Rabin] We don't want that influx of Palestinian refugees, a  quarter of a million, will cross the passes because it is  written in the DOP [Declaration of Principles] that the question  of the refugees, that it has to be negotiated once we'll reach  negotiations on the permanent solution. It is excluded to be  dealt with during the creation of the interim period.    [Katzenell] More than 300,000 Palestinians and other Arabs  visit the territories every summer, Rabin said. We welcome  them, but we must know when they enter and whether they have  left. Otherwise, we shall have a quarter of a million or half a  million refugees returning in the interim period, and this is  not sanctioned in the Declaration of Principles.    Turning to the negotiations with Syria, Rabin said President  al-Asad has not yet clarified what he means by peace; whether he  means open borders, diplomatic relations, and encouragement by  the two governments of normal relations between the peoples. We  do not expect al-Asad to come to Jerusalem as President al-Sadat  did, Rabin said, but he has to understand better the way the  Israeli people think.    [Rabin] Unfortunately, if you watch the last press  conference in Geneva in which the two presidents, Clinton and  al-Asad appeared -- in the press conference al-Asad didn't do 1  percent of what al-Sadat did in coming to Jerusalem. It was  President Clinton that answered Wolf Blitzer, and not President  al-Asad.    [Katzenell] Rabin said he has invited al-Asad to Jerusalem  10 times or more. I am willing to meet him in Damascus, in  Jerusalem, anywhere on the globe, the prime minister said,  without preconditions, except what has already been agreed  between us. [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our guest this evening is the Gabonese opposition  figure, Max-Anicet Koumba. After 13 years of exile in France he  has now decided to return to Gabon. Assane Diop met Max-Anicet  Koumba, who is the leader of MORENA [Movement for National  Recovery] in exile, and asked him to react to the multiparty  presidential election of 5 December, which ended in the  re-election of President Bongo. Here is Max-Anicet Koumba:    [Begin recording] [Koumba] When one looks at the preparation  for and the holding of the presidential election in Gabon, one  has the impression that for several years now, and, more  precisely, since 1990, the opposition has been content with  playing a walk-on part within the institutions that were  entrusted with preparing this election. Today, since the  presidential election has taken place and the results are out,  this is no longer a simulation, a polling operation, where one  says so and so has come first, the first choice of the people,  and such and such has come second. I believe that the verdict  of the ballot box is out, it is known, the president of the  Republic has been elected democratically in our country for  once. Now it is for the losers, the unhappy rival candidates  for presidential election, to acknowledge the result of this  election. The technical part of the organization of the election  was certainly not without imperfection, but basically the  election took place and if there are any questions, they must be  generalized. In other words, there must be an effort to check  exhaustively the results of all the candidates, not just of a  single candidate, but of all the candidates.    [Diop] What do you think of President Bongo's proposal to  involve all of the Gabonese political officials who so wish it  in the running of the country?    [Koumba] That is pointless. That is pointless in a democracy  -- we are not obliged to operate and form a national unity  government as if this was still the era of the single party. A  president of the Republic has been elected. If he is confident  in his election, then let him shoulder his responsibilities. I  do not believe that it is useful to call on everyone to form a  single party once again in the midst of democracy. If there is  a majority, it is for this majority to shoulder its  responsibilities and for the opposition to shoulder its own.    [Diop] While honoring the law-based state?    [Koumba] Yes, absolutely.    [Diop] So, what do you think about the forming of a parallel  government and of this parallel presidency taken on by Father  Mba Abessole ?    [Koumba] I would not venture even to comment on this  initiative. I know quite simply that it is an imitation of the  Gabonese Government in exile, which I myself had created here,  of which I was the prime minister, the head of government. In  an electoral stage, in the context of a democracy, this  initiative seems to me to be stupid. It is politically stupid  and legally reprehensible.    [Diop] After your return to Gabon, where are you going to  position yourself now within the political sphere? Where will  you stand first of all with regard to the government of  President Bongo?    [Koumba] Before saying where I will position myself, I am  going to begin by carrying out a tour of talks, because the  problem today is clarifying the political situation in our  country.

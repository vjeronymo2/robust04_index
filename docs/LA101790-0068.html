			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS ;  </P> <P> PROP. 128;  </P> <P> FARMERS TO CAMPAIGN AGAINST 'BIG GREEN' INITIATIVE IN SUBURBS  </P> <P> As many as 200 Ventura County farm families are being organized this week for a  door-to-door campaign in the San Fernando Valley as part of a statewide effort  to block passage of the "Big Green" initiative on the November ballot.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Farm Bureau and state organizers are recruiting Ventura farm  families to join as many as 1,500 to 2,000 growers from Fresno to San Diego to  walk door-to-door in the Valley on the weekend of Oct. 27.  </P> <P> Another group of 1,500 growers from Fresno north to the Oregon border will  campaign against the ballot initiative in the San Francisco-area community of  Concord Saturday, organizers added.  </P> <P> While voters are told by the growers how they believe Proposition 128 will hurt  the California and Ventura County agriculture industry, the growers will also  be attempting to gain support for a counter initiative, Proposition 135.  </P> <P> Called the "Careful" initiative, Proposition 135 would require increased  testing for illegal pesticide residues on food, but would be far less  restrictive on growers' practices than Proposition 128.  </P> <P> Proposition 128 would ban an estimated 350 potentially cancer-causing  pesticides now used on food crops. Proposition 128 also contains several  provisions unrelated to agriculture.  </P> <P> If both measures pass and Proposition 135 passes by more votes than Proposition  128, Proposition 135 provisions pertaining to agriculture would prevail and the  rest of Proposition 128 would stand.  </P> <P> "People just don't understand what they are doing with Proposition 128," said  Rex Laird, executive director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. "It's really  scary."  </P> <P> Laird said there are no alternative pest-control tools available to farmers for  many of the chemicals that would be banned under Proposition 128. That could  result in a substantial cost to area growers and knock them out of foreign  markets, he said.  </P> <P> He said growers agree that the agriculture industry must both reduce its use of  chemicals on food crops and monitor water pollution from crop runoff more  carefully.  </P> <P> "There is a very clear direction toward less and less use of pesticides," he  said. "The lack of speed on this is not reticence on the part of the growers,  but the need to remain competitive in the global market place."  </P> <P> Local supporters of Proposition 128 say the agriculture industry must be pushed  into reducing its dependence on chemicals.  </P> <P> They point to the success of Oxnard vegetable grower Dean Walsh, who  organically farms 23 different row crops on 800 acres.  </P> <P> "We are now achieving good, almost up to conventional standard yields in  Ventura County," Walsh said. He depends on the shaping of the plant bed, soil  tilling techniques, composting and crop rotation for much of his pest control  strategy.  </P> <P> Proposition 128 supporters have no war chest to sponsor massive precinct walks,  said Marianne Sprinkel, an organic grower from Carpinteria. Sprinkel organized  a "Big Green" party that drew about 35 people, and is considering setting up a  second event for the Santa Barbara area.  </P> <P> "The whole campaign for 128 is very grass-rootsy," she said. "We're hoping that  at least three other people will throw parties for their friends, and they will  throw parties for their friends."  </P></p>

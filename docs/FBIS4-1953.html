			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, March 18 (XINHUA) -- High technology  industry has stolen the limelight in this heavy industrial  center of Shenyang, provincial capital of northeast China's  Liaoning Province and promised to make the city a high-tech  center in Liaoning and even in the whole of northeast China.    According to statistics, the high-tech industry in the city  has generated eight billion yuan in output value and expects to  add up to 10 billion yuan by 1995.    Shenyang began to industrialize its high-tech sector in 1992  when the state chose it for experimenting with reforms in the  science and technology system.    By the end of last year 1,264 high-tech enterprises had been  set up in the city's Nanhu Science and Technology Development  Zone, including 195 Sino-foreign joint ventures. These  enterprises earned 2.8 billion yuan from technology deals,  industrial production and trade last year. In addition there  are 1,490 non-governmental research organizations which created  1.7 billion yuan in output value.    The annual industrial output value of such sectors as  computer peripherals, bio-technology, numerical controlled  machine tools, and bar code has exceeded 100 million yuan and  that of all-plastic telecommunications cables and closed-type  combined electrical appliances has exceeded 50 million yuan.    In addition, the city has selected 50 old enterprises for  technical transformation by high technology.    The development of high technology has not only laid a solid  foundation for the industrialization of the whole sector but  provided the motive force for the development of research  institutions.    An official from the Shenyang City Commission for Science  and  Technology said that the development of high and new technology  has injected renewed vigor into this heavy industrial center and  a large number of new industries promising large market  potential has taken shape.</p>

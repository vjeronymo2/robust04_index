			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Forte hit Hotels group Forte gave up 8 to 239p, in heavy trading of 7.9m, making it the day's sharpest loser among FT-SE 100 constituents, after Hoare Govett reiterated its negative stance just one week before the group's results. The broker denied reports in the market that it had downgraded profit expectations and said it was maintaining its current estimate of Pounds 88m. The range of predictions is Pounds 86m to Pounds 126m. But Hoare Govett yesterday joined other broking firms which have highlighted the possible negative impact of the new FRS5 accounting standard which deals with off balance sheet debt. Bargain hunters helped Rank Organisation shrug off recent weakness and the shares closed 12 ahead at 398p, on volume of 2.1m. Shares in British Gas slipped on talk of a switch carried out by one leading UK investment bank and continuing concern over the regulator's decision on the rate of return from the company's pipelines. News that the privatised company is to halve the number of its shops and cut 1,700 staff had already been anticipated. The stock, which has underperformed since the start of the year, slid 6 1/2 to 295 1/2 p with 13m traded. News and financial information group Reuters Holdings moved forward 22 to 1949p in spite of a weak US market. Dealers said a big institutional sell order of between 2m and 3m shares, equivalent to around Pounds 50m, had been completed in early trading. The was also also some buying ahead of a Europe-wide presentation to analysts in Geneva on April 25. Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome, which had held up throughout the day, fell 8 to 557p shortly before the close. News leaked into the market that the full text of the Anglo-French Concord study which undermined prospects for AZT, the anti-AIDS treatment, would be published today. AZT is Wellcome's second biggest selling pro-duct. News of an increase in passenger traffic for March boosted British Airways. The shares moved 7 ahead to 422p. The 10 per cent improvement in profits at Highland Distillers to Pounds 23.4m left the shares trailing 12 to 403p. Among stores, Boots improved 7 to 526p, following recommendation from Smith New Court as the market awaited news on the sale of the group's pharmaceutical division. Brewing group Bass closed 3 ahead at 532p, after it refused to comment on recent speculation that it was about to bid for Dutch brewer Grolsch. Building group Blue Cirle fell 12 to 325p on dilution concerns after the company decided to call in its capital bond. Shares in engineering group James Wilkes closed 17 ahead at 177p, following an announcement of an agreed bid from 29.5 per cent stake holder conglomerate Suter. British Steel put on 4 1/4 to 146p, with James Capel reported to have been the buyers. Turnover closed at 9.2m. News that British Aerospace was to join forces with Dasa of Germany and French group Aerospatiale in a research programme to investigate the viability of a successor to Concorde left the market unimpressed. The shares closed 3 lighter at 477p, in thin trading. Mr Chris Avery at Paribas said: 'The results are too far in the future to worry us now. The industry is more likely to develop a 600 seat jet rather than son of Concorde.'</p>

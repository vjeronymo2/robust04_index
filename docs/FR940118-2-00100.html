			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex proposes to amend other rules so that such rules either conform to similar NYSE Rules, are made clear, or are responsive to current market conditions. The Commission believes that these rule changes are also appropriate and logical revisions to Amex Rules. These rule changes are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 103(a)_Dealings When Option Granted or Held: Rule 103(a) prohibits a member, while on the floor, from buying or selling any stock if the member or his firm holds or has granted an option to buy or sell the stock. This rule was adopted prior to 1961. In December 1985, Exchange Act Rule 175 was revised to permit a stock specialist to hedge his stock position with options. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  The Exchange asserts that Rule 103(a) should, therefore, similarly be revised to permit a stock specialist to engage in listed options transactions to hedge his stock position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22670 (November 27, 1985), 50 FR 49808 (December 4, 1985) (File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;85&hyph;18).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that this rule change is appropriate in order to ensure uniformity among Amex Rules and in order to conform Amex Rules to Exchange Act Rule 175. This change will serve to facilitate transactions pursuant to section 6(b)(5) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 103(c)_Discretionary Transactions: This rule provision prohibits the regular or options principal member, while on the floor, from executing or causing to be executed on the Exchange <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  any transaction for the purchase or sale of any security with respect to which transaction such member is vested with discretion as to the choice of a security to be bought or sold, the total amount of any security to be bought or sold, or whether any such transaction shall be one of purchase or sale. The prohibition applies except when the member is executing a transaction for a bona fide cash investment account or for the account of a person who due to illness, absence, etc., is unable to effect transactions for his own account. It is proposed that the exceptions be deleted since they are not appropriate in today's market. The NYSE has adopted a similar revision to a comparable rule. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This includes by means of the issuance or acceptance of a commitment or obligation to trade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex states that the proposed amendment is based on NYSE Rule 95.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission agrees that the proposed amendment to Rule 103(c) is substantially similar to recent revisions to NYSE Rule 95 and therefore should be approved. In the Commission's order approving the NYSE's amendments to Rule 95, we stated that the deletion of the exceptions would strengthen the rule by further limiting the authority of members to execute discretionary orders. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  This change will help to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices in accordance with section 6(b)(5) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29318 (June 17, 1991), 56 FR 28937 (June 25, 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  footnote 12.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 108_Priority and Parity at Openings: Paragraph (c) discusses parity at openings of limit orders in the crowd with orders on the specialist's book. The Exchange states that because Exchange Act Rule 11a1&hyph;1 impacts on the types of orders which may be on parity, Rule 108(c) should include a reference to it. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment No. 3 further amends Rule 108(c) to include a citation to Section 11a of the Exchange Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

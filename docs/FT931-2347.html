			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Letter: Widely differing views on long-term effect of Budget measures on cost of pensions (2) Sir, The reduction in the tax credit on UK dividends paid to pension funds is one of the most significant proposals in this year's Budget. The chancellor has, at a stroke, effectively reduced the value of pension fund assets in the UK. This has serious consequences: Companies which operate 'final salary' pension funds will have to pay higher contributions in the future, unless they cut back on benefits or their employees pay more. Individuals with personal pensions will also have to pay more or accept lower pensions in the future. The Budget proposal should therefore concern a very large proportion of the population but, unless it receives wider coverage in the media, it is unlikely to lose the government many votes at the next election. Indeed the public's ignorance of this issue may lead the chancellor and his advisers to conclude that pensions are a 'soft touch' for further tax in the future. However, before imposing further tax on pension funds the government should bear in mind that: tax incentives are needed to persuade the public to tie up their money in pension schemes (money invested in pension schemes cannot be withdrawn until retirement); unless the public makes adequate private pension provision, the government's aim of reducing dependence on the state will not succeed.

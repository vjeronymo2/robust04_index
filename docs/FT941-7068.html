			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: Crean raises IPounds 63m to fund development James Crean, the Dublin-based industrial holding company, has announced a rights issue, together with a five-year convertible loan stock issue, to raise a total of IPounds 62.8m (Pounds 60.4m), to be used for debt reduction and acquisitions. A total of 11.4m new shares will be issued at 265p per share, on a basis of 35 new units for every existing 100 units. The 1999 convertible loan stock, which carries a 7.25 per cent coupon, will raise IPounds 32.6m on the basis of IPounds 1 of stock for every share held. The loan stock will be convertible into shares on the basis of 32.258 shares for IPounds 100 of loan stock. AIB Capital markets and J&amp;E Davy are to underwrite the issue. The company said that proceeds of the rights would reduce indebtedness, extend the debt maturity profile and finance 'an increasing number of development opportunities' in its food, electrical wholesaling and print and packaging divisions. Gearing is currently close to 100 per cent, with year-end debt estimated at IPounds 76m. The issue will make an immediate significant reduction in gearing and fund development in the near and medium term. The company anticipates pre-tax profits of not less than IPounds 16m before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation for the year ended December 31 1993. Results are due to be published next month, and according to the company no exceptional charges are anticipated. Crean reported a IPounds 15.4m loss last year, following a IPounds 32.5m total write-off of IAS, its aircraft leasing subsidiary. Excluding this item, it reported a pre-tax profit of IPounds 17m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin by </F> correspondent Vitaliy Gan; place and date not given; from the  "Panorama" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Gan] Far from everyone likes this activity of  Russia's. For example, the initiatives aimed at easing tension  around Sarajevo and opening Tuzla airport for humanitarian aid  caused obvious irritation in NATO circles and among some Western  leaders. I have turned to Vitaliy Churkin, Russia's deputy  foreign minister, for comments.    [Churkin] It seems to me that irritation is not exactly a  political category. Indeed, there were some people in the West  who wanted air strikes and saw them as the main task at the  time. That was not possible, and therefore such politicians  probably do not like what Russia did. If one were to speak  about the official political reaction, it was quite normal. We  were thanked for making it possible to find the way out of the  crisis situation around Sarajevo. Moreover, after this,  everyone recognized without reserve, Russia's role in the  Bosnian settlement.    [Gan] Well, Vitaliy Ivanovich, Americans have said that they  have strategic interests in former Yugoslavia. Can you say just  a few words on what sort of interests they might be and whether  Russia has its interests there, too?    [Churkin] I would prefer not to discuss American interests,  especially strategic interests, and what is more, in Yugoslavia.  I believe, of course, that such interests exist since the  United States, like Russia, is a global country and I think that  it is in the interests of both Russia and the United States that  a political solution to the problem in such an explosive region  of the world as the Balkans is found. Speaking about Russia's  interests, our interest is primarily in this. We are not only a  world power but also a European country and naturally it is in  our interests that there is peace in Europe. It is only natural  that apart from purely political interests we have practical  economic interests. As soon as the war ends sanctions against  Yugoslavia will be lifted, and everyone will be able to breathe  normally in the entire Balkan region. We are already preparing  for this, and we hope that Russia's economic interests, along  with the economic interests of other countries, will benefit  greatly from this.    [Gan] One is getting an impression that we are supporting  different sides in the conflict in Bosnia, I mean we and the  West. For example, the Bosnian Serbs leader recently visited  Moscow. Incidentally, they put forward a very important  initiative with regard to the opening of Tuzla airport for  humanitarian aid. The Muslim leader was in Washington. Do you  have anything to say about this?    [Churkin] As for Russia, we try to keep in touch with all  three sides in the conflict. You were right to point out that  Radovan Karadzic was in Moscow. We are expecting to see Haris  Silajdzic, prime minister of the Bosnian Government and one of  the Muslim leaders, in Moscow on Sunday, 6 March. Next week,  probably on Wednesday, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic  will also be in Moscow. I must say that the coming week will be  extremely active from the point of view of our contacts aimed at  settling the Yugoslav conflict. One could say that the center  of world activity will move to Moscow, because apart from those  two visits that I have just mentioned, we are also expecting to  see in Moscow the Italian foreign minister who will mainly be  here because of the Yugoslav affairs, while on 12 March the  Greek foreign minister will come here, to talk about Yugoslavia  as well. This round of contacts will be concluded on 14 March  at a meeting in Vladivostok between our Foreign Minister Kozyrev  and the U.S. state secretary.    [Gan] There has been fighting and missile attacks in  Sarajevo  in the last few days. What are the peace prospects?    [Churkin] The present situation in Sarajevo is better,  although, as you said, there is sporadic fighting, and there  have been reports about single missile attacks. But this is not  at all what it was like, even two weeks ago. The situation in  the city is much calmer. In general, there are still a lot of  conflict zones in Bosnia, and many problems. Combat action  continues in a number of areas of the country. I think that  some partial measures will not be enough here. A global  political settlement is needed here. A really great work has  already been done by everyone toward a settlement. It seems to  me that we still have to make a last step or two. But as you  know, the last battle is always the most difficult one, not only  a military one, but also a political and a diplomatic one.  Therefore, I would not give any particularly optimistic  forecasts. Thank you.</p>

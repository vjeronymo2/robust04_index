			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Barclays quits card venture BARCLAYS yesterday said that it had sold its 49 per cent stake in a joint store card venture with Hertie Waren und Kaufhaus, the German retailer, following a review of its operations in Germany. The group said it had decided that the joint venture, which it set up three years ago to provide credit cards to customers of Hertie in eight German cities, was a distraction from its main credit card business in Germany. The 49 per cent stake was sold for an undisclosed amount to Berliner Bank. Berliner said it had also acquired a further 1 per cent in the Optimus Bank fuer Finanz-Service venture from Hertie, giving each 50 per cent. Barclays said that no decision had yet been made on the future of CFS, its German store card processing arm.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pasminco sets deadline for European assets sale PASMINCO, the Australian lead-zinc group, expected to sell its European assets - put up for sale last week - in six months, said Mr Peter Barnett, managing director, yesterday. The assets include Pasminco's smelter at Avonmouth - the sole domestic source of zinc in the UK - and 50 per cent of the Budelco smelter in the Netherlands. Several companies had already indicated an interest, he said after talking to analysts in London. Mr Barnett later left for Helsinki to talk with Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish group. He will then fly on to Japan because Mitsui and Sumitomo have expressed an interest. Metallgesellschaft, the German group, also wanted details. Mr Barnett said the European assets would not necessarily be sold as a package. However, Pasminco's three companies at Bloxwich in the UK West Midlands, which make a number of zinc alloy products, would be sold with the Avonmouth smelter because their operations, which employ about 850 in total, were tightly linked. Analysts said that Pasminco should easily find a buyer for the Avonmouth smelter, which recently completed a Pounds 10m programme to expand its annual capacity to 105,000 tonnes of zinc and 50,000 tonnes of lead bullion. However, there were doubts about the 200,000-tonnes-a-year zinc smelter at Budel in the Netherlands. Budelco, jointly owned by Billiton, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, will run out of storage capacity for jarosite, an iron-bearing waste product from electrolytic smelting, in 1995. The Dutch authorities want proposals for the future of the smelter this year. The partners have said they are willing to contribute F310m (about Pounds 100m) towards necessary environmental changes. Mr Barnett said the partners had discarded as uneconomic a scheme to reprocess the jarosite into an inert slag for building material. They were now looking at a project to treat the jarosite with other waste materials, such as water sludges, from the locality at a new waste treatment plant. There were still technical and economic issues to be resolved. One option was to close the Budel smelter, which employs 600. But 'closure would be a great pity because it is one of the most efficient zinc smelters in the world,' Mr Barnett insists. Potential buyers might 'look on this as an opportunity to invest in a world-class smelter and a new waste treatment plant.' Avonmouth's performance had improved in two years and both smelters were well located for the European market. The sale would enable Pasminco to reduce its debt and to focus its attention on its Australian operations.</p>

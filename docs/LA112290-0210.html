			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> METHAMPHETAMINE SEIZED; MAN HELD  </P> <P> Acting on a tip, Newport Beach narcotics officers arrested a Garden Grove man  at his home on suspicion of drug possession and confiscated 5 ounces of  methamphetamine, eight assorted firearms and $200 in cash, police said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> James Alan Gassaway, 43, was taken into custody Tuesday afternoon at his Otis  Street home, minutes after undercover detectives found a jar full of  methamphetamine buried in his front yard, Newport Beach Police Sgt. Andy Gonis  said.  </P> <P> The self-employed truck driver was being held on $50,000 bail at Newport Beach  City Jail and is expected to be arraigned on drug possession charges Friday at  Harbor Municipal Court, Gonis said.  </P> <P> Gonis said detectives working on a case received information that they would be  able to find the drug, also known as speed, at Gassaway's house, Gonis said. He  declined to elaborate on the investigation.  </P> <P> At the house, Gonis said, one of the plainclothes detectives noticed a spot on  the yard that looked suspicious.  </P> <P> "They saw that the ground had recently been dug up," Gonis said. "Something  looked like it was buried there."  </P> <P> The officers then discovered a buried plastic jar with a sandwich-size plastic  bag stuffed into it. Inside the bag was a substance that police believe to be  methamphetamine with a street value of about $14,000, Gonis said.  </P> <P> Armed with search warrants, the detectives combed the house and found two  shotguns, two rifles and four handguns, Gonis said. About $200 in Gassaway's  wallet was confiscated.  </P> <P> There was no one else in the house, Gonis said.JAMES M. GOMEZ  </P></p>

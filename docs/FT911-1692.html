			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / PM mediates pay deal to clear way for Australian port reform AUSTRALIA'S waterfront reform programme appeared to be back on course yesterday after employers and unions ended a pay dispute following all-night negotiations chaired by Mr Bob Hawke, the prime minister. Mr Hawke emerged from nearly 18 hours of non-stop talks in Sydney to announce a deal which could clear the way for changes in manning requirements and work practices in ports around Australia. The deal must be ratified by the waterfront employers' association, the Waterside Workers' Federation, the main dockside union, and the Industrial Relations Commission, the national labour court. However, it represents a significant political victory for Mr Hawke, who has made waterfront reform a key element in a wider programme of structural reform of the economy. The prime minister intervened in the dispute after the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) blocked waterfront reform in protest at a 2.5 per cent ceiling on wage increases imposed across industry by the Commission. The Commission's ruling conflicted with an earlier agreement between the ACTU and the government, known as the Accord, under which workweek, plus further productivity-backed payments and improved superannuation. The deal reached yesterday excludes superannuation, but provides for most other elements of the Accord, including the ADollars 12 payment. Waterfront workers will also receive a further 6.12 per cent pay increase over two years, provided reforms are agreed and implemented. The unions agreed to ask the Commission to ratify the deal, removing employers' fears that an agreement struck outside the framework of the centralised wage fixing system could reduce their legal protection from industrial disruption. Mr Richard Setchell, managing director of Conaust, the biggest stevedoring company, said the unions' agreement to deliver reform before receiving productivity increases represented a significant breakthrough. 'They will get nothing, other than the ADollars 12, unless they come up with the goods. That is a huge contrast with the past 50 years,' he said. Mr Setchell said Conaust, a subsidiary of Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation of the UK, hopes an agreement reducing its Sydney workforce by 30 per cent will be implemented next month. Only one company has so far implemented an agreement under the reform process, which the government says will reduce the waterfront workforce from 6,500 to 4,500 by September next year. The ACTU, which voted on Wednesday to campaign for full payment of the Accord, said the deal showed employers were willing to recognise that the Commission's 2.5 per cent ceiling was unworkable. 'It is an indication of what is possible if employers are willing to sit down and talk to us,' said Mr Martin Ferguson, ACTU president.</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION;  </P> <P> SAMPLE DAY AT THE MART: IT'S A SHOPPER'S BONANZA  </P> <P> Bargain hunters who get even more of a thrill when they have to dig for the  deals say the California Mart is a shoppers' nirvana. Even the size of the  place suggests heavenly proportions. It's a rambling, three-wing, 13-story  structure at 110 E. 9th St., with 2,000 showrooms and more than 10,000  collections of clothing, shoes and accessories to paw through -- all at  wholesale prices.  </P> <P> Most days the building is only open to retailers, and the items they inspect  are one-of-a-kind samples of next season's merchandise that will be delivered  to their stores for fall.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Open to the Public  </P> <P> But then there is sample day, a once-a-month, wild and woolly free-for-all open  to the public. It's a somewhat erratic event, scheduled on the last Friday of  many, but not all, months. Today's is the last one of the summer, because there  is no sample day in August.  </P> <P> From the time the doors open at 9 a.m. until they close at 5 p.m., showroom  owners will be selling off last season's goods. But because they work so far  ahead, last season by their definition is this season for everybody else.  Today's sale is filled with summer clothes.  </P> <P> The bargains are impressive, especially considering that most of the  merchandise is better quality and often carries a familiar label. And  everything is right in style. At last month's sale, there were soft, colorful  children's leather shoes from Australia for $5 a pair. Psychedelic-colored  cotton T-shirts for teen-agers were $15. Textured suede purses were $60. One  showroom offered cotton print camisoles and tap pants for $15 a set and slips  for $8.  </P> <P> It's easy to find things because this isn't a messy madhouse. But there are no  dressing rooms for trying on clothes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Preview of Fall  </P> <P> Summertime sales also offer a glimpse at what will be in stores after Labor  Day, because that new merchandise now fills the showroom windows. On display  are suede and leather suits by Vakko, the well-known New York label, which will  be available in September. Shapely and tailored, they are shown in plum and  crimson, among other colors. Look for plenty of animal-skin prints and  Southwest motifs too, hinting at other trends to come. Hat lovers will get a  preview of some ornately feathered creations by George Zamau'l in brilliant  blue, raspberry and yellow that won't be in stores for several months.  </P> <P> More than bargains and previews of future fashion looks, sample day is unusual  for its ambiance. From the moment shoppers enter the expansive lobby crowned by  a canopy of stained glass, they're in for a different experience. The ground  floor could pass for a bustling business hotel. The jam-packed escalators carry  shoppers up and down from the center of the lobby, and people watchers can  catch the action while relaxing in deep, comfortable chairs. The snack shops  around the lobby include bakeries, salad bars and pizzerias, but food and drink  are priced at retail, even on sample day.  </P> <P> You can spot the veteran shoppers right away. They're at the door before 9  a.m., shopping bags in hand (because the showrooms don't supply bags), cash  practically burning a hole in their purses. And cash is required. Checks and  credit cards are not accepted.  </P> <P> Well before noon, they are already pouring out of the elevators onto the  building's upper levels, heading straight for their favorite showrooms and  attacking the sale racks with gusto. One realtor from Hacienda Heights said she  spends about $200 on clothes for herself and her two young daughters at every  outing to the Mart. She flicked quickly through a rack of children's clothes as  she spoke, found nothing of interest, and raced off to another showroom.  </P> <P> Doris Deitering, a seasoned sample-day shopper and a physical education teacher  from Diamond Bar, confessed: "I am hooked. I hardly ever buy anything in the  stores anymore."  </P> <P> Deitering and others with her considerable expertise know that every floor has  its specialty. The third, for example, is for women's wear, the fourth and  fifth are for boys and men, the sixth floor is for children's fashions. It's  most efficient to plan your shopping tour to include what you most want to see,  because it is virtually impossible to get to more than about two dozen  showrooms without risking absolute exhaustion.  </P> <P> Not all the showrooms have samples for sale each month, but most carry a sign  in the window telling whether there are items available that day. Where there  are sales, the selection is wide, but the range of sizes is sharply limited.  Most women's clothes and shoes are Size 6. Men's sizes are usually 30 to 34,  with shoes in Size 8. The children's wear selection is broader, from infant  sizes to Size 14, with shoe sizes from 1 to 3.  </P> <P> There is just a sprinkling of other sizes.  </P> <P> While plenty of shoppers adore sample day, the Mart owners and tenants say they  approach it with some trepidation. To them, it can be a day of security  problems, unruly crowds and a lack of understanding by shoppers about how the  bargain day works.  </P> <P> "Sample sales are a real thorn in our side," said Susan Morse-Lebow, a general  partner and director of operations for the Mart. She said tenants have a clause  in their leases prohibiting sales to the public, but "they all violate it." She  said Mart management allows it because the event is a longstanding tradition.  Occasionally, however, when the halls get too crowded or the public becomes too  disruptive, she asks the Mart's security guards to gradually and politely clear  the building.  </P> <P> Nearly a dozen tenants interviewed agreed that sample day presents its  problems. They find that some shoppers expect to find the same color and size  selections they find at the local mall. Some ignore window signs stating that  there is nothing for sale in a particular showroom and barge in where other  business is being conducted. Other trials and tribulations the reps associate  with the day include customers' failure to carry cash and their indignation  upon discovering that shopping bags are not supplied. But reps said it was  still worth the effort, because it allows them a way to clear out merchandise  and generate cash.  </P> <P> If sample day is a version of nirvana, it's an imperfect one. Yet the place  always seems to be filled with smiling shoppers.  </P> <P> Mart Smarts  </P> <P> If you want to try sample-day shopping, here are some tips to make it more  pleasant.  </P> <P> It costs $7.50 a day for parking underneath or across the street from the Mart.  There are less expensive lots nearby, but metered parking won't give you enough  time to explore.  </P> <P> Do not bring children 13 or under or infants, in or out of strollers. Mart  security guards will not let you in.  </P> <P> Wear comfortable shoes. The Mart has three interconnected, 13-story buildings,  and you will be walking for miles.  </P> <P> Check the directory in the lobby of the Mart or near the elevators on each  floor if you are looking for a specific brand.  </P> <P> Observe the signs on the showroom doors. Showroom sales reps post a notice  saying whether they have samples for sale.  </P> <P> Bring only cash. The reps do not accept checks or credit cards.  </P> <P> Bring your own shopping bags. Showrooms do not have them.  </P> <P> Don't try to bargain. The prices marked are final.  </P></p>

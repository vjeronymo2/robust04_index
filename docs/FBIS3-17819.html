			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Morozov] </F>   [Text] Bucharest March 30 TASS -- "In principle Romania  has reconsidered its attitude towards Russia and is seeking to  develop cooperation with it in all spheres," Russian Defence  Minister Pavel Grachev said upon the completion of his three-day  visit to Romania.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Grachev said  that the trip had been postponed twice. "When I was flying here  I expected to see restraint and hear traditional phrases instead  of words about closer contacts," he said. "However pretty soon,  mostly on the initiative of the Romanian side, there were no  doubts about the need for my visit left, all our neighbours  stressed that despite the long stagnation in bilateral relations  Romania is ready to develop equal and mutually beneficial ties  with Russia," the minister said.    Relations between the armed forces of the two countries  broke  up after the conflict in the Dniester Republic, Grachev  continued. Now Romanian partners have shown that they have  changed their views. "During the talks none of our partners  tried to raise the question about the situation in Moldova.  This is a real turn -- not to connect our bilateral relations  with the situation in a third country. The situation in Moldova  is the internal affair of that independent state and its leaders  will settle it on their own," he said.    The key question of Russian-Romanian military relations is  cooperation in the military and technical sphere. The  disintegration of the Warsaw Pact has severed traditional ties  between the two countries. The bulk of machinery and equipment  now used by the Romanian Army was made in the Soviet Union.  Some spare parts could be produced in Romania, but the majority  of them have to be supplied from Russia. Now that Romanian and  Russian defence departments signed an agreement on cooperation,  Romanian plants which have been making spare parts for obsolete  military equipment will switch to civilian production, others  will be modernised with Russia's assistance.    Romania was the first to have joined the Partnership for  Peace programme and made no secret of its intention to  eventually join NATO, Grachev noted. "President (Ion) Iliescu  told me that Romania calls for integration into NATO with all  other countries simultaneously, including Russia. The head of  the Romanian state foresees the transformation of that  military-political alliance into a military-peace-making union.  Moreover, the president of Romania prioritises partnership not  so much in the military as in the economic sphere," he added.    Many former Warsaw Pact countries consider the Partnership  for Peace programme as a stage towards full integration with  NATO. This is a very long process which will go gradually. Now  these countries are not ready to enter NATO and this  transitional period may last eight to ten years, according to  various estimates.    "As for Russia, we will not integrate into the structures of  the North Atlantic Alliance. One of the reasons is that it is  impossible to adjust Russian nuclear missiles to NATO standards.  Russia is a great power and it has a great Army with powerful  modern weapons. That's why we stand for close cooperation, but  the Partnership for Peace programme is not a transitional stage  for us," Grachev said.    "Fears that this programme may hamper the establishment of  new military structures within the CIS are groundless," the  minister continued. "There are certain circles in Russia which  have never stopped considering Western countries, let alone  NATO, as an enemy. It is they who claim that Russia is allegedly  being involved in NATO structures and that NATO will soon govern  Russia. This will never happen. We can exist on our own and  resist any bloc, including NATO, if the need arises. It is time  to stop frightening our people with American and NATO threat,"  he said.    In a separate statement made at a news conference in  Bucharest, Grachev said that Russian troops will act as  peace-keeping forces in the former Soviet Union, pending a  respective resolution by the U.N. Security Council. Russian  troops will be deployed in a republic only with consent of its  leaders and will act in conjunction with the troops of that  republic to prevent bloodsheds.    At present, 15,000 Russian troops are engaged in  peace-keeping operations. The issue is expected to be discussed  during U.N. Secretary General Butros Butros-Ghali's upcoming  visit to Moscow in April.</p>

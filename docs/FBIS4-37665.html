			<p>BFN     [Text] A source at the Tunisian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, answering a question about the latest developments of  the situation in Rwanda and especially the intention of some  non-African countries to send forces to that country, said that  Tunisia, which chairs the Organization of African Unity, OAU,  affirms that the Rwandan issue should be tackled according to  Security Council resolution 918 dated 17 March 1994 and within  the framework of the 30th OAU summit decision on the need to  base every move on the following principles:    -- coordinating with the OAU regarding the sending of any  forces to Rwanda in support of the central organ of conflict  prevention, management, and settlement mechanism.    -- only African forces and no other should be sent to Rwanda  as stated by the above mentioned Security Council resolution.    -- securing the consent of the conflicting parties before  taking the initiative of sending troops.    -- enlisting the material and logistic support of other  countries wishing to contribute to the establishment of peace  and stability in that African country.    The same source added that Tunisia, as chairman of the OAU,  sees that it is preferable to support this framework agreed on  by the African countries and by the Security Council and  considers that any other initiative outside this framework would  further complicate the situation and would hinder the  reconciliation and peace efforts in that sisterly African  country.</p>

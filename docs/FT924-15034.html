			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Dublin approves job threat fund The Irish government last night approved an IPounds 50m (Pounds 46m) 'Market Development Fund' to protect an estimated 30,000 jobs in Ireland's manufacturing industry that have been placed at risk by sterling's devaluation, writes Tim Coone in Dublin. The fund will be allocated to companies which have a significant share of their exports going to the UK market, or in the domestic or third country markets in which they face competition from UK companies. Payments will be made at the rate of IPounds 50 per week per employee, and is expected to last until March 1993.</p>

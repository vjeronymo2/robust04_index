			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> A timely -- if unrelated -- centerpiece for a group exhibit of work by young  Los Angeles artists is a stained and faded flag. In 1965, an otherwise obscure  artist named Marc Morrel tied the flag into the squat shape of a bolster to  protest the Vietnam War in 1965. The following year, when the piece was  exhibited in a New York gallery, dealer Stephen Radich was convicted of  violating the city's flag desecration statute. After a prolonged court fight,  the conviction was finally reversed in 1974 by a federal district court.  </P> <P> The newsworthiness of Morrel's piece, of course, lies in the recent hullabaloo  over presumed flag desecration -- outraged responses to the recent Supreme  Court decision on flag burning and to a flag piece displayed earlier this year  at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. But distanced from the era that  inspired it and separated from the rhetoric that swirled around it, the bundled  flag itself seems a calm and sober piece. A quiet little parcel, it suggests  repression and constraint -- a national symbol made musclebound and dumb and  humble.  </P> <P> Of the other 13 artists in "Fresh Art from Hollywood," the most familiar name  is that of Judy Fiskin, whose tiny black-and-white photographs offer crisp  glimpses of the quietly distinctive personalities of Southern California homes.  </P> <P> One of the most distinctive pieces in the show is "Posing Threats," Kevin  Miller's large painting of three silhouetted soldiers in uniforms of different  vintages. Although the doughboy's rifle is easy to make out, it's anyone's  guess as to what objects the other two are holding, and perhaps that mystery  (suggesting the ultra-specialized aspects of modern-day warfare) lies at the  heart of the piece.  </P> <P> Painter Judy Kameon looks afresh at a number of familiar objects, most  rewardingly in "Large Honeycomb," in which the irregularities of the artist's  touch and the brushy color deliberately fight the serial rigor of the magnified  grid pattern.  </P> <P> James Trivers' down-home canvases are filled chock-a-block with little  vignettes (key moments from the life of Elvis Presley in "Elvis, What  Happened?") and overlaid with big images that pop out when viewed with 3-D  glasses. Nicholette Kominos' pale paintings with odd bobbing shapes are most  appealing when regular patterns of texture and quirky form unite, as in  "Periods of Water No. 3."  </P> <P> Of Lauri Sing's mixed-media works, the most ambitious is "Boots, wood plank,  cup and two figures," in which blocks of color, a real wood plank and objects  rendered as if in imitation of print techniques suggest a puzzling yet oddly  intense form of rebus.  </P> <P> Daniel Wheeler offers several enigmatic wall pieces, the most formally  satisfying of which is "Utterance (III)," a tall plaque with a thermometer-like  slit, attached to a low-slung vessel containing a wax deposit.  </P> <P> Other artists with work in the show are Paul Knotter, Chris Wilder, Peter  Zecher, Kevin Miller, Darcy Huebler and Tomas .

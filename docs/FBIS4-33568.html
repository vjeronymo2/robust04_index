			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 7 Jun (DPA) -- An undetermined number of  former soldiers, who were once assigned to the Government  Ministry, decided to take over the Managua Cathedral this  afternoon (local) after approximately 40 former servicemen had  decided to peacefully occupy the Venezuelan Embassy to demand  social and economic assistance.    The double occupation by the former servicemen and former  Nicaraguan resistance members, aimed at demanding the  distribution of land for the building of homes and other  assistance, prompted the police to assume positions near the  scene of the events.    The police arrested nearly 10 people who participated in the  brief occupation of the Managua Cathedral.    The police are searching the area near the cathedral, which  is located near Managua's heavily used eastern highway. Deputy  Commander Pedro Aguilar, head of the Public Security Police,  told reporters the deployment of troops had been carried out in  order to guarantee "security."    Other police officers stated they were awaiting orders and  had not breached the embassy grounds where the retired former  servicemen are.    At least six Venezuelan diplomats are reportedly still  inside  the diplomatic mission.    It is possible Ambassador Juan Jose Monsant could be  negotiating, given he is aware of the demands being made by the  former servicemen, who claim they belong to the Movement for a  Just and Honorable Compensation [Movimiento Pro Indemnizacion  Digna y Justa]. This group contends that for the past years it  has been demanding retirement benefits from the Chamorro  government.</p>

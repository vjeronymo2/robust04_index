			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> MORE SAFETY FEATURES URGED FOR VEHICLES  </P> <P> Researchers said manufacturers of mini-vans and light trucks should voluntarily  implement safety regulations that already are mandatory for passenger cars. If  they don't, the California Public Interest Research Group said in a report,  thousands more lives will be lost in the next six years until the federal  government orders their use. The report said such safety features as front-seat  passive restraints, head rests, shoulder restraints, crush-resistant roofs and  reinforced side-door strength are urgently needed for mini-vans and light  trucks.  </P></p>

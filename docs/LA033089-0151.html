			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Giuliani to Advise Japan: Former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, who  led a crackdown on white-collar crime during his five-year tenure, says he will  travel to Japan next month to offer advice on prosecuting insider trading and  other securities fraud. The Japanese government is embroiled in a stock scandal  of its own that has implicated government officials and is putting pressure on  Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. Giuliani, whose office brought about 50  securities fraud indictments in his term that ended in January, said he was  contacted by private attorneys in Japan and will lecture to officials in Tokyo  April 13-14. "I think it's very, very important for the United States that in  other countries that are part of the world market that we have a similar set of  rules," he said. "Otherwise we're at a competitive disadvantage." Japan has the  world's biggest stock market.  </P></p>

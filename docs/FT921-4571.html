			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / International Company News: Parretti claims victory in latest MGM-Pathe twist MR GIANCARLO Parretti, the controversial Italian financier, claimed yesterday that he had scored a court victory in Rome in his long-running battle with Credit Lyonnais, the French state bank, for control of MGM-Pathe, the financially crippled Hollywood studio. Mr Parretti said a Rome court had ordered the sequestration of shares in Pathe Communications and MGM-Pathe Communications, throwing into confusion an earlier US court decision giving control of the MGM board to Credit Lyonnais nominees. Full details of the decision were not released. However, the move probably represents an attempt by Mr Parretti to bring Credit Lyonnais, whose Dutch subsidiary Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland largely financed his Dollars 1.3bn November 1990 takeover of MGM-Pathe, back to the negotiating table. Mr Parretti said in an interview last night he believed a compromise solution would be found, but pledged to 'defend my company'. The mercurial Italian financier - who said he was still appealing a four-year jail sentence in connection with his conviction on fraud charges in Naples - argued that the Rome ruling would mean the immediate ousting of Mr Alan Ladd, the MGM chairman backed by Credit Lyonnais. Mr Parretti said that in place of Mr Ladd, the Rome judge had appointed Mr Cesare De Michelis, the brother of Mr Gianni De Michelis, Italy's foreign minister. Last December, Credit Lyonnais gained control of Pathe Communications after a long legal battle in the US. Voting rights for Mr Parretti's controlling stake in Pathe Communications, which in turn controls MGM-Pathe, were subsequently allocated to Credit Lyonnais, which installed new management. Mr Parretti and two associates were removed as directors. There is now likely to be frenzied legal activity ahead of a second legal hearing, set for April 28, when the Rome court will decide whether to confirm the sequestration. Mr Parretti may well seek to use the interval to negotiate a deal with Credit Lyonnais.</p>

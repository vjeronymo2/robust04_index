			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 10 May (NOTIMEX) -- Violent student  protests to demand the restoration of subsidized bus fare rates  occurred for the fourth consecutive day today, police sources  have reported. The protests on Monday were concentrated in the  western part of Caracas, where groups of students seized at  least two mass transit buses and clashed with riot police. It  was unofficially reported that the young students, most of them  high school students, set one of the vehicles on fire.    The disturbance, which spread to five areas west of the  Venezuelan capital, is the most serious distubance reported so  far in the government of Christian Democratic President Rafael  Caldera, who took office last February.    The students, between the ages of 16 and 19, were also  demanding punishment for those responsible for the murder of a  fellow classmate. The student was shot three times by a  policeman during the protests that took place in downtown  Caracas.    On Monday, transportation sector workers went on strike to  demand a 50-percent increase in bus fares and to protest the  government's delay in the payment of student bus fare subsidies.    Similar protests resulted in the deaths of dozens of  students  during the administrations of social democrat Jaime Lusinchi  (1984-89), Carlos Andres Perez (1989-93), and Ramon Velasquez  (1993-94).</p>

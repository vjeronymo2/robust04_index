			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Brussels warns audio-visual sector The European film and television industry is in a state of financial crisis and will decline steadily against its US competitors unless it is radically overhauled, the European Commission has warned. The diagnosis, made in a discussion paper on the audio-visual industry adopted by the commission yesterday, calls on governments to provide more effective funding and co-operation to operate on a trans-national basis. The document appears to reflect the divisions which remain among member states over Europe's audio-visual policy in the aftermath of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations and the commission's own uncertainty about how far it can endorse protectionism in the European industry. Instead of proposing a single strategy for investment, the paper poses questions about the future of regulation, financial stimulus, and national convergence in the industry. This rhetorical formula is intended to 'generate debate among the industry's practitioners and member states', according to Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, EU cultural commissioner. The vagueness of the paper is likely to disappoint some producers hoping for more urgent and concrete proposals. Commission green papers, however, deliberately avoid being proscriptive and do not contain precise proposals. Both Mr Pinheiro, and Mr Jacques Delors, the commission president, are expected to put their political weight behind the document at a press conference today . Both have been keen to stress the political significance of the report, pitched as a cornerstone of the commission's manifesto for developing Europe's 'information highways'. A group of leading European television and film producers and directors, including Mr David Puttnam, were among those who submitted much more precise proposals to the Commission. They argued for a levy on every sector of the audio-visual industry to help fund more commercially-orientated production and 'soft loans' to help create a number of competing European-wide distribution organisations each capitalised at up to Ecu1bn (Pounds 780m). Nearly 80 per cent of the films shown in Europe are now of US origin, the paper notes, with US film distributors enjoying a huge advantage over their fragmented and under-funded European counterparts, currently split between 1,000 different operators. The Commission is due to submit the paper to the European parliament for discussion in the autumn, before drawing up proposals for possible new legislation at the end of the year.</p>

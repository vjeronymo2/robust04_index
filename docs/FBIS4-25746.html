			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Linda Choy in Beijing and Queenie Wang in Hong Kong] </F>   [Text] China's Hong Kong-based advisory body, the  Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), will consider calls to  change the territory's electoral system from a single-seat,  single-vote model to proportional representation during its  plenary session next month.    The proposal was put forward by PWC political sub-group  members at a two-day meeting which ended in Beijing yesterday.  One delegate, Professor Lau Siu-kai, said members felt  proportional representation was more appropriate for the  territory. He said it would preserve the nature of the  legislature as a watchdog to the Government, with reasonable  representation from various political groups. Professor Lau  said the group would discuss various models later in the year.    Adoption of a proportional representation system would mean  voters choosing between political parties rather than individual  candidates when casting their vote. Seats obtained by each  party would be in proportion to the percentage of votes they had  won.    The news came as legislators and academics expressed fears  the Government's voter registration drive was heading for  disaster. With less than three weeks before the campaign's July  1 deadline, 1.66 million eligible voters have yet to enroll.  The situation is even worse among people aged 18 to 21 who will  be able to vote for the first time in September's district board  elections following the recent lowering of the voting age. Only  28 percent, or 56,000, of the 200,000 potential electors have  enrolled, according to figures released by the Registration and  Election Office. The two-month campaign has reaped just 340,000  new voters, marginally increasing the proportion of Hong Kong's  potential 3.9 million electorate who are registered to 57  percent, or 2.24 million.    The apathy was evident yesterday at a registration drive in  Kwun Tong. One potential voter said: "I'm not interested in  politics and I don't believe any of the politicians could  genuinely represent my interests." A queue of potential  electors lined up in front of the Telford Gardens registration  counter in Kowloon Bay yesterday, proved on closer inspection to  be collecting free balloons given away as part of the drive.    The registration campaign has cost $6.6 million. But  legislator and Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood  chairman Frederick Fung Kin-kee was shocked by the response. "I  would have expected at least half of eligible voters between 18  and 21 to have registered," he said.</p>

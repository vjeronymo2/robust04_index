			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Leading Article: The G7 at an impasse IF MEETINGS of finance ministers and central bank governors of the group of seven leading industrial countries were intended to deliver day-to-day, co-ordinated management of the global economy, then its latest one would have to be judged disappointing. From the American perspective - that the G7 should concentrate, first and foremost, on promoting global economic growth this year, next year or, indeed, in any year - the meeting in Washington must have been a failure. Happily, it was not, or at least not altogether. It has, at least, pushed the case for aid to the former Soviet Union up the international agenda, though over liberalisation of world trade the G7 remains an egregious flop. With his remark that the G7 should spend more time thinking about world growth, the US Treasury secretary, Nicholas Brady, was speaking oft-repeated lines. Equally familiar by now was the response of the two addressees: Germany and Japan. In this case, the Japanese refusal to accept a fiscal commitment even prolonged the meeting by two hours. It was not always thus. 'Co-ordination' used to mean that the US did what it wanted, while everybody else also did what the US wanted. Now it means that the major players first argue with one another, whereupon each does precisely what it wants. No accident This decline of American leadership is no accident. It reflects the reduction in American geo-strategic leverage upon its principal allies after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the poor quality of much US economic policymaking, the weak intellectual case for a monetary and fiscal policy oriented primarily to short-term growth and, not least, the legacy of past German and Japanese obedience to American behests. Germany only flirted, and that rather briefly, with global exchange rate stabilisation and the search for short-term economic growth. Japan, by contrast, was seduced. The short-term result was rapid monetary expansion and asset price inflation. The longer-term result has been the asset price deflation and economic miseries of today. No wonder then that the Japanese are unwilling to risk the stability they have been trying to regain in return for renewed pursuit of short-term growth. Furthermore, the asset price collapse has been matched by that in the influence of the politicians. Nobody can now force the Ministry of Finance to relax the fiscal reins or the Bank of Japan to loosen the monetary ones. Intensely irritating Meanwhile, calls from Washington for smaller fiscal deficits must be intensely irritating to the Germans. US policymakers have, after all, called for a fiscal boost by Germany almost every year since the G7 was formed. More irritating still, the US has itself followed the most consistently profligate fiscal policy of the three major economies. If global interest rates are to fall - as, indeed, they must - the US must put its own fiscal house in order. Otherwise real rates of interest on American long-term bonds are unlikely to fall from their current high levels. However inhibited the US may be in putting its case, it does have one. Fiscal flexibility in Japan would be desirable. Equally, current European monetary policy is inappropriate to European conditions. Europe has a single monetary policy, but one dedicated to stability within only one region. Worse, that region is in the throes of an exceptional shock to its economic and political stability, as the current strikes in Germany bear witness. Europe now suffers from most of the disadvantages of economic and monetary union, but gains none of the advantages. The G7 log-jam is only likely to be broken by changed economic circumstances among the main players. The world must hope, instead, that the International Monetary Fund is right to forecast strong recovery next year. In the meantime, the G7 has been right to focus attention on providing support to the reforming countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Equally important, however, is completion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. G7 summits have twice promised a successful end to these negotiations; twice they have failed. The leaders of the G7 cannot afford to leave the issue unresolved until they next meet, in Munich this summer.</p>

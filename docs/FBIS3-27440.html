According to a report on the economic development in 1993  and  the outlook for 1994 issued by the Economic Ministry and the  State Statistical Committee to the State Duma members, the  country's gross national product (GNP) in 1993 dropped by 12  percent from 1992, while the industrial production decreased by  16 percent.    The country's industrial production has gone down sharply  since the beginning of 1994, with a 23.1-percent drop in January  over the same period of 1992, the report said.    Unemployment was increasing rapidly and had reached 7.7  million by the end of last year, the report added.    The country's inflation also remained high last year. All  prices for consumer goods were soaring by 8.4 times while those  for manufactured goods went up by nine times.    Russia also faces a grim situation in regard to its foreign  economic relations and foreign exchange which the country badly  needs for investment in some projects and for support for  ongoing economic reform.    Meanwhile, the funds allocated by the government in the  budget to the country's science and technology also decreased in  1993.</p>

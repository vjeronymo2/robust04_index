			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> DISRESPECT: There's a war of words in the otherwise dormant race for state  treasurer. . . . It started when Democratic contender Kathleen Brown referred  to one Republican opponent as an "Orange County gal". . . . That would be  Republican Angela (Bay) Buchanan of Irvine. . . . Buchanan, a former U.S.  treasurer, lashed back, accusing Brown of "the worst kind of condescension and  disrespect" for women in politics and said Brown "must think the women of  Orange County are dull, politically unsophisticated or not very bright." So  far, no response from Brown. Kristina Lindgren and Mark Pinsky  </P></p>

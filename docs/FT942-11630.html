			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Markets have gone too far, says Bentsen The Clinton administration has come a long way in its remarks on exchange rates since taking office 15 months ago. A year ago, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, prompted the dollar to slide to Y118.20, at the time its lowest level in four decades, when he observed in passing at the Washington National Press Club that he would like to see a stronger yen. A few weeks later, President Bill Clinton, asked how the US trade deficit with Japan could be reduced, responded: 'Number one, the appreciation of the Japanese yen.' The dollar duly dipped further. The administration has since then become more wary of commenting on foreign exchange issues. The Treasury is now in the habit of carefully drafting short and precise statements, and senior officials decline pointedly to elaborate. Nothing has served to reverse the impression that the Clinton administration, with its entire international economic policy built on a promise to open up markets overseas, would still not be averse to a lower dollar-yen rate in its search for ways of penetrating the Japanese market. 'It's got to the point now where the market interprets any comment from the administration as tacit acceptance of the dollar moving further down,' says Mr Ravi Bulchandani, an economist with Morgan Stanley, the New York investment bank. Mr Bentsen's statements have had to become more and more explicit in their rejection of a further depreciation of the dollar. 'We're not going to try to devalue ourselves into their markets. We are in no way managing the dollar in that regard,' he said before meeting fellow finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations two weeks ago. Yesterday, he had to move even further, insisting in a two-paragraph statement accompanying concerted intervention by G7 central banks in support of the dollar that the administration 'sees no advantage in an undervalued currency'. 'These operations reflect our view that recent movements in exchange markets have gone beyond what is justified by economic fundamentals,' Mr Bentsen said. Mr Bentsen's assessment, backed by the other G7 ministers, has the economic numbers on its side. Judging by continuing strong data, the US recovery is still far stronger than either Japan's or Germany's. Yesterday's intervention may, in fact, have some enduring effect on the dollar's value against the D-Mark and other European currencies, which has slumped in the wake of its plunge against the yen. 'They have a fair chance of stabilising the dollar against the D-Mark. In that instance, co-ordinated intervention is acting in the same direction as prospective monetary policy changes,' says Mr Bulchandani, noting that while the German Bundesbank is expected to keep lowering its interest rates, the Federal Reserve is expected to keep raising its. But traders still seem unpersuaded, while trade tension with Japan remains unresolved, of the administration's commitment to a serious reversal in dollar-yen trends. The recent change in the Japanese government has done nothing to raise hopes of an early settlement to the row. Market analysts interpret the administration's decision to step into the foreign exchange market in recent days as motivated more by concern over the knock-on effects on the bond market than by disagreement with the exchange rates. The sliding dollar has added a risk premium for foreign institutions considering investing in US bonds. That has, in turn, given an extra spin to the wheel of rising long-term interest rates, which had already begun to move quite fast enough for the administration's taste, in response to the Fed's tightening of short-term interest rates and to ever-increasing inflationary fears. Against this background, the administration may have to brace itself for a steeper rise in long-term interest rates before the dollar returns to stability.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul, June 9 (A.A.) -- British Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd said at the opening ceremony of the NATO  foreign ministers meeting that the Cold War is over and now the  time is coming for cooperation and partnership.    He said that relations with Russia have a great importance  for NATO, expressing satisfaction upon the announcement by  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev that Russia will sign the  Partnership for Peace [PFP] document.    Referring to a demand by Russia on `flexibility' within the  document, Hurd said that the PFP has a very realistic character  and it is large enough for including each country.    He also recalled words said earlier by Foreign Minister  Hikmet Cetin, adding that NATO will make every effort for  bringing lasting peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

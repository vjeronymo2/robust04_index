			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Spanish companies hit by weakened peseta LEADING companies, which experienced a run of strong profits in recent years on the back of Spain's strong economy, are feeling the effects of lowered business levels and a weakened peseta. Telefonica, the state-owned telecommunications company, yesterday reported a third-quarter net income increase of just 2.2 per cent to Pta63.5bn (Dollars 632m) against the same period last year . This was in spite of raising operating profit by 13.7 per cent to Pta251.7bn. Telefonica said the 5 per cent devaluation of the peseta midway through September had caused it to increase its provisions against currency fluctuations by 38 per cent to Pta7.9bn. At the end of September Telefonica's non-peseta debt stood at Pta390bn. Repsol, the state-controlled energy group, could do little more than maintain nine-month net income at Pta55.1bn. It blamed a difficult global scenario and the expense of both cost reductions and past investments. Repsol's operating profit fell by 9.6 per cent to Pta88.4bn against the same period last year. Iberdrola, the privately owned domestic utility, posted a third-quarter pre-tax profit of Pta64.4bn, a 9 per cent increase on the same period last year. The company noted that energy consumption by industry had dropped by 4.7 per cent over the nine months. Both Iberdrola and Repsol, which pays dollars for its energy imports, are severely exposed to the decline in the value of the peseta. Sociedad General Aguas de Barcelona, is to step up its capital by Pta774.3bn through a rights issue of 1.54bn shares at a nominal value of Pta540, Reuter reports from Madrid. Shareholders can subscribe to the issue on a one for 25 basis.</p>

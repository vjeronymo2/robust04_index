			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- The largest opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) decided Friday [17 June] to  propose a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata as soon as the 1994 budget passes the Diet, party sources  said.    The 73.08 trillion yen budget was approved by the House of  Representatives on June 8 and is expected to clear the House of  Councillors during the current session ending June 29.    LDP President Yohei Kono wants to meet at an early stage  with  Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the opposition Social Democratic  Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social Democratic Party of Japan], and  Masayoshi Takemura, head of New Party Sakigake (harbinger), to  ask for cooperation on the planned no-confidence motion, they  said.    Hata is not deserving of confidence, the sources said,  because his minority government does not represent the will of  the people.    The LDP also criticizes the ruling coalition for having lost  credibility in international society as well by its reluctance  to uncover the facts about questionable financial deals by  former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the sources said.    If a no-confidence motion is approved by the Diet, Hata must  either have his cabinet resign en masse or dissolve the lower  house for a general election.    LDP secretary general Yoshiro Mori, speaking at the party's  headquarters Friday, said the budget is likely to be approved in  the latter half of next week and the political situation will be  "busy" thereafter.    Some powerful LDP figures, including former Foreign Minister  Michio Watanabe and former Transport Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka,  have insisted that "conservative" forces in the LDP should ally  with those in the coalition government rather than seek  cooperation with the SDP.    Former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu also reiterated at a  press conference in Asahikawa, Hokkaido, on Friday that the LDP  should not immediately propose a no-confidence motion.    However, the party made the decision to submit a  no-confidence motion because it became more convinced that the  SDP would cooperate, LDP sources said.    On Thursday, the LDP and the SDP cooperated to force a  motion  through the lower house budget panel summoning Hosokawa to  testify next Tuesday under oath about his questionable personal  finances, over which he was forced to resign in April.    Meanwhile, Yuichi Ichikawa, a major coalition government  strategist, said Friday he will urge the SDP next week to come  back into the ruling camp.    Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, a Buddhist-backed  party in the ruling coalition, told reporters in Makubetsu,  Hokkaido, that he wants to represent the ruling parties and meet  SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo as early as the middle of next  week to "exchange opinions frankly."    The SDP seceded from the coalition in April shortly after  other ruling parties formed a lower house parliamentary group,  "Kaishin," without consulting with the SDP.    Sakigake leader Takemura met some LDP members Friday and  expressed a positive view on alliance with the LDP, political  sources said. Takemura has also been eager to cooperate with  the SDP, they said.    A high-ranking SDP official said Friday Hata's cabinet must  resign en masse before the SDP will return to the ruling camp.    The official suggested the party may allow Hata to be prime  minister again once a new cabinet is formed after his  resignation.</p>

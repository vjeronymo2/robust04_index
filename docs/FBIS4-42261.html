			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Our View" column: "Search for Guardians"] </F>   [Text] The latest crisis that broke out in Greek-Albanian  relations as a result of the provocations of the Tirana  government brought to the foreground again the issue of the  general orientation of the current government's foreign policy.  Irrespective of the final outcome, the developments of the past  few days cause great concern for the delicate balance of powers  in the Balkans. This is especially true when one takes into  account that a number of factors tend toward instability, and  there are many things that exist or have been fabricated that  can in any time cause the situation to explode.    The U.S. State Department's positions regarding the Greek  arguments on the violation of the Greek minority's rights in  Albania seek to justify the Tirana government. The main result,  though, is that the State Department's positions belie the hopes  placed by the government of PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist  Movement] on the development of particularly "warm" relations  with the United States.    From the beginning of its term, this government has tried by  all means to win the favor of the United States in order to use  it in dealing with almost all foreign policy problems (Skopje  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM],  Greek-Turkish relations, the Cyprus issue, relations with  Albania). In order to gain this favor, the government has  pretty much "put itself" at the service of U.S. foreign policy  and its aims in the Balkans. The government justified this  choice as a necessary answer to the offending positions of  Greece's EU [European Union] partners.    As is known, in recent years the Albanian leadership has  capitalized on the U.S. intention to gain an advanced outpost in  the "hot" zone in the south of the former Yugoslavia by offering  "land and water." Consequently it won the title of a "U.S.  protectorate." As a result, when the crisis in Greek-Albanian  relations broke out as a result of the incident at Episkopi, the  Greek Government placed many hopes that it would be settled by  U.S. intervention with Albania. This obvious expectation was  also raised during Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's trip to  the United States, where, among other things, the government  offered to play the role of "Trojan horse" for U.S. economic  penetration of the Balkans. At that time, the current National  Economy Minister Ioannis Papandoniou characteristically said in  New York: "The Balkan people do not want the Americans very  much, because of their past as a superpower." The "clearing up"  of this "past," which has been transformed into a more agonizing  "present," was assumed by the government. But now what?    Ever since PASOK came to power, we said that the "carte  blanche" handing of all unsettled disputes to the United States  not only would not be in Greece's favor, but on the contrary  would worsen conditions. The history of this "subjection," for  which PASOK has successfully passed the test, teaches us that  giving in to the orders of imperialism is the worst service to  the national interests. There is a scope for exercising  national policy in the Balkans. The issue is that the  government does not appear willing to abandon the search for  "guardians."</p>

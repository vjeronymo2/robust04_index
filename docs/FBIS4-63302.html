			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Announcer Igor Vykhukholev] The State Duma of  Russia's Federal Assembly also intends to hear a report on the  situation in the Crimea during this evening's session.    [Correspondent Vlada Vishnevskaya] At the request of a  section of deputies, the Duma's Committees on International  Affairs, Security, and Defense will today report to the lower  house on the situation that has developed over the Crimea. A  substantial proportion of the Duma's session was taken up with a  debate on a draft resolution setting up parliament's own TV and  radio service. Diametrically opposed points of view were  expressed during the debate. Russia's Choice deputies pointed  out the similarity between the new TV and radio service and the  former Supreme Soviet's Parliamentary Hour. The Democratic  Party, the Communists, the Agrarians, and Liberal Democrats, on  the other hand, said that the Duma should refuse outright to  grant interviews to the Russian TV and Radio Company and deprive  it of Duma accreditation.    The LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] group walked  out en masse during the morning session. Explaining the reasons  for this decision, its leader, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, said:    [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording] For six months now the LDPR,  the party, its leader, the group and the deputies, the entire  State Duma, and the activities of the supreme legislative body  have been subjected to a stream of lies and slander. It is not  just a question of [words indistinct] Svanidze. We are not  bothered by [word indistinct] as a person. It is the position  of Russian television and the mass media. The LPDR group cannot  put up with this any longer. These are (?unacceptable) lies.  So, we will take a range of steps. [end recording]    [Vishnevskaya] The first of these measures was the boycott  of  the Duma session. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's move succeeded, it  has to be said. In the absence of a quorum the session was  broken off at midday.    [Vykhukholev] The meeting of the lower house resumed at  1600.  You will hear the details in our next newscast.</p>

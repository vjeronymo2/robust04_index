			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Technology threatens sows with baby boom THE NUMBER of piglets reared by a single sow every year will rise from an average of 21 to 30 by the year 2012, using only existing technology, an international conference on pig breeding was told this week. Much higher figures could be achieved through improvements in genetic engineering and reproductive technology, according to Mr Hein van der Steen, technical manager at the Oxfordshire based Pig Improvement Company. He suggested a figure of 44.6 piglets per sow. While such high numbers are still science fiction, 'few of us doubt that they could be achieved', said Mr van der Steen. He pointed out that the most efficient breeders were already getting 28 piglets per sow. The biggest strides were being made in the field of reproductive technology. Future developments could include the sexing of semen, enabling litters of only one sex to be produced; in vitro fertilisation; collection and maturation of eggs; and non-surgical embryo transfers, Mr van der Steen suggested. He was doubtful, however, that the public would accept some methods of increasing efficiency, pointing out that public pressure had already stopped the use of bovine growth hormone to boost milk production in the European Community. 'You have to ask: is 45 pigs a year on a sow acceptable from an animal welfare point of view?' he said. 'We have to find the right balance.' PIC, which is owned by Dalgety, staged the conference to celebrate the 30th anniversary of its foundation by a small group of Oxford farmers. It now boasts sales of Pounds 100m a year, with more than 25 per cent of the UK market for breeding gilts and a network of worldwide outlets. Last year more than 750,000 breeding animals were sold in 29 countries. Mr Richard Clothier, chief executive, said the world market still had plenty of potential. The US had been slow to develop improved pig breeding, but demand now far exceeded the ability of breeders to supply. China, another huge potential market, has not yet started to improve its pig farming. 'Over the next 10 years the demand for breeding stock will at the very least double - and probably treble,' he said.</p>

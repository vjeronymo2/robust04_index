			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Le Pen attacks 'treason' MR Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the far-right French National Front, yesterday stepped up his call for his countrymen to mobilise against the 'felons' in their government who had committed 'treason' by signing the Maastricht treaty on European union, writes David Buchan in Reims. In the heart of the champagne country he held his rally against the historic backdrop of Reims cathedral, site of the baptism of Clovis, King of the Franks, in the 5th century and of the coronation of subsequent French kings. The archbishop cancelled Sunday morning services to keep the Front out of the cathedral itself. Hammering home calls for 'judgment and punishment' in the September 20 referendum, Mr Le Pen suggested that he and others in the No camp would have handled President Francois Mitterrand far more toughly in last Thursday's TV debate than the lacklustre neo-Gaullist, Mr Philippe Seguin. The president's choice of Mr Seguin as sparring partner, Mr Le Pen told 2,000 supporters, was all part of the 'manipulation' of French public opinion by its political establishment. Judging by the Reims crowd, Mr Le Pen is not succeeding in using Maastricht to recruit many anti-EC rejectionists from other parties, which all have their own No candidates.</p>

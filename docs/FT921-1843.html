			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: The week of the wise old owl - The triumphs of John Smith, the shadow chancellor IT WAS the moment when Labour's 1992 campaign revved its engines at the start of the electoral runway and prepared for take off. Everyone in that crowded Westminster lecture hall on Monday knew that a single overlooked technical glitch in the shadow Budget could start the party off with a potentially fatal belly-flop. Yet, under the scrutiny of the sceptics, Mr John Smith's bird flew. Seldom can an election campaign have depended quite so heavily on a single event or the personality of a single individual. Yet with the economy, tax and spending at the very core of the election, the shadow chancellor has already proved an asset at least as crucial to Labour as Mr John Major is said to be for the Tories. This is not to say his Budget is flawless. Economists have criticised the wisdom of its tax bands, its impact on the rich and not-so-rich and a number of evasions in the fine print. But the very fact that yesterday, five days after it was unveiled, the Conservatives were promising to dedicate all their firepower - 'day after day, on and on and on' as one campaigner put it - to discrediting its prescriptions is a weighty tribute to its political acuity. Alongside his frontbench colleagues, Mr Smith is a howitzer among airguns. His stocky physique and owl-like features exude a confidence and power that lend much-needed gravitas and morale to the entire Labour team. He is comfortable with himself and appears wholly undaunted by the prospect of taking on a post that has defeated so many. Much has been written about the shadow chancellor's reassuring Scottish burr and bank-manager demeanour. But his public image is now a critical component in the campaign. No other member of Labour's shadow cabinet could have delivered a shadow Budget that added to, not detracted from, Labour's credibility. If Mr Neil Kinnock pledges that Labour will not devalue the pound, he is instantly doubted. If Mr Smith does so, he is at least given a serious hearing. When Mr Norman Lamont says Labour will put up taxes, interest rates and inflation, and Tory posters argue 'You can't trust Labour', a camera shot of Mr Smith's contemptuous disapproval is the Opposition's most effective reply. The FT-Mori poll of business attitudes this week showed that clear majorities believed a Labour government would raise interest rates, devalue the pound and put a brake on investment. Yet Mr Smith out-polled Mr Lamont by 46 points to 39 points as likely to make the better chancellor. That conundrum is hard to explain. One merchant banker suggested yesterday that while some dislike Mr Smith's vocal championing of such redistributionist policies as a national minimum wage, there is a conviction in the City that he is, as Mrs Thatcher said of Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, 'a man we can do business with'. There is less confidence, however, in the company he keeps. The MP for Monklands East has had plenty of time to hone his act. He has been deployed, not just on the City's prawn cocktail circuit of boardroom lunches, but in Europe, Japan and the US. This week his lawyer's at radio and television audiences. In his Panorama debate with Mr Lamont, he was widely credited with looking more convincing. On party election broadcasts and throughout the campaign, he will be systematically used to promote Labour's image as a government-in-waiting. If Mr Kinnock fails to cross the threshold of 10 Downing Street, there is no question that his shadow chancellor will run for and, barring unforeseen disaster, win the Labour leadership. Though an old-fashioned rightwinger, his genuine indignation at poverty and his lack of 'side' has won him strong support even on the hard left. As Mr Ken Livingstone said earlier this year in the ultimate tribute to Mr Smith's political skill: 'The thing about John is he has no real enemies.'</p>

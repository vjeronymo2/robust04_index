			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "New Inflation Levels in the First </F> Months of 1994"]    [Text] Tirana -- The tight monetary policy expressed in a  squeeze on credit and budget expenditure continues to bear fruit  in restraining inflation to relatively low and acceptable levels  under conditions of economic crisis. Data from the Statistics  Institute show that in January 1994, the Consumer Price Index  (CPI), which remains the main indicator of inflation in Albania,  rose 2.02 percent compared with December 1992. In February, the  CPI rose 1.70 percent compared with January. It seems that  higher prices for fuel and passenger transportation tickets in  particular led to a rise in the index. The high profit levels  enjoyed by traders on the market also continues to exert a  strong influence on inflation. Before reaching consumers, goods  pass through the hands of several traders, which increases their  price artificially. It was this phenomenon that obliged the  government a short time ago to reverse its policy of price  liberalization and impose a price ceiling on sugar.    Starting from January, the CPI will be calculated on a new  basis. "The year used as a basis for comparison will be 1994  instead of 1990," Statistics Institute specialists told GAZETA  SHQIPTARE.</p>

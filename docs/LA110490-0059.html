			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SEVERAL THEORIES ON WHY FAMOUS HORSES HURT THIS YEAR  </P> <P> The injuries began in February, when top Kentucky Derby candidate Grand Canyon  developed a knee problem that led to his retirement and later to his death.  </P> <P> Cryptoclearance and Derby favorite Red Ransom were hurt soon after, and  Champagneforashley two days before the Preakness. Next came Hawkster and  Eastern Echo, who was Red Ransom's stablemate. Sunday Silence and Easy Goer  never made it to the $1 million Arlington Challenge Cup, which had been billed  as the race of the year, because of injuries.  </P> <P> Classic Fame, Northern Wolf and Gorgeous also had their careers cut short by  injuries.  </P> <P> And then came the Breeders' Cup at Belmont Park on Saturday.  </P> <P> In the first race, Mr. Nickerson died of an apparent heart attack. Shaker Knit  fell over him, and was humanely destroyed that night.  </P> <P> Two races later, heavily favored Go for Wand was leading Bayakoa by no more  than a neck during the stretch of the Breeders' Cup Distaff when her right  foreleg snapped and she fell. The filly tried to stand -- to the horror of more  than 50,000 at the track and millions watching on national television.  </P> <P> It is unclear why so many famous racehorses have been hurt recently, but a  survey of prominent racing people this week produced these theories:  </P> <P>  -- Longer seasons and more races than before. Instead of the good horses being  taken out of training for the winter and brought back to the races leisurely  each spring, they continue to race until something goes wrong.  </P> <P>  -- Thoroughbreds are bred for speed and competition. The good races provide  the toughest tests. When the best race the best, as it was Saturday, they race  their hardest until something gives. Go for Wand raced until she fell. That's  the nature of the sport.  </P> <P>  -- With more racing coverage than ever, more attention is given to the careers  of the top horses. More horses are being bred. There are more than 50,000  thoroughbreds foaled each year. Thirty years ago, there were about 5,000.  </P> <P>  -- Hard tracks. Some people believe that some track superintendents are  inclined to speed up their tracks when important races are coming up. When the  speeded-up condition exists -- the tracks are harder because there is less  cushion -- the fragile legs of racehorses can give way.  </P> <P> Seth Hancock, who runs Claiborne Farm in Paris, Ky., agreed with several of the  theories.  </P> <P> "I believe there's more injuries this year," he said. "There's so many more  horses at so many more tracks. There used to be 5,000 horses born each year,  and there was very little winter racing. It used to be that horses rested in  South Carolina. They don't rest now.  </P> <P> "And there's the competition. Sunday Silence and Easy Goer raced four times  last year. Their trainers knew they had to be at their best to race, and they  were honed to the finest edge. Something has to give sometimes."  </P> <P> Alex Harthill, a nationally known veterinarian, said: "They run all year.  Around the racetrack, people say there's two kinds of racehorses. One has  problems, and the other will have problems."  </P> <P> Said trainer Shug McGaughey: "This (all the attention) is just because they are  name horses. No one pays any attention to a horse trained by a friend of mine  that got hurt in an earlier race that day and had to be operated on to be  saved.  </P> <P> "These are a matter of good horses taking bad steps and getting hurt."  </P> <P> Or does the horse of McGaughey's friend merely add to the puzzle?  </P> <P> Dr. Robert Vallance, a veterinarian who practices on the Maryland circuit, says  the extreme speed and the horses' natural desire to run fast cause the  problems.  </P> <P> "I'll never forget a trip I took to the Bahamas in the 1970s," he said. "I was  in Nassau at the Hobby Horse track. The horses were native-bred and weren't  thoroughbreds. But they didn't have any injuries. They were mostly all sound.  </P> <P> "But the point is, they weren't fast either. They went six furlongs in 1:20."  </P> <P> Fast thoroughbreds at good tracks in the United States race six furlongs in  about 1 minute, 10 seconds.  </P> <P> Trainer Hank Allen said he didn't think the rash of injuries at Belmont was  coincidental.  </P> <P> "Northern Wolf had never taken a bad step in his life until the day (at  Belmont) he worked so fast," Allen said. "The track was extremely fast. There  have been several other horses, not in the Breeders' Cup races, that were  injured up there. It seems to me that tracks in many places get faster the  closer the time comes for a big race. That's not to say the tracks  (managements) aren't trying to do their best.  </P> <P> "I just know I've had awfully bad luck."  </P> <P> Joe King, superintendent of the tracks run by the New York Racing Association,  of which Belmont Park is one, said: "There's no reason (for speeding up  tracks). Our goal is uniformity and consistency. Nothing was changed for  Breeders' Cup week."  </P> <P> King did point out that faster times usually are produced by the better horses,  "and they run on weekends."  </P> <P> An employee of the NYRA checks the depth of the cushion each racing day at  about 120 places on the tracks.  </P> <P> "There was no difference last week," King said.  </P> <P> Dr. David Zipf, chief veterinarian representing the Maryland Racing Commission,  said he has not seen an unusually large number of injuries in Maryland this  year.  </P> <P> "It's about the same or maybe a little less this year," he said. "Generally, we  have 20-25 horses injured in races each year that have to be put down. I  haven't counted them for 1990, but I think it's no more than 25. And that  includes a larger-than-usual number this summer at Timonium. No big number in  Maryland."  </P></p>

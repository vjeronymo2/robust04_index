			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Arts: Today's Television We are promised that the subject of BBC2's popular science series Antenna (8.00) is 'a new revolution in medicine' (to distinguish it from all the old revolutions that keep occurring): gene therapy. Professor Bob Williamson talks about the race to discover the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis. World In Action's cameras have been on the road with a convoy of 'travellers', the 'new age' gypsies who cause such hostility when they gather in large numbers at places such as Stonehenge and Castle Morton. They claim to be the free spirits of our age, but farmers and police treat them as drug-crazed scroungers (8.30 ITV). The perfidious French are the subject of Secret History (9.00 C4), which tells of the events on October 17 1961, at the height of the Algerian war, when 30,000 Algerians demonstrated in Paris and the police moved in: there were 11,000 arrests, 200 deaths, and the French government suppressed the facts for 30 years. Panorama (9.30 BBC2) considers the way in which many of the old communist hardliners have kept their hands on the reins of power in the former Soviet Union.</p>

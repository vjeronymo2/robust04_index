			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maria Elena Gil] </F>   [Text] Havana, 31 Mar (PL) -- As of next week, Cuba will  have a diplomatic mission in Barbados. From there and as part of  the process of integrating into its geographic surroundings,  Cuba will promote commercial, cultural, and athletic relations  with the entire eastern Caribbean.    Just before leaving for Bridgetown, Cuban Ambassador Lazaro  Cabezas told PRENSA LATINA that the Barbadian Government's  decision to authorize the opening of a Cuban Embassy in its  territory was further confirmation of the Caribbean countries'  willingness to integrate the largest of the Antillean islands  into the region where it rightfully belongs.    "Cuba and Barbados have had diplomatic relations since 8  December 1972, but based on our country's rapprochement with the  Anglo-Caribbean community (Caricom) [Caribbean Common Market],  we now have the opportunity to establish a Cuban mission in  Bridgetown, Cabezas said.    He reported that the main purpose of his activities in  Barbados and as concurrent ambassador to the eastern Caribbean  region will be to strengthen economic and commercial relations  with the region and promote cultural and athletic ties, for  which there is excellent raw material in the Caribbean and a  considerable amount of experience in Cuba, he added.    Cabezas explained that one of his goals is to implement a  sports and cultural cooperation agreement signed with Barbados  in 1983 but never put into affect.    The ambassador announced he will present his credentials to  the Grenadian Government on 5 April. Cuba reestablished  relations with that country in March 1992. Relations between the  two countries cooled as a result of the events surrounding the  overthrow and murder of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and the  subsequent 1983 U.S. military invasion.    Cabezas is accredited as concurrent ambassador to the  Governments of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Bahamas, St.  Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago.    The only Caricom members yet to normalize relations with  Cuba  are Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua, and Barbados. As of  this past December, Cuba has maintained a joint commission  before Caricom.    At the beginning of the current decade, the Cuban Foreign  Relations Ministry launched a diplomatic offensive in the  Caribbean that was crowned by the reestablishment of diplomatic  relations with nearly all Caricom pact members and Cuba's  admission into the organization's cooperation mechanisms.    The climax of the regional rapprochement was Cuban Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina's official seven-nation tour this past  November. On that occasion, Robaina stated that the region has  become one of Cuba's foreign policy priorities.    Cabezas said that at the end of April, Cuba will participate  in the First Global Conference on Sustainable Development by  Small Insular States, which is sponsored by the United Nations  and is scheduled to take place in Barbados.    He added that Cuba expects to participate in the event with  the best proposals prepared by the country's social, scientific,  and ecological nongovernmental organizations. In addition, Cuba  expects to share its achievements in areas of common interests  with its sister nations.</p>

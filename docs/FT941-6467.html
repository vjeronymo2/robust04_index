			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Moscow taps new source of funds A decision by Moscow's mayor to introduce a new tax on the country's only and fledgling currency market, in an effort to save the Russian capital's treasury from ruin, has provoked angry protests from more than 100 Russian banks. The banks, shareholders and members of the Moscow inter-bank currency exchange, said the 0.1 per cent tax on the volume of all deals would push business away from Moscow to provincial currency markets. The move would also be self-defeating, reducing overall tax revenues from the exchange, and be a new burden on exporters, the banks said. About Dollars 12.6bn, or a third of Russia's export earnings, were sold on the exchange last year. The exchange, the country's first and the main venue for central bank interventions to support the rouble, accounts for 80 per cent of foreign exchange dealing in Russia. However, Mayor Yuri Luzhkoz, was insisting yesterday that the city would soon have no cash even for rubbish removal unless the government honoured debts of tens of millions of dollars. He told a municipality meeting that the government owed Rbs250bn to city authorities but that the acting finance minister, Mr Sergei Dubinin, was refusing to pay. 'The government has paid nothing to Moscow to help it function as the capital of Russia. It hasn't given a single kopeck for the construction of new metro lines. We might as well move the capital to somewhere else.' Russia is in a chronic non-payments crisis as the government, state enterprises, companies and individuals all owe each other money but no one pays. Amid this crisis, the finance ministry is trying to delay some payments as it puts together a 1994 budget which is already stretched to cover trillions of roubles promised by the government to ailing industries. 'The Russian leadership is like a gypsy who hasn't been feeding his horse for a long time,' said Mr Luzhkov. 'It then decides the horse shouldn't be fed at all. Finally the horse dies.' Russia's gas company Gazprom said yesterday it would halt supplies to Ukraine this week because payments had not been made. It also accused Kiev of stealing gas from export pipelines crossing its territory, Reuter reports from Moscow. 'We intend to cut off gas supplies from March 3 if Ukraine does not take any steps,' said Gazprom's chief engineer, Mr Vladimir Podmarkov. Ukraine, which is suffering acute fuel shortages, depends on Russia for most of its oil and gas, but has been unable to pay for supplies. In Kiev, a Ukrainian gas industry official doubted that Gazprom would carry out its cut-off threat, which could lead to further tapping into export pipelines by fuel-starved Ukrainian enterprises. 'Russia won't dare cut supplies completely,' said Mr Bohdan Babiy, chief engineer at the transport division of the Ukrhazprom company. Previous experience shows that our enterprises would just take the gas (meant) for export (to western Europe) from the pipeline.' Russia exported about 100bn cubic metres of gas outside the former Soviet Union last year, mostly to Germany, Italy and France. More than 90 per cent of these exports passed though Ukraine.</p>

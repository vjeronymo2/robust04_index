			<p>BFN     [Text] Sevastopol [no date as received] -- Ukrainian and  Russian expert working groups, led by Ukrainian Deputy Prime  Minister Valeriy Shmarov and Feliks Gromov, the Russian navy  commander in chief, met here on 3 June. At the meeting, the  work of the experts on a final resolution of the Black Sea Fleet  problem, which is to be achieved at a meeting in Kiev on 8-9  June, is being discussed. The Ukrainian delegation, including  heads of the Ministries of Internal Affairs, Defense, and  Foreign Affairs, the state property fund, and the Ministry of  Economy, also plans to discuss Sevastopol's social and economic  problems with the local authorities.    At the start of the meeting, Valeriy Shmarov stressed that  the Ukrainian side stands firm on the question of political and  military cooperation between the fleets in the Black Sea region  and in the South as a whole. He emphasized that the division  formula "must respect Ukrainian legislation, otherwise it would  be unacceptable to the people and parliament of Ukraine." The  Ukrainian side expressed the hope that the division not only of  ships but of the coastal infrastructure and the Black Sea Fleet  aircraft would be discussed. Feliks Gromov said that issues  concerning the infrastructure and the deployment of aircraft  cannot be resolved without political decisions at the top level.    Further discussion revealed that the Russian side has not  yet  provided an official list of its ships and that the ships are  being divided, according to Ukrainian Navy Commander Volodymyr  Bezkorovaynyy, "at random."    While in Crimea, Valeriy Shmarov plans to visit Sevastopol  docks and Donuzlav. Shmarov noted that the division of property  is probably one of the key issues at the talks. He believes  that the situation in the Black Sea Fleet "should not be  described as a separation, since in the long run we are creating  two friendly forces."</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Financial strength is the issue not competition - Bernard Gray hears Lord Weinstock's VSEL views Lord Weinstock's view of the right future for VSEL, and the British defence industry, could not be more different than John Weston's, the man who runs BAe's defence business. GEC's managing director believes that the arguments about competition in shipbuilding are nonsense, and that the talk of wholesale cross-border rationalisation of the European defence industry is naive. Lord Weinstock argues that when the Office of Fair Trading looks at each order, they will see that each could only be built by one specialist yard. 'The order for the second batch of Trafalgar submarines would always have been built at Barrow (VSEL's yard in Cumbria), so there can be no real competition for that contract. 'The other order around is for the last batch of Type 23 frigates for the Royal Navy. Yarrow (GEC's yard on the Clyde) has built nine of the 13 of that class and the prices for these ships are well known, so the Ministry of Defence need have no concerns on that score.' In the future, ships are likely to be built on a collaborative basis. 'Beyond that is the next generation Horizon frigate, which will not be built until the turn of the century and is an Anglo-French-Italian venture anyway, much as you have in BAe's monopoly aircraft business.' If anything, Lord Weinstock contends that the risk is that Barrow run by another company would be tempted to put Yarrow out of business. 'If Barrow had won a large submarine contract to keep it profitable, it might be tempted to buy other contracts and starve its competitors of work. The history of shipbuilding is littered with similar incidents.' At a philosophical level, Lord Weinstock also questions whether effective competition can exist when two potential manufacturers of equipment vie to supply one buyer. 'If, for example, you have four contracts to parcel out between two bidders A and B, the maximum split you could make is three to A and one to B, regardless of whether B was cheapest bid because otherwise B would be out of work and you would have no future competition. 'There is no real competition under those circumstances and bidders know that.' On the broader question of how the defence industry should consolidate, he thinks that companies in Europe should respond to the rapid rationalisation in the US, and that countries will, and should, want to maintain strong self-sufficient defence industries. 'We have to respond to the changes in America. They are producing giant companies through these mergers. Compared to them BAe and GEC's defence operations are minnows. We have to form companies of sufficient size to compete effectively with them or even to have an effective voice in collaborating with them.' In the art of the possible, Lord Weinstock does not believe in the option of rationalisation across Europe with large-scale cross border mergers being impractical. 'There will be some smaller deals, such as the joint venture which we have formed with Thomson (of France) in sonar, but the larger deals are fraught with difficulty.' What is possible, and desirable, in his view is for Britain to rationalise its defence business. Lord Weinstock has made no secret of his desire to merge BAe's defence business with his defence arm GEC-Marconi. 'We have made several attempts to get together with BAe. When GEC bought Yarrow (in 1985) we suggested to BAe that we form a joint naval systems business and we did so again in the last few weeks.' He has also had more recent talks, including well-publicised merger talks last year, and less well-known discussions about a joint bid for VSEL at the beginning of the year. Both came to nothing, but it appears Lord Weinstock's conviction that a merger should happen has grown. He agrees with BAe's management on at least one point. 'Prime contracting (the ability to manage complex programmes with many sub-contractors) is growing into the most important element of defence manufacturing. 'I think that it is vital for the UK to foster a strong capability in defence prime contracting, otherwise we will not be able to build these complex systems in future. GEC has a very good record in prime contracting, and we want to buy VSEL because we wish to do more of it.' It is in how this prime contracting should be done that he parts company with BAe. 'For the concept of a prime contractor who accepts the risk of managing a project to make sense, then the prime contractor has to be able to bear the cost of a project going wrong. 'Who would you rather take on as a prime contractor, a company with nearly Pounds 3bn in the bank and can pay for its own mistakes, or one which owes the bank Pounds 200m? I know who I would choose.' Lord Weinstock's inference is clear. GEC's strong cash position gives it an enormous asset to bring to the table. BAe's relatively weak financial position undermines its credibility. Bring BAe's longer prime contracting experience together with GEC's financial backing and you have a strong company able to take on the competition. Short of that the best solution is to increase the amount of prime contracting done by GEC. In Lord Weinstock's view, only be good for the British defence industry. In the longer term he still clearly hankers after the ultimate rationalisation linking GEC and BAe to produce one UK super-prime contractor. 'Prime contracting is an important skill. But it is about more than collecting all of your suppliers bills and adding a fat margin to them.'</p>

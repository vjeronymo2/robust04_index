Umanets, chairman, Ukraine State Committee </F> for the Study of the Nuclear Power Industry]    [Abstract] In 1992, Ukraine had 14 operating nuclear power  plant units with a total installed capacity of 12,818 kW. During  1992, Ukraine's nuclear power plants produced 73,750.6 million  kW of electricity, which constituted 29.4 percent of all  electric power produced in Ukraine. Because Ukraine's atomic  scientists have been able to maintain the necessary ties with  Russia since the collapse of the USSR, it is certain that  Ukraine's nuclear power industry will be able to develop and  become a serious structural component of the country's power  grid. It has become entirely clear that the apparent rejection  of nuclear power in the West after the Chernobyl accident was  either a myth or else the invention of technical and economic  policy. It has become quite evident that even those countries  possessing the overwhelming majority of natural fossil fuel  reserves will not be able to survive without a closed nuclear  fuel cycle, and construction of new nuclear power plants has  continued throughout the world. Today, the absolute majority of  specialists believe that the only way for Ukraine to create an  independent nuclear power industry is on the basis of its two  domestic energy carriers, i.e., coal and uranium. The following  are among the results of policies instituted after the Chernobyl  accident: Ukraine is now short a minimum of 12 nuclear power  plant units with a capacity of 1 million kW each; attempts to  maintain an acceptable level of operation of the country's  existing power plant units are being foiled by one obstacle  after another, including an inability to pay suppliers and flow  of highly trained personnel to Russia because their wages in  Ukraine are 3 to 5 times less than those offered in Russia;  construction of six VVER-1000 units with a safety level higher  than the existing 10 units of the same type remains unfinished;  and opportunities to export electricity are being lost along  with future markets and dollars that could be used to buy  imported equipment or advance scientific-technical progress. The  time has come to develop a new nuclear power policy that will  guarantee safety. Its main components should be as follows:  develop the nuclear power industry based on modern nuclear power  plant units meeting modern safety requirements; create a  domestic nuclear fuel cycle based on the use of existing uranium  deposits; create a national system of scientific-technical  maintenance of work in all points of the nuclear fuel cycle from  uranium recovery to radwaste burial; increase and strengthen the  prestige of workers in the nuclear power industry on both morale  and monetary planes; and create a legislative base as quickly as  possible. The moratorium on construction of new nuclear power  plants on Ukraine territory that was approved on 2 August 1990  has been particularly damaging to Ukraine's nuclear power  industry. Of the six nuclear power plant units left unfinished  as a result of the moratorium, three can be put on line in 1-1.5  years and three in 5-6 years. These units already meet  International Atomic Energy Agency safety standards for existing  nuclear power plants and are on a par with the best nuclear  power plants now operating abroad. Furthermore, before the six  plants are actually put into operation, measures will be take to  further improve their operating safety and reliability.</p>

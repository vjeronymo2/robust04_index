			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Abiola cancels plans for return to Nigeria CHIEF Moshood Abiola, the winner of Nigeria's annulled presidential elections who fled the country three weeks ago in fear for his life, has cancelled plans to return to Lagos today in an attempt to claim the presidency. 'I have been advised by my supporters to stay away,' Chief Abiola said in London last night. 'My return at this time would only compound problems. When the bad wind is blowing the only sensible thing to do is to bow one's head and let it pass.' With General Ibrahim Babangida, Nigeria's military ruler, due to relinquish power on August 27, Chief Abiola's decision to stay in London may deliver a fatal blow to his ambitions of becoming the country's next leader. Gen Babangida, who annulled the June 12 presidential poll, is expected to go ahead with plans to install an interim civilian administration, whose composition and leadership are not yet known. Given Gen Babangida's reluctance to name his successor, August 27 is becoming increasingly irrelevant. Many Nigerians also believe the interim civilian government will merely be a front for military rule. Only last week Chief Abiola was planning a triumphant return on August 24, his 56th birthday. The wealthy businessman said his change of heart did not make him an exile. 'I will be returning to Nigeria very soon, and by the grace of God I will be heading my government on August 27, which will be recognised as Nigeria's legitimate government.' However, four days from the scheduled transition to democracy, the only certainty is that Nigeria's next government will not be democratic. Chief Abiola is taking refuge in Europe and the civilian politicians in Nigeria are too compromised or fragmented to mount nationwide opposition. The choice of the proposed interim government lies with the armed forces, and they have yet to close the deal. Gen Babangida's speech to the national assembly last week shows that a faction of the military regime is not ready to give up power. But there is dissent within the armed forces, some of whom want to limit the damage which the instability of recent months has done to their reputation. The sense that Nigeria has no government has affected both the economy and society. The only commodity in demand is hard currency. The battered naira is now trading at N39 to the dollar on the black market. It has lost 20 per cent of its value since the June 12 election. Consumption has fallen sharply and industrial output has slowed to a crawl. The labour movement and pro-democracy groups have called their members out on strike if the military does not relinquish power on August 27. Minority ethnic groups, anticipating trouble, are leaving the cities for their homelands.</p>

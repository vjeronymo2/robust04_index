			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / People: Caradon seeks finance director in wake of Pillar acquisition Caradon, the building materials group, has moved quickly to reorganise its management structure following its acquisition of the Pillar group of businesses from RTZ. The purchase, for Pounds 800m, was announced in August and completed late last month. As a result of the changes, the group is looking for a new finance director who will become the fifth executive director on the board. Peter Jansen, chief executive, said the group had already started the search. Caradon had found good operational management in the Pillar businesses, he says. However, most of Pillar's head office people will stay with RTZ. Jansen said under the new structure the group's larger businesses would report directly to one of three main board directors to keep communication lines short, while smaller companies will be clustered. The three areas will each have an executive committee chaired by the director in charge. Daniel Cohen, currently finance director and managing director of bathrooms and some building products, will be in charge of all the group's European building products businesses. He will give up the finance function when a new person is appointed. Peter Hewett will pass his responsibility for heating products and double glazing to Cohen, but take charge of all the engineering, automotive and distribution activities. Tim Walker, who currently runs the group's US security printing business, will be responsible for all the group's north American activities.</p>

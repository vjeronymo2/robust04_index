			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [`ke'-signed report: "Help for Eastern German Space </F> Enterprises"]    [Text] Berlin, 29 May -- In 1993, the German Space Agency  supplied 52.7 billion German marks [DM] to support space  travel-related activities in eastern Germany. This year, the  Agency has over DM53 billion at its disposal for this purpose,  said General Director Jan-Baldem Mennicken at the International  Air and Space Exhibition in Berlin. The task of the Agency,  which cooperates closely with the German Air and Space Travel  Research Institute, is to preserve and coordinate space  travel-related activity in the former GDR. Apart from  Jena-Optronic GmbH, which used to be a part of the Zeiss Jena  complex and now belongs to German Aerospace, the Agency also  supports an entire range of medium and small east German  enterprises that are engaged primarily in the manfacture of  smaller satellites, measuring equipment, and geophysical  research. One of these enterprises is FMP Space Sensor GmbH in  Freiberg, Saxony, which produces small satellites. The  Neubrandenburg firm GTA, which is engaged in measurement and  geophysics, was founded by scientists from the former GDR Space  Research Institute in 1991. With the German Space Agency's  help, these enterprises should also be permitted access to large  European space projects.</p>

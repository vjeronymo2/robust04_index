			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SOURCES: ROSE TO BE SUSPENDED, NOT BANNED;  </P> <P> RED MANAGER, BASEBALL COMMISSIONER REACH A COMPROMISE IN GAMBLING CASE  </P> <P> Pete Rose and Commissioner Bart Giamatti reached a compromise Wednesday calling  for the Cincinnati manager to be suspended -- but not banned for life -- for  having bet on baseball, sources said.  </P> <P> Giamatti announced Wednesday night that he would hold a news conference in New  York today.  </P> <P> However, the commissioner did not say officially what the news conference would  be about.  </P> <P> Sources familiar with the situation said the news conference will involve  Rose's suspension. However, the sources were not sure of the length of the  suspension.  </P> <P> United Press International reported the length would be five years.  </P> <P> Several baseball sources said Giamatti pushed for a settlement because he was  afraid the case would continue to linger in court, preventing him from  disciplining Rose.  </P> <P> The sources said Rose needed to settle because he believed that Giamatti  ultimately would suspend him once Rose's legal appeals were exhausted.  </P> <P> Rose's need for a settlement increased once baseball successfully moved the  case into federal court.  </P> <P> Rose, under investigation since Feb. 20, obtained a temporary restraining order  from an Ohio state court on June 25.  </P> <P> That order has prevented Giamatti from holding a hearing on the gambling  allegations.  </P> <P> Rose was accused by bookmakers and other acquaintances of betting on baseball,  including games involving the Reds.  </P> <P> Investigators for baseball compiled a 225-page report that concluded Rose bet  on the Reds from 1985-87 and cited evidence that included betting slips alleged  to be in Rose's handwriting, and telephone and bank records.  </P> <P> A hearing on Rose's request for a preliminary injunction is scheduled to begin  on Monday in federal court in Columbus, Ohio.  </P> <P> Reds owner Marge Schott, contacted at her home Wednesday night, said she had  received no word from the commissioner's office about the news conference.  </P> <P> "I know nothing about what's cooking," she said. "I'm going to wait for  tomorrow and see what happens."  </P></p>

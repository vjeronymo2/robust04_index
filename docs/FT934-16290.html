			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Ford accused of distorting market FORD came under heavy attack yesterday from the leading UK car dealer association for 'forcing registrations' and 'distorting' the true state of the market. It came as figures were released showing that UK new car sales jumped by 11.7 per cent in September. In one of the most outspoken attacks ever launched by retail dealers against the car manufacturers, Mr Alan Pulham, director of the national franchised dealers association claimed that 'the continuing practice by Ford of forcing registrations distorts the true market situation and has an adverse effect on prices and residual values'. The association represents UK dealers selling around 80 per cent of all new cars and includes most Ford dealers. The retail motor industry has become increasingly concerned that the strong rise in new car registrations could mislead the Government 'into thinking that the car sales revival is more substantial than it in fact is'. Mr Pullen added: 'The Autumn Budget must not increase taxes - such a move would severely damage our fragile revival.' The increase in new car sales in September followed the 17.8 per cent jump year-on-year of registrations in August, the key new car sales month, which now accounts for close to a quarter of annual UK new car sales. According to figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, new car registrations in September rose to 136,100 from 121,823 in the same month a year ago. New car registrations in the first nine months of the year rose by 11.8 per cent to 1,450,717 from 1,297,423 in the corresponding period in 1992. Ford, the UK market leader, reacted angrily to the attack from the retail dealers. 'We flatly deny that Ford has taken any action to distort the market,' it said. 'The surge in registrations at the end of September is nothing unusual. The late strengthening of the market at the end of the month is a common feature in the UK market.' Ford said that 27.3 per cent of new car registrations occurred at the end of September. It claimed that some 38.3 per cent of its registrations took place in the last five days of September, compared with 17.1 per cent for Vauxhall, 28.7 per cent for Rover, 39.5 per cent for Peugeot, 35.7 per cent for Nissan, 38 per cent for Renault, 40.3 per cent for Fiat, 42.6 per cent for Citroen and 49.5 per cent for Toyota. Nearly all the major manufacturers had dealer and customer incentive programmes during the third quarter, said Ford, and many of these finished at the end of September. The US car maker offered dealers bonuses of Pounds 100-Pounds 150 per car for every Escort and Fiesta registered before the end of September. The franchised dealers association, which is part of the Retail Motor Industry Federation, claimed that the pre-registering of cars by dealers or carmakers before the vehicles had actually been sold was 'a major problem forcing unreality into the market'. Despite Ford's denials Mr Pulham alleged yesterday that 'Ford, and its dealers under Ford direction, are pre-registering cars rather than selling and registering at the same time. Theoretically the two events should be linked. Unfortunately success is judged by market share. 'If you wish to promote your market share you increase your registrations but not necessarily your sales on the same day. 'Somebody, either Ford or a dealer, will register a car in September, which will then be sold in October or later. It will sit in stock with a tax disc and an L-registration plate, and a customer will be encouraged to buy it as a nearly-new car.' Mr Pulham said that 'every manufacturer of any stature plays this game to some extent and has done for many years. What we have here is an exceptionally high level of forced sales'. Mr Pulham claimed that 'this forcing of the market creates the nearly new car, which then deflects the buyer from the new car market to the nearly-new. The recovery could easily peter out'. Mr Roger King, director of public affairs for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said: 'The motor industry is building from a very low base and, coupled with declining export business to EC countries, true recovery still seems a long way off.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              UK CAR REGISTRATIONS -

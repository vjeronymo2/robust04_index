			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DEATHS UP 19% ON HIGHWAYS WHERE SPEED LIMIT WAS RAISED TO 65  </P> <P> Fatalities increased by 19% on rural highways on which the speed limit was  raised to 65 m.p.h., an increase nearly three times as high as in states that  kept the limit at 55, a government study has found.  </P> <P> The study, released Friday by the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration, is the first of three annual reports since Congress voted in  April, 1987, to allow states to raise the speed limit to 65 m.p.h. on highways  passing through rural areas.  </P> <P> The study involved 38 states that raised the speed limit in 1987 and 10 states  that did not. The report noted that all rural interstate fatalities increased  in 1987 over 1986.  </P> <P> The number of fatalities in the states that stayed with 55 m.p.h. increased by  7%, a significantly lower increase than in those states that raised the speed  limit.  </P> <P> Traffic safety officials cautioned that the higher speed limit has not been in  effect long enough to measure its long-term impact on highway safety.  </P></p>

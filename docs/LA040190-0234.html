			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AN ELOQUENT 'LEGACY'  </P> <P> I commend KCAL for the broadcast of "Legacy of a Movement." It was a joy to see  he youth of our black leaders together and sharing their views about the black  community. There should be more shows just like these on TV.  </P> <P> A.

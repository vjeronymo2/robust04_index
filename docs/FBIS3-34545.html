He added: Solely because of its grudge against and hatred  for  Islam, world arrogance does not show any serious reaction to the  massacre of Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina while, under the  pretext of defending human rights, it describes as inhuman our  stance on Salman Rushdie's blasphemous act and his insult to the  sanctities of the world Muslims. That double standard of theirs  on the world Muslims stems from nothing but arrogance's hatred  for Islam and Muslims.    He added: We Muslims and Islamic countries should learn a  lesson from the actions of the enemies of Islam and preserve our  unity. For we have no alternative but to stand up to the enemies  of Islam and Muslims.    The Majles speaker stressed the need to improve  parliamentary  relations between the two countries.    At the meeting the Moroccan ambassador in Iran expressed the  hope that relations between the two countries will further  expand in the future. He called for the establishment of  parliamentary relations between the two countries and the  exchange of parliamentary delegations. On behalf of his  government he invited the Majles speaker to visit Morocco.</p>

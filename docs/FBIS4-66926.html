			<p>BFN     [Text] On Tuesday [10 May], Arthur Paecht, the rapporteur  of the military programming law, declared that, "according to a  unanimous recommendation of all experts consulted, the  resumption of nuclear tests is indispensable." As to the Palen  test simulation program, it "would not suffice to ensure the  development of new nuclear charges." The deputy also pointed to  two other "controversial" issues: "The decision by the  president of the Republic to keep active the ballistic missiles  on the Albion plateau" and "the five-year delay in the M5  strategic ballistic missile program."</p>

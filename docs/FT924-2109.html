			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Coal gets boost from Eastern Electricity EASTERN Electricity gave coal a boost yesterday by becoming the first regional electricity distributor to sign up a new deal for coal-based power. But other companies seemed hesitant to follow suit. Eastern, the largest of the regional distributors in England and Wales, signed a five-year agreement with PowerGen, one of the two leading generators, to take 21 terawatt (billion kilowatt) hours of electricity. The deal, worth more than Pounds 100m a year, equates to 8m tonnes of coal. The contract takes effect from March 31 when all British Coal's current coal contracts are due to expire. The energy review by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, has thrown negotiations into uncertainty. Dr James Smith, Eastern's chairman and chief executive, said the deal was flexible enough to cope with changes in energy or regulatory policy. He added: 'We also believe that it does not prejudice the outcome of the current energy review but in fact helps break the deadlock in electricity contracts and is a positive move towards securing the future of coal.' Dr Smith preferred the certainty of a five-year deal to the one-year deals which both Mr Heseltine and Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, have indicated might be more appropriate until the review is complete. The deal would meet about 17 per cent of Eastern's needs over the period. Dr Smith hoped to sign a similar deal with National Power, the other large generator, by Christmas. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, said he expected to complete deals with other regional elewctricity companies. Although he doubted whether they would be done by Christmas. Neither company was prepared to discuss the deal in detail, but it is understood to be based on the price of 3.26p a unit, which has been on offer since the coal negotiations started several months ago. The deal excludes Eastern from paying 'uplift' - the variable charge added to bulk electricity to finance the running of the electricity system. Mr Neil Clarke, chairman of British Coal, said the deal would bring much-needed stability to the coal market. He hoped other regional companies would sign five-year deals to give British Coal the breathing space it needed to make its operations more efficient. Other regional companies gave a mixed response. One said it would sign nothing until the review was completed, although another indicated that it might be ready to sign by mid January. Mr Jim Keohane, power purchasing manager of East Midlands, said his company was keen to see a five-year deal, although none was imminent. It was working with other regional companies and was in active discussions with the generators.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Minister gives reasons for City regulation move MR ANTHONY NELSON, economic secretary to the Treasury, has explained publicly for the first time the government's reasons for a planned upheaval in the regulation of financial markets. He also restated the government's intention to oppose proposed EC legislation that might threaten the UK's securities industry. Mr Nelson said responsibility for regulation of financial markets and non-bank financial services would not be shifted from the Department of Trade and Industry to the Treasury for a 'month or so'. It is understood that legal difficulties have delayed the move, which was announced in the Conservative manifesto. Mr Nelson said the switch reflected developments in financial markets. 'The barriers between the different industries are crumbling,' he said, and it made sense to bring together regulation of both the bank and non-bank sector. It would give more weight to the UK financial sector's views internationally. Mr Nelson said: 'If UK interests are to be represented and expressed as effectively as possible, they should be concentrated in one department and one set of ministers.' The dividing line on big fraud cases between City regulators and criminal investigators should be reconsidered, Mr Christopher Sharples, chairman of the Securities and Futures Authority, said. 'There may well be advantages in allowing City regulation, with its ability to act quickly and get results on a much less legalistic basis, to deal with some of the alleged offences at the outset.' He added that that might apply particularly 'when they are of a nature more akin to breaches of City codes or ethics or market misconduct, rather than fraud or theft in the traditional sense.'</p>

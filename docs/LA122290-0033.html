			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NOVEMBER DEFICIT HITS $48 BILLION, 62% OVER YEAR AGO  </P> <P> The federal government ran up a $48.1-billion deficit in November, a 62%  increase over a year ago, due in part to the Persian Gulf buildup and a failing  economy, the Treasury Department reported Friday.  </P> <P> Combined with the October deficit, the imbalance for the first two months of  fiscal 1991 totaled $79.5 billion, up 42.5% from the comparable period of  fiscal 1990.  </P> <P> Economist Michael K. Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said the  weakening economy is resulting in declining tax revenues.  </P> <P> "It's really getting to the point where the deficit is starting to balloon  because both personal and corporate taxes are starting to fall off," he said.  "Receipts in November were $6 billion less than they should have been in a  normal economy."  </P> <P> The government collected $27.2 billion in individual income taxes last month, a  21% decline from November, 1989. Corporate income taxes were down 46%, to $1.3  billion.  </P> <P> At the same time, defense spending increased 18% from a year ago, to $29  billion.  </P></p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Open justice Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, warned judges yesterday that they would have to cut the length of custodial sentences or the new provisions of the Criminal Justice Act would result in a 'bulge in the prison population', Robert Rice writes. At the second of what, in the interests of more user-friendly justice, he hopes will become regular press conferences, Lord Taylor said he would be issuing a practice direction to judges on Thursday when the act comes into force. Under the act, judges will have to take account of the actual time likely to be served when passing sentence. Lord Taylor said: 'There is a very real risk that if judges continue to sentence on the scale of the past, some prisoners may serve longer than they would have done under the old regime.' Under the old regime, a person sentenced to three years would be eligible for parole after serving a year. At most with remission they would serve only two years. Under the new act they must serve at least half their sentence before release on licence. Lord Taylor said: 'If we are not careful we will have a bulge in the prison population.' Effectively, judges would have to pass shorter sentences, although another object of the act was to ensure that violent and sex offenders served longer. Lord Taylor dismissed the idea of an independent inspectorate of judges, which has been proposed by Lord Williams QC, chairman of the Bar. That was not because judges should be beyond criticism but because such a system might threaten the independence of the judiciary.</p>

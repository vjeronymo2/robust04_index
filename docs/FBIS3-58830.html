			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "ban": "Bonn Concerned About Refugees"] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 21 January -- In spite of opposition from  other European states, the Federal Government is demanding a  common European Union (EU) regulation on accepting refugees from  the former Yugoslavia. On Friday [21 January], during the first  reading of the ratification act on the "Dublin Agreement,"  Lintner, the state secretary in the Interior Ministry, said a  "fair distribution" of refugees from the civil war zones must be  safeguarded throughout the European Union and other European  states. "So far, we have met with strong opposition from  several West European states." Lintner pointed out that Germany  has accepted some 370,000 refugees from the former Yugoslavia.  This is approximately two-thirds of all the refugees who fled to  the European Union from the civil war zones.    In the summer of 1990, the European Community members had  concluded an agreement on asylum proceedings. Under this  agreement, asylum seekers entering the European Union have the  right to only one such proceeding. The responsibility lies with  the country that has allowed the foreign national to enter, or  that was the first one he entered. The agreement shall prevent  foreign nationals from applying for asylum in more than one EU  member countries, either concurrently or consecutively. Lintner  said the agreement is an important step toward harmonizing the  community's asylum laws. The Dublin Agreement is to be seen in  connection with the abolition of border controls agreed on by  the community. He said the reason given for the change of the  asylum law that was passed by the Bundestag last year was the  European agreements. Lintner said that beside the Dublin  Agreement, the government is aiming at a standardization of  asylum policies and procedures throughout the European Union. A  short debate showed that the Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union agrees with the Social Democratic  Party and the Free Democratic Party on this matter. The Party  of Democratic Socialism and Alliance 90/Greens opposed the idea.  Deputy Weiss of Alliance 90/Greens warned against "isolation  measures," which would create the preconditions for criminal  organizations trafficking in asylum seekers.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: STRESS AND THE MAHARISHI  </P> <P> It's a stressful world, and everyone needs a way to keep his head from  exploding. I saw a head explode once and it isn't a pretty sight. Walls were  spattered with shards of suppressed rage, sinewy strips of free-floating  anxiety and small, hairy chunks of an inability to cope. It took weeks to clean  up.  </P> <P> Some method of reducing tension is obviously necessary if we are to survive in  today's tense urban environment. There are hundreds of techniques, from  squeezing rubber balls to screaming in the cemetery where your mother is  buried.  </P> <P> Someone in our neighborhood, for instance, beats tom-toms occasionally to, one  presumes, put him or her (or them) into a state of restful meditation.  </P> <P> Others down the block gather to chant in an effort to attain nirvana. The chant  assumes a humming quality and on certain quiet nights sounds like a horde of  wasps descending on Sweet Jesus Mountain.  </P> <P> But if it helps ease stress, I say go for it. A Hum and Tom-Tom Band might even  be in order.  </P> <P> There are dangers to stress-reduction, of course. A friend tried yoga once to  quiet his Furies and became entangled in a position from which he was unable to  free himself. His wife was out of town and he was near starvation by the time  someone found and untangled him.  </P> <P> My point, if indeed I have one, is that there's no safe, sure-fire way of  reducing stress and finding perfect peace. Unless, of course, you live in a  City of Immortals.  </P> <P> It's this way. There's a company called the Maharishi Heaven on Earth  Development Corp. that is promoting the creation of 50 stress-free communities  based on the teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the guru of transcendental  meditation.  </P> <P> Company headquarters are in Malibu, but you probably already suspected that.  </P> <P> The idea is to build tracts in accordance with natural laws, to the extent that  houses will be placed on sites that utilize cosmic energy and are at peace with  those spiritual cross-currents that enhance the beneficial purpose of each  room.  </P> <P> You'll walk into a dining room of such a home, for instance, and enjoy a  healthy appetite. In the den, your most complex thoughts will snap into focus.  In the bedroom, you'll feel either sleepy or sexually stimulated. I personally  feel stimulated in the kitchen, but our house wasn't built under the  Maharishi's Vedic guidance.  </P> <P> Parks, vegetable gardens, nontoxic building materials and a kind of holistic  conditioning are expected to create a collective happiness in each City of  Immortals not unlike that enjoyed in the old days by Ozzie and Harriet Nelson  on Sycamore Street.  </P> <P> Picture the Nelsons, the Cleavers, kindly Dr. Kildare, Henry Aldrich, Aunt Bee,  little Opie and the gang from "Father Knows Best" living in the same glorious  neighborhood and you'll have some idea of what the corporation hopes to achieve  in its heavenly communities.  </P> <P> Transcendental meditation, or TM, for those ignorant of psychic  self-improvement, taps one's universal energy to create a state of "restful  alertness" that clears the mind, improves health and frees you from tension,  anxiety and stress.  </P> <P> Kinda makes you wanna sing and dance.  </P> <P> I stopped by the office of the Heaven on Earth Co. the other day and talked  with men in suits and ties who somehow seemed more . . . well . . . serene than  most people. One was Curtis McDonald, a vice president of the company.  </P> <P> This all began, I was told, two years ago at a gathering in India where the  Maharishi declared that the problem of war was over and mankind ought to  concentrate on quality of life.  </P> <P> The concept somehow evolved into real estate speculation that shaped the notion  of sweet-peace cities, a dozen of which are in various stage of development in  the United States and Canada.  </P> <P> The difference between them and any other high-priced communities, McDonald  says, is the removal of stress through many means, including programs of  purification involving diet, exercise, meditation and, of course, the  Gandharva-Ved music concerts with which we are all so familiar.  </P> <P> When I suggested that stress might be a little difficult to leave behind in  this era of people with Uzis who do not abide by the principles of spiritual  fulfillment, he assured me that, in that case, security systems would be  incorporated into each of the housing developments.  </P> <P> Where good vibes fail, hire guards.  </P> <P> This all sounds pretty good to me and I plan on moving into a City of Immortals  myself. The possible intrusion of criminal mischief doesn't worry me at all. I  am confident that Sheriff Andy of Mayberry, and his sidekick Barney, will be  around to keep me safe and serene.  </P></p>

Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Robert  Urbain was assured of this by his Chinese counterpart Wu Yi at  Thursday's opening in Beijing of the tenth meeting of the  BLEU-China Joint Committee [for Trade], despite the already high  level of trade between the two countries -- worth more than $1  billion in 1993.    Mrs. Wu did not specify whether Chinese exports to the BLEU  will increase more, or vice-versa, but the total Chinese foreign  trade deficit in 1993 gives reason to believe that the former  hypothesis will prevail.    Internal growth in China will remain high, and high  technology imports will continue, especially from the member  states of the European Union [EU], said Mrs. Wu, who sees in  this an argument for rejecting the reservations voiced by  members of the EU concerning the efforts deployed by China to  conform with GATT standards. She contests the accusations of  dumping, and insists on the continuous growth of foreign  investments in China.    The leading foreign investment there at the moment is namely  the construction of the Shanghai Bell factory, which represents  an investment of more than 9 billion Belgian francs [BFr], for  which a loan worth over $125 million is about to be granted,  specified Minister Urbain. When it goes into production in  Putong in 1994, this factory will be the largest production unit  in the world for digital telephone lines (5 billion lines per  annum -- BELGA editor's note), employing 2,700 people who will  figure among the most productive employees in China. Moreover,  it is a long-term investment, for the joint venture has been  extended until 2013.    For its part, ATEA-Belgium [Telephone and Electricity  Workshops, Antwerp], which is trying hard to compete with  Alacatel-Bell, is making ready to supply the central provinces  of China with telecommunications equipment worth $133 million.  Currently, the company is waiting for a green light from the  regional subsidiaries of the Bank of China. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Far East raid on Trafalgar AT THE opening of the market, all eyes were trained on conglomerate Trafalgar House as broker SG Warburg launched a dawn raid on the hotels, shipping, construction and engineering group. The move not only excited the market but sent the shares sharply higher on turnover soaring to record levels. Word quickly spread that Warburg was shopping for a 15 per cent stake in Trafalgar at 85p, some 25p above Wednesday's close, but, apparently, with an order from the predator that only an outright 15 per cent was acceptable. The few doubts about the likely success of the Warburg operation were dispelled by mid afternoon when a majority of the required stake went through the market. The ordinary shares jumped 29 to close at 89 1/2 p, and the 'A' 28 1/2 p to 86p. Turnover in the ordinary shares reached a hefty 169m, while 44m 'A' shares were traded. Shortly after the market closed, it was announced that Hongkong Land had taken a 14.9 per cent stake in Trafalgar and was making a tender offer for an additional 15 per cent stake at 85p. A full scale bid was ruled out for at least a year. Mr Bruce Davidson at Smith New Court said, 'this places a floor on the share price but it will be difficult to see the price advance while Hongkong are still in the picture' Trafalgar was quoted at between 84 and 87p, in after hours trading. Shell in demand Shell Transport outpaced a generally strong oil sector after a senior executive of Shell Oil, the group's US division, carried out a series of one-to-one meetings with analysts from many leading London broking houses. Shell Transport shares raced up 9 to 546p on good turnover of 5.1m shares. Oil specialists said they were mainly boosted by sterling's weakness, notably against currencies linked to the D-Mark. Shell Transport would have to increase its sterling dividend proportionally more than Royal Dutch's payment in D-mark-linked Guilders to compensate for the decline in the UK currency. The Shell Oil meetings were said to have gone well with the oil company highlighting to Panmure Gordon, the UK broking house, the significance of progress in the Gulf of Mexico and recent increases in US gas prices following Hurricane Andrew. BP also attracted keen support, with dealers surprised at the weight of buying from UK institutions. Turnover, which reached 16m shares, was also boosted by the unwinding of positions said to have been taken out during the big programme-trade activity of recent sessions. BP ended the day 4 higher at 218 1/2 p. Enterprise Oil added 6 more to 428p with the market warming up ahead of Monday's ADR listing in the US which will be accompanied by a series of presentations to US institutions. Water stocks hit An announcement from the Office of Water Services (Ofwat), that it was seeking cuts in domestic water charges of around 2 per cent for 1993/4 saw UK water company shares in full retreat before rallying in the mid-session, only to fall back again. The news also affected electricity stocks. 'This is obviously not good news and will mean that the water stocks could well drift easier in the near future,' said Ms Rachel Lucas, a utilities specialist at County NatWest. But she said the sector 'still offers three to five per cent real dividend growth'. County said the Ofwat move would most affect companies such as Severn Trent and Welsh Water. The utilities team at Nomura described the Ofwat proposals as 'the annual autumnal regulatory tightening', and said they were 'not entirely unexpected'. Even after the planned cuts 'water dividends are still covered three times', Nomura said. Of the Footsie constituents, Anglian tumbled 18 1/2 to 420p, North West 16 to 442p, Severn Trent 19 to 396p and Thames 14 to 439p. The heaviest trade, 5.1m shares, was in Thames. Electricity stocks - 'the best way back into the utilities sector,' according to County - were given a mauling, with Norweb 19 lower at 413p and South West 18 off at 384p. Barclays Bank and Lloyds Bank shares, unsettled earlier this week by worries about bad debts and property values, resumed their upward momentum. Barclays jumped 12 to 349p on big turnover of 9.7m shares in response to stories that UBS Phillips &amp; Drew had recommended a switch from NatWest to Barclays. NatWest slipped 4 to 359p on 3m traded. BICC fell 12 to 260p after Smith New Court chopped current year profits estimate to Pounds 120m and that for next year to Pounds 152m. Kleinwort Benson was said to have reduced its current year estimate even further, to around Pounds 100m. Redland raced up to 3169p following interim figures at the top end of market expectations, but fell back to end a busy session a net 19 lower at 343p. The retreat came as analysts left a post-results meeting described by one as 'realistic, but generally gloomy'. He said Redland shares had suffered along with other building materials shares which looked toppy after a recent good run. Contracting issues, battered by the recession, took heart from the move by Hongkong Land to acquire a 30 per cent stake in Trafalgar House. But property stocks, sustained recently by hints of possible predatory moves by Hongkong Land, suffered from selling by disappointed speculators. Business services group BET fell back 6 to 102p, after Smith New Court downgraded its profit expectations for the current year by Pounds 47m to Pounds 88m, and the following year's forecast by Pounds 40m to Pounds 128m. The broker, however, expects BET to maintain its dividend at 6.5p. Turnover was 4.7m. Shares in international conglomerate Hanson gave up 6 to 210p, in trade of 15m shares, amid reports of a profits downgrade from Hoare Govett, its own broker. Shares in Forte brushed aside the much flagged disappointing interim results and a clutch of downgradings and jumped 14 to 149p, in brisk trade of 16m shares. P&amp;O mentioned for most of the session as a likely predetor for Trafalgar closed 2 up at 390p. Credit Lyonnais issued a buy recommendation on the stock saying, 'trading cash flow is expected to turn positive from 1993, alleviating any balance sheet concern.' Asda Group edged up 1 1/2 to 35p, after a Pounds 57m disposal of developments and sites. Henderson Crosthwaite said the sales represented bargains to the site purchasers, Argyll Group, unchanged at 335p, and J Sainsbury, up 14 at 483p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (52).

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo The Japanese government bond market is likely to move in a narrow range this week, with investors focusing on evidence of further economic weakening and the size of a prospective income tax cut. Investors have become wary of the recent fall in the yield on the No 145 10-year benchmark, to below the 3.5 per cent level. An increasing number last week tried to avert the risk of profit-taking by buying put options, or contracts giving the holder the 'right to sell'. However, increasing pessimism over an economic recovery is likely to support lower interest rates. One concern for bond investors is the size of the income tax cut, which Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, pledged over the weekend. The tax advisory committee to the government last week proposed an income tax cut funded by an increase in consumption taxes. But the government is likely to implement an early tax cut to boost the faltering economy, financed by government bonds, until consumption tax is increased. Traders believe a tax cut of Y5,000bn to Y6,000bn one year ahead of any consumption tax hike will be unlikely to affect supply and demand but a cut over Y10,000bn, two to three years ahead of a consumption tax increase will be bad news for the bond market.</p>

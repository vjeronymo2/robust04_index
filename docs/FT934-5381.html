			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Dorling shares fall on warning Santa has not been kind to Dorling Kindersley, the recently floated publisher which impressed the stock market with the quality of its illustrated reference books and futuristic multimedia products. Its shares fell nearly 10 per cent yesterday after the publisher warned that trading in the important pre-Christmas period had been disrupted by a computer problem at its distributor, Tiptree Books, which is owned by Random House, the US publishing group. Mr Richard Harman, managing director, said he could not quantify the impact of the problem, but a claim was being assessed by Arthur Andersen, the accountants, and would be pursued against Tiptree. Tiptree was named distributor of the year at the British Book Awards in February, but difficulties started when it installed a new computer system in July. Mr Harman said the problems at Tiptree were continuing in spite of the appointment of a new chief executive and round-the-clock working to clear the backlog. Although the disruption had been spotted in August, it was still affecting distribution to trade outlets and the DK Family Library, which sells directly to homes, offices and schools. Mr Harman said the UK represented only about 30 per cent of Dorling Kindersley's sales. Although Christmas accounted for about 60 per cent of sales, that was a lower weighting than other publishers, some of whom did 75 per cent of their business in the run-up to Christmas. Mr Peter Kindersley, group chairman and chief executive, told yesterday's annual meeting that it was too early to quantify the financial effect of the problem. However, BZW, the house broker, reduced its forecast of pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 10m. Dorling Kindersley's shares yesterday closed down 31p at 293p, still well above last October's flotation price of 165p. Most of the City's excitement has been generated by the link with Microsoft, the US computer software group which has a 20 per cent stake in the UK company.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / German employers reject arbitrators' pay proposal GERMAN government hopes for a peaceful pay round and spending restraint suffered a setback yesterday as employers rejected an arbitration proposal for a 5.4 per cent wage rise for west Germany's 3m public sector workers. Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister responsible for federal and local government wage policy, was joined by private sector employers and other government politicians in a chorus of protest. 'The arbitrators' suggestion fails to take account of current economic conditions and therefore cannot be a basis for agreement,' Mr Seiters said. Mr Hermann-Otto Solms, leader of the Free Democrat parliamentary group, said the offer was not acceptable. It would cost federal and state budgets an additional DM20bn (Pounds 7bn) a year, he claimed. The non-binding proposal, put forward after a 7-6 vote in favour, included extra payments totalling DM750 a head. The employers' final offer in the six-day conciliation talks consisted of 5 per cent from April plus DM400 back-pay. 'Anyone who thinks that is too little must go on strike,' said Mr Friedrich Zimmermann, the employer-nominated negotiator. Officials of the OTV and DAG unions, which represent most of the workforce, said if the employers did not improve their offer when formal negotiations resumed on Monday, they would hold strike ballots. The last public sector strike, in 1974, stopped virtually all public services for three days. The overall 'compromise' package for the public sector is lower than the 6.34 per cent steelworkers' award, agreed earlier this year, but similar to the 5.8 per cent deal offered to bank staff last weekend by employers which enjoyed record profits last year. Engineering employers negotiating with unions over a 9.5 per cent claim, said yesterday the offer was too high. Economic recovery in east Germany could be held up considerably if Bonn plays too interventionist a role in the region's industry, the Bundesbank warns in its annual report published yesterday, reports Andrew Fisher from Frankfurt. The central bank also repeats its concern that the value of the D-Mark as well as German economic growth and employment were at risk from inflation and the weak state of foreign economies. The bank made clear it had no intention yet of relaxing monetary policy.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Second half boost for Grafton A marked improvement in second half trading enabled Grafton Group, the Dublin-based builders' merchant, to lift full year pre-tax profits by 7 per cent to IPounds 4.13m (Pounds 3.97m). The directors said that a general reduction in interest rates and renewed economic confidence had had a positive impact on construction demand and consumer spending in all of the company's main markets. Sales for the 12 months to end-December rose by 9 per cent to IPounds 104.9m (IPounds 96.4m). For the second six months they rose by 16 per cent. Lower interest rates resulted in a reduction in interest charges from IPounds 1.23m to IPounds 692,000. Earnings per share improved from 18.6p to 20.9p and a final dividend of 4.25p makes an increased total of 7.25p (6.5p). The directors expect Grafton to 'benefit strongly' in 1994 from improved markets and from substantial investments in recent years to strengthen the operating position. The opening six months to June 30 saw pre-tax profits fall from IPounds 1.85m to IPounds 1.21m. Turnover was virtually static at IPounds 48.6m.</p>

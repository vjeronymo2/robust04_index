In a report to clients, Eiris investigated claims made in an article by a US investigative journalist in the magazine Business Ethics last week, and concluded that Body Shop had been 'unfairly criticised'. 'A number of claims made in headlines have turned out to be untrue, or at least misleading,' the report said. Body Shop's animal testing policy, while differing from that of some 'green' groups, was defensible, and that its charitable giving compared more favourably with other companies than the article suggested. It added that the company's environmental reporting record was 'among the best in the UK' although it could be improved. Body Shop had had problems with franchisees but was 'much the same as other people'. Eiris admitted the scale of Body Shop's Trade Not Aid policy was small but it was at least a practical step. 'Some criticisms remain, and there are ways in which Body Shop can improve (as can every company),' the report said.

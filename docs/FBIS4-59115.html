			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following review of the 3 May issue  of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Islamists Win Elections in Cairo University Club    2. Muslim Brotherhood Appeals to Yemeni Parties To  Preserve    Unity    3. Military Court Sentences AL-SHA'B Military Editor    4. Islamic Writer Criticizes Government's Handling of  Violence    5. Writer Assails Government's Bid To Foil Political Islam  <H5>  ISLAMISTS WIN ELECTIONS IN CAIRO UNIVERSITY TEACHING CLUB </H5>   A 150-word unattributed report on page 1 says the Islamic  trend at Cairo University won a landslide victory in the  elections to the Cairo University Teaching Club. The report  notes that the Islamists won the four seats and that 93 percent  of the voters gave their support to the Islamists in a  democratic atmosphere.  <H5>  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD APPEALS TO YEMENI PARTIES TO PRESERVE </H5> UNITY    A 150-word unattributed report on page 1 notes that the  Muslim Brotherhood appealed to the parties to the conflict in  Yemen to safeguard the public interest and settle differences  within the framework of a constructive dialogue based on the  shari'ah and to place Yemeni unity above all other  considerations. The report says that the Muslim Brotherhood  called on the Arab and Muslim leaders and organizations to play  the required role in closing the Yemeni ranks and stopping the  bloodshed.  <H5>  MILITARY COURT SENTENCES AL-SHA'B MILITARY EDITOR </H5>   A 200-word report on page 1 by 'Abd-al-Fattah Fayid says  that  after one hearing, the military court sentenced AL-SHA'B  military editor 'Abd-al-Sattar Abu-Husayn to one year with hard  labor and ordered him to pay a 500-pound fine. The paper notes  that he was arrested after publishing a report on the Bright  Star maneuvers between Egypt and Western countries. The report  says that the military editors of the Journalists Syndicate and  journalists doyen Ibrahim Naf'i sent a memorandum to the defense  minister urging him not to ratify the ruling.  <H5>  ISLAMIC WRITER CRITICIZES GOVERNMENT'S HANDLING OF VIOLENCE </H5>   In an approximately 2,000-word article on page 3, Islamic  Brotherhood writer Dr. Ahmad al-Malat claims that a trustworthy  mosque preacher told him that mosque prayer leaders receive  instructions directly from the Awqaf Ministry "not to mention  Palestine, talk badly of Jews, or comment on Bosnia in their  Friday sermons." Al-Malat asks the Awqaf minister if this is  the mosque's mission in the country that is home to the al-Azhar  Mosque. He asks: Shouldn't the Muslims know about Islamic  issues that are the focus of world media? He says what he calls  the intelligence henchmen want the Egyptians to forget the  peoples of Palestine and Bosnia and leave them to their fate.  He asks if a mosque and a preacher's mission have become so  trivial. He argues that this attitude does a great injustice to  the sublime mission of Islam and the Muslims' right to know  about Muslim issues.    Discussing violence by Muslim youths, al-Malat says: We  "agree" with these youths on the goal of serving the Islamic  call but "differ" with them over the means. He says Islam calls  for preserving the sanctity of life, property, and honor and  draws limits that Muslims should not exceed. He says: We the  Muslim Brotherhood "cannot accuse these youths of being  mercenaries, hirelings, or renegades," as we have no evidence.  But we maintain that they are Muslim youths who have "gone  astray."    Addressing government officials, al-Malat states that they  have a right to pursue crime but within the framework of Islamic  shari'ah, not their laws that they call democracy. He claims  that government officials have no right to take power,  deactivate the laws, and impose the emergency law to "humiliate  the people and subjugate them." He suggests that they have no  right to prevent particular preachers from addressing the  masses. He argues that the Muslim Brotherhood is "more capable  of understanding" these youths and closer to the right path of  holding a dialogue with them, especially in view of the failure  of every government effort embodied in the enlightenment convoys  that tour the country. If the officials "think rationally and  avoid wielding a heavy stick" it will be easy to address this  problem. "Direct dialogue" with these youths is the way to get  closest to their minds. This, the author believes, requires  "recognition of the right of the Muslim Brotherhood to free  movement among the youths without control or spying." He  contends that the government can silence voices with whips but  cannot stop resentment "seething" in the hearts of youths, which  will eventually give vent to disaster.  <H5>  WRITER ASSAILS GOVERNMENT'S BID TO FOIL POLITICAL ISLAM </H5>   Muhammad Jamal Mishhat, in a 500-word column on page 8,  discusses the escalating acts of violence in Egypt. He claims  that the government and its media "endorse a policy hostile to  Islam." He suggests they "penetrated" the Islamic groups,  "distorted" their image, and shed their blood. The Muslim  Brotherhood, he says, learned from 20 years of experience in  jail and notes that "no Muslim Brotherhood member has been  involved in acts of violence." The Muslim Brotherhood accepted  democracy and entered the People's Assembly and various other  associations. They achieved reforms but their "achievements  have been fought" and the government is "escalating the  confrontation" because it wants to "foil the success of  political Islam" in the same way it foiled the attempts to  revive economic Islam.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Survey of Chicago - A Centre For Finance and Industry (1): Exchanges defend their world title - Diversification has helped to insulate the city from the worst of the economic downturn, writes Barbara Harrison, introducing this portrait of the 'no boom, no bust' capital of the US Midwest CHICAGO, big, brash, and very American, has a runner-up complex that compels it always to try harder. As the third largest US city, it wants to prove that it is as good as New York for business and finance, and as culturally up to the minute, if more high-minded, as Los Angeles. The phrase 'second to none' rolls off Chicagoans' lips remarkably often. Thus the capital of the great Midwestern swathe known as America's heartland is competing increasingly against the two US coasts for international attention. Over the past decade or so, the international prominence of the city has surpassed the dreams of most Chicagoans. Thanks largely to the remarkable growth of its futures and options markets, Chicago now figures on the maps of every major financial institution in the world. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the world's two largest futures exchanges, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the world's largest options exchange, have ridden the crest of a global derivatives trading wave. On many days, more money - measured in the value of derivative products - passes through Chicago's hands than New York's. This new world role has allowed Chicago to temper, if not bury, its old gritty image as a steel and meat-packing town - the poet Carl Sandburg's 'city of broad shoulders.' And the view of Chicago as Al Capone territory has also faded. While organised crime and corruption still exist, they are nowhere near the blown-up dimensions of Hollywood's version of Prohibition-era Chicago. The city's futures markets have also had to contend with a negative image. The CBOT and the CME have waged a public relations battle against those who view futures trading as just a half step away from gambling. The efforts of the exchanges were, however, set back by the 1989 scandal, in which 47 traders were indicted for fraud following an undercover investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Since then, reforms of trading practices have helped to quieten criticism, and the increasing use of electronic trading devices is expected to provide further protection against fraud. Yet the meteoric rise in the international financial importance of Chicago's futures markets was not lost on other countries. During the past few years, new foreign futures markets, led by the London International Financial Futures Exchange, have been eating away at Chicago's once dominant world market share of futures trading. Together, the CBOT and CME now claim only 40 per cent of the world's trading volume for futures. The greatest challenge to the CBOT and CME during this decade will be to keep their market share from dropping further. They are fighting back by launching more products with international appeal and with Globex, the round-the-clock electronic trading system. On the positive side, the explosion of derivatives trading has brought a tide of financial investors to the city, including many foreign banks and brokerage houses. All of the major Japanese banks and brokerages, for example, have opened Chicago operations. Overall, some 70 foreign banks are present. The markets, with their accompanying investments and jobs, have helped fuel an extensive retooling of the local economy over the past 15 years. In the mid-1970s, Chicago was still heavily reliant on manufacturing. Some 35-36 per cent of its jobs were in manufacturing then, whereas today manufacturing accounts for only 17-18 per cent - similar to the national figure, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. The shift from manufacturing was helped by the collapse of the local steel industry at the start of the 1980s. A general industrial restructuring that came in the wake of the 1982-83 recession pushed it along further. That recession, which hit the Midwest particularly hard, and the painful retrenchment after it kept the region from experiencing the giddy 1980s boom that occurred on both US coasts. Chicago plodded through the 1980s with slow growth; but it increasingly diversified, creating jobs in financial services, telecommunications, transportation, insurance, real estate, distribution, food and health. The number of service jobs roughly offset the losses in manufacturing, leaving city employment to hover at the 1.2m mark since 1977. Diversification helped insulate Chicago from the worst effects of the 1990-91 economic downturn. Regional economists are fond of attributing the relative economic health of the city and the Midwest to 'no boom, no bust'. Despite many lay-offs by Chicago area companies during the past two years, particularly in banking and real estate, evidence of the local economy's resilience is seen in the fact that unemployment is running at just 6.8 per cent, compared with 7.4 per cent for the nation. Metropolitan Chicago's economy is helped by the presence of several dozen Fortune 500 companies. Powerful multinational companies such as Sara Lee, Amoco, Sears, McDonald's, United Airlines, Inland Steel, Quaker, Waste Management and Motorola call metropolitan Chicago home. Local boosters like to tout the fact that two thirds of US gross national product is generated within a 500-mile range of Chicago. Foreign companies have also bolstered the city's fortunes, with jobs and capital expenditures, and raised its international profile. According to a 1992 study, by KPMG Peat Marwick, of inward investment to Illinois, the state is home to 617 US headquarters of foreign-owned companies, most of which are in the Chicago area. For the study, such companies were defined as being at least 50 per cent owned by a foreign entity. Of 361 companies that responded to the survey, 58 per cent were in the city itself or Cook County, in which Chicago is located. Another 31 per cent were in the metropolitan area, or 'collar counties'. Notably, 68 per cent were start-ups and 52 per cent of their workforce was in manufacturing. Democratic Mayor Richard Daley, who was re-elected to a second term last year, is unabashedly pro-business. But he contends that big tax concessions ought not to be made in order to encourage investment. He is currently trying to win the Illinois legislature's approval for a controversial Dollars 2bn casino project. It would receive no tax incentives and be an entirely private investment. But, despite backing for the project from top business associations, Governor Jim Edgar, a Republican, is opposed. No one is willing to predict the outcome of a vote, which is imminent. Yet, even with Chicago's successful economic diversification, the city faces many challenges. Economists predict that it will continue to lose manufacturing jobs. Its infrastructure has deteriorated severely, as the disastrous downtown flood showed earlier this year. Its substantial airport facilities, which constitute one of the biggest attractions for business, need expansion in order to keep up with demand into the next decade. While Mayor Daley is attempting to address these issues, the city also faces a host of social problems typical of America's urban landscapes. As the crack and heroin trade has moved more heavily into the city, over the past year or so, violent crime, largely from gangs, has mounted. Local business leaders are worried, too, about the quality of the local workforce. The Chicago school system ranks as one of the worst in urban America, despite attempts in recent years to reform it. The city's publicly subsidised housing for the poor is also in horrifyingly bad condition and infested with gangs. In addition, racial tensions have bubbled. Black leaders criticise Mayor Daley for inadequate attention to their community's needs. This complaint could spell a significant political challenge to Mr Daley when he runs for re-election in 1995. Meanwhile, the mayor hopes that, with president-elect Bill Clinton - a fellow Democrat whom he strongly supported - in the White House, some federal support for the city's problems could be forthcoming. But even with that support, Chicago's political and business leadership will have to draw on its stores of dynamism, inventiveness and vision to find solutions to the city's difficulties - a test that will also be 'second to none'.</p>

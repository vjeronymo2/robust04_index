			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Former Iri chief makes quick comeback Mr Michele Tedeschi, former chief executive of Iri, the state holding, was brought back yesterday in a surprise move to head the huge group that has debts of over L70,000bn (Pounds 28.97bn), writes Robert Graham in Rome. The appointment came after intense political wrangling among the main partners in the right-wing coalition government that has delayed a choice for almost two months. It represents a technocratic compromise which will give an important signal of the Berlusconi government's commitment to privatise as much of Iri's diversified activities as possible. The 44-year-old Mr Tedeschi returns to Iri after only 14 months absence to replace Prof Romano Prodi, who resigned in May when the Berlusconi government took office. Mr Tedeschi was appointed to act as chief executive in 1992 when Iri was converted into a public company with the Treasury as single shareholder. Mr Tedeschi returns as chairman, heading a six-man board that includes Mr Mario Draghi, director-general of the Treasury, who has played a key role over the past 18 months while the holding has begun to sell off bank interests. He comes from being managing director of Stet, the national telecoms utility. His choice should help rationalise the management of the fast-changing Italian telecommunications business. Only yesterday the complex merger was signed bringing together five elements in Iri's telecom interests to form Telecom Italia.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, June 3 (AFP) -- PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat  resumed work late Thursday [2 June] after a day and a half's  rest to recover from recent trips to neighbouring Algeria and  Mauritania, a PLO spokesman said.    The spokesman denied reports that the 64-year-old Palestine  Liberation Organisation leader was seriously ill and requiring  hospital treatment, saying only that he had been tired.    'Arafat met late Thursday with former Swedish foreign  minister Sten Anderson, an old friend, and the spokesman said  the meeting would be filmed to show that "malevolent rumours"  about his health were false.    A senior Palestinian official, PLO Executive Committee  member  Samir Ghawshah, said Thursday that 'Arafat was suffering from  influenza and had been confined to bed at his Tunis home since  Wednesday.    Doctors recommended that he get plenty of rest, but he was  not expected to receive treatment in hospital, Ghawshah told AFP.    However a hospital source said that 'Arafat had been  admitted  to the Tunis military hospital since meeting three U.S.  congressmen early Wednesday, following a "cardiac alert."    All his appointments until his meeting with Andersen were  cancelled, including a business conference, a poetry evening and  an interview with CBS anchorman Dan Rather.    The PLO leader, who is due to set up the Palestinian  self-rule authority in Jericho in two weeks, was treated twice  last month for exhaustion and stress, spending a night at the  military hospital in Tunis, Palestinian sources said.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Marginal seats are targeted - Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform LABOUR candidates in marginal Tory-held seats are being urged to stress their backing for a change in Britain's voting system to win crucial floating voters, the party's electoral reform lobby revealed yesterday. The Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform (LCER) said such a move would be crucial in winning vital votes from the Liberal Democrats - the only party openly committed to proportional representation for the House of Commons. While LCER did not expect the party's manifesto to do more than repeat its openness to change, campaign leaders insisted that reminding the electorate of Labour's new stance would help the leadership pave the way to a national debate after an election victory. They said LCER would press candidates to use election leaflets to underline that Labour's working party on electoral systems would report soon after the election. They recalled that there were already commitments for new voting methods for a Scottish parliament and a Greater London authority. Mr Jeff Rooker, LCER chairman, said: 'Labour candidates across the country will be well advised to ensure they signal their support at this and every opportunity.' His call was backed by Mr Huw Edwards, MP for Monmouth, who used public support for reform to rebuff a Liberal Democrat challenge at the by-election last year. Other electoral reform lobbyists are also gearing up their preparations for highlighting the issue during the campaign. The Electoral Reform Society plans to release computer calculations on how the 1987 election might have been influenced by other voting systems. The Charter 88 lobby group is planning a 'Democracy Day' the Thursday before polling, intended to put a critical spotlight on the current first-past-the-post method. The aim is to persuade candidates of all the main parties in some 100 seats to participate in public debates on the issue as the election campaign draws to its climax. The poll tax is the single cause given most often by former Tory voters as the reason for their defection, according to an opinion poll in the 50 most marginal Tory seats. The NOP survey shows Labour in a five point lead over the Tories - on 43 and 38 per cent respectively. The Liberal Democrats were up on 18 per cent. It was carried our for today's Local Government Chronicle and BBC television's Public Eye.</p>

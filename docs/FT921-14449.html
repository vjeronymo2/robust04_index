			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Putting a price on idealism - Political Notebook Mr Neil Kinnock has spent much of the past four years promising Labour will not change the world, at least not much. Now, as the election approaches, he must pledge that it will. It is not a contradiction he would admit. He argues that by jettisoning the ideological baggage that made it unelectable during the early 1980s, Labour has returned to, rather than turned its back on, its ideological roots. It is possible to be both safe and exciting. Yet, just as Conservatives now hark back to a mythical age of polite schoolchildren diligently reciting their tables and of liveried trains chugging elegantly across rolling hills, Labour is glancing wistfully at an idealised past. Mr Kinnock's dilemma is obvious. He must persuade the electorate that he will not rob it of the fruits of Thatcherism. For all their anger over the recession, voters will not accept a return to extravagant public spending and punitive taxation. But he must convince them also that a limited reallocation of the nation's resources is something worth voting for: that idealism has not been thrown out with extremism. The response is to seek an image which combines its new-found economic respectability with a perception that Labour is the party ordinary people vote for because it stands for a fairer society. Nationalisation, unilateralism, anti-Europeanism, and soaking the rich are to be seen as a damaging but aberrant departure from this true socialist tradition - much perhaps as Thatcherism is now regarded by some Conservatives as an, albeit extraordinary, deviation from the traditions of Disraeli's One Nation. Senior Labour figures lose little sleep when accused of offering a warmed-up version of the 1960s vision of the then Mr Harold Wilson. Mr Wilson, they remind themselves, won three of four elections. They are unashamed that Mr Kinnock - as at the party's weekend rally in York when he spoke on a platform emblazoned with the Union Flag - has combined his conversion to Europe with a new brand of economic nationalism. 'Made in Britain', the latest slogan from the party's image makers to encapsulate its economic and industrial strategy, could have been coined by Mr Wilson. Perhaps it was. Yet, as Mr John Major has discovered, it is not so easy to relive history. The backbone of postwar Labour support came from the 'respectable' working classes who saw security for their old age and opportunity for their children in the welfare state. It is no accident that Mr Kinnock's firmest spending pledges are to increase state pensions and child benefit. But cloth caps and rows of rented terraces have been replaced by Ford Escorts and mortgaged council houses. The recession has not erased that part of the Thatcherite legacy which has left the electorate more than half-persuaded that opportunity is now found in low taxes, home ownership and a quick profit on BT shares. It is that change that has been the driving force behind Mr Kinnock's transformation of his party. It remains the most potent force shaping the general election campaign. For all its dismissive rejection of the Conservative onslaught on its tax and spendings plans, Labour remains deeply worried that its reputation for wasteful profligacy has not been entirely exorcised. Its leaders will privately admit that if the decision could be taken again, proposed increases in National Insurance Contributions for those earning over Pounds 20,000 would be more cautiously framed. The message is already seeping out that the rise might well be phased in gently rather than slapped on in a first Budget. Labour takes comfort in polls showing that most voters would prefer a better health or education service to a tax cut. And, like Mr Wilson, Mr Kinnock will argue that 'modern' management will yield the economic growth to square the circle of higher spending and moderate taxes. Labour knows that, however strong its pledges, it cannot avoid the charge that taxes under Mr Kinnock would be higher than under Mr Major. So from now until the election we will see an effort by Labour to claim the moral high ground. To admit that idealism costs money; and then argue, as Mr Hattersley did in York on Sunday, that if it is loyal to its past idealism the voters will readily pay for 'the fairer society which the Labour party was founded to create'. But how much will they pay?</p>

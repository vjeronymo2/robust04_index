			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / EC urged to curb labour law growth THE European Community should stop introducing laws and regulations over a wide range of labour issues, the Engineering Employers Federation says in a submission to be presented in Brussels today, Robert Taylor writes. The EC should stay away from collective labour legislation, worker consultation and participation, working hours, job content, contracts of employment, annual leave and industrial relations and procedures, it says. 'The future direction of European social policy must be about encouraging business competitiveness and job creation,' it adds. EC social policy should concentrate on training, labour mobility and the creation of cross-border employment services, it concludes.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (4): Popularity soared in past two years  -Tenders and Auctions / An analysis by JLW reveals that more properties are being put out for bids Discussion on the merits of differing religions occupies little time in the life of the average property professional. They are more likely to be deep in debate about the advantages of buying shops rather than offices. The buying and selling of such investments, however, often appears to have all the hallmarkings of a doctrinal division. Auctions have soared in popularity over the past couple of years, bringing an air of nervousness to advisers who have never set foot in a sale room. Public exhibitions of bidding frenzy bring a shiver of discomfort to those used to playing off unidentified buyers and sellers in quiet offices or on mobile phones. But they now face questions from clients about whether auctions are better than tender or private treaty. Such debates are futile, says Richard Auterac, auctions specialist for Jones Lang Wootton. 'It is a bit like comparing religions. None is better than any other.' There is no hard and objective evidence to make a meaningful comparison. A sector analysis launched by JLW has certainly helped show that business is increasing. The Auction Results Analysis System (Aras) brought together figures for the first time from six top London auctioneers. But such changes are too often attributed to the method of sale, when they might reflect general changes in the market, says Mr Auterac. Explosion of turnover last year and a fall-off in the past six months, for example, have been matched in the private treaty market. This is not surprising, as Mr Auterac believes auctions give a more accurate picture of the property market than the big, glossy deals which attract headlines. They reflect the tone of the wider market, which involves thousands of private property companies and individual investors. Proselytisers insist that selling under the hammer does have advantages which outlast general market movements, however. 'It provides a quick and efficient method of sale, avoiding the procrastination often associated with private treaty,' says Patrick Kerr of Allsop &amp; Co, the largest UK operator with sales of more than Pounds 200m in the past 12 months. Auctions can also squeeze out extra value from bidders spurred by the fact that they can plainly see the 'whites of the competitor's eyes'. Certain kinds of property are well suited to such open and dramatic techniques. Unique buildings need an open forum to determine market value, says Cliff Krieger of Chesterton. Investment property can be hard to price any other way when demand soars above supply, while banks, receivers and trustees also need a public stage to show they are fulfilling a duty to obtain maximum returns. The market has been flooded with this kind of property over the past two years. Banks, for example, are now willing to unload vast property holdings at knock-down prices, says veteran auctioneer Simon Rigall of Conrad Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith. Local authorities rushed in during a period of grace when the government allowed them to keep capital receipts. Conrad Ritblat sold 300 council properties in this blue patch up to early 1994. Brewers have shed pubs under orders from the Monopolies Commission while retailers and banks raised cash through sale and leaseback deals. The surge appears to be abating, however. The number of lots fell by almost 40 per cent and sales by 50 per cent in the three months to September, according to Aras. This reflects the end of council property dumping but also demonstrates Mr Auterac's case that auctions follow the general market, which is now more uncertain over rental growth and interest rate movements. John Townsend of Erdman Lewis says yields are suffering because of wider interest rate moves, but volume should remain stable if sellers are not over-ambitious. Richard Ellis is so confident of institutional interest in selling assets this way that the firm is joining the market by setting up a partnership with Dublin-based auctioneer Gunne. It may be a tough business to enter. Shortage of quality property could turn the market into a test of survival of the fittest, says Mr Krieger. Over the long-term, however, most professionals believe the sector will continue to grow as bigger dealers taste the advantages of auction selling. And if some form of objective analysis can be devised to illustrate this difference, it will expand even more, adds Mr Auterac.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Arts: Misogynist on the rampage - Cinema NAKED (18) Mike Leigh DAVE (12) Ivan Reitman THE REAL McCoy (12) Russell Mulcahy LONDON FILM FESTIVAL Mike Leigh's Naked is so politically incorrect that it risks being trampled to death by outraged ideologues. Greens will be shocked by its morbid relish for urban decay and global despair. Feminists will be appalled as the hero-misogynist Johnny (David Thewlis) rapes, rants and chauvinistically philosophises. And film purists - do we count them as PC? - will think, 'This is not a movie, it is a Jeremiad with changing backdrops.' At Cannes the film won two prizes, for best director and best actor (Thewlis). But let us not take that as a quality guarantee. It may just mean that Europeans fell for it as they fall for any UK movie, from the latest Loach to Jarman's The Last Of England, that depicts Britain as a doomed island inhabited by losers, villains or madmen. In reality Naked is itself maddening: part good, part bad, part ugly. Our hero Johnny, brilliantly played by Thewlis, is a Leigh special: a gutter Hamlet, awash in downbeat soliloquising and offbeat mannerism, all the way from the snuffly cough that punctuates his sentences to his habit of spinning giant think-aloud arias at the drop of a triviality. 'How did you get here?' he is asked at one point: whereupon he delivers a thumbnail history of human evolution. We first meet him date-raping a girl in a Manchester alley and are soon watching him throw his virility around down South. He has dropped in on the London flat of girlfriend Louise (Lesley Sharp) where the new prey is dimwitted flatmate Sophie (Katrin Cartlidge): a sort of Dalston Vampira with pinched vowels and tighter-pinched black clothing. 'Is there an instruction manual for this?' asks Johnny, attempting to unbutton the unbuttonable after Louise has gone out to leave the coital coast clear. So far, so typical. This is the Doctor Leigh we know from High Hopes and Life Is Sweet: the man who lays his specimen proles on the examining table and solemnly, minutely probes their minds and manners. But Naked then moves off in a new, alarming direction. Abandoning individual patients for a general medical inquiry, Leigh tracks all over London pushing his stethoscope at every cardboard everyman he can find in Cardboard City and environs. He seems to be searching for the dark soul of London; or perhaps of all cities; or perhaps of the world. There is the young Scottish down-and-out shouting for his lost girlfriend. There is the woman Johnny roughs up - he is still our escort-guide - after glimpsing her dancing in a window. And there is the middle-aged office nightwatchman (Peter Wight), forlorn and Hancockian, with whom Johnny strikes up an all-night chat about life, death and the Book of Revelation. Oh good heavens, and we almost forgot Jeremy (Greg Cruttwell). He is the snooty yuppie in a parallel story, who first beats up a waitress and then moves in on That Flat to menace poor Sophie with a stuffed lizard. Mike Leigh is a wise old lizard himself. He probably knows that people secretly like the political incorrectness of his plays and films, whether sexist or classist. More usually it is the latter: the sacred proletariat coshed with its own obtuseness, and those who try to escape from the proletariat impaled on their pretensions. Whatever the satirical agenda, in Leigh's best work there has been an enlivening struggle between the director's dictatorial comic spirit and the fight-back spontaneity of the improvisation-developed characters. In Naked the characters seem to have been allowed little or no autonomy at all. They are pawns in a Great Miserablist Plot. Those who are not villains are victims. Those who are not DIY philosophers like Johnny, or like Leigh's Nietzche-with-a-filofax Jeremy, are birdbrains like Sophie or Louise. Put more bluntly, those who are not men - the bio-deterministic thesis almost seems to amount to this - are women. Naked has a loose, free-form daring in its structure that one would love to say marks an advance in Leigh's work. But in the viewing it seems less like an advance, more like a walk off a tall cliff into a chasm of glib misanthropic and misogynistic generalities. For once the PC crowd (we hate to say it) may be right. Kevin Kline is multiplied by two in Dave, causing us to wonder what marvels or monsters lie in wait if Hollywood gets serious about genetic replication. The interesting thing about this comedy of Presidential imposture - the only interesting thing - is the way it strews living duplications of the famous all through its story. Not just Kline, who plays both stroke-stricken outgoing President and the goodhearted bumpkin who takes his place, first to placate the media, later for real. (The plot is The Prisoner Of Zenda meets Mr Smith Goes To Washington.) But also walking, talking and smirking through in small cameo roles are Arnold Schwarzenegger, Oliver Stone and a dozen real-life American politicians and newspersons: possibly real, possibly (as I suspect) made in test-tubes. Certainly the film is made in one. Director Ivan (Twins) Reitman and writer Gary (Big) Ross begin by heating some funny satire over a low burner. Then just when the substance begins to fizz they pour in a whole lot of schmaltz concerning Kline 2's growing passion for Kline 1's first lady, Sigourney Weaver. This pair is determined to save children's homes, cut out corruption on Capitol Hill and generally bore us to death with social-political piety. What did Reitman and Ross, bending over their tube, want the film to do? Just to change colour? It does, from bilious wit to sentimental puce. What we had hoped for, vainly, was a few sharp crackles leading to a climactic explosion. The Real McCoy is a heist thriller with similar pace and wit problems. Hi-tech burglar Kim Basinger is fresh from a six-year jail sentence, and do we mean fresh. Evidently they have a beauty salon and state-of-the-art hairdresser at the Athens Correctional Facility in Georgia. Looking a million dollars, Miss B comes out to steal Dollars 18 million more. She is helped by boyfriend Val Kilmer and hindered by evil former criminal pal Terence Stamp (plus Southern accent). But she is not helped by Russell Mulcahy's direction, which proceeds at the pace of a lobotomised snail even when hell and high hokum are meant to be breaking out during the theft itself. The London Film Festival is back, starting today. Has it really been a year since London's South Bank was last covered in a seething, palpitating mass of international celluloid? Ah, but my new year resolution for 1993 was not to be rude about the size and unwieldiness of this year's LFF, however tempting. Enough to say that there are more than 200 films on show, and those are just the features. Among entries I have seen, I can commend Atom Egoyan's Calendar, brilliantly blending a mock-travelogue with a tale of unravelling romance; Rolf De Heer's Venice Grand Jury Prize winner Bad Boy Bubby, a bizarre growing-up tale from Australia mixing sex, religion and comedy of (bad) manners; Tian Zhuangzhuang's touching and majestic The Blue Kite, a banned-in-China tale of life in Peking under Chairman Mao; and Maria Luisa Bemberg's We Don't Want To Talk About It, featuring magic realism, Marcello Mastroianni and sly comic insights into small-town Argentina. Among films I know, I also scratch my head and wonder why the likes of Alain Cavalier's Libera Me, Bertrand Blier's 1,2,3 Sun and Assi Dayan's Life According To Agfa - groan-inducers at earlier European festivals - have been selected for the LFF. But I said I would not be rude about the event's gargantuan all-inclusiveness. Best to end on hope and to mention promising but as yet unseen films such as Lindsay Anderson's Is That All There Is? (self-portrait of British cinema's grand old man), Stephen Poliakoff's Century (Miranda Richardson in tale of mad love and mad science) and Frederick Wiseman's Zoo (latest fly-on-waller from the unblinking US documentarist). Nor let us neglect such golden oldies as John Ford's The Searchers, Alfred Hitchcock's Under Capricorn and William Wellman's Wings, plus orchestra. The festival, which is based at the National Film Theatre and continues until November 21, is open to all.</p>

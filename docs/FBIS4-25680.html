Such  news briefings are of high authoritativeness. The "spokesmen"  are playing more and more important roles. In order to better  serve journalistic work, we will introduce the spokesmen of  various central departments, and will also listen to their  opinions about the news media and journalists.    Following replies to the questionaires, this issue first  introduces six spokesmen. In the future, we will introduce  more, and will also discuss the work of the "media spokesmen."

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / 3i likely to be valued at Pounds 1.6bn in June flotation 3i, Europe's largest investor in unquoted companies, yesterday paved the way for a public share offer that is likely to value the British company at about Pounds 1.6bn. The flotation will be one of the year's largest share issues and the biggest UK investment trust ever launched. The listing will give private investors their first opportunity to buy shares in a group that has taken equity stakes in a wide range of small unquoted businesses since it was formed as the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation in 1945. 3i has investments valued at Pounds 3bn in 3,400 small UK businesses and has a strong bias towards manufacturing companies. Seven leading commercial banks and the Bank of England, which own 3i, plan to sell about 40 per cent of the equity. A quarter of this will be made available to private investors, according to the pathfinder prospectus which was published yesterday. The offer is scheduled to be launched on June 22. The current weakness of the stock market prompted some analysts to wonder yesterday whether the shareholders might consider pulling the issue in a repeat of the embarrassing postponement 14 months ago when some banks believed the likely float price was too low. Mr Ewen Macpherson, 3i chief executive, would not comment on the market fall or whether there was any chance of the issue being postponed. In the past, he has said the issue would be pulled 'over my dead body'. If the market continues to fall before the issue is priced, the banks are likely to proceed but sell less than the planned 40 per cent of their stakes. 'The issue is very important in the totality of the unquoted market and in terms of the whole function of getting venture capital into the marketplace,' one analyst said. In the year to March 31, 3i's net assets rose 39.1 per cent to Pounds 1.85bn, after including the write-back of a Pounds 152m provision for deferred tax. That provision will not be needed once 3i floats and becomes an investment trust that is exempt from capital gains tax. The issue will be priced at a discount to this net asset value. Even though 3i is most likely to attract long-term investors, the discount may have to widen to make the shares attractive to investors if the market is still depressed before June 22. 3i has set up a share information office and a 'retail brokers' scheme' to encourage private investors to register early for application forms. Early registration will not confer extra allocation of shares. The adviser to the issue is Baring Brothers and brokers are BZW, James Capel and National Westminster.

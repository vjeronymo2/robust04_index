			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 20 Jun (INA) -- Official talks between the  Iraqi National Assembly and the Yemeni House of Representatives  began here today. The Iraqi side to the talks was led by Safa'  Salih al-'Umar, chairman of the Arab and International Relations  Committee, whereas the Yemeni side was led by House Member  Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Kibsi.    The heads of the two sides reviewed Arab and international  developments, particularly the situation in fraternal Yemen in  light of the continued imperialist-Zionist conspiracy that is  targeting Yemen's unity.    Talks also dealt with ways to coordinate cooperation between  the Iraqi National Assembly and the Yemeni House of  Representatives in the parliamentary and political fields in a  way that will serve both fraternal peoples and benefit the Arab  nation in various fields.</p>

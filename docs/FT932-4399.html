			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: Investment side hits Orkla interim result ORKLA, the Norwegian group with interests ranging from branded consumer goods to chemical processing, yesterday reported a decrease in four-month pre-tax profit to NKr303m (Dollars 43.9m) from NKr415m last year. The weaker result was attributed to a sharply worse performance by the group's investment business which contributed just NKr16m to group interim pre-tax profit against NKr270m last year. Realised gains on shares fell to NKr53m in this year's four-month interim period from NKr385m last year, while unrealised gains shot up to NKr774m from NKr84m. Orkla said the aggregate market value of the share portfolio was NKr4.88bn at the end of April. On the Oslo bourse yesterday, Orkla's A shares shed NKr3 to NKr181; B shares dropped NKr3.50 to NKr187.50 as free shares fell NKr4 to NKr188 on the weaker result. Group operating profit rose by 32 per cent to NKr321m in the interim period from NKr243m last year due to growth in volume, higher productivity and increased market share. Group sales in the four-month period increased to NKr5.52bn from NKr5.42bn last year. Orkla said its branded consumer goods business lifted operating profit by 20 per cent to NKr242m from NKr201m, in spite of a continued low growth rate in the domestic consumer goods market. 'In particular, household products, food and media contributed to the advance,' Orkla said. Household products saw operating profit rise to NKr112m from NKr70m while food products increased to NKr87m from NKr71m. The media business more than doubled operating profit to NKr30m from NKr14m. Orkla said lower operating profit by the beverage business - which was more than halved to NKr10m from NKr22m - was mainly due to investments in new capacity related to new activity in Poland. The group's chemical processing business lifted four-month operating profit to NKr77m from NKr43m, helped by increased sales and cost reductions.</p>

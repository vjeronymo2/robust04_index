			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pendragon rises 41% to Pounds 7.4m - New car market showed recovery while used car prices firmed Stronger demand and improved margins helped Pendragon, the luxury and executive car dealer, report a 41 per cent improvement in 1993. Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 7.37m, against Pounds 5.23m last time, on turnover up 29 per cent to Pounds 276.4m (Pounds 214.6m), including Pounds 5.59m from acquisitions. Earnings per share emerged at 14.1p (11.8p) out of which an increased final dividend of 4.8p (4.4p) is being paid, raising the total for the year to 7.2p (6.6p). Despite the increase the shares closed 2p lower at 304p. Mr Trevor Finn, chief executive, said: 'New and used car profits, after-sales contributions and profits from the contract hire business, all showed improved results in 1993. Operating profits grew by 31 per cent to Pounds 8.99m (Pounds 6.87m). . Interest costs were flat at Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 1.64m). Buoyed by the general car market recovery, new car gross profits increased to Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 9.1m). Similarly the increased availability of nearly-new cars enabled the group to sell more used cars at higher margins. Overall used car gross profits increased by 82 per cent from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 4.2m. Firmer used car prices also helped lift the profitability of Pendragon's contract hire business, which turned in a 73 per cent gain in profits to Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 1.4m). Meanwhile the contribution from parts, service and body-shop activities  - the mainstay of profit growth throughout the recession - increased to Pounds 20.4m (Pounds 16.9m.) The group ended the year with net debt of Pounds 8.2m (Pounds 8.8m) representing gearing of 16 per cent. COMMENT Pendragon has used the proceeds of last year's Pounds 16.6m rights issue wisely, and now has the largest grouping of executive and luxury car franchises in the UK. Future growth is likely to come from adding franchises to existing sites, somewhat greater representation in the volume segment of the market and an expansion of the contract hire business. Meanwhile the upturn in the UK luxury market lagged the general upturn so Pendragon should see further benefits this year. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 9.2m are likely, pro-ducing earnings of 16.8p and a reasonable prospective p/e of about 18.1.</p>

Commenting on the issue, Presidential Press Secretary  Vyacheslav Kostikov pointed out that democrats, after denying  the party structure which had led to the arbitrary rule of the  Soviet Communist Party, started to realize that a "strong,  well-organized democratic party will guarantee development of  democracy and continuation of the reforms in Russia." On  possible interaction between this party and the Russian  president, Kostikov emphasized that the president was a  long-time democrat.    "Boris Yeltsin has determined his place in the history of  new  Russia primarily as a democrat. That is why an ideological  connection between the president and the democratically-oriented  party to be established is quite natural. This stems from the  president's whole policy," Kostikov remarked.    Different political groups currently argue who will receive  the "president's banner." According to Kostikov, this proves  that society has realized what strong political potential the  president has. Kostikov expressed his confidence that this  potential was applied in favor of democracy and contributed to  the development of reforms.    However, Kostikov pointed out that "democrats should take a  more active position towards the president, introducing  themselves as an active political force, friendly to Boris  Yeltsin and ready to support his policy."    Also participating in the meeting were Deputy Prime Minister  Anatoliy Chubays; Sergey Kovalev, a well-known fighter for human  rights; Yelena Bonner, widow of Academician Andrey Sakharov;  writer and Federation Council deputy Yuriy Chernichenko; actors  Zinoviy Gerdt, Mikhail Gluzskiy, and Mikhail Ulyanov; movie  director Rolan Bykov; satiric poet Aleksandr Ivanov; writer  Fazil Iskander; and others.</p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Where to find the best Festival fare - Nicholas Lander picks his favourite places to eat and drink in Edinburgh TO DISCOVER the restaurateur's view of life during the Edinburgh Festival I phoned Tim Cumming, chef-proprietor of the Vintners' Rooms, a man who had catered for festival goers at his previous restaurant in Bath. Was it, I asked him, the equivalent of two Christmases in a year? Better, came his prompt response. The festival lasts longer; because of the timing and the frequency of the performances customers hop from restaurant to restaurant as well as from event to event; corporate entertaining is rife. But the unique ingredient, he added, is the atmosphere. The only time Edinburgh had the same sense of carnival, he felt, was before, and after, a rugby international at Murrayfield. Visitors to the Edinburgh Festival obviously contribute to this ambience but in return they benefit from two elements particular to this city. The first is that the Edinburgh restaurant scene is an excellent example of an open market at work. This is a medium sized city with an unusually large number of restaurants, cafes and bars (I have never been anywhere with so many privately owned, personally run restaurants). Demand regulates price and, although there are expensive restaurants, I feel that in Edinburgh's restaurants, prices are lower overall and the price/quality ratio higher than anywhere else in Britain. The second factor in ensuring such good value for money owes more to history than economics. Perhaps because of the Auld Alliance and Edinburgh's long association with France, Edinburgh restaurant-goers demand quality. Like the French - but still unlike most of us long-suffering Brits - the burghers of this city vote with their feet: those places that become too expensive or unappreciative of their customers lose out to those places that are prepared to look after them better. For the restaurateurs, Edinburgh is a demanding market place; for the consumer, there are some certainly some wonderful treats. UNIQUELY EDINBURGH In the newly opened Traverse Theatre, Cambridge Street, close to the Lyceum Theatre and Usher Hall, a good looking bar in the basement with food and, on the ground floor, the Atrium restaurant with chef Andrew Radford (228-8882), and next door his sandwich bar, The Kiosk. (All numbers take an 031 prefix, the Edinburgh code). Les Partisans, (known by the locals as Les Patersons]) Royal Mile, (225-5144) great value food and wines; Cafe d'Odile, under the French Institute in Randolph Crescent but not licensed and lunch only (225-5366); The Doric, Market Street (225-1084), Le Marche Noir, Eyre Place (558-1608) for its wines too and Pierre Victoire, Victoria Street, (225-1721) for exceptionally low prices. Kelly's, West Richmond Street, (668-3847), has a strong local following. Leith, Edinburgh's harbour, offers a wide range: The Vintners' Rooms, (554-6767) where, in the candle-lit vaults, you can almost sense the ghost of Bonnie Prince Charlie; Marinette (555-0922) and Skippers (554-1018) for fish. The Waterfront, Dock Place, (554-7427) and The Shore Bar, (554-5080), The Shore, are two popular bars with good food and wines. ALL DAY EATING Maison Hector, Stockbridge (332-5328) for great soups and close by, Bell's Diner (225-8116) for the best hamburgers and bratburgers for the children; Cafe Florentin, (225-6267) St. Giles Street off the Royal Mile, open 24 hours during the Festival; Helios Fountain, a coffee house/ bookshop in the Grassmarket (229-7884) VEGETARIAN Kalpna, Patrick Square (667-9890) where a plate of Indian food from their lunchtime counter is about Pounds 3; Black Bo's, Blackfriars Street, (557-6136), just off the Royal Mile; the long-running Henderson's, Hanover Street (225-2131) and the recently opened Pierre Lapin, West Nicolson Street (668-4332). ETHNIC For distinctive Italian food, Pellicano (661-6914) at 110, Easter Road and Tinelli along the road at number 139 (652- 1392). More central, at 58 North Castle Street, is the more expensive Cosmo (226-6743). For Thai food Siam Erawan, 48, Howe Street (226-3675), Kris in Raeburn Place for Malaysian cooking (315-2200), Kweilin (557-1875) and Loon Fung (556-1781) for Chinese food. The Far Pavilions (332-3362), Shamiana (228-2265), Suruchi (556-6583), opposite the Empire Theatre and Monsoon (346-0204), complete with a beer list, for spicier Indian cooking. DRINKING The most elegant venue is still the Cafe Royal at the east end of Princes Street, complete with oyster bar. By the King's Theatre are Bennet's and The Golf Tavern; for draught Guinness and Murphys try the Barony Bar in Broughton Street. Great pubs include Mather's, Queensferry Road, The Cumberland Bar and the Bow Bar, with a huge range of malt whiskies, Kay's in Jamaica Street, the Canny Man's in Morningside Road and the aptly named Malt Shovel Inn, just off the Royal Mile. In Leith visit Tod's Tap in Bernard Street and/or treat yourself to a malt whisky tasting at the Scotch Malt Whisky Association, 87, Giles Street (031-554 3451). EXPENSIVE Martins, Rose St, North Lane (225-3106), particularly for his range of exciting Scottish cheeses; The Witchery, Castlehill (225-5613), and the Pompadour restaurant in the Caledonian Hotel (225-2433). L'Auberge, 58, St Mary's Street, (556-5888) offers better value at lunch than dinner. Finally, should you want to escape the 1.3m festival-goers, try to get a booking at La Potiniere in Gullane (0620-843214) a 45-minute drive west. Lunch Tuesday-Sunday, dinner Saturday only with one of the country's great, and most reasonably priced, wine lists.

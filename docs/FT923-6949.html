			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Dunedin Income to maintain dividend Over the six months to July 31, net asset value of Dunedin Income Growth Investment Trust fell by 6.6 per cent to 506.5p, but outperformed the relative indices. The 6 per cent discount to asset value was eliminated and turned into a 1 per cent premium. At the end of July 1991 the asset value stood at 596.7p. Net revenue in the half year fell to Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 4.77m), and earnings per share dropped to 11.96p (15p). However, the interim dividend is again 8.4p and the final will at least be maintained at 17p by drawing on reserves.</p>

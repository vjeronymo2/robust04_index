			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Echoes of Achilles haunt this ancient mystery: Kerin Hope investigates the evidence for a murder most foul AN ANCIENT whodunnit has a special fascination, particularly when the gentle scraping of an archaeologist's trowel unexpectedly reveals the murder victim. Nikos Stampolidis has been excavating an early Greek cemetery at Eleutherna, in the western foothills of Mount Ida on the island of Crete: 'a site full of surprises,' as he puts it. Not the least of these is a striking connection between his grisly find and a famous burial ceremony conducted outside Troy, the ancient city described in Homer's Iliad. The city of Eleutherna, built in a splendid defensive position on a long narrow hill cut off by a ravine on each side, flourished from the 11th century BC until the Romans conquered Crete. In the 1920s British archaeologists found several striking pieces of sculpture of the archaic period. When the University of Crete resumed excavations there in the mid-1980s, Doctor Stampolidis decided to dig on the steep western slope. He unearthed more statue fragments - some built into terracing for the olive groves which now cover the hill - suggesting that Eleutherna was an important centre of early Greek art. The leg of a finely carved 'kouros,' a nude figure of a young man, dates from the 6th century BC. It is made of local limestone, and would have stood almost six feet high. Four small, delicately worked ivory heads of figurines, perhaps gods or heroes, date from a century earlier. These were found in one of a bewildering array of burials in the cemetery, which was used by generations of city-dwellers from the 10th to the 6th century BC. Children were often buried in pithoi: Ali Baba-style jars used for storing oil or honey. Many adults ware cremated on funeral pyres built of neatly stacked logs of pine or cypress. Nikos Stampolidis says: 'They wore their best clothes and their jewellery; they were surrounded by offerings and household goods. Afterwards the bones were collected and cleaned, then preserved in a covered jar.' Last summer, while cleaning the remains of one pyre, the excavators revealed part of another, more extravagant cremation: 'a rich, important man, judging from the bones of goats and cattle and and a pair of ox horns that were found - all slaughtered for the burial.' From one side of the pyre came a surprising find: a curving line of human vertebrae. Beside it lay a whetstone, a perfume bottle and the neck of a broken water jar. The leg bones were burned, and the skull was missing. 'Instead we found a double-edged iron knife, broken. It would have been about 12 inches long.' Studies of the bones by Tina McGeorge, a British expert, showed that the headless man was about 40 years old and powerfully built. His spine was forced into an unnatural curve - apparently because his arms were tightly bound behind his back, perhaps with a piece of wood thrust in between, to pull back his head. His throat had been cut. 'The man was killed in a kneeling position, and fell on to his right side. I think his head was probably tossed on to the centre of the pyre.' Was it an expiatory sacrifice, an execution, or a ritual revenge killing? Stampolidis thinks the victim may have been a prisoner of war, executed at the funeral of the man he killed. From the style of the perfume bottle, the execution can be dated to about 725-700 BC. This was the period, some five centuries after the probable date of the Trojan war, when Homer's epic poems were written down. The execution remains discovered on Crete vividly recall the scene in the Iliad where Achilles, the Greek hero, buries his friend Patroclus on a huge funeral pyre, after slitting the throats of 'twelve noble sons of great-hearted Trojans' in revenge for his death. The ritual of execution in early Greece was elaborate. A virgin brought water in a jar to dampen the whetstone; the knife used to decapitate the victim had to be broken and immediately discarded. If Patroclus' burial is anything to go by, Nikos Stampolidis may find more human victims this summer when he uncovers the rest of the pyre. 'Perhaps we shouldn't be so surprised to discover that some of Homer's descriptions of the Trojan war were really drawn from contemporary Greek life.'</p>

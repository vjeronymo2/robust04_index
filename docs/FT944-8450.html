			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Laughing gas - Pick of Lex / A selection of comments from this week's FT Last year, British Gas was fighting tooth and nail to preserve its domestic monopoly; on Wednesday, it welcomed the promise in the Queen's speech to abolish that monopoly. The main reason for the change of heart is that Gas has convinced ministers to create a level playing field when the market is opened to competition. A demonstration of the new approach came next day when Gas announced price rises for late-paying customers but discounts for prompt-payers. Without such differential pricing, rivals would have been able to concentrate on profitable prompt-payers, leaving Gas with loss-making late-payers. Of course, when the monopoly goes, Gas's market share will fall, but the decline is unlikely to be rapid. If the development of competition in the telecoms market is anything to go by, a largish discount will be needed to convince customers to switch. But, given that all operators will face roughly the same charges for wholesale gas and transportation - which account for the bulk of total costs - rivals will struggle to undercut Gas. The new competition will also give Gas an added incentive to cut costs. This week's better than expected third-quarter results show the restructuring programme is already containing costs; in coming quarters, they should start to fall. More worrying for investors is next year's review of Gas's transportation price cap. The risk is that the regime will be tightened. But there are opportunities, too. The regulator is considering replacing the price cap with a mechanism for sharing excess profits with customers. That might lead to sharper falls in bills. But, if Gas also improved its performance, the quid pro quo would be higher profits.</p>

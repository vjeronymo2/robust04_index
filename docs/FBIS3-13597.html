			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by an "official source" at the Standing Committee </F> of the General People's Congress--date not given]    [Text] We, in the General People's Congress [GPC], and all  the honest sons of our Yemeni people and all their good unionist  nationalist forces, have believed that the final signing of the  pledge and accord document in the Jordanian capital, Amman, on  10 Ramadan [20 February], marked an end to the crisis based on  the text of the document, to the effect that the signing of the  document means an end to the crisis. We have also believed that  settling the crisis can only be achieved by turning a new leaf  of national accord, forgetting the past along with all its  negative points, and restoring cohesion to the Constitutional  institutions in the capital of the state of unity in order to  begin the implementation of the clause and provisions of the  document in accordance with the timetable and the mechanisms of  implementation included in the document.    Regrettably, as all the masses of our people know, we were  surprised that our brothers in the leadership of the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP], only few hours after the signing of the  document, began to escalate the crisis, militarily, and  politically. The military escalation was represented by suspect  military moves by the members dominating the YSP leadership  toward lofty Abyan Governorate without any justification.  Citizens in Abyan were also attacked, particularly in Mudiyah,  by the forces moved by the YSP from the Aden and Hadhramaut  governorates to Abyan Governorate. The military attack was only  stopped by sincere nationalist efforts that led to the joint  military committee taking an action, in accordance with an  authorization from the president, the GPC secretary general, and  the vice president, which was embodied by supervising the return  of all the military units to their positions which they were at  before 19 August 1993. The military repercussions abated, and  the military committee began the implementation of a great part  of its agenda.    The political escalation was represented by the YSP  leadership's refusal to return to Sanaa to assume their  responsibilities in order to achieve the cohesion of the  political leaderships with their various institutions. Instead  of doing so, they began to carry out divisionist actions, to  weaken the pledge and accord document, and to circumvent the  dialogue committee by setting new impossible and unilateral  conditions, demands, and concepts.    Today, we were all surprised by the YSP leaderships adopting  a new serious course of escalating the crisis politically and  militarily. The commander of the central axis in Shabwah, along  with the YSP organization's first secretary, issued a warning to  the brothers Colonel Dirhim 'Abduh Nu'man, Shabwah governor, and  Colonel Ahmad 'Ali Muhsin, director of the Shabwah security  department, to quickly leave their offices in the governorate  and to return to Sanaa, considering this a party decision, or,  otherwise, they shall be held responsible for rejecting this  decision.    As the brother governor and the brother director of  security represented the Constitutional institutions in the  region and as decisions to appoint and relieve them are usually  made by these institutions and not by the party, they rejected  that threat-like warning. On Wednesday morning, the residents  of the city of 'Ataq, the capital of the governorate, were  surprised when they saw a column of tanks and armored vehicles  of units commanded by the renegade and separatist forces in the  YSP besiege the governor's office, the Security Directorate, and  the entrances to the city with a group of hireling agents led by  Ahmad Bin-Farid al-Suraymah. The siege was an attempt to put  pressure on these officials.    While the GPC regrets annoying our people's sons, who are  still enjoying the blessed 'Id al-Fitr holiday, with this  disturbing news, it wants to put the people's masses and all its  political forces in the picture of what is going on so that they  can see by themselves the complicity of the YSP's separatist  forces in carrying out the separatist plans.    The GPC leaders in Shabwah informed the Military Committee  of  this regrettable development and urged it to move quickly to  lift the siege imposed on the city of 'Ataq, the governor's  office, and the Security Directorate; to quickly withdraw the  military units taking part in this escalation; and to punish  those responsible for sending them. The GPC leadership in  Shabwah also urged the Military Committee to withdraw the  military units that are still stationed in Shabwah to their  original bases in Hadhramaut Governorate and al- Mahrah  Governorate.    The responsible source added: Thus, it is clear that every  time the crisis approached a detente, the YSP aggravated the  situation. It has also become clear through the YSP's recent  behavior that it is planning to get rid of officials who  represent the Constitutional legitimacy in the eastern and  southern governorates and to tighten its iron fist on these  governorates, which have become a stumbling block in the face of  its separatist plans.    We in the GPC condemn this behavior and urge the unionist  leaders in the YSP to stop these practices, which harm the party  in its capacity as a principal partner in the unity, as well as  unity itself. We also warn the adventurous and influential  leaders in the YSP against continuing their provocations and  escalations, and we hold them fully responsible for the  consequences of their separatist behaviors. We urge the masses  that protest in the various governorates and subdistricts to  denounce this new escalation by the YSP.</p>

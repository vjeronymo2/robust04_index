			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / High returns from a steep slope: Rich pickings from the US yield curve While Europe is nervously eyeing the higher German discount rate, US financiers are rejoicing in exceptionally low short-term interest rates. Since US long-term rates remain high, the 'yield curve' which plots the pattern of interest rates is the steepest in living memory - and it is proving a godsend to financial institutions and others with the capital to exploit it. The yield curve, a graphical depiction of interest rates on securities with varying maturities, has steepened sharply in the past year for two reasons - concern about the massive US budget deficit, and fear that the Federal Reserve's easing of monetary policy might revive inflationary pressures in the economy. Consequently, Treasury investors have been reluctant to push long-term yields down as far or as fast as short-term returns. The market believes the Fed has dropped its inflation guard, and has decided to do the Fed's job of damping inflationary pressures with relatively high long-term rates. Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist with Nikko Securities in New York, says: 'The market has its foot on the brake harder than the Fed has its foot on the accelerator.' By keeping its foot on the brake, the market has held the yield on the 30-year bond at 7.7 per cent, while the Fed's accelerator has pushed the yield on three-month Treasury bills down to 3.3 per cent. The spread between the two of 440 basis points is unprecedented. The previous record spread was 200 basis points in late 1976 and early 1977. While the stubbornly steep yield curve has annoyed the Fed, which wants lower rates at both ends of the market to stimulate economic activity, financial institutions have rushed to take advantage of the wide spread between short and long rates. Commercial banks have been keen manipulators of the steep yield curve, as shown by their active buying in the past year of longer-dated Treasury securities. Banks have borrowed in the short-term Fed funds market, where rates on interbank loans range from below 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent, to pay for three-year to seven-year Treasury notes that yield between 4.7 per cent and 6.3 per cent. Wall Street's securities houses have also reaped the rewards of lower funding costs. Like banks, they have been borrowing short to buy long. One chief financial officer (CFO) at a big Wall Street bond house agrees the best way to exploit the steep yield curve is to fund short. 'You buy one-year US government securities and fund them overnight in the repo (repurchase) market, using the government securities as collateral,' he says, thereby exploiting the 200 basis-point spread between the rate on the one-year notes and on the overnight loans. The CFO says the yield curve is so steep that 'it's desirable to fund short regardless of maturity'. The risk of doing so, of course, is that short-term interest rates could climb sharply over the next year and wipe out the extra yield available on the longer-dated asset. That, however, is unlikely in the current economic and political climate. Few expect interest rates to go up for at least six to 10 months. 'It's as close to being without risk as you can get', says the Wall Street CFO. Institutional investors have also been able to take advantage of the steep yield curve, although rather than raising interest rate risk by switching between the bottom and the top of the curve, investors have concentrated on the smaller, but still profitable, spreads between securities closer together on the yield curve. Mr Michael Gray, fixed-income portfolio manager at Fidelity, the biggest US investment fund group, says it makes sense to switch into longer-dated paper if you think short-term interest rates will continue to decline. He says: 'You can extend your duration modestly, but not increase the risk because of the steepness of the yield curve.' Fidelity's quantitative research department has calculated the financial impact of a Treasury fund switching out of 6-month bills (yielding 3.32 per cent) into two-year notes (yielding 4.23 per cent) for six months. Instead of earning a 1.65 per return on the bills, the fund would enjoy a 2.75 per cent return, a 110 basis points difference. For a Dollars 100m fund, that would bring in an extra Dollars 1.1m. Moreover, the additional risk taken on by moving up the yield curve is not particularly great, calculates Fidelity. The fund would only lose out if interest rates rose 85 basis points during the period. Economists believe the steep yield curve is here for some time. Mr Steve Slifer, chief bond economist at Shearson Lehman, says the curve will not flatten until the market is convinced that the Fed has stopped easing. Such a shift in sentiment will not happen until the economic recovery has built up a clear head of steam, which means the yield curve will probably continue to look more like a mountain incline and less like a hilly slope well into next year.</p>

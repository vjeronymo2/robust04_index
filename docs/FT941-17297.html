			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Lottery - a route to riches, and honours Sir, The lottery for the people which Mr John Major, the prime minister, so heartily endorsed is at risk. Money which should go to the arts, sports and environment may be so whittled down as to become ridiculously small. This could be a betrayal of all that we and so many others have fought for. The fundamental point about equity or debt capital for lotteries, which your editorial ('Charity lottery', December 20) and Richard Branson's letter (December 23) do not address is that the capital can be repaid within months of start-up. Guy Simonis (British Columbia Lottery Corporation) is a leading lottery expert. On December 9 he outlined in a London seminar how his 20-year-old lottery now achieves the maximum gains from its Dollars 240 per capita per annum input: 'We are freed at start-up from the obligation to pay profits immediately for some months. Therefore we could pay off suppliers without loans or advances. We didn't have to borrow money to pay the beneficiary. The enormous cash flow provided the financing we required. The bank found it a silly arrangement.' He also saves expenses by running his own facilities management system. If the UK government and all the bidders adopt this simple wisdom, our lottery will be for the people and not for super-profiteers. The profit from handling Pounds 4bn or Pounds 5bn a year is a handsome stimulus for any operator and bank. The super-profits from equity capital do not enhance the image of those who propose them, and risk convincing the world that the government is not sincere in its aims to maximise funds to the good causes.

			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UCI COMES CLOSE, BUT SUCCUMBS TO PACIFIC  </P> <P> A victory for UC Irvine was dangling there, closer than at any time in recent  weeks, against the University of the Pacific Saturday night.  </P> <P> A Bren Center crowd of 1,823 sensed a victory was close at hand. The Anteaters  seemed to sense it too. Even Pacific appeared worried it would be the team that  lost to Irvine.  </P> <P> In the end, Irvine blew a 14-point lead that it had built in the first half,  missed two shots in the final five seconds and lost, 76-75.  </P> <P> Irvine, losers of 12 consecutive games but playing as well as it has all  season, trailed Pacific by a point. Five seconds remained as the Anteaters  inbounded the ball at midcourt following a timeout.  </P> <P> The Anteaters' Dylan Rigdon, who had made six of 10 shots from the field,  including five of eight three-pointers, took the pass and dribbled toward the  basket. Rigdon, a freshman guard, pulled up 10 feet from the basket and  launched an awkward-looking jump shot with the Tigers' Dell Demps hounding him  and three seconds left.  </P> <P> The ball clanged off the back of the rim and into the hands of Jeff Von Lutzow,  whose hurried follow hit the side of the backboard at the buzzer.  </P> <P> And Irvine (2-18 overall, 0-11 in the Big West Conference) had lost its 13th  consecutive game.  </P> <P> "I think I should have taken it to the hole instead of pulling up," Rigdon  said. "I was counting in my head. I had a good idea (how much time was left)."  </P> <P> The play was designed to go to Rod Palmer, Rigdon said, "but they took it away,  so I cut to the ball.  </P> <P> "I'm sure I'll be thinking about this for days, weeks, months."  </P> <P> Rigdon had a career-high 22 points as Irvine seemed primed for its first  victory since a 75-62 triumph over San Diego State Dec. 16.  </P> <P> The Anteaters built a season-high 14-point lead, 30-16, after a dunk by Von  Lutzow with 5:10 left in the first half.  </P> <P> But Pacific (12-8, 5-6) chipped away and trailed at halftime, 35-33.  </P> <P> The lead changed hands in the second half with Pacific taking the lead for  good, 68-67, on Demps' three-pointer with 3:36 left.  </P> <P> Later, Irvine cut the lead to 76-75 on a three-pointer by Rigdon with 11  seconds left. The Anteaters then fouled Anthony Woods, who missed a  one-and-one, setting up Rigdon's unsuccessful shot.  </P> <P> "We stole that game," said Demps, who had 26 points on 11-of-14 shooting from  the field. "They (the Anteaters) were winning practically the whole game. They  played well enough to win."  </P> <P> Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan has grown weary of that familiar refrain.  </P> <P> "That's nine of 11 (Big West) games we should have won," he said. "It's the  same old B.S. Nobody wants to hear that . . . "  </P> <P> Then, picking up steam, he said, "It's like, 'How are we gonna lose this one?'  </P> <P> "They blow the one-and-one. I thought we got a pretty good shot and everybody  in the arena thought Rigdon got fouled. Notice I didn't say I thought he was  fouled."  </P> <P> The last-second play was executed well enough, Mulligan said.  </P> <P> "The ball ended up with a guy who's a big-time free throw shooter and who makes  three-point shots in games."  </P> <P> Three other Anteaters scored in double figures. Palmer added 17 points, Von  Lutzow 14 and Ricky Butler 11.  </P> <P> Pacific's Don Lyttle had 19 points and Daryl Wolfe added 16.  </P> <P> Anteater Notes  </P> <P> This date in Anteater history or where have all the good times gone? A year  ago, playing before a sellout crowd of 5,000 at the Bren Center, Irvine rallied  from nine points to beat Nevada Las Vegas, 99-98. Ricky Butler had a then  career-high 25 points, hitting 17 of 19 free throws. Jeff Herdman added 24  points as the Anteaters shot 76% from the field in the second half, 56% for the  game. The Anteaters also made 36 of 43 (84%) from the line. The victory gave  Irvine an 8-12 record on the way to a 12-17 finish.  </P> <P> If the season ended today, Irvine and Pacific would play in the opening round  of the Big West tournament March 7.  </P></p>

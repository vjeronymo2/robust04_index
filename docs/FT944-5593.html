			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: Telefonica to divide group into eight companies The deregulation of the telecommunications sector has prompted Telefonica, Spain's government-controlled operator, into a far-reaching reorganisation that will divide the group into eight specialised companies. The move will also give Telefonica the possibility of floating off parts of the group, which is 32 per cent owned by the government with a further 20 per cent held by foreign institutions. The reorganisation, which will be completed before the industry's liberalisation in 1998, will create separate units dealing with basic telephones, international communications, data transmission, mobile phones, public phones, international business, publicity and information, and multimedia. The development will lend an increased transparency to Telefonica's business. It has been designed to prevent units where the group continues to hold a monopoly, such as basic telephony, subsidising others, such as data transmission, which has already been liberalised, and mobile telephony, where Telefonica will soon be competing with a second operator. The government is reviewing rival bids, one backed by the UK's Vodafone and the other by AirTouch, a US telecoms group, to develop a second pan-European GSM (global system of mobile communications) digital network to compete with one which will be installed by Telefonica. The second licence is to be awarded before the end of the year. 'As the reorganisation takes root, the Telefonica companies might want to tap the markets individually,' Mr Pedro Gonzalez Ahijado, chief analyst at Madrid securities firm AB Asesores said. 'There will be nothing to prevent the group disposing of part or all of its yellow pages unit, for example, if it wants to.' Along with the data transmission and mobile telephony units, one of the first business areas to be moved into a separate company will be multimedia. The government has already drafted a cable television law to allow the private sector into multimedia and, as with the GSM network, one cable licence has been reserved for Telefonica.</p>

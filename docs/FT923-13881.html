			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Tribunal upholds dockers' complaint BOTH sides claimed victory yesterday when the Employment Appeal Tribunal delivered judgment on the legal battle between the Port of London Authority and 19 dockers sacked in 1989 at Tilbury. The 65-page judgment broadly upheld the dockers' complaint of unfair dismissal for being union activists, but overturned an industrial tribunal order that the authority re-engage 12 of the men. It said the tribunal had erred in law in making the order. The dockers began action against the authority for unfair dismissal in August 1989. The industrial tribunal sat for 198 days - the longest UK hearing. The dockers were sacked after a dispute over the abolition of the National Dock Labour Scheme - the agreement that covered their minimum terms and conditions - and the subsequent decision by employers to abandon national collective bargaining. The tribunal said the question of responsibility for the 'appalling industrial relations' was not 'one coloured black and white' but 'the clearest possible case of shades of grey'. A majority of the tribunal said the membership of some of the dockers of the National Port Shop Stewards Committee pointed to 'obvious militancy' and said the sole purpose of the committee was 'as a tool in the militant domination of working practices at Tilbury.' The case has been sent back to another industrial tribunal so that compensation for unfair dismissal can be reconsidered. The authority was given leave to appeal.</p>

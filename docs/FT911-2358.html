			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / UK Company News: Norton launches probe into US and German arms FOLLOWING the resignation of Mr James Tildesley as chairman and chief executive of Norton Group on Friday, the revamped board has launched an investigation into the US and German subsidiaries. Norton said yesterday that 'strenuous inquiries' were being made into the financial and trading position of Pro-Fit Piping, in the US, and FUS, the German subsidiary. The Pounds 8.2m purchase of FUS, a fasteners maker, caused controversy because the vendor was a Channel Islands trust company set up to benefit Mr Tildesley's offspring. His former company, PSM, had founded the German business and a poorly supported Pounds 6.5m rights issue to help complete the purchase had a troubled conclusion in January. The company, which is best known for its motorcycle business, is being investigated by the Department of Trade and and Industry. Its shares were suspended at 18p on April 1 because of a delay in publishing results for the six months to October 31.</p>

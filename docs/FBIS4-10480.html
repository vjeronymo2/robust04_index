			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Valparaiso -- Following a heated debate, the  Coalition of Parties for Democracy [CPPD] on 23 March received  the minority in 16 of 17 Senate committees in relation to the  opposition and the government-appointed senators.    The Senate committees were constituted during a voting  session. All the committees were constituted with two CPPD  senators, two from the opposition, and one government-appointed  senator.    This result was described by several senators as "a great  defeat" for the CPPD and "a great triumph" for the center right  (Unity for the Progress of Chile) in the Senate. Also within the  CPPD, the bloc formed by the PS [Socialist Party], PPD [Party  for Democracy], and PR [Radical Party] was strengthened to the  PDC [Christian Democratic Party]'s detriment.    During the first legislative term, the CPPD obtained the  majority in five committees (defense, labor, government,  finance, and mining).    On 23 March, the CPPD obtained a majority only in the  Finance  Committee, which is considered a "key" issue for the  government's economic administration.    This majority was decided by a coin toss that favored PDC  Senator Andres Zaldivar, who was tied with government-appointed  Senator Carlos Letelier with 30 votes each. (The committees are  made up of five members, but in this case there were six  candidates).    The other committee members are Jorge Lavandero (PDC), who  obtained 36 votes; Sebastian Pinera (RN) [National Renewal], 35  votes; Francisco Javier Errazuriz (UCC) [Center-Center Union],  35 votes; and Carlos Ominami (PS), 34 votes.    The chairmen of each committee will be elected by their own  members during the first week of April when they meet to agree  on their work methods.    It was learned on 23 March that the right will offer the  CPPD  the presidency of the Labor and Defense Committees (to Arturo  Frei in the latter case). The government-appointed senators will  preside over two or three committees; the independents will  preside over one or two; the RN will preside over seven or eight  committees; the UCC will preside over one; and the Independent  Democratic Union [UDI] will preside over two.    The CPPD senators believe the 23 March voting session  changes  the balance that existed during the last four years and has  turned the official bloc into "a minority in all the committees."    This is a "real change" in the political reality and a fact  that will have consequences in the Senate's future work, the  CPPD senators said.    They said that by joining the committees from which they  were  left out before 1990, the government-appointed senators left out  the CPPD senators. They also pointed out that the  government-appointed senators have constituted a new political  bloc.    The opposition (RN-UDI-UCC) senators believe the new  distribution of posts is the result of "a perfect balance" of  harmony and unity in the center right and also the logical  result of the parties' representation in the Senate.

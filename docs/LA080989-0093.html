			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMPCO-PITTSBURGH ACQUIRES STAKE IN MIDWAY AIRLINES  </P> <P> Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp., an engineering company, said Tuesday that it has  acquired a 6.6% stake in Midway Airlines Inc. with the possible view toward  acquiring it, a move that could spark a bidding war for the regional airline.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh-based Ampco, which has recently undergone a major streamlining, said  it currently has no plans to acquire Chicago-based Midway, but that it may be  interested in some type of merger.  </P> <P> Analysts said the announcement may spur other interested parties to come  forward as well. "Midway is in play. Who knows what will happen if the right  offer comes along?" Louis Marckesano, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott  Inc., said.  </P> <P> The price of Midway stock rose $1.50 a share to close at $20.50 on the New York  Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Midway Airlines said in a statement that Ampco-Pittsburgh had not contacted it  in connection with the investment.  </P> <P> But it said it was aware that Ampco had notified the Securities and Exchange  Commission of the stock purchases, which were made between July 25 and Aug. 3  at prices ranging from $14.625 to $18 a share.  </P></p>

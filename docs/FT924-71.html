			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Mixed feelings over the single market: Andrew Jack looks at why some companies are grumbling about EC changes CUSTOMS and Excise officials have been gathering in an ageing tower block at Southend in the past few months to prepare the statistical systems needed for the single European market. Meanwhile, in a newly built office in Newry, Northern Ireland, staff re-allocated from the border with the republic are starting work on the administration of the value added tax procedures which will be required from tomorrow. In the 22 VAT collection regions around the country investigations officers have been added to strengthen controls against smuggling, fraud and tax evasion. In spite of all these preparations the single market - and Customs as its frontline representative - has been the subject of significant grumbling by a number of companies. Many appear unaware, even now, of the changes which will be required. Others have received blank stares or conflicting advice from trade associations and consultants. Still more have been waiting for details to be announced. From tomorrow border controls for traders with other EC countries will be abolished. The old statistical document with 54 questions which had to be presented at each frontier will be no more. In its place businesses will have to complete two new boxes on their VAT returns, giving the value of imports or exports to other EC states. Those for which either figure exceeds Pounds 35,000 for the year will be required to file monthly statistical forms and regular sales-listing forms to Customs. Those likely to find the transition most painful are the businesses just above this threshold - too large to escape the extra requirements, too small to have dedicated staff to deal with them. Many see the new burdens without appreciating the benefits of increased speed at border crossings because they used to delegate this administration to customs agents. Meanwhile, the lack of detail has stalled final preparations. The commodity code directories required to complete the new statistical forms and the final document listing new procedures for businesses were distributed in the past few weeks. Customs has taken the blame for the slow progress of its political masters. It was only in mid-December that EC finance ministers drew up agreements dealing with the treatment of antiques and yachts, for example. At that time they initialled a simplification directive on the subject of 'triangulation' by which a company in one EC country supplies a customer in a second state through a sub-contractor in a third. Some accountants argue that its interpretation remains unclear. Privately, Customs officials express despair at the attitude of many businesses - accusing them of being far more eager to criticise the changes than to embrace the opportunities of the single market. They also say that there has been some self-interested scaremongering by consultants and computer suppliers hoping to generate extra business. They argue that businesses have managed to cope with substantial changes to the tax system before now. They stress that the UK has fought with other member states to reduce the burdens on business. The number of questions on the new statistical form has been kept to a minimum, and the proportion of companies required to file them has been cut to far lower levels than in other EC states. Customs has completed personal visits to almost all the 30,000 traders affected by the new procedures, in addition to an extensive programme over many months of distributing publicity material and hosting presentations. That compares favourably with the position elsewhere. Mr Peter Wilmott, head of the EC Commission's indirect tax and customs directorate, admits that there has been a significant 'information gap' in some member states. 'It has been difficult to get firms to listen, but many member states have not made enough effort,' he says. In the past few weeks countries such as Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece have redoubled their efforts to notify businesses of the changes required. 'Nobody believes we will have all the rules and that firms will know what they are meant to be doing on January 1,' he says. 'Until you test it, you can't be sure.'</p>

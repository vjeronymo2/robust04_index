			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: BCE moves on Teleglobe CANADA'S telecommunications company, BCE, is near its goal of winning control of Teleglobe, the overseas telephone and data monopoly. BCE cannot, by law, own more than one-third of Teleglobe, a regulated utility. It now has four directors in Teleglobe's boardroom, and for two years has tried to arrange alliances with other large shareholders to oust Teleglobe's management. It fears Teleglobe in non-friendly hands could divert heavy overseas voice and data traffic to competitive systems, including US companies. BCE owns the largest telecommunications utility, Bell Canada, and, with several other telephone companies, effectively runs the domestic system. The battle came to a head yesterday at a Teleglobe board meeting. Following an alliance with directors representing other big Teleglobe share-holders, BCE succeeded in getting Mr Charles Sirois appointed Teleglobe chief executive. He is thought to be friendly to BCE. Mr Sirois will head a president's office at Teleglobe, and a new board of directors will be proposed at Teleglobe's annual meeting this spring.</p>

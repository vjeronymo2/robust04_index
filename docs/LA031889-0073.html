			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZIEGLER PROVIDES A GOOD EXAMPLE IN PROBERT CASE  </P> <P> NHL president John Ziegler does not rule his sport with the authority of the  other three major sports commissioners, but at times his decisions are  noteworthy.  </P> <P> The recent expulsion of Detroit Red Wing all-star Bob Probert is a good  example. Probert used drugs, was caught and removed from the game. Unlike other  sports that try to work with the athletes, the NHL respects the players and  treats them as normal people. Namely, abuse drugs and you'll be excused from  your livelihood.  </P> <P> No slaps on the wrist for three-time offenders as in the NBA and major league  baseball.  </P> <P> ANDREW JAMNER  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

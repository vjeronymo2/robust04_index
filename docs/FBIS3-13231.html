The sources noted that  the meeting was held to reorganize relations between these  groups in light of current developments in the wake of the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron.    The sources added that an agreement was reached at this  meeting, which was chaired by Faysal al-Husayni as the head of  the Fatah Movement in the West Bank, that stipulated the revival  of the Unified National Leadership of the Intifadah. They said  that agreement was also reached on reformulating national unity  on the basis of the struggle [against the Israeli occupation]  and within the framework of firm Palestinian principles.    They also noted that collective action will be taken to  support the PLO command's suspension of the peace process in  protest of the Hebron massacre and linkage of the resumption of  negotiations to the drawing up of new rules and bases that will  ensure the removal of the existing settlements in the occupied  territories.    The Palestinian sources expressed their belief that the  Palestinian groups' representatives might soon reach an  agreement, according to which the Population Front for the  Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the  Liberation of Palestine will return to the PLO establishments  and leadership bodies.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PACS FUND OVER 50% OF BENTLEY RACE  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Carol Bentley has collected more than half of her campaign  contributions for her state Senate race from political action committees,  according to a financial disclosure form filed by the El Cajon Republican on  Friday.  </P> <P> Of the $118,328 in cash and contributions that Bentley has raised this year,  the form shows, $61,550 -- or 52% -- came from PACs, or registered  special-interest lobbying groups. But, as of last Saturday, less than three  weeks before the Dec. 5 special election, Bentley had only $7,353 in cash on  hand, the form shows.  </P> <P> The disclosure forms, which show all campaign contributions and expenditures  made from Oct. 22 to Nov. 18, were due at the San Diego County registrar's  office on Friday. But Bentley's opponent, Assemblywoman Lucy Killea (D-San  Diego), failed to meet the deadline. According to the registrar's office, she  will be charged $10 for each day she is late. It wasn't known why Killea missed  the deadline.  </P> <P> Political observers had wondered whether the recent actions of San Diego's  Roman Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher might prompt a surge in donations for Killea  and Bentley. On Nov. 15, Maher barred Killea from receiving Communion because  of her pro-choice stand on abortion, putting the spotlight on Killea, who  appeared on the CBS This Morning and Donahue shows this week.  </P> <P> Kathy Krause, a spokeswoman for the Killea campaign, said Friday that as a  result of the publicity surrounding Maher's action, "there has been an increase  in last-minute contributions. We've been inundated with lots of small  contributions."  </P> <P> David Lewis, Bentley's campaign consultant, said Bentley's fund raising has  "remained strong throughout. We've seen no decline." The disclosure forms filed  Friday, he pointed out, include only three days after Maher's directive.  </P> <P> Bentley, whose campaign slogan calls her a "real Republican," received  significant contributions from the building and construction industry, her  disclosure form shows.  </P> <P> Six of the 38 PACs that donated to Bentley's campaign represented builders or  building suppliers, such as the Timber Assn. of California. When added to the  contributions from private construction and lumber companies, these gifts made  up nearly 15% of Bentley's funds to date -- $17,300.  </P> <P> Another, less influential group made a visible, though not very lucrative,  showing in Bentley's behalf: foot doctors. Of the 19 doctors who made private  contributions to her campaign, 14 were podiatrists who gave an average of $143  each. They were joined by the Downtown San Diego Podiatry Group, which gave  $100.  </P> <P> "They supported her in her Assembly race, and they're continuing to support her  now," said Lewis, adding that he doesn't know whether Bentley has sponsored any  legislation that might affect podiatrists.  </P> <P> Of the $86,460 Bentley's campaign spent from Oct. 22 to Nov. 18, more than 59%  -- $51,272 -- was spent on campaign literature and advertising. Another $8,566  -- nearly 10% -- was spent on surveys and fund raising.  </P></p>

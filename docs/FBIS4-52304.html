			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Cambodian Second Prime  Minister Hun Sen expressed opposition Tuesday [10 May] to  holding certain meetings outside Cambodia and holding a general  election to end the conflict between the government and the  Khmer Rouge, Foreign Ministry officials said. Hun Sen told  Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata that he is opposed to the  idea of holding a meeting in Jakarta or Paris to discuss  problems involving the Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who refuse to  accept Phnom Penh's authority, the officials said.    He was quoted as saying such a meeting may give the Khmer  Rouge a chance to break the 1991 Paris Peace Accord. He also  said the problem should be solved by the Cambodian people  themselves.    The officials said, however, that it is not clear whether  Hun  Sen was referring to a roundtable meeting or other international  conferences.    Hun Sen, in Japan since Monday to attend a meeting of the  Socialist International, also said another general election  proposed by Cambodian King Sihanouk cannot be held due to  Constitutional limits stipulating a five-year term for  parliamentarians.    Sihanouk suggested last week a new election be held with the  participation of the Khmer Rouge to end the fighting.    The Khmer Rouge boycotted the U.N.-sponsored general  election  last May despite its signing of the Paris Peace Accord in 1991.    Hun Sen told Hata he is well aware that King Sihanouk is  offering various ideas to achieve peace in Cambodia.    The Cambodian co-premier also called for a Japanese role in  improving Cambodia's relations with Thailand, which have soured  in recent weeks regarding the Western town of Pailin, a  stronghold of the Khmer Rouge about a dozen kilometers east of  the frontier with Thailand.    Cambodian Government troops occupied the guerrilla  headquarters at Pailin in March but the Khmer Rouge recaptured  it in April.    Cambodia has strongly protested to Thailand about forcibly  repatriating 25,000 Cambodian refugees into Khmer Rouge-held  areas without informing Phnom Penh.    Hun Sen told Hata although relations with the Thai  Government  are good, there are some elements in the Thai military and some  entrepreneurs who have not stopped business with the Khmer  Rouge, the officials said.    Hata told Hun Sen he has been telling Thai leaders that  friendly ties with Cambodia are important and has been urging  them not to obstruct efforts to achieve peace in Cambodia, they  said.    Turning to bilateral affairs, Hun Sen called on Japanese  companies to invest in his country, saying Cambodia's economic  development achieved by receiving aid will in turn solve the  problems of the Khmer Rouge.    Hata was quoted as saying he will call on Japanese companies  to invest there but that he hopes Cambodia will make efforts to  bring about peace.    Japan intends to cooperate as much as possible to that end,  Hata was quoted as saying.</p>

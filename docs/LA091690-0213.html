			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RETURN TO MORAZAN  </P> <P> "The Return to Morazan," by Patrick McDonnell, is an accurate chronicle of what  has happened to the thousands of displaced Salvadorans in the civil war. What  is omitted, however, is whose interests the fighting serves.  </P> <P> El Salvador is an oligarchy in which 90% of the land is owned by 2% of the  population. It is an agrarian economy, and the major export crop is coffee. If  free enterprise were allowed in which average Salvadorans could become  entrepreneurs growing their own coffee on their own land, the ruling oligarchy  would be forced to give up its near-feudal privileges. It is to maintain these  privileges that the war is being waged.  </P> <P> Here in North America we can help to bring democracy, peace, justice and free  enterprise to that battered country by refusing to support the coffee oligarchs  by not purchasing coffee from El Salvador. Sixty percent of El Salvador's  coffee is exported to the United States and can be found in Folgers, MJB,  Sanborn &amp; Chase, Nescafe and Maxwell House. Boycotting Salvadoran coffee is  the right thing for Americans to do.  </P> <P> Our nation was conceived in liberty, therefore, we have an obligation to not  support despotism. If El Salvador's feudal oligarchy cannot afford its  privileges because of market pressure from the United States, it will be forced  to reform.  </P> <P> DANA HOHN  </P> <P> ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR,  </P> <P> CENTRAL AMERICAN INFORMATION CENTER  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

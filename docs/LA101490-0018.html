			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SOLAR CAR SLOWLY GETS UP TO SPEED;  </P> <P> ENERGY: THE VEHICLE IS SMALL AND UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT IT IS A NATIONAL CHAMPION  IN ITS CATEGORY.  </P> <P> Today's state-of-the-art solar car resembles a waist-high, bright yellow  tadpole that is 20 feet long. Getting in without breaking it is an adventure,  and only one person will fit.  </P> <P> Taking such a vehicle home from the showroom isn't likely to be possible soon.  The price comes to about $650,000, without $350,000 worth of computers and  other ancillary equipment.  </P> <P> But the University of Michigan's Sunrunner has one thing going for it: It's a  national champion in solar speed, and it's headed for an international test on  the roadways of Australia next month.  </P> <P> In July, the Sunrunner and 31 other solar-powered cars built by student teams  raced from Disney World in central Florida to General Motors Corp.'s Technical  Center in the Detroit suburb of Warren. The Sunrunner, traveling by day only,  won the 1,641-mile race in 72 hours, 50 minutes and 47 seconds. Its average  speed was 22.5 m.p.h.  </P> <P> GM is entering the Sunrunner and other top finishers in the 1990 World Solar  Challenge. In all, 43 cars from 10 countries will compete in the 1,863-mile  race race from Darwin, on Australia's northern coast, to Adelaide on the south  coast.  </P> <P> For the race, which starts Nov. 11, the Sunrunner team hopes to attain an  average speed of 32 m.p.h.  </P> <P> To take the car out for a test drive at the Michigan International Speedway  recently, industrial engineer Paula Finnegan had to buckle on a safety harness  and have a colleague boost her up into the open top of the car. Inside, she  balanced on the aluminum-tubing skeleton and a hammock-like seat slung in the  frame.  </P> <P> She then threaded her legs through the jungle-gym-like tubing to reach the  accelerator and brake pedals, reclined in the seat, buckled on safety straps  and donned a headset with microphone.  </P> <P> The Sunrunner still wasn't ready. Three people then gingerly lifted its floppy  plastic canopy from the ground, lowered it over Finnegan and sealed it in place  with bright yellow tape.  </P> <P> During test laps on a mostly sunny day with thin, high clouds, the car reached  23 m.p.h. To go faster or to climb, the Sunrunner's circuitry draws power from  a battery. At slower speeds or going downhill, it stores excess power from the  solar cells back into the batteries.  </P> <P> In bright sunlight, the solar cells produce about 1,200 watts, enough to power  a toaster oven, hair dryer, or the 500-pound Sunrunner. Cloudy weather can cut  the power to 300 to 400 watts, enough for a bright light bulb.  </P> <P> A 1.5-horsepower. electric motor the size of a coffee can powers the car via  chain drive on one of the 26-inch mountain-bike wheels.  </P> <P> There's a slot through which to view the road ahead and a rear-facing,  fiber-optic viewer that allows the driver to get an idea of what's behind.  </P> <P> Two ports in the front of the cockpit bring in fresh air. "The drivers said it  wasn't too bad as long as they kept moving," said Mike McAlear, strategist for  the team.  </P> <P> For now, electric cars will have to rely on batteries. Solar cells and motors  must be made more efficient before energy straight from sunlight will be able  to propel a car faster than 30 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Solar cars, therefore, aren't on the verge of becoming a practical alternative  for commuting, Finnegan said.  </P> <P> "Not any time in the near future -- but with improved technology, it can  happen."  </P></p>

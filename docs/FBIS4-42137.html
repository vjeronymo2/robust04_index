			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has said that a new era  condoning the changing of borders and the gaining of territories  through the use of force will begin in the world unless the  Azerbaijani territories occupied by Armenia are returned.  Addressing a meeting in Ankara marking the independence and  freedom day of Azerbaijan, Demirel expressed his views on the  developments in the region.    In his speech, Demirel explained that the Azerbaijanis are  trying, on one hand, to improve their economic situation, and,  on the other hand, to recover their territories from the  Armenians through the use of international diplomacy. Pointing  out that the developments in this region concern the entire  world in addition to Azerbaijan and Turkey, the president  stressed that Turkey does not want relations based on enmity  with its neighbors.    [Begin Demirel recording] We said to the Armenians:  Whatever happened in the past, we cannot live in the past. If  you want to live here, then you must improve your relations with  Azerbaijan. As long as you are in conflict with Azerbaijan, you  will be in conflict with Turkey. Moreover, if you are in  conflict with both Azerbaijan and Turkey, then you cannot live  here.

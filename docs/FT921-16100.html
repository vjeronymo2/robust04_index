			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Opec catches a winter chill: Deborah Hargreaves says tough decisions lie ahead for oil exporters When ministers from the world's leading oil-exporting nations meet in Geneva in six weeks, they face difficult decisions over production cuts if they are to stem a further steep slide in oil prices by the spring. Prices for North Sea Brent crude have slipped by Dollars 5 a barrel to Dollars 18.50 in the past month in an already weak world market, prompting calls from some smaller producers for emergency action when the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) meets. Algeria has been vociferous in its calls for an emergency Opec meeting after seeing its oil revenues eroded by oil prices as low as Dollars 16-Dollars 17 a barrel  - Dollars 5 a barrel shy of Opec's target price. It is an unusual situation for the time of year: when the weather turns frosty in the western hemisphere, world oil prices usually reach their peak, but this year prices have not followed form. Several reasons lie behind the price decline, the most important being that traders had anticipated a cold winter and a continuing drop in deliveries from the former Soviet Union, and thus a strong call on available oil supplies. In addition, they were banking on a substantial pick-up in demand as the world economy headed for recovery. When oil prices rose to about Dollars 23 a barrel in early November, many industry observers speculated that the traditional winter peak had come too soon. They seem to have been proved right. The weather has remained relatively warm and the dip in Soviet production has not been as great as expected. At the same time, the US, UK and other western economies have been much slower to recover than expected, with the result that oil consumption has failed to show much of an increase. Stagnant demand has prompted the International Energy Agency, the west's oil watchdog, to revise downwards its estimate for OECD usage in the first quarter of 1992 from 39.2m barrels a day (b/d) to 39m b/d  - a rise of just 1 per cent over the same period in 1991. The outlook for the market has been made even more gloomy by the action of 11 of Opec's 13 members, which have continued to produce as much as they can despite flat demand. This excess production has more than made up for the radically reduced output from Iraq and Kuwait: Iraq is still restricted from exporting oil by UN sanctions imposed after the Gulf war, while Kuwait is rebuilding its oil industry after the devastation wrought by Iraqi troops. The consuming nations have looked to Opec to pump as much oil as it can to compensate for the absence of these two big exporters since the onset of the Gulf crisis in August 1990. This flat-out production by Opec stretched its production capacity and caused oil prices to rise as companies built stocks in anticipation of any shortfall in supply. Consumers now believe that they may have overdone their cautious stockpiling. 'I would say the market is now over-supplied with oil,' said Mr Peter Bogin, oil consultant at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 'Company stocks are high and demand is low.' Cold weather in coming months could still give a short-term fillip to the oil price, but the weakness of the underlying trend has shifted the focus on to Opec and the need to introduce concrete cuts in production. The organisation is currently producing some 24m b/d, but needs to cut this by at least 2m b/d by the second quarter of next year if it is to stabilise prices. Without swift Opec action, some smaller producers fear the market could collapse in the same way that North Sea oil prices plunged from about Dollars 30 to Dollars 9 a barrel in the spring of 1986. This sharp drop prompted many US and UK companies to slash investment plans  - a move which has only been reversed in the past two years. Producer countries were also hit badly by the slump in prices. Yet five years on ministers from the richer Opec members  - notably Saudi Arabia, despite its pressing budget problems caused by its contribution to the cost of the Gulf war  - are more sanguine about the outlook and have resisted calls for an emergency meeting before the regular one scheduled for February 12. Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states are unwilling to commit themselves to a formula for cutting output before trying to thrash out a compromise in the discreet talks that surround Opec meetings. 'There is a recognition of the need to make some adjustment to production at the next meeting, but we will face many problems about how to do it,' one Gulf source commented. The producers face tough battles in trying to reach a consensus on how high they expect market demand to be in the second quarter of this year; they will also be hard-pressed to convince other members of their own actual capacity levels which many try to artificially inflate in order to gain a higher production quota. Saudi Arabia has increased its dominance in the stormy producers' club since the Gulf war under Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister. He is unwilling to relinquish the country's 35 per cent share of Opec's overall export market. Saudi Arabia has boosted production from 5.4m b/d before the Gulf crisis to 8.5m b/d at great additional expense and is unlikely to agree to a reduction much below 7m b/d. 'The Saudis want a deal that gives them the maximum flexibility to call the shots and cut production at their own discretion,' said Mr Fareed Mohamedi, senior economist at the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington-based consultancy. February's meeting could steer clear of a return to formal production quotas in a bid to cut output, as has happened at several Opec meetings since the Gulf war. A more likely outcome in Geneva is that producers will agree a formula such as an all-round cut of 5 per cent to 7 per cent in each producer's output. There is likely to be a great deal of wrangling over how this can be achieved. Whether this formula will be enough to stem the decline on world oil markets is not clear. Mr Robert Mabro, director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies believes that Opec continually acts to stave off a short-term crisis without giving much thought to long-term trends in the market. 'Opec could lose its credibility as a crisis-management organisation by failing to think far enough ahead,' he said. For instance the organisation will have to accommodate the full return of Kuwait and the possible re-entry of Iraq to the market later this year. This should entail further cuts by producers if prices are to remain stable, but ministers shy away from discussing the issue until market crises force them to do so. They disclose little beyond hoping that demand will rise later in the year to absorb all the oil on the market. Traders know Opec has the power to influence prices, but the longer it refrains from using it, the more the market will test its will by pushing prices downwards. 'Opec's more subtle approach to market management is definitely riskier,' said Mr Mohamedi.</p>

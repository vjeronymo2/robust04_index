			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / People: Kenny joins Potter at Guinness Mahon Kevin Kenny, chief executive of fund management and financial services group Tyndall Holdings in the difficult period before it was acquired by Jupiter Tarbutt Merlin last summer, has resurfaced at Guinness Mahon, the small merchant bank owned by Bank of Yokohama. Kenny becomes director of international private banking, with the three overseas operations - Guernsey, Dublin and Zurich - reporting for the first time to a single board member. Tyndall suffered heavy losses in the Australian market, with the then boss Garnet Harrison subsequently resigning. Kenny, who had been in charge of the Tyndall banking division, took over as managing director of the group in the autumn of 1990. David Potter, chief executive of Guinness Mahon, was also made non-executive vice chairman of Tyndall at the time, which was how the two met. Tyndall fell under something of a cloud as a result of the Australian debacle. In the past few months there has also been an unseemly wrangle between Jupiter and former Tyndall directors over the management of two funds, Pacific Horizon and European Project. But Potter says that he was impressed with Kenny's efforts to restructure Tyndall: 'He did a great job keeping it moving through the water'. Potter also contends that the banking side of Tyndall was, and is, very sound. 'When I knew he did not have a perch (after the Jupiter acquisition) I naturally engaged him in conversation.' Kenny has been a consultant to Guinness Mahon for several months: 'There is no better way for both sides to do their due diligence,' according to Potter. ***** Ever since Sir Gordon Borrie stepped down last month as Director-General of Fair Trading after 16 years in the job, there has been speculation about what he will do next. He is still only 61 and somehow it never seemed likely that he would withdraw from the battle for consumers' rights to grow roses in the Cotswolds. Now comes news that he is to join the Council of the Ombudsman for Corporate Estate Agents, a voluntary scheme set up two years ago to handle complaints against the large chains of estate agents taking part in residential property transactions. Few people have done more than Sir Gordon to change the face of the industry. He was the driving force behind the 1979 Estate Agents Act and the 1991 Property Misdescriptions Act which is about to come into force. As Lady Ewart-Biggs, the OCEA Council chairman, said yesterday, no one else knows as much as Sir Gordon about the regulation of estate agents. Rogues had better beware.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report based on INTERFAX and POSTFACTUM </F> materials in the "Demarche" column: "It Has Been Decided To  Consider the Incident in Riga as an Extremist Provocation.  Talks on Troop Withdrawal Have Been Resumed"]    [Text] According to the Baltic News Service, President  Yeltsin "does not intend to react officially" to the 10 January  incident in Latvia. Nonetheless yesterday the Russian  president's press secretary Kostikov came out with a sharp  statement on this score. In the future Russia will take into  account the "U.S. experience" of reacting in similar situations,  Vyacheslav Kostikov said. In the press secretary's opinion,  should such excesses be repeated, "the reaction by the president  and Russia may be tougher, I would say, very tough indeed, based  on world precedents."    Thereby the incident involving the detention in Riga of two  Russian generals and the capture of Russian military  installations has presumably been exhausted. In spite of  threatening statements by the Russian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, the Defense Ministry, and the Russian Federation  Embassy in Latvia issued Monday evening, yesterday bilateral  talks on the pullout of Russian troops resumed in the Latvian  capital. Moreover, the Russian delegation offered to reduce the  term of temporary operation of the radar station in Skrunda from  six to five years.    At the same time, the head of the Russian delegation,  Ambassador at Large Sergey Zotov, described the action by the  Latvian self-defense forces as "a gross provocation by extremist  and nationalist forces aimed at torpedoing the Russian-Latvian  negotiations" and also as "a test of Russia's force and its  ability to defend its installations against attack." It needs  to be recognized that the test has been impressive. According  to Russian Federation Defense Minister Grachev, not only the  troops deployed in Latvia but also units of the Pskov airborne  division were put on alert.    The Russian demarches have produced an appropriate effect.  Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis officially apologized to  Russia. The Latvian Prosecutor's Office has initiated criminal  proceedings over the detention of the generals. Andreys Ruchs,  chairman of the Vidzemskiy district, who was in charge of this  action, has been dismissed from his post.</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / 'Stop squabbling', Major tells feuding Tory MPs Mr John Major acknowledged yesterday that his government's remaining hopes of political recovery rested on an end to the Tory civil war over Europe as senior ministers disclosed plans for a new strategy to unite the party. The prime minister, speaking at the summit of European Union leaders in Essen, Germany, warned Conservative MPs that the electorate did not expect 'the governing party to squabble'. Blaming a string of by-election defeats on the feuding, and anticipating another loss in Dudley West next week, he said he understood the voters' anger. In a reference to the recent backbench rebellions over Europe and over Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget, Mr Major said pointedly that Conservative MPs had been elected to support the government. He added: 'I think it is time it (the squabbling) stopped.' His comments came at the end of a week which has seen Labour's lead over the Conservatives in the opinion polls jump to the highest level recorded by any political party in the postwar period. They followed the government's ignominious parliamentary defeat over value added tax on domestic fuels. But there was little sign that Mr Major's call for discipline was being heeded by rebel Tories. Mrs Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay, said the prime minister could not drive his party into policies which it wanted to reject. Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the rightwing 92 group of Tory MPs, who has been at the centre of a row over claims that he plotted to remove Mr Major from the leadership, said: 'This kind of paranoia, where you get one group of the prime minister's supporters attacking another group, really doesn't help us at all.' The concern within the cabinet that divisions over Europe could destroy hopes of a political recovery has led to an acceleration of work on Britain's negotiating stance for the EU's 1996 inter-governmental conference. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has told colleagues he has produced a framework for the talks which he believes will unite 'the vast majority' of Tory MPs. The strategy centres on proposals to slim down the European Commission and make it more accountable to member states, and to enhance the role of national parliaments in the scrutiny of EU legislation. Mr Hurd's ideas, to be discussed by the cabinet's overseas committee during the next two months, include plans to strengthen the inter-governmental dimension of EU co-operation - particularly on security and defence. But he may anger Tory Eurosceptics with a separate call for a considered national debate on the merits and demerits of a single European currency. Mr Hurd believes that a rational discussion on the pros and cons of economic and monetary union would take the political heat out of the issue. But his stance will be seen by hardline Eurosceptics as an attempt to open up the possibility of Britain eventually joining a single currency.

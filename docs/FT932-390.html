			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / High noon on the high street: Can UK superstores beat off a sharp challenge from discounters while improving profitability? At Castle Bromwich in the West Midlands, shoppers face a choice that will confront increasing numbers of UK consumers in the 1990s. On one side of a car park is a Safeway superstore, offering almost 20,000 high-quality products, many at premium prices; on the other is a branch of Aldi, a German discount retailer, offering 600 of the most popular products at rock-bottom prices. The UK's 'big three' food retailers, which stress quality, choice and convenience more than price, have bounced through the recession with ever-growing profits. Continuing a 10-year trend, Sainsbury's pre-tax profit rose 17 per cent to Pounds 733m last year; Argyll, owner of Safeway, was up 9 per cent to Pounds 417m; and Tesco gained 7 per cent to Pounds 581m. But the strength of their results has led to allegations from MPs and consumer groups that operators of superstores - large supermarkets of more than 20,000 square feet - are using their market power to overcharge consumers and make excessive profits. There are also fears in the City of London that the superstores' ability to sustain the profits growth of the past decade could be undermined by the rapid expansion of the price-led discount retailers. A study by McKinsey, the management consultancy, warns that UK retailers risk a sharp decline in profitability unless they use increases in efficiency to provide lower prices to consumers. It says the UK faces similar market conditions to those in the US, including increasing price sensitivity among consumers and competition from discount outlets. Critics say the benefits of recent efficiency improvements have not been passed on to consumers. Rather, superstore operators have used these improvements and the 'screwing down' of prices paid to farmers and other food producers to double their profit margins in the past decade. The big three's operating margins - broadly a measure of how many pence they make on each Pounds 1 customers spend, after subtracting operating costs - have increased to 7 or 8 per cent, while margins for leading grocers in the US and continental Europe have been held at 2 or 3 per cent. That, claim the critics, means the UK's biggest grocers could cut their prices by up to 6p in the Pounds 1 and still perform as well as their overseas counterparts. Although Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, rejected a recent call from Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, for an investigation of the big supermarkets' pricing policies, profits and treatment of suppliers, he added that he would keep the matter under review. But are the allegations of overcharging accurate? Taking profits as a proportion of sales, there is no doubt that the big UK retailers make a better return than their continental European rivals, with operating margins three or four times as high. UK grocers, however, say they have held their price increases below the overall rate of inflation over the past decade and have increased operating margins by improving efficiency and reducing costs. They point to a series of measures that have improved their performance: The big grocers have shifted towards trading from large superstores, where there are greater economies of scale in labour, sales and distribution costs. They have reduced rental costs by investing more in freehold, rather than leasehold, property. The superstore operators have also increased their sales of high-margin goods, such as fresh and prepared foods. They have cut costs by centralising distribution and investing heavily in technology, such as laser scanners at check-outs linked to computers that automatically monitor stocks and re-order goods. 'UK food retailing systems are the envy of Europe,' says Mr John Beaumont, chief executive of the Institute of Grocery Distribution, an industry research and advisory body. But what most sets the UK's big three apart from continental European competitors is the importance they attach to own-label products, which account for more than 50 per cent of sales by value at Sainsbury, Safeway and Tesco. In many UK and overseas chains, own-label has usually meant poor-quality imitations of branded goods. The top UK grocers have improved the quality of own-label products so much they can compete directly against proprietary brands. Because they do not have to bear the same distribution, advertising and promotion costs as brand manufacturers, retailers can sell own-label goods at 15 per cent below branded equivalents and still achieve a similar cash profit, says Mr David Webster, Argyll's deputy chairman. Own-label is also set to be a powerful weapon in any war against the discounters. Sainsbury has recently given presentations comparing favourably the quality and price of its own-label products with manufacturers' branded products at Kwik Save, the largest discount food chain. But does this mean the big three are now making bigger operating margins than they need to and so overcharging customers? The grocers answer that the high investment needed to expand in the UK compared with continental Europe means their operating profits have to be higher if they are to achieve similar returns on their investments. Taking profits as a proportion of capital employed in the business, Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway argue their return is not out of line with that of most continental European grocers. Some of the higher investment was through choice: the superstores decided to invest in freehold property and build to a very high standard. However, some of the higher spending was forced on them by higher land and construction costs in the UK than in Belgium, France or Germany, for example. In these conditions, says Mr Roger Ramsden, manager of the consumer and retail practice at the Boston Consulting Group, the management consultancy, UK grocers would achieve a lower return on capital than their European counterparts if they reduced their operating margins. This would discourage investors from putting money into UK grocers. 'The end result would simply be a less effective food retailing sector,' he says. Some industry analysts, however, challenge the grocers' arguments that it is mainly efficiency that is allowing them to boost operating margins. Mr Robert Clark, director of Corporate Intelligence, a retail market research group, believes it is partly because their gross margins - the difference between the price customers pay for goods and the amount the goods cost the retailer - are higher than those overseas. Gross margins are not a subject UK food retailers like to dwell on, and accounting differences between the UK and continental Europe make it difficult to draw comparisons from the published accounts. But Mr Clark says his research shows that UK gross margins average 27 per cent, outstripping most European food retailers by several percentage points. Research is inconclusive on whether UK consumers pay more for their food than people in continental Europe. Fluctuating exchange rates and the difficulty of comparing like products with like mean price comparisons between different countries can be misleading. However, one reasonably authoritative survey carried out for the Financial Times in January by Nielsen, the market research company, found UK retail prices for a range of common European brands were 17 per cent lower than the average for 14 European countries. UK prices were the cheapest in every product category except alcoholic drinks, which are heavily taxed in the UK. But the results of this survey were influenced by the devaluation of sterling last September. Superstore operators say their real achievement has been to keep prices competitive overall, while transforming the eating habits of the nation  - introducing many products unknown in the UK 10 years ago - and offering customers unprecedented standards of quality and service. 'We don't have 835 superstores in the UK because of some fantasy on the part of the retailers that said we ought to have them. People like shopping in them,' says Mr Beaumont. There are now fears in the industry and in the City, however, that the rise of the discounters may put an end to the seemingly inexorable expansion and profits growth of the superstores. The number of cut-price grocery chains in the UK has risen from two in 1990 to 14, with European discounters - including Germany's Aldi, Denmark's Netto and France's Ed - joining new UK entrants. Discounters make money by concentrating not on margins but on shifting large volumes of goods. Margins, prices and costs are all kept as low as possible. The format may prove very attractive to the post-recession consumers of the 1990s. Most forecasts see discounters increasing their share of the food market from about 9 per cent now, to 15 per cent by 1995 and to more than 20 per cent by the end of the decade. To achieve that market share, they must grab sales from their competitors. But most observers believe it is the so-called middle market - including both independent grocers and weaker chains such as Gateway, Waitrose and the co-operative retailers - which will suffer the most. They argue there will still be enough customers for whom quality, choice and convenience are as important as price, and this will ensure that the big three will not lose many sales. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that some superstores are already being hit by discounters which have opened nearby. Institutional investors, which paid out Pounds 2.2bn in rights issues in 1991 alone to fund expansion by superstore operators, are growing nervous that the returns on those investments may be lower than projected. Food retailing shares have underperformed the stock market by 10 per cent since January. Tesco is seen as the most vulnerable. It has a younger customer base, which has been hit harder than those of its rivals by the recession and which may be more susceptible to the charms of the dis-counters. There are also fears that the growth of the discounters will foster a new price sensitivity among consumers that will force all retailers, including the big three, to sharpen their prices. 'It is hard to see how the margin growth of the last few years can continue at the same rate,' says Mr Nick Bubb, retailing analyst with Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank. Food retailing shares have also been depressed by another nagging fear: that the the food market is becoming saturated. There is only a certain number of superstores that can be built before they start to 'cannibalise' each other's sales. The big three each say they have identified 100 or more suitable sites for superstores, enough to keep them going for several years. Mr Bill Myers, food retailing analyst at institutional brokers Henderson Crosthwaite, found in a recent demographic survey of the UK that the highest proportion of food retailing floor space held by the big three in any town in the country was 45 per cent. In many areas, it was less than 10 per cent. This suggested there was still considerable room for expansion. But the large grocers say that cannibalisation of sales is already occurring, and each has indicated it may need to diversify or move offshore. Tesco has bought 94 supermarkets in northern France; Sainsbury has the Shaws chain in the US; while Argyll is developing the Lo-Cost discount format alongside Safeway. Retailers are fond of demonstrating the rapidly-changing nature of their industry by citing Asda, the pioneer of superstore retailing in the UK. It began the 1980s as one of the UK's most successful grocers, with the highest margins, but ended the decade in severe financial difficulties after moving away from its traditional low-price policy and over-spending on expansion. However dominant the big three grocers might seem to be, observers suggest they must walk a tightrope on their pricing and spending - and watch the discounters like hawks - if they are to avoid a similar fate.  --------------------------------------------- Typical UK supermarket chain's average gross                  margins 1991-2  --------------------------------------------- Overall average margin 27.0% Food:  Groceries        24.0%  Provisions       28.0%  Average          25.5% Including:  Bakery           61.0%  Meat             26.5%  Produce          34.5% Non food:  Household goods  33.0%  Clothing         45.0%  Average          37.5%  --------------------------------------------- Source: Corporate Intelligence Group Research  ---------------------------------------------</p>

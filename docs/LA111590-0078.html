			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USED NEEDLE EXPOSES PATIENT TO AIDS;  </P> <P> DISEASE: A SYRINGE USED ON AN AIDS PATIENT IS REUSED ON A WOMAN BEING TREATED  AT MERCY HOSPITAL FOR A MINOR BACK INJURY. FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES ARE  INVESTIGATING, AND A LAWSUIT IS PENDING.  </P> <P> A 23-year-old San Diego woman was exposed to a deadly virus at a hospital here  after having been treated with a syringe used previously on a patient with  AIDS, medical officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The woman, whose name was not released, was notified by doctors at Mercy  Hospital 36 hours after being treated for job-related back pain that she had  been exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, her  attorney said.  </P> <P> Representatives of the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and the  State Department of Health Services confirmed Wednesday that the incident,  which happened Sept. 25, is under investigation.  </P> <P> Harvey Levine, the attorney representing the woman and her family, said  Wednesday he intends to file suit in February against Mercy Hospital and its  parent corporation, Catholic Health Care West.  </P> <P> Levine said a 90-day waiting period accompanies any case in which doctors or  hospitals are named as defendants. He said officials at Mercy, which is in the  Hillcrest section of San Diego, have refused to provide records pertaining to  the case.  </P> <P> Levine said this is the first case in the United States in which a patient has  been exposed to an AIDS-related virus through injection with a syringe used  previously on another person -- a claim federal and state officials could not  confirm.  </P> <P> Dick Keyser, the president of Mercy Hospital, acknowledged Wednesday that a  critical mistake was made.  </P> <P> Asked why the syringe was not disposed of, he said, "Obviously, that should  have happened."  </P> <P> "The medical risk to this patient is very limited," Keyser said, because the  needle was inserted into a tube, which was attached to the woman's body, rather  than being injected directly through the skin.  </P> <P> Levine said his client may know within three months whether she's HIV-positive,  but she faces "an umbrella of danger" for the rest of her life.  </P> <P> "She faces issues of future employability, problems in her relationships with  men and in whether she's eligible for certain types of health insurance,"  Levine said. "This is a nightmare of major proportions."  </P> <P> Levine said the woman, whose occupation he refused to disclose, was sent to the  hospital with an "insignificant lower-back injury" she sustained at work. She  received a magnetic resonance imaging test -- a type of X-ray -- which turned  up negative.  </P> <P> "There was no problem with her disc or cervical spine," Levine said. "It was  very minor. For some reason, the worker's compensation doctor decided to order  a bone scan. That involved a radioisotope-dye injection, which would have  detected a herniated disc. Even without the risk of AIDS, they should have  realized that radioisotope dye, once it's used, is nothing less than nuclear  waste.  </P> <P> "She received the injection, and 36 hours later, on Sept. 27, she received a  call at 1:15 a.m. She was told to report to the hospital immediately, that she  'might have caught a virus.' She reports to the hospital and is greeted by the  head of the radiology department, a hospital vice president and a physician who  specializes in infectious diseases.  </P> <P> "She was then told she had been injected with a syringe used previously on a  patient known to be HIV-positive, and that the same syringe, instead of being  disposed of by the attending technician, was then used on her. They refused to  explain how or why such a mistake occurred."  </P> <P> Levine and physicians unrelated to the case say it is customary for "any and  all" syringes to be disposed of as soon as they're used.  </P> <P> "The standard procedure is that you never use a used syringe on another  person," said Dr. Donald Ramras, deputy director of the San Diego County Health  Services Department. "You use a syringe only once. Obviously, someone made a  big mistake."  </P> <P> Keyser refused to name the technician who made the injection but did say the  person was no longer employed by the hospital. He refused to say whether the  technician had been fired.  </P> <P> Ernie Trujillo, district manager for the division of licensing and  certification for the State Department of Health Services, confirmed Wednesday  that his agency is investigating the hospital.  </P> <P> Trujillo said Mercy Hospital reported the incident to his agency in early  October, about a week after it happened. He said the worst that could happen to  Mercy would be a review that might cause the hospital's certification to be  re-evaluated on a state and federal level.  </P> <P> Dr. George Rutherford, the chief of the infectious diseases branch of the State  Department of Health Services, said Wednesday that he's more concerned "about  the larger issues this case raises."  </P> <P> "Are there blind spots involving infection control that we're overlooking?"  Rutherford said from his office in Berkeley. "Procedures are quite a bit  different now than they were five years ago, before AIDS became so prominent.  </P> <P> "With the advent of AIDS, infection control guidelines have been extensively  revamped. But our concern is whether they're adequate enough even now to  address all possible situations. The harsh reality in a hospital setting is, we  need to treat everyone as if they have a highly infectious disease."  </P> <P> Rutherford said that, in developing countries, needles are re-used "constantly,  but in the United States? No, it's a big no-no, even before the AIDS scare."  </P> <P> Attorney Levine accused the hospital of trying to cover up the mistake, but  Keyser said the "error was not detected until about 24 hours after it was  made."  </P> <P> "I don't wish to comment on that," Keyser said. "Our No. 1 concern right now is  that patient. We contacted her and got the infectious-disease specialist  involved in it immediately. We're very concerned. Any time something isn't in  the best interest of a patient, it's a big concern to everybody around here.  We're doing everything we can to see that an incident like this never happens  again."  </P> <P> Levine said he also wondered whether other patients at Mercy might have been  exposed -- which Keyser heatedly denied. Levine said his client is now  suffering side effects from injections of AZT, an anti-viral drug used to slow  the march of the AIDS virus through the body's system.  </P> <P> "The people at Mercy traumatized her," Levine said. "They forced a terrible  decision on her with AZT, saying she might incur risks of cancer, as well as  liver and kidney damage, but 'It's up to you.' "  </P></p>

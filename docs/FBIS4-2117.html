A lawyer, who  originally had promised to defend Xi Yang, suddenly changed his  mind and said he was not competent for the job. Nevertheless,  MING PAO has stressed that it will continue its efforts in the  coming days to help Xi's family to find a suitable lawyer to  appeal the case.    On the day before yesterday, Xi's family met with a  responsible official from the China Solicitors' Office and  reached a verbal agreement: A lawyer from the solicitors'  office will appeal Xi's case.    Xi's family presented the name of the lawyer, who had  indicated he was willing to defend Xi Yang, to the court the day  before yesterday, and the process of Xi's appeal was set in  motion. When MING PAO chief editor Chang Hsi-hung accompanied  Xi's family to sign the official agreement at the solicitors'  office, the lawyer suddenly said that he was not competent for  the job, without giving any specific reason. It has been  reported that a responsible official from the solicitors' office  did not want the lawyer to take on the job of defending Xi Yang.    When Xi's family presented the name of the lawyer to the  court on Monday [4 April], a court official revealed that Xi  Yang had said two things regarding the search for a lawyer:  First, his family should try to get a lawyer for him; and,  second, if his family is unsuccessful, the court may do so on  his behalf. The court official also said that, if the lawyer  invited by the family cannot attend the court for personal or  other reasons, he will naturally lose the opportunity to defend  Xi Yang. The court will then have to assign a lawyer to defend  Xi Yang. Xi's family nonetheless still wanted to try to find a  lawyer for Xi Yang.    Despite the setbacks encountered in their search for a  lawyer, Xi's family said that they will do their utmost to find  a qualified lawyer in the next day or two to defend Xi Yang.    Xi Yang's father, who is currently hospitalized, appealed to  the authorities to allow him to meet his son Xi Yang in the  course of the appeal and let him attend the second trial as an  observer. Xi Yang's father also expressed his hope that Hong  Kong's National People's Congress [NPC] deputies or Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] members could  attend the trial as observers.</p>

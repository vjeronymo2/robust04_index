			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Shares in MTM fall after new warning MTM, the specialist chemicals supplier, shed half its market capitalisation at one stage yesterday after it made its second profits warning in a week. Its shares, which began the day at 189p, fell to below 90p before closing at 119p. Shareholders and analysts questioned why the Stock Exchange had not suspended the shares before the announcement. One analyst said the market in MTM shares had deteriorated into a 'casino' after the announcement. He had written a buy recommendation after Mr Richard Lines, chairman and chief executive, told analysts last week at the offices of Robert Fleming, MTM's merchant bank, that there were no problems with 1991 trading profits. MTM's warning last Monday said profits would be substantially below City expectations - then at Pounds 23m - because its auditors, Binder Hamlyn, were taking a tougher view on the valuation of fixed assets. Before that announcement, MTM's shares were at 286p. With the company adding little to its statement that it was now facing a 'significant' shortfall in trading profits over expectations, some shareholders were questioning whether Mr Lines could stay on as chairman and chief executive. Neither Mr Lines nor Mr Tom Baxter, MTM's finance director, who met analysts last week after the company's first announcement, was available for comment. One institutional investor bought shares last week after the first sharp price fall when he was assured that 1991 trading was unaffected by the difference of opinion with the auditors. He said he could see no reason why Mr Lines should mislead the market about profits and he had no idea why these profits suddenly appeared to have hit a wall. Mr Lines, who founded the company in 1979 after 11 years with ICI, owns 7 per cent of MTM. Last week's announcement that MTM had fallen foul of the auditors, particularly over capitalisation of development costs and some fixed assets, took few in the City entirely by surprise. But the group's admission that trading had fallen short of expectations shocked analysts. 'Last week it was an accounting problem; this week it is a trading problem,' one analyst said.

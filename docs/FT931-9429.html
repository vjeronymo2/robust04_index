			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Briefcase, Q &amp; A: Cottage for sale I AM A JOINT tenant with my mother in ownership of a bungalow, although I do not live there. She is now in residential care and I have power of attorney for her affairs. To obtain income support allowance for her, the DSS informed me the bungalow must be put up for sale, and it has been. But can they force me to do this? My solicitor thinks it would be difficult for me to buy her out; is this so? If I can, what equitable arrangement for valuation would be acceptable to the DSS, and would it affect the present allowances? The DSS cannot force you to sell the bungalow but they can, and will, assess your mother's needs on the footing that she has available capital to the extent of her half-share in the property - so the result is likely to be much the same. It is not too difficult to buy out your mother's share, but certain safeguards are necessary as you are a trustee purchasing from your beneficiary. The principal requirement is that you obtain a proper valuation assessing the value of the property in the open market, so that you can show that the price you are paying is a proper price and not detrimental to your mother's interests. It would be wise to inform the DSS that you are proposing to buy your mother's interest at that valuation, provide them with a copy, and invite them to agree the value or to appoint a valuer of their own if they do not accept the valuation. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

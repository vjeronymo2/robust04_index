			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Observer: User friendly Cable &amp; Wireless seems to have a knack of acquiring the services of ministers formerly responsible for its well-being. First, Lord Young becomes chairman of the privatised telecommunications group, hot-foot from the Department of Trade and Industry. Now Michael Manley, prime minister of Jamaica until last March, appears on its payroll as C&amp;W's chief lobbyist with Cuba's Fidel Castro. Once upon a time Jamaica's phone system was as decrepit as Cuba's and C&amp;W mended it. So presumably Manley has been hired to tell Fidel what a good job it did. If the ploy works, it could turn out to provide a nice little number for other out-of-work politicians. Who knows, there could be a job for an ex-governor of Hong Kong, helping C&amp;W's Hong Kong Telecom crack the Chinese market.</p>

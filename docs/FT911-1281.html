			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Aid pledge relieves pressure on Pakistan PAKISTANI officials have expressed relief after foreign government donors meeting in Paris pledged new assistance worth Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.4bn) for the coming fiscal year. The consortium also committed Dollars 174m in assistance for Afghan refugees, in a meeting which ended on Friday night. Pakistan's budgetary deficit projected for last year was PRs57.8bn (Pounds 1.5bn), or 6.6 per cent of gross domestic product, according to the latest government statistics. In the past, international financial institutions have urged Islamabad to introduce measures for reducing the deficit. The consortium asked Pakistan to give higher priority to programmes in the social sector and the environment. The announcement came at the end of weeks of speculation that the US, which cut off aid to Pakistan last year after congressional objections on Islamabad's nuclear programme, might influence other countries to do the same. India stirred the controversy afresh yesterday by alleging that Pakistan had received a secret shipment of uranium at Karachi. A senior New Delhi government official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters the uranium had arrived on Sunday and would be carried to Hyderabad by military trucks on a road from which all other traffic has been banned. Japan, concerned at Pakistan's foreign exchange reserve position, has downrated it as an export credit insurance risk, Reuter adds. The Japanese embassy in Islamabad said applications for insurance on exports to Pakistan had been switched to a case-by-case basis since April 1 instead of being automatically approved in bulk.</p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASTIMES: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> BOOKBINDING  </P> <P> A HAND-BOUND BOOK is two works of art: the writing on the pages, and the design  and craftsmanship on the cover surrounding it. A hand-bound book is hard to  find and expensive to buy -- but it is not impossible to bind yourself.  </P> <P> A warning: This is not the hobby for a dilettante. The array of equipment  needed is great, and the availability of materials in Southern California is  rather poor. Mail order looms large.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, anyone who cherishes books for their heft and color, size and  shape, the feel of the cover as well as the diversions within, will be  fascinated by the craft of bookbinding. At its very simplest, it is sheets of  paper stitched together and encased with a binding of board, paper or leather  that is glued at the spine and tidied up on the inside with endpapers. But the  pages and covers must be carefully measured and cut and then squeezed into a  piece of medieval equipment called the lying press, which not only gives the  book its tight shape but also makes that little ridge where the spine curves  around to become the cover.  </P> <P> Depending on the size of the book and style of the binding, there are many  different ways to stitch the pages together; there are even different types of  adhesives and spines. Veteran hand-bookbinders can turn out metal, wood,  plastic or velvet-covered bindings that rival the Hope diamond in flash and  substance. "Bound to Vary," a designer-bookbinding exhibit at the Renwick  Gallery in Washington (up through the end of July), includes various  bookbinders' editions of Herman Melville's "Billy Budd" (with handmade papers  and handprinted woodcuts) in dazzling nautical styles. If anything can inspire  courage to try this craft, this collection will. You don't have to fly to D.C.;  there is a book of the exhibit.  </P> <P>  The Collings Bindery in Los Angeles is perhaps the only source of  hand-bookbinding instruction in Southern California. Charles Collings gives  three-hour classes every Saturday; the cost is $75 a month, open ended;  students can stay one month or longer. Much longer -- one student has been  going for 15 years. "A lot of people don't have the space at home," Collings  says, or the lying press. Collings says there is no local source for general  bookbinding supplies, but they are available from Talas, 213 W. 35th St., New  York, N.Y. 10001-1996 (catalogue $5); Bookmakers, 2025 I St. N.W., Room 502,  Washington, D.C. 20006 (free catalogue), and Colophon Bindery, 1902 N. 44th  St., Seattle, Wash. 98103 (catalogue $2). Several books are available in  varying levels of instruction; Collings recommends "The Craft of Bookbinding,"  by Eric Burdet, and "Bookbinding and the Care of Books" (Taplinger Publishing);  they are no longer in print, but copies might still be circulating. He also  recommends "The History of English Craft Bookbinding Technique," by Bernard C.  Middleton (available from Oak Knoll Books; write 414 Delaware St., New Castle,  Delaware 19720). Oak Knoll Books has just issued a new catalogue, "M511  Bookbinding", that lists new titles and rare books about bookbinding.  </P> <P>  On a more accessible level are three Dover Publications books, "Bookbinding:  Its Background and Technique," by Edith Diehl, "Basic Bookbinding," by A.W.  Lewis, "How to Clothbind a Paperback Book," by Francis J. Kafka, and "Hand  Bookbinding: A Manual of Instruction," by Aldren Watson (Macmillan Publishing).  "The Practical Guide to Craft Bookbinding," by Arthur W. Johnson (Thames &amp;  Hudson), is not for beginners. The last five books, as well as "Bound to Vary,"  can be ordered from the Renwick Gallery Museum Shop, c/o Smithsonian  Institution, Washington, D.C. 20560; telephone (202) 357-1300.  </P></p>

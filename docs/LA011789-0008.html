			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAKING PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA;  </P> <P> NEUTRAL OUTSIDERS CAN EXERT POLITICAL, FINANCIAL LEVERAGE  </P> <P> As 1989 begins, Central America is caught between the harsh reality of war and  the lingering promise of peace.  </P> <P> Almost 200,000 people have been killed in the internal conflicts of El  Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua, and more than 2 million have been uprooted  from their homes. Much of the region's physical infrastructure lies in ruins or  disrepair. Hurricanes, drought and earthquakes have taken a heavy toll, but the  worst destruction has been wreaked by war.  </P> <P> Yet even as Central America's suffering continues, broad agreement has finally  emerged on what must be done to end it. The blueprint exists in the Esquipulas  accord -- the proposals put forward in 1987 by President Oscar Arias Sanchez of  Costa Rica and adopted by the five Central American presidents when they met in  Guatemala that August. But this blueprint will be useless unless there is a  resolution of the confrontation between the governments of Nicaragua and the  United States.  </P> <P> At this juncture the prospects for peace between the United States and  Nicaragua depend on Washington's first making clear its terms for restoring  normal relations with the Sandinista government. If the new U.S. Administration  and Congress believe that the very existence of the Sandinista regime in  Managua, because of its character and ideology, threatens U.S. security  interests, then the United States may see no long-term alternative to  attempting to oust the Sandinista government, in the meantime continuing its  unremitting hostility toward Nicaragua. Such an approach almost certainly would  condemn Central America to many more years of confrontation, destruction and  despair.  </P> <P> We strongly urge a different tack. We do not believe that the Sandinista  regime,by its mere existence, poses the kind of security threat that could  justify direct or indirect military or paramilitary intervention by the United  States. The emphasis of U.S. policy should be not on overthrowing the  government of Nicaragua but on ensuring that its activities do not threaten the  security of other countries. On this key point there is broad agreement both in  Latin American and in the United States.  </P> <P> To deter any future threat to its security, the United States should obtain  satisfactory assurances from the Soviet Union and Cuba that they will curtail  their military ties to Nicaragua. The United States should also resume direct  bilateral talks with the government of Nicaragua in order to fashion mutual  security arrangements.  </P> <P> While negotiating on security issues, the U.S. government should continue  trying to foster political competition in Nicaragua. By alleviating its  security concerns, the United States should be able to concentrate more  effectively -- in concert with other democratic countries -- on promoting  pluralism and democracy everywhere in Central America. This aim is more likely  to be achieved, over time, through internal pressure and consistent  multilateral inducements rather than through unilateral imposition or  intimidation.  </P> <P> Central America's security ultimately depends on fashioning internal agreements  that allow all major groups to participate fully in political life and thereby  acquire a stake in civic peace. That is why the Esquipulas peace process  focuses on fostering national reconciliation and political pluralism.  </P> <P> It is, however, much easier to profess a commitment to democracy than to carry  it out. Most of Central America today is still a long way from political  pluralism and constitutional democracy. Abuses of human rights and restrictions  on open political activity are all too common in El Salvador, Guatemala,  Honduras and Nicaragua. In Guatemala, El Salvadorand Honduras, military and  police forces ignore or resist civilian political authorities. In these three  countries, institutions are weak and vulnerable to corruption. In Nicaragua,  Sandinista Party control of the armed forces raises serious questions about the  regime's willingness to accept autonomous opposition -- the basic prerequisite  for peaceful political competition.  </P> <P> Even if Central America's armed conflicts can soon be halted or sharply  reduced, pluralist politics will take many years to build. These societies have  become intensely polarized, and their deep divisions have to be healed. The  rules of politics still have to be devised through broad consultation and  agreed on by the main social actors. Civic trust must be earned reciprocally  among the main contenders for power.  </P> <P> A whole network of institutions must be built to make effective democracy  possible. Independent judiciaries must be created; political parties,  professional associations, interest groups and other nongovernmental  organizations must be fostered and strengthened; the media must become more  competent and professional and be allowed to provide information independent of  the dictates of ruling groups, and civilian control of the armed forces must be  firmly established.  </P> <P> National reconciliation, combined with steady progress toward pluralism and  democracy, is essential to achieve a lasting peace in Central America. The  genius of Esquipulas was its marshaling of concerted, symmetric and reciprocal  external pressures on Central America's countries to open up on competitive  politics. Continuation of such pressure, accompanied by incentives, is much  more likely than military action -- or mere exhortation -- to promote  democracy. What is urgently needed now is a strategy for bringing international  influence to bear more effectively.  </P> <P> We recommend three concrete steps:  </P> <P>  -- We urge the five presidents of Central America to request the United  Nations or the Organization of American States to establish an independent  international committee to evaluate compliance with the political provisions of  Esquipulas. Such a body -- which might include Canada, Spain and West Germany,  for example -- should be responsible for reporting on violations of human  rights, monitoring freedom of assembly and expression, and observing political  campaigns and elections.  </P> <P> Unlike the short-lived verification and follow-up commission established after  Esquipulas, the new evaluation committee should be composed of a small number  of countries accepted as impartial by the five Central American governments; it  should have unimpeded access to all five nations, and should issue periodic  public reports on progress toward achieving the Esquipulas commitments.  </P> <P>  -- International pledges of significant economic assistance should be  conditioned on good-faith efforts by the Central American governments to  negotiate solutions to the armed conflicts as well as on their satisfactory  implementation of the Esquipulas commitments regarding political pluralism and  peaceful political competition. Until progress on both these dimensions has  been achieved, international economic assistance should be limited to  humanitarian relief for the victims of war.  </P> <P>  -- The international community should organize a consultative group to  mobilize resources in support of the Esquipulas process. Specifically, the  group should coordinate economic development assistance, tying it tightly to  each country's progress in implementing the Esquipulas provisions, as evaluated  by the recommended independent body. Positive incentives and sanctions for  non-compliance should be based on a reasonable timetable for progress toward  pluralism and democracy, taking into account each country's circumstances.  </P></p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Iberian currencies are devalued BOTH THE Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo fell to the bottom of their bands against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday after their central banks announced plans to devalue the currencies, writes James Blitz. The Bank of Spain announced at 09.21 GMT yesterday that it was seeking a meeting of the EC's monetary committee later that day for a realignment of the ERM. It was later announced that there would be an 8 per cent devaluation of the Spanish peseta and a 6.5 per cent devaluation of the escudo against their central Ecu rates. Although dealers had anticipated that the peseta would be devalued either before or after next month's Spanish elections, the timing of the move took the markets by surprise. Previous requests for devaluations have come at weekends, and the timing of yesterday's move, at the start of an ERM trading day, suggested that the Bank of Spain had suffered an excessively large drain on reserves when trying to support the currency earlier in the week. On Wednesday evening, one dealer at a major London bank said that the Bank of Spain had spent a large amount of reserves maintaining its exchange rate against the D-Mark. The Bank also bought back options to sell the German currency, probably in the knowledge that these would become prohibitively expensive to hedge after a devaluation. The Bank of Spain's announcement was followed by strong selling of the currency, which fell to Pta76.33 against the D-Mark from Wednesday's close of Pta73.56. The escudo dropped similarly, moving as low as Esc98.23 to the D-Mark from about Esc92.00 of the previous night. The Iberian currency crisis had little immediate impact on the ERM as a whole. The Danish krone came under some selling pressure in the European afternoon, being quoted as low as DKr3.8675 per D-Mark at one stage. However, the overwhelming view in the market appeared to be that the realignment of the Iberian currencies was a separate issue because of the fundamental economic weakness of both countries. According to Mr Avinash Persaud of UBS in London, the fate of both the krone and the ERM will depend on whether the Danes vote 'no' in Tuesday's referendum on the Maastricht treaty. 'Pressure on the Danish krone could blow apart the ERM because there would be no fundamental explanation for it,' he said. Elsewhere in the currency markets, the dollar was firmer against the D-Mark following a surprisingly big 0.4 per cent rise in US April consumer prices. It closed at DM1.6145 from a previous DM1.6115. In New York the US currency ended at DM1.6160. Sterling remained weak, however, amid the poor political situation in the UK. The pound closed at DM2.4625 from a previous DM2.4700.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The commander-in-chief of Russia's Air Force said  NATO's air strikes in the Gorazde area had aggravated the  situation in Bosnia.    General Petr Deinekin told Interfax on Wednesday that  Russian  military experts had predicted that air attacks in Bosnia would  produce no positive results, the warring sides there not being  properly separated.    He cited data according to which the U.S. aircraft, F-16's  in  the first raid and F/A-18's in the second, had used 300-kg bombs  with laser homing heads, able to hit human targets at a distance  of up to 30 meters.    Citing information obtained by the Russian Air Force high  command, Deinekin said that on April 10 the American planes were  planning to raid armored units, but, seeing none, bombed an  artillery command post instead. He said the second strike, made  on April 11, was a failure since only one of the three dropped  bombs exploded.    Commenting on the Bosnian Serb command's statement that NATO  aircraft making new raids would be downed, the general said the  Serb forces positioned in the Gorazde area had no air defenses  or fighter planes. He said the Americans had used an AWACS  control system during the raids.</p>

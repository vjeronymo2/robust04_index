			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOTEL ADDITIONS  </P> <P> Your article on New York City's friendliest small hotels was excellent, however  you missed one that goes out of its way to be much kinder and gentler to its  guests than many I have experienced: the Parc 51, 152 West 51st St.  </P> <P> Everything there is top drawer: cleanliness abounds, excellent 24-hour service,  beautiful rooms and a fine restaurant.  </P> <P> Shame on you for passing it by.  </P> <P> JOSEPH N. FEINSTEIN  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

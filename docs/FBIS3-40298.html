			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Dr. Zlatko Binenfeld, reserve </F> Croatian Army general and adviser to Croatian defense minister,  by Mate Piskor; place and date not given: "Tuzla and Vitez Are  Ecological Bombs"]    [Excerpts] Reporting from the fronts in Croatia and later  also from those in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Croatian media on  numerous occasions has alleged that the Serbian and the Muslim  forces have been using chemical agents banned since 1925 by  international convention. However, there has been very little  credible evidence and this has been the reason why the Croatian  Army so far has not openly reported it, stresses Professor Dr.  Zlatko Binenfeld, reserve general of the Croatian Army and the  defense minister's adviser for research and military-technical  development.    [Piskor] General, your lecture on the application of  chemical welfare in the clashes in the former Yugoslavia, which  was given at Croatian Defense Ministry last week, has perplexed  the public. Why did you present it to the public in such a  shocking way and why only now?    [Binenfeld] You see, I am a scientist and I always insist  that each claim must be supported by the appropriate evidence.  There had been no material evidence for the use of chemical  agents in Croatia even though there was much talk about it. We  have the evidence now and we are presenting it to the public.  This involves an Oganj rocket filled with the CS  [chlorobenzamalonitride] chemical agent, which landed near  Pokupski a year and a half ago and a hand grenade filled with  the same chemical agent that was recently found near Zadar.  <H5>  Shocking Information </H5>   [Piskor] You have stated that the former Yugoslav National  Army has approximately 100 metric tons of CS at its disposal.  How great a danger does this represent?    [Binenfeld] Before I give a specific answer, I must explain  something. I have been studying the problems of protection from  chemical agents for 42 years. I have lectured at the Military  Medical Academy and the Military Technical Faculty in Zagreb, I  was an adviser to the former Yugoslav Government on the  Disarmament Committee in Geneva, and a participant and lecturer  at numerous international conventions on the use of and  protection from chemical agents. Despite this, I did not know  what the Yugoslav People's Army was manufacturing in Bijelo  Polje near Mostar. I thought that that they were manufacturing  quantities of chemical agents that were only sufficient for  protection tests, but in fact they manufactured large  quantities. General Tus, the commander of the air force of the  former Yugoslav National Army in Mostar, was not informed  either, and not even the omniscient CIA had any such notion.  [passage omitted]    [Piskor] There is growing evidence that chemical agents are  being used in the clashes in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that the  Muslim forces are using it increasingly often against the  Croats. What is your view?    [Binenfeld] This whole business about the use of chemical  agents in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and I consider the use of chlorine  to be a chemical agent, started long ago with Silajdzic's  statement that, if given no other choice, they would use  chlorine as a weapon. He threatened to poison all Europe with  chlorine and similar nonsense. Had he used the chlorine in  Tuzla he would have killed his own people first, because a  chemical agent kills unselectively, and especially pays no  attention to ethnicity.    But they really do have 500 tons of chlorine in Tuzla and  now  comes the most dangerous bit about it. They have threatened to  use chlorine against the Serbs and the Serbs have accused them  of actually doing so. However, this is not certain because UN  experts have found smoke boxes and not bombs filled with  chlorine. However, they have used chlorine against the Croats  several times.    When we started to receive the initial reports about the use  of chlorine-filled bombs in Vitez and Busovaca, for a long time  we would not allow this to be revealed to the public until we  held what we considered evidence. Evidence means the name of a  hospital, a date, the name and surname of the patient, date of  birth, symptoms, a medical examination, therapy, and the seal  and signature of the physician in charge. Unfortunately, there  is plenty of such evidence published. We have not received a  denial of a single one either from the Muslims, whom we were  accusing, or from the UN Protection Force. [passage omitted]    [Piskor] Grenades filled with chemical agents are being  manufactured in Tuzla. However, is Tuzla dangerous just because  of this?    [Binenfeld] Precisely. The Sodaso factory in Tuzla is a  real ecological bomb. I studied the Sodaso factory in autumn  1992. Bearing in mind that I obtained information about the  exact quantities of chemicals that they possess from the factory  itself, I informed all the important officials in the world  about the danger. They have all acknowledged it but nobody has  done a thing about it. I have informed the world that the  approximately 60 tons of mercury in Tuzla presents a danger of  contamination spreading via the Spreca River practically all the  way to the Black Sea. The representative of Tuzla in Zagreb has  openly threatened to do this. Bearing in mind that, apart from  mercury, they have more than 150 tons of a chemical similar to  the one in Bhopal, where a tenth of the quantity caused a huge  ecological catastrophe and killed several thousands of people,  it becomes clear why I have said that Sodaso is a real barrel of  gunpowder. There is also a great quantity of hydrochloric acid  and other acids. If an explosion occurred, lethal  concentrations of acids would emerge. It is actually difficult  to anticipate what would happen, how many people would perish,  how many would be injured, and what the environment would be  like afterward. It would be a catastrophe. I have proposed that  these chemicals be transported somewhere safe, but, naturally,  again without any success. [passage omitted]</p>

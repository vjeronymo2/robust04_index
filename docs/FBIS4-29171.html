			<p>BFN     [Text] It is speculated that talks may possibly be held  between the United states and the DPRK (North Korea) around late  June on DPRK's suspected nuclear development. Regarding this  speculation, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai indicated  his negative view at a news conference held on the morning of 15  June, and said: "Judging from the developments so far and the  U.S. position, it is difficult to imagine that such talks will  be held unless DPRK meets the demands of the international  community."</p>

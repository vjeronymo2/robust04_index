			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: BA's flight surcharge Investors buying into the privatised British Airways may have anticipated Mr Peter Lynch's adage: 'I like to buy a company any fool can manage because eventually one will.' With 40 per cent of the landing slots at the world's busiest international airport, it was only a matter of time before a more commercial BA produced the financial goods. The Virgin fiasco aside, BA's management has proved far from foolish. Profits may have fallen heavily to Pounds 185m last year but its performance still contrasts favourably with most international airlines. Yet yesterday's Pounds 442m rights issue highlights how BA is now raising its risk profile. Expensive equity finance is being used to help fund BA's unproven globalisation strategy. This consists of spending Pounds 574m on an array of minority investments in foreign carriers, such as USAir and Qantas, over which BA exercises limited control. BA hopes industry liberalisation will permit greater control, leading to substantial scale economies. This, though, may represent a flight of fancy, given the highly politicised regulatory environment. Without such reform, it seems improbable that BA's investments will produce anything like an adequate return. Although depressed by start-up costs, a Pounds 17m loss from associated investments in TAT and Deutsche BA hardly represents the most auspicious start. Comfort may be drawn from the projected decline in the industry's capacity growth coupled with a pick-up in UK and US passenger demand. This should work wonders for BA's profits over the next two years. Its operational gearing is high; a one percentage point rise in capacity yield adds about Pounds 50m to profits. It would be unfortunate, though, if the timing of the rights issue allowed these short term blandishments to obscure the longer term concerns.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: Earnings rise at leading Japanese drugs groups TWO leading Japanese pharmaceuticals groups reported increased non-consolidated earnings for the year to December. Both companies saw rises in sales and profits from the previous year due to new drug developments. Chugai Pharmaceutical's pre-tax profits rose 11.9 per cent to Y10.5bn (Dollars 81.6m) after a sluggish performance in the previous year, as profits fell sharply in 1990 due to a slump in sales of the group's anti-cancer agents. While sales of its mainstay drugs remain subdued, Chugai's remedy for renal anemia helped push sales of blood and body fluids up 69 per cent to Y22.8bn. For the full year to December, Chugai expects a 13.2 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y12bn on an 8.8 per cent rise in sales to Y145bn. Green Cross, the plasma derivatives maker which was found importing uncertified blood products in 1988, saw pre-tax profits rise 4.6 per cent to Y4.7bn on a 5.8 per cent increase in sales to Y77bn. Net profits rose 69.5 per cent to Y2.2bn. The company's profits were squeezed the previous year due to sluggish demand for its blood preparations. For the current year, Green Cross expects pre-tax profits to remain flat at Y4.8bn on a 3.9 per cent rise in sales to Y80bn.</p>

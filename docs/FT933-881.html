			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / The Labour Party at Brighton: Brown pledges to reverse 'wealth gap' MR GORDON BROWN, the shadow chancellor, yesterday pledged to reverse the 'unacceptable' gap between rich and poor which he said had developed over the past 14 years of Conservative government. Mr Brown said that redistribution of wealth was a central issue in terms of social justice and economic efficiency. 'If you're too poor to pay income tax, you shouldn't have to do so,' he said, 'but if you have the money, the progressive principle will apply.' His comments coincided with the launch of his pamphlet on how a new economic approach could achieve 'full and fulfilling employment'. In calling for demand management and a readiness to challenge the way the market economy works in the public interest, it appeared to be a response to internal party critics who have accused Mr Brown of moving Labour's economic policy too far to the right. As part of the programme of immediate action, it recommends a holiday from national insurance contributions for employers who hire the long-term unemployed as extra staff. Speaking on BBC television's On the Record, Mr Brown rejected the suggestion that in abandoning Labour's taxation policies of the last election he had lost sight of the party's traditional values. He said that the gains by a very few people during the 1980s were 'indefensible', and that he would consider a minimum tax rate for the rich, and changes to tax allowances and to 'boardroom allowances' such as executive share options. It was not a matter of marginal tax rates, but looking at changing the basis of taxation, as the social justice commission was doing. 'The principle is that people should pay their fair share of taxes,' he added, underlining Labour's commitment to giving everyone a chance to fulfil their potential. In his pamphlet, which is reflected in the economic statement to be debated by the conference today, Mr Brown argues that supply-side measures alone are not enough to tackle the UK's unemployment, and calls for an 'enhanced Keynesian approach'. The short-term programme covers measures such as: The national insurance 'holiday' for employers taking on the long-term unemployed. Environmental initiatives to create jobs in areas such as energy efficiency and tackling pollution. Re-training for key occupations in which skills shortages exist. Longer-term proposals include: A tax system which rewards employers who provide training, and a training levy - higher than the previously proposed level - for companies which do not. Access to education and training for all young people; An examination of the entire UK financial system, including pension funds, the stock exchange and the Bank of England, from the point of view of their contribution to investment in the UK. While the tone of the pamphlet marks a shift in Labour's economic thinking, Mr Brown was still quick to dismiss the call from Mr John Edmonds, the leader of the GMB union, that borrowing should be increased by Pounds 10bn as a way to deal with the UK's problems. Saying Mr Edmonds had 'plucked a figure out of the air', Mr Brown said that a Labour government would look at investment projects to see if they met the strict criteria that would justify extra borrowing.</p>

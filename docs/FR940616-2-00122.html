It supports international projects in the United States or overseas involving composers, choreographers, filmmakers [see guidance below], playwrights, theater designers, writers and poets, visual artists, museum professionals [see guidance below], managers and administrators of arts institutions and organizations [see guidance below]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We particularly seek projects with organizations with expertise in the arts as well as broad outreach and networking capabilities into American arts activities nationwide. On its side USIA offers prospective applicants its network of U.S. Information Service [USIS] posts located in American embassies, consulates and cultural centers around the world. Proposals making imaginative and substantive use of this USIS network will have a decided advantage in the competition. Proposed projects should support the USIA mission to increase mutual understanding between the United States and other countries and to promote international cooperation in educational and cultural fields. USIS' role in such projects should be integral and not purely facilitative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

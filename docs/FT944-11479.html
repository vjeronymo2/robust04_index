			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax demand is negligent My daughter has been renting her furnished house in the UK while she is living in Australia. She did not work either in the UK or Australia during the tax year April 1993 to April 1994 and did not leave Australia during that year. The rent from the UK house is her only income for that year, but the Inland Revenue has refused to allow her the UK single personal tax allowances for this year. As a non-resident Commonwealth citizen, she is entitled to a full personal allowance by virtue of section 278(2)(a) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. Write to the District Inspector, marking both your letter and the envelope 'For the attention of the District Inspector': you will probably find the inspector's name printed on the tax office's letterhead. He will be grateful to you for drawing his attention to this example of maladministration. He will also ensure that: 1. Appropriate adjustments are made to the case VI assessments for 1993-94 and 1994-95. 2. Compensation is paid to your daughter for the consequences of the officer's negligent tax demand for 1993-94. 3. All other assessments and repayment claims dealt with by the officer in question are checked by a competent colleague, since it is unlikely that your daughter is the only person who has been over-charged unlawfully. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

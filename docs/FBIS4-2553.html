			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 12 (CNA) -- The cabinet-level  Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) announced Tuesday [12 April] that  it will temporarily suspend all government funded cultural and  educational activities with Mainland China.    The Education Ministry also announced it will no longer  accept applications for mainland artists to perform in Taiwan.    MAC Vice Chairman Su Chi said resumption of cross-strait  cultural and educational activities will depend on how Beijing  responds to a mysterious boat fire in Mainland China in which 24  Taiwan tourists died.    Some of the activities affected by the suspensions include a  planned visit by a mainland printing industry group and a  delegation of presidents from ten Chinese medicine institutes.    A trip to the mainland by members of Taiwan's mass media  will  also be cancelled.    Meanwhile, Taipei Association of Travel Agents President Hsu  Chin-jui said the MAC will announce an all-out travel boycott  against Mainland China within one or two days.    Hsu said the travel association will cooperate with the  boycott and urged all other travel agents to join.</p>

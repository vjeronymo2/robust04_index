			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku, 4 May (AZERTAC)--Manat, Azeri national  monetary unit seems to undergo the same fate as the Ukrainian  Karbovanets. The manats exchange rate against the U.S. dollar  has gone down by 90 per cent and against the Russian ruble by  2.5 times correspondingly. Thus, today one U.S. dollar costs  1000 manats and the Russian ruble 0.6 manats. The Azeri  currency's rapid downfall provoked a feverish mood in the  country. At Baku's parallel market on Molokanka square, the  exchange rate of the foreign currency is being updated up to  three times a day.    However, official exchange rates have not been adapted yet.  According to the information available, the Azeri national bank  pays 182.5 manats per dollar and 1 manat per 10 Russian rubles.  That is why the center of currency transactions has moved from  banking offices at the parallel market. According to  specialists view, this is one more factor provoking the  disastrous downfall of the local currency.    Azeri experts consider the principal reason of the present  economic situation the absence of a flexible monetary policy in  Azerbaijan. Some experts explain this situation by the small  amount of foreign currency that is being earned by Azerbaijan  since the Republic's industry has virtually stopped working.  Moreover, the manat has not become an independent currency and  its condition depends on fluctuation of rate of exchange of the  Russian ruble as the national bank has not determined the manats  real value so far. One of the local televisions observers has  expressed a very original opinion concerning this situation. He  explained it by the reason that governmental officers take their  bribes in freely convertible currency only. However, he may  guess all too near: Baku newspapers give many examples of this  kind.    Though predictions are dismal -- experts think that dollars  rate will increase in about 40 per cent every month -- the  Republic is trying to find the way out from this crisis.  Abolition of the law of limitation on export of strategic goods  will undoubtedly provide more constant flow of currency. The  experts think that the situation might be improved by creation  of currency exchange offices where monetary transactions will be  done in accordance with the reasonable rates of currency. The  experts also say that development of the local industry and  creation of normal conditions for small enterprises will be more  effective in this case.    However, present monetary and credit crisis resulted in  retirement of administration of the national bank. Through the  ever falling manats exchange rate more people live below the  poverty line. Now 60 per cent of the republics population --  about 4 million people -- live in poverty. According to one of  Baku's newspapers, each of the poor needs 12,600 manats monthly,  if not to take inflation into consideration, in order to satisfy  the minimum needs. This amount of money is 70 and 170 per cent  as much as it was necessary in March and January this year.  According to Ministry of Labour and Social Security, one  citizen needs 16 thousand manats for showing a sign of life, it  is a so-called physiological minimum.    Meanwhile, a minimum salary of 900 manats is enough to buy  half a kilogram of meat. So an average citizen of the Republic  has to display miracles of resourcefulness in order not to kick  the bucket.</p>

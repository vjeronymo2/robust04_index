			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Tory MPs face 'civil war' over finance BITTER divisions within the Tory party erupted again yesterday as a rightwing Conservative MP accused some colleagues on the left of the party of trying to create 'civil war'. The fresh outbreak of acrimony came as the rift within the party over government finances was highlighted with a call from a left-of-centre Conservative for an increase in the top rate of income tax. Mr John Townend, chairman of the party's backbench finance committee, attacked loyalists who had called for rebels to be purged from the influential executive of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs in the annual elections in the autumn. Sir George Gardiner, the chairman of the rightwing 92 Group of Tory MPs; Mr Townend and Sir Ivan Lawrence are the most prominent members of the executive in the loyalists' sights. Mr Townend's position on the backbench finance committee could also come under attack. Mr Townend warned that it would be very damaging if the 1922 Committee did not reflect opinion on the right as well as the left of the party, 'and that would be the last thing John Major would want'. Although government loyalists were angry about the persistent revolts during the passage of the Maastricht bill, once the prime minister had won the confidence motion in the Commons in late July, senior backbenchers insisted there would be no 'witch-hunt'. Party managers have underlined the need for the party to unite, but the control of public spending and possible tax rises have provided a new focus for competing ideological pressures. Mr Keith Hampson, Tory MP for Leeds North West, yesterday called for a rise in the top rate of income tax from 40 per cent to 45 per cent. He argued that the almost Pounds 1.8bn raised would enable cuts in tax for those in middle-income groups to go ahead. He told BBC Radio: 'You could then have plenty of scope for indexing properly the top rate, you could have scope for broadening the bottom 20 per cent range, and still have a major contribution to paying off the shortfall in the public spending borrowing requirement.' His suggestion was immediately rejected by Mr Townend, who said that tax increases of about Pounds 10bn had already been accepted through measures such as the extension of value added tax to domestic fuel. Mr Townend said that the emphasis should now be on public spending cuts.</p>

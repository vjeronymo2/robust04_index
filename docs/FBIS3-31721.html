			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 22 Feb (TANJUG) -- Radoje Kontic, prime  minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, who returned  from New York today, said at a news conference at the Federation  Palace [in Belgrade] that his visit to New York was useful and  essentially achieved its objectives.    Speaking about numerous meetings he had in New York, among  them with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and with  ambassadors of the Security Council permanent member states and  other prominent UN figures, the Yugoslav prime minister  emphasized the efforts Yugoslavia was making for a peaceful  resolution of the Yugoslav crisis.    Prime Minister Kontic received support for the Yugoslav  position -- that the planned NATO military action in Sarajevo  could threaten the peace process in Bosnia and bring about an  escalation of the crisis -- during his talks with the Brazilian  ambassador, who is also the president of the UN Sanctions  Committee, the Nigerian ambassador, and in his numerous talks  with representatives of influential UN members such as Japan,  India, EU countries, and with well-known journalists.    Calling for a more aggressive and organized approach by our  country in attempts to break through the information blockade,  Kontic appealed for a stronger offensive by the Yugoslav media  in presenting the truth about Yugoslavia and about our country's  humanitarian needs caused by the vast numbers of refugees of all  nationalities who had found refuge here. Only our reintegration  into the United Nations can make a full contribution toward  peace in the Balkans, Kontic stressed.    With the exception of the official representatives of the  American administration, who he did not meet, most of the  officials with whom he held talks showed understanding and  willingness for the lifting, that is softening, of the sanctions  against our country, Kontic said. Sanctions were described as  counterproductive and inhuman, as an expression of the  international community's inability to influence the resolution  of the crisis through political means.    The first concrete result of my visit to New York, Kontic  said, will emerge in the humanitarian sphere. Due to the  hitherto lack of knowledge about humanitarian needs of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Under Secretary James Grant  promised aid for Yugoslav children to the tune of several  million dollars. While waiting for the sanctions to be lifted,  Yugoslavia will, more easily than before, be able to secure raw  materials for medicines, about which Prime Minister Kontic spoke  with Butrus-Ghali, among other things.    At his news conference, Kontic expressed pleasure for the  timely deployment of UN peace forces on positions around  Sarajevo from where the Serbs withdrew, thus preventing the  escalation of the conflict. He described the NATO ultimatum as:  Knocking on an open door, because back on 6 February Bosnian  Serbs and UN Secretary General's envoy Yasushi Akashi reached an  agreement on the withdrawal of heavy weaponry around Sarajevo  and an agreement on that was later reached by Bosnian Serbs and  Muslims.    Speaking about a meeting with IMF representatives, Kontic  said that this international institution did not change its  attitude toward the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but  underscored the need to maintain constant contacts with the IMF  because of this institution's importance for Yugoslavia's  economic recovery and development.    The Yugoslav prime minister positively assessed his talks  with representatives of our emigrants in the United States, who  displayed significant interest in providing help for the  stabilization program.</p>

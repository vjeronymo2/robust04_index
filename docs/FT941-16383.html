			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Oil leak hits tourism in Puerto Rico Puerto Rico has launched an effort to protect its tourism industry, the pillar of the island's economy, from the effects of an oil spill which has polluted six miles of beaches in the main resort area of San Juan, the capital, writes Canute James in Kingston. The local tourism company has launched a publicity offensive and is offering prospective visitors alternative destinations on the island. The government of the US possession in the north eastern Caribbean is also seeking compensation for economic and environmental damage from the owners of the barge from which the oil started spilling late on Friday. About half the barge's 1.5m gallons of heavy oil has leaked, polluting beaches and moving towards an ecologically sensitive lagoon.</p>

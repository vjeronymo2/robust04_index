			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH IRAQI OFFICIAL VISITS KING HUSSEIN;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: FOREIGN MINISTER BEARS A PERSONAL MESSAGE FROM SADDAM HUSSEIN. BUT  ITS CONTENT IS SHROUDED IN SILENCE.  </P> <P> Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz made a flying visit Saturday to Jordan, a  determined peacemaker in the Persian Gulf crisis, but his mission was shrouded  in silence.  </P> <P> A ranking Jordanian official said only that Aziz had delivered a personal  message to King Hussein on "recent developments in the gulf crisis."  </P> <P> The note from President Saddam Hussein was discussed over lunch, 24 hours  before the Iraqi leader was to speak at Baghdad ceremonies today marking the  Prophet Mohammed's birth date, a day earlier than the rest of the Muslim  world's ceremonies.  </P> <P> Amman diplomats said Saddam Hussein's message could have dealt with any of a  range of issues, including possible feelers on a political solution to the  crisis. But there was little in the week that preceded its delivery that  suggested Baghdad was looking for a way out of the confrontation with Western  forces over the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> A week ago today, Hussein threatened to attack Persian Gulf oil fields and even  Israel if the U.N.-mandated trade embargo began to strangle Iraq's economy. The  threat may have been largely rhetorical, but it was enough to send oil prices  soaring over $40 a barrel in Western markets.  </P> <P> In the same speech, the dogged Iraqi strongman again declared the annexation of  Kuwait irreversible. The U.N. Security Council's answer two days later was  adoption of an air embargo to further tighten the blockade.  </P> <P> The half-day visit by Aziz, who flew into Amman in a small Iraqi government  jet, marked his first visit here since late August, when he met with U.N.  Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. The U.N. leader, searching for the  parameters of a political solution to the gulf crisis, left disappointed. "I  have failed," he told reporters later.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, King Hussein has continued his efforts as a peace seeker, most  recently meeting in Morocco with King Hassan II and Algerian President Chadli  Bendjedid on Sept. 17-20. The three moderate Arab leaders called on Iraq to  make a commitment to withdraw from Kuwait in the framework of a wider  settlement. There has been no public answer from Baghdad, and no anticipation  that one was delivered by Aziz on his visit here.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, King Hussein, the fence-walking monarch of a decidedly pro-Iraqi  populace, postponed Monday's scheduled opening of Parliament for 48 days, the  official Petra news agency reported. No reason was given, but the political  floor of Parliament would give Baghdad enthusiasts a high profile.  </P> <P> In other crisis developments:  </P> <P> * French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas warned that the Paris government would  retaliate if an investigation proves that Iraqi agents are responsible for a  cafe attack that killed a young boy and wounded 17 other people in the former  French colony of Djibouti in East Africa.  </P> <P> In the Thursday night attack, still unidentified assailants tossed grenades  into a cafe crowded with off-duty French servicemen. Djibouti is the major  staging base for French forces being deployed in Saudi Arabia as part of the  Western military force there. The first units of the French Foreign Legion went  ashore Saturday, and the total French commitment is expected to reach 13,000,  the nation's largest overseas deployment since the Algerian war of independence  in the 1950s and early 1960s.  </P> <P> If Iraq is found responsible for the Djibouti incident, directly or indirectly,  Dumas told a television interviewer in Paris, "There will be a response from  France and -- you better believe it -- it will be appropriate to the hateful  nature of this attack."  </P> <P> In the explosive gulf, military analysts fear that even an isolated incident  like the Djibouti attack could trigger a series of escalations that could start  a full-scale war.  </P> <P> * In Cairo, Egyptian military sources told Associated Press that another 1,000  troops left the port of Alexandria for Saudi shores, and the total Egyptian  force by the end of the coming week will be 14,000. Egypt has deployed the  largest non-gulf Arab force in the confrontation. Along with Saudi, Syrian and  Moroccan troops, and non-Arab Islamic forces from Pakistan and Bangladesh, the  Egyptians form the front line in the Saudi desert facing 430,000 Iraqi troops  in Kuwait and the territory north and west of the Iraqi border. The anti-Iraqi  Muslim troops are backed by even stronger Western ground forces, primarily  Americans.  </P> <P> * The Iraqi government denied reports that it would deny rationed food to  foreigners beginning Monday. "There are no instructions to deprive foreigners  from benefiting from the ration cards as claimed by certain hostile media,"  Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said in Baghdad. Press accounts of  the reported restrictions sent a surge of Asian and Egyptian workers seeking  sanctuary across the Jordanian border.  </P></p>

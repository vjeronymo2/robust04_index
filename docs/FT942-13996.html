			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Check-off drive boosts union The GMB general union has increased its membership for the first time since 1990. The union attributes this to the success of its 'check-off' campaign. The campaign was devised in response to the government's requirement that all employees re-authorise their agreement for check-off of union dues from salaries by the end of August. Some unions feared they would lose many members as a result, but the GMB says its membership has increased by 9,470 to 834,571. Several other unions, including the AEEU engineering union, say they are also consolidating their membership in areas where they are already organised.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pro-EC Tories turn on rebels THE GOVERNMENT received a fillip last night when Euro-sceptic Tory MPs who have tried to wreck the Maastricht legislation came under attack from more pro-European colleagues. A stormy meeting of backbench Tories heard attacks by loyalists on Conservative rebels who have voted against the government on procedural motions designed to prevent filibustering on the bill. Although encouraged by government business managers, the row reflected growing disquiet in Tory ranks over the snail-like progress the bill is making through the Commons - and signs that the unease is spreading among ministers. But the rebels said last night that they would continue to oppose the bill. One said: 'It was a good ambush.' About a dozen Tory Euro-sceptics joined with Labour and Ulster Unionist MPs later in voting against the government. With the aid of the Liberal Democrats the government secured a majority of 26 on a motion enabling the debate to continue after 10 o'clock last night. So far 13 days have been spent in the Commons on the bill's committee stage. Britain has come under attack from European Community partners for its slow ratification. Government loyalists are annoyed that debate on Maastricht is squeezing out other government business - such as legislation to crack down on juvenile offenders or reform Sunday trading laws. The loyalists complained that defying the government on matters of principle was understandable, but that attempts to deliberately delay and extend debates were unacceptable and unprecedented. The row erupted at a meeting of the backbench 1922 committee, which includes all Conservative MPs who are not in the government. There were calls for the resignation of members of the 1922 executive who have voted against the government. An all-party campaign for a British referendum on Maastricht was launched yesterday by the Maastricht Referendum Campaign which has Baroness Thatcher as a patron.</p>

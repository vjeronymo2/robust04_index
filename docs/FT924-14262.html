			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Stocks and shareware - Computing A SHARE portfolio would seem an ideal application for computer monitoring. Finding (or devising) a program to satisfy all requirements is remarkably difficult. Every investor needs to know how much each of their shares cost. Not just the cost of the original purchase, but the subsequent history of additions and subtractions through warrants, options, additional purchases, partial sales, rights issues, scrip issues, shares accepted in lieu of dividends; not to mention takeovers, mergers, or simple name-changes. Shares held for any length of time can acquire a history of Byzantine complexity, and the best way of dealing with it will probably always be a loose-leaf notebook with a page for each shareholding. Beyond that basic requirement, different investors want to know different things. Active traders like graphs and understand what an oscillator is. Americans like to contemplate their Return on Investment  - roughly, capital gains (or losses) plus dividends as a percentage of the original investment. I believe that a well-balanced portfolio is best left to its own devices for much of the time, but I need to know which shares are pulling their weight over the longer term. I have been trying out a range of computer portfolio programs, from shareware through cheap-and-simple up to fully-complicated. If you like messing around with computers, you should explore shareware. There are thousands of shareware programs; every computer magazine carries the advertisements for them. You pay a small fee, Pounds 2-Pounds 3, for the disk the program comes on, and for the distributor's trouble. If you like the program and want to go on using it, you are supposed to send some money to its author. The idea could only be American. The sort of preposterous honesty required to make such a system work is commoner, I think, among Americans than Europeans. As a result, most shareware programs, including all the stockmarket ones I could find, are American. Shareware programs cover the full range - you can get databases, spreadsheets, and word processors. But most are smaller programs designed for specific tasks. Most were written by lonely enthusiasts and have an idiosyncratic air. Some are really quite useful. You need an elementary amount of computer savvy to get started, as all you will get from the distributor is a disk or two. You may need courage and patience - a shareware program is guaranteed to work on its author's computer, but could freeze yours solid. The disk you receive will almost certainly contain the text of a manual which you can print out. Paying the author may get you a printed manual and a more up-to-date version of the program; or may provide nothing except a glow of satisfaction. Portfolio monitoring is a popular area for shareware authors. Most programs probably began life looking after their authors' portfolios. Many claim specifically to have been written because the authors could not get exactly what they wanted any other way. This means that there is likely to be a program somewhere whose approach to the problem is congenial with your own. The terminology of US investing can seem odd. But if you remember that they quote share prices in dollars, not pennies, and that each US share has a unique short code name - its 'ticker code' - which your program will surely ask for, the transition is not impossible. Two problems I found insoluble: north American newspapers list shares in alphabetical order; I could not find a shareware program that would let me arrange a portfolio by sectors, in Financial Times order, so that I would not have to wave the newspaper around so much when I was updating the prices. Of the programs I succeeded both in installing on my computer and subsequently understanding, I liked Personal Portfolio Management best. It really is 'intuitive' - the jargon word of praise for a straightforward program. It draws nice graphs. It can manipulate your data to produce a considerable number of useful reports. It can deal with as many shares as your hard disk has room for. I also liked an odd program called PFROI, standing for Portfolio Return on Investment. PFROI is certainly not intuitive. Once mastered, however, it is not difficult to use. It provides a record of share transactions and dividend receipts as well as calculating the return on individual shares and on the portfolio as a whole from any point in the past to any other point - once you have typed in the data, of course. It can handle the excitements of an active trader's life, as well as your great aunt's quieter portfolio. No graphs, alas. If the idea of shareware appeals, try several programs. One of the ones which baffled me completely might be just what you are looking for. Personal Portfolio Management is available from Ensign Systems, London SE26 5BR; 081-778-2871. A catalogue is available on disk for 90p in stamps: specify 3 1/2 or 5 1/4 . PFROI is available from Shareware Marketing, 3A Queen St, Seaton, Devon EX12 2NY; 0297- 24088. Their catalogue is free and is printed.</p>

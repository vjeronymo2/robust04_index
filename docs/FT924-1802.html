			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Growth in south-east Asia behind 31% gain at Courts OVERSEAS growth, especially in the Far East, enabled Courts (Furnishers), the home furnishings group, to report pre-tax profits up 31 per cent at Pounds 2.81m in the half-year to September 26. The shares advanced 25p to 344p. The rise from Pounds 2.14m was also helped by property profits of Pounds 311,000 (losses Pounds 322,000) and was struck on turnover ahead at Pounds 84.2m (Pounds 80.7m). Turnover in the UK fell to Pounds 46.6m (Pounds 48.1m), but overseas it advanced to Pounds 37.6 (Pounds 32.7m), thanks mainly to strong performances from Singapore and Fiji. Sales were up, though less strongly, in Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Mauritius and St Lucia. Consumer confidence in the UK suffered, said Mr Paul Cohen, chairman, from the fear of unemployment, while the housing market remained depressed. Four high street stores were closed, reducing the group's outlets to 95. A new superstore is scheduled to open in Swindon in May. Mr Bruce Cohen, chief executive, said that the group's 28 superstores accounted for two thirds of UK turnover. If a superstore makes Pounds 110 per sq ft, a high-street store makes only Pounds 68, he added. In October, Courts floated 25 per cent of its Singapore subsidiary on the Singapore stock exchange, raising Pounds 6.3m. Other overseas arms to have been floated are: Jamaica, 29 per cent; Barbados 10 per cent and Mauritius 12 per cent. Mr Bruce Cohen said that Malaysia was possibly the next. The interim dividend is held at 1.83p, payable from earnings per share of 4.95p (2.69p). Gearing stood at about the same level as last time's 48 per cent, though Mr Bruce Cohen said that it was nearly twice covered by Courts' internally financed worldwide consumer credit, worth about Pounds 90m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, April 5 (XINHUA) -- It is an urgent  task for the United Nations to establish a set of guiding  principles to ensure a solid political and legal foundation for  peace-keeping operations, said a Chinese delegate here today.    Addressing the U.N. General Assembly's Special Committee on  Peace-Keeping Operations, Zhang Yan said it is highly important  and timely for the committee to re-examine the issue in all  aspects so as to sum up experience and seek improvements.    Zhang said the Chinese delegation believes that the  following  four issues should be focused on.    -- Strict observance of the purposes and principles of the  U.N. Charter. Involvement in whatever forms should help  maintain the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the  country concerned, conform the common desire of the people in  the country and obtain the prior agreement of the parties  concerned.    -- Adherence to the principle of settling disputes by  peaceful means and refraining from using force. The attempt to  stop war by expanding it is undesirable.    -- The key to improving the effectiveness of peace-keeping  operations lies in the full preparedness and acting within  capacity. The Security Council must act prudently in its  decision-making and set forth specific and feasible mandates and  appropriate timetable.    -- Assurance of the U.N.'s leading role in command and  control in peace-keeping operations. A collective U.N. action  based on the will of its member states must be under the  exclusive operational command of the U.N.    U.N. peace-keeping operations have witnessed unprecedented  development and reached an all-time high in terms of number,  scale and scope of their mandates, Zhang added.    Despite their achievements, U.N. peace-keeping operations  are  encountering many new problems as they develop so rapidly.    The U.N. has 71,816 military and civil police peacekeepers  deployed in the world's hot spots for 17 operations, including  30,500 in Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia.</p>

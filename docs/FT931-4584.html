			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: Freia Marabou records increase to NKr534m FREIA Marabou, Scan-dinavia's leading chocolate, sugar confectionery and snacks producer, reported a 4.5 per cent increase in 1992 pre-tax profit to NKr534m (Dollars 75.82m) from NKr512m in 1991, despite weaker sales. Last autumn, Kraft General Foods International paid Dollars 1.5bn in a friendly takeover of Freia, but approval by the Norwegian authorities is not expected until the beginning of April. Freia's sales slipped last year to NKr5.38bn from NKr5.40bn as operating costs dipped to NKr4.62bn from NKr4.63bn. Investments reached a record NKr629m in 1992 against NKr466m in 1991. Group operating profit slipped to NKr520m in 1992 from NKr548m in 1991. Net financial items showed a substantial improvement from a loss of NKr36m in 1991 to a gain of NKr14m last year. Freia attributed the improvement to earnings from sales of shares, currency gains and increased interest income derived from restructuring of the biscuits sector.</p>

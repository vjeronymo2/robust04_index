			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [FINSKA NOTISBYRAN-NORSK TELEGRAMBYRA report: "Date Could </F> Determine Norway's EU Fate"]    [Text] The decision on when the Norwegian referendum on EU  [European Union] membership is to be held could be of crucial  importance for its outcome, a poll published yesterday in the  newspaper NATIONEN shows. According to the poll, the yes side's  only hope is that both Sweden and Finland vote in favor of  membership before the Norwegian referendum.  <H5>  Sweden's and Finland's Decision Is of Great Importance </H5>   Some 55.7 percent of those who took part in the poll said  that they will vote against Norwegian membership if the Swedes  and Finns have also done so. Only 19.4 percent would vote yes  under such circumstances.    If Finland decides to become an EU member while Sweden  remains outside the Union, 48.3 percent would vote against and  24.1 percent for Norwegian membership.    If both Finland and Sweden joint the EU, 39.9 percent of  Norwegians would vote against membership. Under such  circumstances almost the same number of Norwegians -- 37.5  percent -- intend to vote for membership.    The poll is the first which has taken the referendums in  Finland and Sweden into consideration. It was carried out over  the past week.    The Norwegian referendum is likely to be arranged for  November or December.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Formal bids take shape for Channel 5 Virgin, the airline and leisure group, and a number of other media consortia are starting to prepare formal bids for the licence to run Channel 5, the planned commercial television channel. The Independent Television Commission, the body that regulates commercial television, yesterday advertised the 10-year licence for Channel 5. It is scheduled to come on stream by early 1997 and will reach between 52 per cent and 70 per cent of the UK. Mr Robert Devereux, chairman of Virgin Communications, confirmed that his company was likely to mount a bid, although he said it had not yet taken a final decision. He said Virgin envisaged launching a 'general entertainment channel' which would be 'slightly younger and slightly more up-market' than existing terrestrial television services. Virgin could face fierce competition from other bidders. Mr Ward Thomas, chairman of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television, confirmed that his company is to bid. Mr Thomas said he had already identified a number of prospective investors interested in forming a consortium, including several US concerns. 'Our problem isn't attracting enough investment, it's deciding which investors to choose,' he added. Channel 5 Broadcasting, a consortium including Time Warner of the US, Pearson - the media group that owns the Financial Times - and the MAI services group, is also about to make a final decision as to whether to proceed with an application. NBC, the US television network, and CanWest Global Communications of Canada have similarly expressed interest in the channel. Some prospective bidders yesterday voiced concern about the uncertainty as to what proportion of the UK would be covered by Channel 5. Some of its original frequencies have been reallocated by the government for digital terrestrial television. The ITC is applying for international permission for extra frequencies for Channel 5, and is confident that it will reach 70 per cent of UK homes or close to that figure. The consensus among prospective bidders is that Channel 5 will be commercially feasible as long as it reaches more than 60 per cent of the UK. Editorial Comment, Page 21</p>

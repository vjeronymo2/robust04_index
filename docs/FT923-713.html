			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Wembley advances to Pounds 2.5m WEMBLEY, the leisure group, reported a trebled increase in first half pre-tax profits but a reduced interim dividend as consumers continued to show a reluctance to spend. Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman, said last April's optimism about 1992 was based on the assumption that this year would be no worse than last. However takings per head and attendances were both down and operating profit margins fell for the group as a whole. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 709,000 to Pounds 2.5m on sales up 17 per cent at Pounds 96.8m (Pounds 82.9m) in the six months to June 30. Earnings per share rose from 0.16p to 0.27p after allowing for the January rights issue that raised Pounds 37m. Wembley is not anticipating an early improvement in the economy, despite recent renewed hopes of lower interest rates. 'The economy will stay flat this year,' said Sir Brian. 'We are going further than this and assuming that this (level of economic activity) is the new reality.' As a result, Wembley is proposing to cut the interim dividend from 0.9p to 0.2p. The shares closed down 4p at 21p. Asset sales cut gearing to 60 per cent from about 75 per cent after the rights issue. However, Wembley showed a Pounds 1.4m extraordinary item mainly relating to goodwill written off on purchase of the Hong Kong night club which the group has now sold. Operationally, UK trading improved with margins increasing at the Wembley Stadium complex following cost cutting. National Leisure Catering and Keith Prowse tickets had a much stronger first half. The Ticketing Group joint venture with Expedier Leisure was hit by lower attendances at West End theatres. The US had a poorer year because of the translation of dollar earnings into sterling and a turn down in betting at greyhound tracks.</p>

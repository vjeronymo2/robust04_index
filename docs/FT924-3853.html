			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Russia wants arms market access THE Russian foreign minister, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, yesterday urged the west to establish a 'new agenda' for assistance to Russia, providing active support for foreign investment in his country and access to western arms markets. 'Humanitarian aid, for all its importance, is not an answer to the challenges of our time,' he told a meeting of the International Press Club in Moscow. He said Russian democrats needed 'concentrated' assistance to continue reforms aimed at joining the ranks of 'first-class democratic states with market economies'. Allowing the reforms to stop at their 'most difficult, initial stage' would prompt even greater political instability, an explosion of corruption, organised crime and what he called metaphorically 'a series of Chernobyls' - disasters from which the outside world would not be able to protect itself. He urged western governments to provide support for their companies to invest in Russia, which badly needs capital, especially to convert defence plants to civilian uses. Mr Kozyrev also urged the west to make room for Russia in arms markets such as the Gulf and even Nato countries, so it was less dependent on customers like Iran. Mr Peter Aven, foreign trade minister, said yesterday Russia was 'intensively' negotiating to sell Mig-29 aircraft to Malaysia and expected a big increase in arms sales to China next year.</p>

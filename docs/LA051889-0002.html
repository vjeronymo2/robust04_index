			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOKBOOK CORNER: TIME-SAVING CUISINE WITH A FRENCH FLAVOR  </P> <P> Cuisine Rapide by Pierre Franey (Times Books: $22.50, hard cover, 372 pp.)  </P> <P> No one knows better about "Cuisine Rapide" than Pierre Franey, the 60-minute  gourmet, whose series on PBS-TV and the 60-Minute Gourmet column in the New  York Times spanned more years than the topic probably deserved.  </P> <P> Now, switching collaborators to Bryan Miller, who has replaced Franey's old  partner, Craig Claiborne, as food writer and restaurant critic for the New York  Times, as well as co-author of Franey's books, Franey offers more 60-minute  gourmet recipes, this time the published version of a 52-week cooking show on  PBS that premiered in April.  </P> <P> And it does have a familiar ring. Deja vu. But what the heck, the recipes are  basic, good and easy enough for today's no-cook cooks to perform, and if you  are looking for something French, you can't go wrong.  </P> <P> Here are your French recipes with a lazy American twist that even Julia Childs  could not provide as effectively. Franey combines classic techniques with  contemporary tastes, emphasizing calorie-light ingredients, herb sauces, with  little or no salt. There is fat and use of roux in the recipes, but even they  are tempered, considering their normally heavy use in French recipes.  </P> <P> For instance, instead of using all whipping cream for sauce, as many French  chefs might do, Franey dilutes the whipping cream with milk, broth or wine for  a less rich, but also less fatty sauce. Instead of 1/2 cup butter for sauteing  meat and vegetables, Franey cuts the fat down to 1/3 cup. What more can today's  health-obsessed cook ask for?  </P> <P> By the way, if you have to be restrictive about cutting down on fats, sugars,  salt and calories, French recipes are not the way to go.  </P> <P> Franey's culinary past is not particularly illustrious -- really no more or  less illustrious than that of the many fine French chefs working their heads  off at any of the grand and not so grand French restaurants anywhere in the  country.  </P> <P> It's just that Franey, who has a friendly, outgoing manner, happened to be at  the right place at the right time when opportunity knocked.  </P> <P> At 18, Franey came to the United States to operate the French Pavilion at the  1939 New York World's Fair and remained. After a brief stint at the  Waldorf-Astoria, he joined (as poissonier) his old Pavilion days colleague,  Henri Soule, who had just opened a restaurant by the same name in New York.  After a brief career as a G.I., he returned to Le Pavilion as executive chef  and remained until 1960, during which time Howard Johnson Sr., the founder of  the restaurant chain, hired Franey as vice president of his organization.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rewarded With a Job  </P> <P> It was at the Pavilion where Franey and Claiborne, then food editor for the New  York Times, met. Franey's friendship with Claiborne was rewarded with a job as  collaborator with Claiborne at the New York Times. Together they produced the  60-Minute Gourmet column, which Franey has since taken over and which appears  weekly to this day, plus numerous co-authored books.  </P> <P> Personable Franey works hard at what he does and the book shows it.  </P> <P> The recipes have no time limit attribution this time around, but they are  quick, relatively easy and healthful.  </P> <P> Hark: Classic chicken with mustard sauce, using skinless chicken breasts and a  sauce made with cream seasoned with balsamic vinegar and Dijon mustard takes  but minutes to prepare, whether you plan it for company or a quick meal after a  day's work.  </P> <P> There is an a la minute cassoulet, which, explains Franey, was developed to  satisfy a friend (my guess the friend was co-author Miller). He substituted  canned white kidney beans for the haricot blanc beans that require prolonged  soaking. For the garlic sausages, which also require inordinate simmering, he  used kielbasa (Polish sausage) from a local market. For meats, he used boned  duck cut into bite-size pieces, lean pork and lamb.  </P> <P> Otherwise, the recipes are nicely divided among appetizers, soups, seafood  (salmon burgers sound good), poultry and game, beef, ham and pork, lamb and  veal, pasta and rice, plus sauces, condiments and bread (quick French bread is  the only bread). Vegetables and eggs (which include a very nice deep fried  eggplant dish and omelette fines herbes, as only the French know how to make  properly), and desserts are last among the chapters.  </P> <P> What's for dessert? We like the sorbets -- passion fruit, melon and green apple  are among them. There are a couple of nice souffles (hot and cold) and a few  tarts, which are to be expected.  </P> <P> A nice surprise is the inclusion of a few non-French recipes that slipped in  between the covers, such as this one:  </P> <P> CHINESE-STYLE  </P> <P> BROILED CHICKEN  </P> <P> BREASTS  </P> <P> 4 chicken breast halves (about 2 pounds) boned but unskinned and with wings  attached  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> Freshly ground pepper  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons soy sauce  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons maple syrup  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon sesame or olive oil  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon finely minced garlic  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes  </P> <P> Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Combine soy sauce, maple syrup, oil,  vinegar, garlic and pepper flakes in dish large enough to hold breasts in 1  layer. Blend well.  </P> <P> Add chicken breast halves and coat with marinade. Arrange, skin side up, in  dish and cover with plastic wrap. Let stand 15 minutes or until ready to cook.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, preheat broiler or charcoal grill.  </P> <P> Arrange chicken breasts, skin side down, in 1 layer in baking dish. Place  chicken under broiler about 6 inches from heat. Leave door partly open. Cook  about 5 minutes and turn pieces. Cook, skin side up, about 2 minutes. Shift pan  to lower rack so pieces are about 12 inches from heat. Continue broiling, skin  side up, with broiler door partly open about 5 minutes longer.  </P> <P> Turn pieces, skin side down, and broil 5 minutes longer on bottom rack.  </P> <P> Turn pieces, skin side up and pour remaining marinade over all. Place chicken  pieces about 6 inches from heat and broil about 2 minutes. (If you barbecue,  cook chicken on hot grill, covered. Cooking time is same.) Makes 4 servings.  </P></p>

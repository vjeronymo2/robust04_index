			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>   [Text] Agriculture Minister Gillian Shephard today angrily  warned the Bonn Government that Germany will "end up in court"  if it goes ahead with a renewed threat to ban British beef  imports because of mad cow disease.    The news that the ban had returned to the agenda after  Germany had apparently withdrawn its threat was received in  Westminster "like a bolt from the blue."    Britain and Germany are now heading for a bitter diplomatic  battle over a proposal which Whitehall regards as illegal under  the European Union [EU] single market rules.    The row flared up again when German Health Minister Horst  Seehofer said today: "I can't wait any longer. It would be a  culpable delay with all the possible legal consequences." He  said he intended to introduce the ban this month. "We have a  legal basis for the import ban in our meat hygiene law. We have  checked this very carefully. If Brussels should stop us in  whatever way, then Brussels will have to take responsibility for  it."    But Mrs. Shephard did not agree. She told PA News: "It is on  the agenda for the German Cabinet next week. Knowing this I was  in touch with the EU Commissioner last week insisting that he  should, before the Cabinet meeting, remind the German Government  that imposing a unilateral ban within the EU obviously could not  be allowed under European law. He agreed to do so. That was a  pre-emptive strike because this is not allowed and they will  have to end up in the court if this happens."    Mrs. Shephard said German Agriculture Minister Jochen  Borchert disagreed with Mr. Seehofer on the issue. "The whole  business is being regarded with great resentment by the German  beef producers, who also want to prevent the German Cabinet from  doing this. It is not a happy scene and we do know that it is  politically motivated. The utterances of Mr. Seehofer make that  absolutely clear." She said that each time this had come before  the Council of Ministers, "Germany has gone away empty-handed."    Condemnation of the German threat came from all quarters of  the Commons. Shadow agriculture minister Gavin Strang said:  "There can be no justification for a unilateral ban on British  beef."    Dr. Strang's front-bench colleague Elliott Morley said:  "There is no evidence whatever, scientific or medical, to  support the German fears." He agreed it was "cynical" for the  Germans apparently to withdraw the threat just before last  month's summit between John Major and Chancellor Helmut Kohl.    "It is clear they tried to put it on the back-burner so it  would not interfere with negotiations at the summit," he said.  Paul Tyler, the Liberal Democrat agriculture spokesman, said:  "This shows that the much-vaunted special relationshsip between  John Major and Chancellor Kohl is worthless. We had understood  that this issue had been sorted out."</p>

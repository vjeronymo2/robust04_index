			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Savimbi urges west to invest in Angola MR Jonas Savimbi, leader of Angola's rebel Unita movement, yesterday called on western companies to take part in joint venture projects to exploit the country's mineral and agricultural resources, Michael Holman writes. Speaking in London at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, Mr Savimbi described southern Africa's potential as in many ways greater than that of eastern Europe, and called for the creation of a regional economic community. Mr Savimbi, who earlier in the day held a 30-minute meeting with Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said he expected the initialling of an agreement to end Angola's 15-year civil war to take place in Lisbon within the next 48 hours. A foreign office spokesman said that Mr Hurd had welcomed what he called 'excellent news'. Editorial comment, Page 18</p>

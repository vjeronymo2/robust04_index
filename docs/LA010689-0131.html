			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTRACEPTION R&amp;D FALLS OUT OF FAVOR;  </P> <P> OF U.S. FIRMS, ONLY ORTHO CONTINUES RESEARCHING NEW METHODS  </P> <P> Fearful of lawsuits, troubled by attacks from interest groups and worried about  the bottom line, all but one major American drug company have stopped  large-scale research into new kinds of contraception, a trend that many experts  say is leaving women and men with limited choices in birth control.  </P> <P> Among the large firms, only Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. of Raritan, N.J.,  maintains an in-depth research program into new contraceptive technologies,  compared to eight major corporations in the early 1970s, according to data  provided by the Allen Guttmacher Institute, a research organization in New  York.  </P> <P> "It's already made a difference," said Dr. Wayne Bardin, vice president of the  Population Council, a Manhattan-based nonprofit research group. "There are  already incredibly fewer products in the pipeline."  </P> <P> Ortho is working on easier, longer-lasting ways to deliver hormones like those  now contained in birth control pills -- through nasal delivery, injections,  patches and other methods, according to Rich Salem, a spokesman for the Johnson  &amp; Johnson subsidiary.  </P> <P> "Not only have we not abandoned the area, but we have a very aggressive  research and development program to discover and produce new contraceptive  products," Salem said.  </P> <P> But despite the efforts of Ortho, the public sector and perhaps a dozen small  firms, most observers say research and new types of contraceptives coming into  the market have dropped off in the United States.  </P> <P> "We can spend money developing products, but eventually to make the products  available to the public, we have to entice manufacturers to do so," said Dr.  Henry Gabelnick, director of extramural programs and product development of the  Eastern Virginia Medical School's Contraceptive Research and Development  program.  </P> <P> "It ends up with things that have reached a certain point and are ready to be  tested more widely sitting on the shelf," said Gabelnick, whose program is  funded entirely by the U.S. Agency for International Development.  </P> <P> Family planning advocates say the dearth of research limits the options for  both men and women who are dissatisfied with current birth control choices.  </P> <P> Half of women are not happy with their current method of birth control, Bardin  said. That discontent is in part because of side-effects that accompany oral  contraceptives and relatively high failure rates among diaphragms, IUDs,  condoms and other methods.  </P> <P> "There's no contraceptive that's satisfactory for everybody, and so you find  some women who aren't served satisfactorily by any of them," Bardin said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Simpler Methods Needed  </P> <P> The effects of the research cuts are seen in high relief among women and men  who choose surgical sterilization as a method of birth control, often for lack  of a better option, according to Bardin.  </P> <P> Sterilization is the most widely used form of birth control among women aged  15-44 who are sexually active, use contraception and are not trying to become  pregnant, according to figures provided by the Alan Guttmacher Institute. In  1987, one third of those women -- or 13.8 million -- were either sterilized  themselves or had sexual partners who had been sterilized.  </P> <P> Yet, according to a 1982 survey, 10% of U.S. couples protected by vasectomy or  tubal ligation said they would now want to undo the procedure if surgical  reversal were completely safe.  </P> <P> "There's a concern about the early age at which sterilization is accepted,"  Bardin said.  </P> <P> Simpler, more durable methods of birth control would be particularly useful for  teen-agers, who often use no contraception at all. About 96 out of 1,000  teen-aged girls in the United States get pregnant each year, according to Dr.  Louise Tyrer, vice president for medical affairs at the Planned Parenthood  Federation of America.  </P> <P> "They're the group that really needs to be reached with contraception," Tyrer  said, adding that available types of birth control are just one factor  explaining the high pregnancy rate.  </P> <P> In addition, most current birth control devices and drugs focus on women,  instead of men who might benefit from injectable hormones or other long-lasting  technologies. "We need better methods for women, but I think even more  importantly they need some reasonably modern methods for men," said Dr. Philip  Corfman, supervisory medical officer for fertility and maternal health drugs at  the Food and Drug Administration.  </P> <P> The major drug companies give a number of reasons for pulling out of  contraceptive research programs.  </P> <P> G. D. Searle &amp; Co. of Skokie, Ill., pulled its IUDs off the shelves in 1986  but continues to manufacture birth control pills. The firm dropped its IUD line  largely because of what the company considered unwarranted lawsuits that  followed the uproar over A. H. Robbins' Dalkon Shield. "It is not conducive to  making you think of developing new things in an area where there is so much  interest in litigation," said Kay Bruno, Searle's senior director of public  affairs.  </P> <P> Syntex Corp., based in Palo Alto, Calif., is another manufacturer of oral  contraceptives that no longer does extensive research in birth control  technologies. "It's more a matter of looking at how well is the oral  contraceptive population served," said spokeswoman Linda Thomas, who added that  the company feels women are well-served by existing products.  </P> <P> A number of American companies say they can rely on new technologies licensed  from European firms, while U.S. corporations concentrate on cardiovascular and  other drugs. "There's no need to duplicate it here," said Marshall E. Malloy,  manager of media relations for Warner-Lambert Co. of Morris Plains, N.J.  </P> <P> But other observers find more complex reasons for the shift away from  contraceptive research.  </P> <P> Roderick Mackenzie, former president of Ortho and current chairman of  GynoPharma Inc. of Somerville, N.J., which recently introduced a new IUD, said  the root of the problem is scientific. He argued that the important  developments in birth control technology came from a few major scientific  breakthroughs. The first was the invention of the IUD; the second was the  discovery of inexpensive ways to manufacture hormones used in the pill, and,  third, the realization that copper enhances IUD performance.  </P> <P> With the exception of RU-486, the so-called abortion pill recently introduced  in France, there has been no other major innovation to guide companies' basic  research efforts, Mackenzie said. "When you're funding research, you have to  have a plan for where it might take you."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Huge Damage Awards  </P> <P> As the companies lost their sense of direction, they put basic research funds  into other fields, creating a "vicious circle," Mackenzie said. Even Ortho, he  added, does less research than it did 10 years ago, although the company  spokesman Salem said Ortho remains committed to female medicine.  </P> <P> Complicating the scientific problems in contraceptive research were legal and  social troubles that discouraged active laboratory work.  </P> <P> The Dalkon Shield, which drove Richmond, Va.-based A. H. Robbins out of  business, made pharmaceutical and insurance companies wary of the huge damages  awarded in drug liability cases. "The reason the major companies have pulled  out is quite simple: dollars," said Gabelnick of CONRAD. "They are afraid to  take the risks because of the giant lawsuits that have come up."  </P> <P> Even producers of safe products found themselves fearful of litigation, a  situation that clashed with the drug companies' desire to be seen as providers  of good health.  </P></p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Flights of fancy Both the gilt and equity markets this week have impressed with their ability to flourish despite depressing domestic news. Left to their own devices both might have wilted under the impact of disappointing inflation figures and weak industrial production data. Nor was there much to cheer about in the limited flow of corporate news. Yet, thanks to a seemingly inexhaustible flow of overseas buying, equities closed at another record high. The chances are that the inflow will continue for a while longer. That only increases the risk of suspending judgment about underlying valuations. The run-up in telecommunications shares in the wake of the Bell/TCI merger, for example, looks driven by sentiment. More alliances may be formed, but it will be years before multi-media actually generates multi-earnings at the touch of a switch. Rightly or wrongly the markets continue to expect another UK interest-rate cut at the time of the Budget. That should ensure ready demand for the short-dated gilts auction announced yesterday. If inflation does turn back up, though, there cannot be many more rate cuts in the pipeline. Once they are over, gilts will be harder to sell. The markets would have to come back to earth if the government felt compelled to tap the long end of the yield curve again.</p>

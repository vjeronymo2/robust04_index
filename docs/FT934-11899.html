China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec) said it was responding positively to calls by Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, for a lifting of economic sanctions.

South Africa has continued to maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan. China's gross national product is expected to grow by 10 per cent in 1994, according to an economic model developed by the State Statistical Bureau. This compares with an expected 13 per cent growth this year. Capital investment was projected to grow 20 per cent in 1994, retail sales 20 per cent, and consumer prices about 10 per cent.</p>

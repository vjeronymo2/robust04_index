			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHEVRON STOCK DIPS AS TRADERS TIRE OF RUMORS;  </P> <P> TAKEOVERS: RECENT HEAVY TRADING SET OFF SPECULATION ABOUT POSSIBLE SUITORS. BUT  WALL STREET IS GROWING SKEPTICAL.  </P> <P> Shares of Chevron Corp. dipped Thursday as skepticism grew about takeover  rumors spurred by weeks of heavy trading.  </P> <P> The dearth of hard information on who has been buying up Chevron shares had  prompted analysts and traders to speculate that everyone from Pennzoil Co. to  British Petroleum to the Kuwaitis was snapping up Chevron shares.  </P> <P> The buzz drove up the stock's closing price as high as $68.375 on Wednesday.  But on Thursday, the stock fell 37.5 cents to $68 a share on volume of  1,692,300 shares, making it the fifth most heavily traded issue on the New York  Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> The rumor with the most credibility, at least among analysts, held that  Pennzoil was buying Chevron's undervalued shares through third parties, with  $2.5 billion in cash from its settlement with Texaco Inc. in the battle for  Getty Oil Co. Analysts had speculated that Pennzoil might be girding for an  all-out takeover or a forced restructuring.  </P> <P> Increasingly, however, analysts were doubting that relatively small Pennzoil  could muster the wherewithal to make a full-fledged run at the West Coast  energy giant -- a proposition that would cost as much as $35 billion or $40  billion.  </P> <P> "That's a minnow trying to swallow a shark," said one trader.  </P> <P> Marc D. Cohen, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York, agreed.  "For analysts who deal with Pennzoil, none of them seem to believe it," he  said. "That's not to say realistically that Pennzoil did not build a position  in the thing to play stock market. . . . (But) they could have already got  out."  </P> <P> So far, no one knows for sure who has been buying Chevron shares, and Chevron  and Pennzoil have declined to comment on the activity. No one has bought more  than 5%, which would trigger Securities and Exchange Commission filings.  </P> <P> Analysts haven't discounted the possibility that Pennzoil could find a partner  -- possibly British Petroleum, which has said it wants to increase its West  Coast presence. But even that would require substantial financing, hardly a  sure thing in the current market.  </P> <P> Moreover, British Petroleum executives last month told analysts in New York  that the company was entering a period of consolidation and would probably hold  off any acquisitions that would strain the company's debt-equity ratio. A BP  spokesman declined to comment on Chevron.  </P> <P> Paul Ting, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., offered the newest twist on  the Pennzoil rumor: The company is likely to buy just enough Chevron shares to  protect it from paying as much as $800 million in taxes on the Texaco  settlement, making use of an as-yet untested interpretation of tax laws.  </P> <P> To avoid paying taxes on the settlement, which arose from an abortive bid for  Getty, Pennzoil must invest it in assets of "like kind" by the end of 1990. He  pointed to Pennzoil's earlier purchase of shares in Burlington Resources as an  example of the strategy.  </P> <P> What is unclear is whether Chevron stock would qualify, Ting said.  </P> <P> A Pennzoil spokesman acknowledged that the company had considered investing in  assets similar to Getty to avoid tax liabilities. But he declined to go into  details or say whether the company had been buying Chevron shares.  </P> <P> Analysts such as Cohen doubt such a gambit would work, particularly since a  minority stake in Chevron would not compare to the major interest Pennzoil had  sought in Getty. "A company could own 20% of (Chevron) stock and still not have  a board position . . . so the validity of that in tax court would not hold very  much water," he said.  </P> <P> As for any restructuring by Chevron, the company may not have enough cash for a  major stock buyback or dividend payment, especially since it paid mostly cash  in its $2.6-billion deal to buy Tenneco oil and gas reserves last year,  analysts said.  </P> <P> Chevron stock remains attractive to investors, analysts said. Most place a  breakup value of more than $100 per share on Chevron stock, which began  climbing last month. Chevron has traded as low as $43.125 in the last year.  </P></p>

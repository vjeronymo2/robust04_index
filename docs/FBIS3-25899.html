			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Lei (1728 7191)] </F>   [Text] Beijing 25 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The premiere  of the eight-part television film series entitled "Talk About  the Population Issue in Length and Breadth," comprising  voluminous shocking facts and heartbreaking scenes, was held in  Beijing today. Many demographers and television artists believed  it to be "comprehensive, profound and vibrant, a fine political  essay in television film, and a vivid text book for perception  through the senses."    The TV series in question is a joint production effort of  the  Fujian Provincial Census Office and the Fujian North-and-South  Telefilm Center; it depicts the population crisis, one of the  five major crises of mankind in the 20th Century, and the  sternest topic in contemporary Chinese society, on the TV  screen, and sounds the alarm on the population issue in the  economic upsurge. The TV series is China's first attempt to  make profound analyses on a series of issues the population  issue involves, which are closely linked to the Chinese people,  such as the environmental issue, nationals' qualities,  education, housing, resources, aging, and population flow.    At the ceremonies of the premiere held today, related  experts  stated that "the series is a piece of great work that aims at  revealing social issues rarely seen in recent years, thus  pushing Chinese telefilms with themes on social issues to a new  level." Fei Xiaotong, the State Family Planning Commission, and  the State Statistics Bureau highly appraised the TV series,  believing that it was an important result in the excavation and  utilization of the fourth census data, "and an educational  document on the national demographic condition with artistic  value which affords great delight."    Chen Lin [7115 3829], the telefilm series' producer and  Fujian Provincial Census Office director, gave a briefing on the  making of the series on behalf of the production team at the  premiere. The shooting of the film began in Fuzhou in October  1992; the production team covered a distance of some 10,000 km,  with their footsteps covering 13 provinces and cities; aside  from collecting much precious historical date, they also shoot  many heartbreaking scenes on location.    Famous scientist Fei Xiaotong, NPC Standing Committee vice  chairman; and State Councillor Peng Peiyun, concurrently State  Family Planning Commission minister; and State Statistics Bureau  Director Zhang Sai were general advisors of the series. Fujian  telefilm director Su Zhong [5685 11813] was the chief director.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Independent seeks Pounds 20m: Publisher's financial restructuring revealed after Times price cut NEWSPAPER Publishing, publisher of The Independent, is planning to raise up to Pounds 20m in a financial restructuring later this year. The amount of money is at the upper edge of expectations because of the competitive threat from the cut-price Times. The news of the potential scale of the Newspaper Publishing refinancing came on the first day that The Times has been available nationally for 30p - a reduction of 15p. Preliminary reports suggest that the broadsheet daily, one of Mr Rupert Murdoch's five national newspapers, may have increased sales by 15 per cent to 20 per cent - a better performance than last month's experiment in Kent. Mr Peter Stothard, editor of The Times, who first raised the suggestion that newspapers may be too expensive in the UK, said: 'I am very pleased with the first day's performance. It reinforces our view that price is a factor in the market for quality newspapers.' Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, said its salesmen estimated that The Times had increased its circulation of about 370,000 by up to 20 per cent but that the increase had come mainly from new sales. Associated said: 'It looks like a one-day wonder.' It said the Daily Mail had not been affected. Other estimates put the increase in sales at closer to 10 per cent. The performance of The Times, and whether or not the circulation of The Independent suffers, will affect the way Newspaper Publishing refinances. But it is clear that Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Newspaper Publishing, and the rest of the board, are keen to strengthen both the finances and the management of the company. A number of UK investors are said to be interested and nothing has yet been ruled out - including selling a majority stake to a larger group. The emphasis will be on trying to preserve the character of The Independent while protecting shareholder value. Meanwhile, the Office of Fair Trading started informal checks yesterday to see whether an investigation is justified into what Labour has called 'the domination of the media by companies under the control of Mr Murdoch'.</p>

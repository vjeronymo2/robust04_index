			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Zixian (3769 1311 0341) and Chen Baomei </F> (7115 1405 3780): "On Speeding Up the Pace of Getting Onto  Track With the World Economy--A Critique of China's Foreign  Trade Reform for 1994"]    [Text] On 1 January 1994, China merged its exchange rates,  to establish a market-based, single, and managed floating  exchange rate system, which exchange-rate system-reform made a  smooth transition. Meanwhile, we have also achieved conditional  RMB convertibility for everyday transactions, which is a major  step in making the RMB a convertible currency. In addition,  China has also lowered again the import tariffs on some  products, publishing management regulations on machinery and  electronic imports and on ordinary commodity import quotas.  While lifting the obligation of foreign trade enterprises to  turn foreign exchange over to the state, we have also instituted  a uniform value-added and income tax system, abolishing  directive foreign trade planning, which has further deregulated  foreign trade operations, and strengthened foreign trade  coordination mechanisms.    The successive implementation of these foreign trade reform  measures, in contrast to past reform steps, has been a great  breakthrough in areas, such as policy consolidation, operating  deregulation, liability for profits and losses, and equal  competition. It will solve well certain deeper problems that  have long troubled our foreign trade growth, as well as bringing  China's foreign trade system closer to international standards,  and further opening up China's huge markets to the outside world.    The major substance of this round of foreign trade reform is  mainly as follows:  <H5>  I. We Have Established a Market-Based, Single, and Managed </H5> Floating Exchange Rate System, Achieving Conditional RMB  Convertibility for Everyday Transactions.    Since 1 January 1994, the RMB exchange rate mechanism has  become marketized, consolidating the official and market  exchange rates, with the recent exchange rate essentially  maintained at about 8.7 RMB to the dollar. The complete  marketization [commercialization] of our exchange rate mechanism  will help to eliminate existing market distortions, paving the  way for deeper participation by China in the international  division of labor and exchanges based on the comparative  advantage principle. 1) As to China's foreign trade enterprises,  the exchange rate merger and foreign trade reform have  rationalized the distribution relations between the state and  enterprises, by abolishing the obligation of foreign trade  enterprises to turn over foreign exchange to the state either  with or without compensation, and changing to payment of income  taxes according to a uniform enterprise income tax system, which  has helped to consolidate policy, creating a climate of equal  competition for all foreign trade enterprises, giving them  genuine liabiliy for profits and losses and deregulated  operation. 2) The full marketization of our exchange rate  mechanism conforms to GATT and IMF arrangements on not  practicing dual exchange rates, bringing China's foreign trade  system closer to international standards. 3) Our exchange rate  mechanism reform will also help to prevent sharp, unchecked RMB  exchange rate volatility through manipulation of speculative and  psychological-expectation factors, thus bringing trade  convenience to both China and our trading partners.  <H5>  II. We Have Abolished Foreign Exchange Retention, Changing </H5> Our Wholesale Foreign Exchange System to One of Bank Settlement  and Sale of Foreign Exchange.    While merging our exchange rates, we correspondingly  reformed  our foreign exchange management system, changing our past  foreign exchange retention and wholesale foreign exchange  systems to bank settlement and sale of foreign exchange, and  achieving conditional RMB convertibility for everyday  transactions. While our foreign exchange retention system was  a key step in our foreign trade reform of devolving authority to  lower administrative levels, playing a key role in stimulating  the initiative of all to export more, it was also an objective  factor in the formation of departmental, regional, and  enterprise [foreign exchange] ownership, strengthening local  foreign trade protectionism, sharpening market divisions, and  having many negative effects, with the duplicate development of  export manufacturing industries, the too similar export  commodity mix, and the regional divisions in our foreign  exchange conversion market all being involved to a certain  extent. Since we went to the system of bank settlement and  sale of foreign exchange, enterprises can buy foreign exchange  from banks for imports within the limits allowed by national  laws and decrees with valid documents, such as contracts and  payment notices. This has formed a nationally uniform and  standardized foreign exchange market, thus thoroughly breaking  local and enterprise foreign exchange ownership, and helping to  eradicate the impact of local protectionism.  <H5>  III. We Have Abolished Directive Planning, Improving Our </H5> Macroeconomic Regulation and Control of Foreign Exchange.    In order to eliminate the conflict of foreign trade  enterprises having to be liable for their own profits and losses  while fulfilling directive foreign trade plans, in coordination  with our overall plans for foreign trade market reform, the  state conducted a major reform of our foreign trade planning  system, deciding to abolish foreign trade directive planning,  and to draw up guidance plans for overall foreign trade volume,  export earnings, and import exchange use, with the state using  economic and legal means to guide enterprises to achieve  predetermined targets. To ensure a balance of foreign trade  and international payments, the state will use the methods in  current international practice, such as adjusting macroeconomic  policy and taking other GATT-permitted steps, to achieve  balance. Our foreign trade macroeconomic regulation and  control will change from the former regulation and control that  was relatively independent of the national economy to a  basically uniform state.  <H5>  IV. We Have Better Promoted Deregulated Operation, Breaking </H5> With Monopoly, and Bringing Market Competition Forces Into Full  Play.    We have speeded up the examination and approval of foreign  trade operating rights for all types of production enterprises,  as well as clarifying that along with the establishment of a  modern enterprise system, the clarification of property rights,  and the perfection of our legal system, the state will no longer  in the future practice a system of examination and approval of  foreign trade operating rights, with enterprises automatically  having foreign trade operating rights according to law. We  will further deregulate foreign trade merchandise operations  with, except for a very few staple resource-product imports and  exports that will be jointly and uniformly operated according to  international practice, all other commodities being freed up to  deregulated operation, so that full market competition will form  a new and rational operating order.  <H5>  V. We Have Instituted a Modern Enterprise System, Speeding </H5> Up the Conversion of Operating Forces, So That Foreign Trade  Enterprise Operations Can Get On Track With International  Practice as Quickly as Possible.    This related reform of our foreign exchange and tax system  has created the prerequisites for rationalization of the  financial relations between foreign trade enterprises and the  state, making it possible for foreign trade enterprises to  genuinely practice standardized operations in which they are  liable for their own profits and losses. Meanwhile, the  widespread practice of a modern enterprise system, with foreign  trade enterprises being upgraded to corporations, will help to  establish the enterprise operating forces suited to current  market economy norms of distinct property rights, clear rights  and obligations, separation of government administration from  business management, and scientific management.  <H5>  VI. We Have Maintained a Uniform Foreign Trade and Economic </H5> Cooperation Policy, Making It More Transparent.    China has instituted a clearer and more nationally uniform  foreign trade and economic cooperation system and policy, to  promote a sound and improved nationally uniform market, as well  as to meet the needs of international trade standards. In the  interests of transparency, China will in the future apply only  officially promulgated laws, regulations, and policies, which  are uniformly announced to the outside world by MOFTEC.    While foreign trade reform since 1988 has always been in the  forefront of all national reforms, creating positive terms for  expanded opening and faster foreign trade growth, the lack of  reform synchronization has also caused a series of conflicts.  The lack of market reforms in other fields has put severe  limitations on foreign trade growth, leaving foreign trade  falling between the cracks of international and domestic markets  in a particularly difficult situation. The greatest difference  between this 1994 foreign trade reform and past ones is that  this is a part of overall economic reform, being conducted as a  related reform along with others in areas such as tax revenue,  banking, investment, and business. It is precisely due to  these externally related terms that this reform is so  unprecedented in dynamics and depth, so that the reform can  basically establish market operating forces that are on track  with international practice, unlike past reforms that all were  flavored by compromise and transition. This will help to bring  market forces into full play in the foreign trade field, while  making the government's indirect macroeconomic regulation and  control more standardized and effective, thus ensuring positive  and sound foreign trade growth. While it will be impossible to  completely avoid certain new conflicts and frictions, the  general assessment is that the foreign trade operating-system  climate will be much better, which will undoubtedly contribute  to foreign trade growth.    In particular, certain conflicts that affected our 1993  foreign trade, particularly our export growth, such as problems  of jacked-up-price panic buying and cut-price competition  touched off by unequal competition due to nonuniform policy,  foreign trade enterprises being squeezed at both ends by  exchange rate instability, local protectionism driven by  interests such as foreign exchange, and the conflict between  directive export-plan obligations and economic efficiency, can  all be essentially resolved. The existing problem is mainly how  foreign trade enterprises will adapt to the new operating  forces, by speeding up their own reform and development, raising  their management level, and improving their service. In this  area, the crucial factors according to modern enterprise needs  are speeding up the pace of state-owned foreign trade enterprise  reform, and accelerating the conversion of their operating  forces. As to government, how to speed up the establishment of  an indirect regulation and control system suited to market  economy needs, improve macroeconomic regulation and control, and  standardize government functions, are major issues affecting  foreign trade growth prospects, as well as a problem for foreign  trade reform and expansion. How to escape the past customary  form and fixed mode of thinking of direct control, to achieve  indirect control in line with new needs is a challenge to  government at all levels.    As long as we make certain progress in these areas, we can  predict that China's foreign trade will grow more in 1994 than  it did in 1993, with prospects that exports will do better than  their poor growth of 1993, thus achieving our aim of rapid and  stable foreign trade growth, paving the way for long-range,  sustained, and rapid foreign trade growth, and providing more  trade opportunities for all countries throughout the world.</p>

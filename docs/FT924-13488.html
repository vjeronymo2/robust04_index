			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of The Nuclear Industry (7): Chernobyl's shadow looms / A look at safety in eastern Europe THE world nuclear industry can look at the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe in two entirely different ways. The region could be a source of much-needed orders to bring its 58 Soviet-designed reactors up to western standards of safety and efficiency - and perhaps even to build entirely new plants in countries that are particularly short of generating capacity. Upgrading nuclear plants throughout the region would cost Dollars 10bn to Dollars 20bn. Or, if the worst happens and there is another nuclear accident as serious as the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, its impact on public opinion would be serious enough to destroy any prospect of a renaissance in the industry for another decade. Most attention has focused on 25 reactors which western experts believe to be particularly hazardous: 15 Chernobyl-type RBMKs (water-cooled graphite-moderated reactors) in Russia, Ukraine and Lithuania; and 10 VVER-230s (old pressurised water reactors) in Russia, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. The G7 summit meeting in Munich last July considered setting up a Dollars 800m multilateral fund to carry out the most urgent safety work. But the seven leaders failed to agree on the proposal (largely because the US and Japan preferred to make their own bilateral arrangements for nuclear assistance). Instead they passed the problem to the 24 OECD countries, known for this purpose as Group of 24. When officials and nuclear experts from the G24 met in Brussels last month to co-ordinate plans, they heard that firm commitments to safety assistance in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union amounted to little more than Dollars 300m, mostly from the EC. Provisional pledges of aid could take the total to around Dollars 700m. The only significant western-funded safety work undertaken so far has been at Kozloduy in Bulgaria, which was described last year as the most dangerous nuclear plant in the world. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had discovered not only basic design defects - for example, the lack of an emergency cooling system and containment to enclose the reactors in an accident - but also a management and workforce too incompetent and demoralised to run the station safely. Even the basic operating manuals and plant drawings had been lost - or perhaps removed by a departing Russian adviser. Kozloduy is less dangerous today. Twenty nuclear specialists from western Europe have been working there for the past year, under the auspices of the World Association of Nuclear Operators (Wano), to improve the plant's management and operating procedures. Virtually no assistance has yet reached the other nuclear plants of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, after two years of discussion and countless visits by assorted western organisations - nuclear utilities, consultancies, equipment manufacturers and regulatory bodies - all looking for commercial opportunities and often working at cross purposes. Not surprisingly, the operators of Soviet-designed reactors are exasperated by the lack of real help after all the talk, as the heads of the Russian and Ukrainian nuclear utilities made plain on a joint visit to London last month. They said that, whether or not western assistance was forthcoming, they would continue to run their nuclear plants - and do what they could to make them safer from their own resources. 'If western governments will stop just talking and will give real assistance, then we will not reject that help, because it will enable us to solve the safety matters more quickly,' said Mr Erik Pozdyshev, president of the Russian nuclear utility Rosatomenergo. 'But if the help is always delayed, we have the capacity to provide the necessary level of safety for our nuclear stations ourselves.' In the short run, the region is so short of electricity that all available plants will have to run close to full capacity during the coming winter. These include the two surviving reactors at Chernobyl itself, which the Ukrainian parliament has said must be closed permanently by the end of next year. Rosatomenergo plans to keep the 11 RBMK reactors in Russia running well into the next century, after upgrading their safety systems. The Sosnovy Bor plant near St Petersburg - where a radiation leak caused widespread alarm last March - will operate at least until 2003. At the same time Russia will open new PWR-type VVER reactors, starting with a 1,000MW unit at Balakovo which is virtually completed and due to start operating next year. As a result of Chernobyl, public opinion is more hostile to nuclear power in the Ukraine and the country has a moratorium on commissioning new nuclear plants. But Mr Vladimir Fuks, chairman of the Ukrainian utility Ukratomenergoprom, is keen to complete three new VVER reactors which are in the final stages of construction at Zaporozhe, Rovno and Khmelnits. He forecast that parliament would vote next year to commission them if this winter is cold enough to bring severe energy shortages. Meanwhile, Russian nuclear engineers - still proud of their achievements in spite of western criticism - are determined to carry on developing new reactors for the next century. Work on fast (breeder) reactors continues, though at a much slower pace than before the break-up of the Soviet Union, and some believe that their salvation could be a collaboration on fast reactor development between Russia and Japan. The R &amp; D Institute for Power Engineering in Moscow favours a fast reactor cooled by molten lead (instead of the molten sodium favoured in the west) which its scientists say could be developed within 12 years.</p>

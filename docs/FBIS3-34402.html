			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Marj 'Uyun, Lebanon, Feb 7 (AFP) -- [Passage  omitted] A spokesman for the Islamic Resistance, Hizballah's  armed wing, told AFP in Beirut that its guerrillas destroyed an  Israeli Merkava tank, killing or wounding an unspecified number  of Israeli soldiers.    Israeli warplanes later raided Hizballah strongholds near  the  south Lebanon port city of Sidon.    Two Israeli fighter bombers swooped over the Jabal al-Safi  hills southeast of Sidon, firing several missiles at Hizballah  positions, while a second wave of attacks targeted the nearby  village of al-Luwayzah, Lebanese police said.    Three Israeli Cobra helicopters strafed the Iqlim al-Tuffah  ridge, where Hizballah has hideouts dug into rock.    The guerrillas launched three surface-to-air SAM-7 missiles  at the helicopters but missed.    Israeli gunners fired around 150 shells on the Iqlim  al-Tuffah and the southern district of the eastern al-Biqa'  Valley while Hizballah fired around 40 Katyusha rockets into the  security zone, security sources said.    One of the rockets hit a home, near the barracks of the  Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia in Marj 'Uyun,  wounding a woman and her four children, hospital officials said.    The guerrillas also carried out two other bomb attacks on  patrols from the Israeli army and its proxy South Lebanon Army  militia (SLA), apparently causing no casualties.    A 10-year-old child was killed meanwhile and three were hurt  in a landmine blast near the southern port of Tyre, UN  peacekeepers said. It was not clear if the mine was left over  from Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon or if it had been sown  recently.    Israeli army deputy chief-of-staff Amnon Shahaq warned last  month that the Israeli army is "facing a real war" in south  Lebanon against Hizballah.    Last year, 26 Israeli soldiers were killed in clashes in  south Lebanon, compared with 13 in 1992, according to an Israeli  army report.    Hizballah, which is staunchly opposed to Arab-Israeli peace  talks, is the only militia which has not been disarmed by the  Lebanese authorities since the end of the 15-year war in 1990.    It is spearheading anti-Israeli attacks, which eased in the  run up to the January 16 Geneva summit between Syrian President  Hafiz al-'Asad and US President Bill Clinton.    There have been 20 attacks since.</p>

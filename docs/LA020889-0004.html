These weapons cannot be used for any legitimate reason other  than to kill people, and I see no justification for anybody to sell them or  possess them."  </P> <P>  -- Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, who signed an emergency ordinance outlawing  the sale and possession of semiautomatic weapons in the city.  </P></p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Shares win in the long run - A look at a BZW study of equities and gilts IN THE long run, there is no substitute for buying shares. That is the conclusion of the latest edition of the BZW Equity-Gilt Study, which analyses figures dating back to 1918. Over that period, the average annual nominal return on equities has been 11.9 per cent, compared to 6.4 per cent from gilts and 5.5 per cent from cash (Treasury bills). In real (after inflation) terms, shares gave returns of 7.3 per cent a year, compared with 1.16 per cent from gilts and 1.04 per cent from cash. When compounded, the effects of this difference are staggering. Someone who invested Pounds 100 in shares in December 1945 would have turned this into Pounds 34,179 by the end of 1992; the same sum in gilts would have grown to Pounds 1,432 and in cash to Pounds 2,549. In real terms, an investor in gilts has actually lost money over the same period. These returns are gross and ignore the effects of tax and the costs of dealing. Nevertheless, BZW says that even allowing for these costs, shares come out well on top. If you allow for basic rate tax, the real yield on equities over the last 25 years has been 4.4 per cent; allowing for top rate tax, it has been 2.1 per cent. Michael Hughes, managing director of BZW economics and strategy, thinks that shares will continue to outperform, although the gap will be narrower. He is expecting gross real returns on equities to be around 6.5 per cent over the next five years and on gilts to be 3.5 per cent. Gilts will do better than previously because of lower inflation, thinks BZW, and equities will not do quite as well as before because of lower real dividend growth. Nevertheless, Hughes says those real returns could mean that the FT-SE 100 index, currently around 2800, will reach 7000 by the end of the decade. So what should investors do? BZW figures show that an investor who wants the best long-term total return (and is oblivious to risk) should invest totally in shares. Few people are oblivious to risk, however. Michael Hughes suggested a strategy of investing in a portfolio of gilts and using the income to invest in shares via a savings scheme approach. That might be a rather cumbersome strategy. Those who want income might also look askance at shares. But someone who bought a portfolio of shares when Margaret Thatcher took office in 1979 would have seen his income nearly quadruple by 1992. None of this proves that shares will do well in the short term. But for those who can afford to invest for five years or more, the case for shares looks compelling.</p>

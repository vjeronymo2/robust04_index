			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Fall in apprentice figures forecast NUMBERS of apprentices recruited by the engineering industry are likely to fall by 24 per cent this year, says the Sheffield Association of the Engineering Employers' Federation, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. The association, which covers the industry in South Yorkshire and the north Midlands, says its annual survey shows numbers of craft apprenticeships have dropped. But only 5 per cent of companies reported serious skill shortages. However, engineering companies are taking on 26 per cent more graduates, while recruitment of trainee technicians is unchanged. The trends are thought to reflect the changing nature of engineering skills. Recruitment of manual operative and clerical trainees has also fallen.</p>

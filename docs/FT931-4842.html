			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Alusuisse ahead at SFr121m ALUSUISSE-LONZA, the Swiss aluminium, packaging and chemicals group, said its net profit jumped 19.8 per cent in 1992 to SFr121m (Dollars 78.26m), due to large margin gains in its chemical and packaging businesses. Sales rose only 3.4 per cent to SFr6.5bn, but the group benefited from specialising in fine chemicals and environmentally friendly packaging systems. The directors said in the annual report that this result, after a 63 per cent slump in profits last year, was 'satisfactory'. It proved the merit of the group's strategy to restructure its businesses to reduce their vulnerability to economic cycles. Operating profits were up 19 per cent to SFr350m, with packaging profits soaring 51 per cent to SFr127m and chemicals profits advancing 27 per cent to SFr142m. Profits on aluminium businesses, on the other hand, fell 13.5 per cent to SFr83m. In January, the group announced the closure of its last remaining aluminium smelter in Switzerland. Closure costs for this and other restructuring measures jumped by over one-third to SFr97m. The directors said that the strains being felt by other companies in the chemical and packaging sectors in the current recession might throw up further acquisition opportunities for the group. Elektrowatt, the Swiss electric utilities and engineering group, said its net profit in the year to September 30 1992 fell 19 per cent to SFr170m. Sales were up 1.6 per cent to SFr4.61bn.</p>

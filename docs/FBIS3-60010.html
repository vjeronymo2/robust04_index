Over 11 months of this year, only 28.5 kg of  marijuana were seized. It seems that the worst prognoses begin  to be corroborated.    During the same week, 518 actions against smugglers and  violators of customs regulations were brought to court; customs  officers confiscated foreign currencies worth over 1.5 million  karbovanetses, precious metals worth 283 million karbovantses,  and nearly 50 million Russian rubles.</p>

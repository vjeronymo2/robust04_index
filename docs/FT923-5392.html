			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Strains in the ERM THE DOLLAR'S weakness will continue to preoccupy dealers this week, but the strains in the exchange rate mechanism are now of the first importance in Europe, writes James Blitz. At the end of last week, the instability in the ERM was acute. The D-Mark, which should ideally be at the centre of the European Monetary System's grid, was at the top, pushing several currencies towards the bottom of their bands. The Italian lira breached its ERM floor against the D-Mark several times. There are three possible courses of action to combat the crisis: Central banks could continue to intervene to support sterling and the Italian lira. 'Such intervention will buy time,' said Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, 'but it will require a change in economic fundamentals to fully work.' The second possibility is a raising of interest rates by countries with the weaker currencies. 'This is the least desirable option and is likely to be the most counter-productive,' added Mr Lyons. In the UK's case an increase in interest rates will give a better return to sterling investors, but would worsen perceptions of Britain's economic plight. Thirdly, Germany could reduce interest rates or revalue the D-Mark. Although the German economy is slowing, there is little sign that the Bundesbank will cut rates before the year's end. A realignment still seems the best way out of the problem. The traditional obstacle here has been French intransigence because a weaker franc will upset their good record on inflation. But after last week's debacle, the franc is less than 3 centimes off its floor against the D-Mark. Faced with the prospect of raising rates, the French may give way on realignment, after all.</p>

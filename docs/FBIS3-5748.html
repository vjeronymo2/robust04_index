The rice databank said 60 kilograms of "Koshihikari" rice  produced in Niigata Prefecture were traded at between 53,200 yen  and 53,600 yen in Tokyo and Osaka free markets, only 300 yen  higher than a week before.    Although the price of "Kirara 397" in Hokkaido is still  rising, rises in other brands have been shrinking, the  Tokyo-based agency said.    A free rice market official in Osaka said most consumers who  persist in eating domestic rice seemed to have purchased what  they want prior to the distribution of government-controlled  rice, which will be blended with foreign rice to counter the  domestic crop shortfall in 1993.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Skosyrev report: "Three Minutes' Silence on </F> Tienanmen Square. Five Years Ago Chinese Students Challenged  the Party. And the Party Gave the Command: `Fire'"]    [Excerpts] Beijing -- No posters, rallies, or speeches.  There must be no breach of the bans. At exactly 1200 hours on 4  June people will stand in silence for three minutes. That will  be the most fitting means of honoring the memory of those who  died on Tienanmen Square. [passage omitted]    Memories of the bloody internal strife are still alive. The  Chinese have before their eyes another frightening image -- the  disintegrating USSR. References to the unsuccessful "Russian  model" figure frequently in secret publications destined for  career party officials and also in statements by pro-Beijing  politicians in Hong Kong. For instance, one such politician,  Chu Youling, claims that, had it not proved possible to put down  the troublemakers on Tienanmen Square, China would have suffered  Russia's fate.    "I realized that the speeches on Tienanmen Square were the  fruit of student fervor and not of mature analysis," I was told  by a young entrepreneur who five years ago was working as a  reporter and was delighted to heed the calls to establish  democracy in China. Since then he has changed dramatically, gone  into business, and continually goes abroad. In his opinion,  Deng Xiaoping's reforms, socialist in name but capitalist in  essence, open up unlimited oportunities for the private sector  to make money.    Whereas, before, university graduates went to work where  they  were assigned, now many people can choose for themselves  well-paid jobs in joint enterprises or foreign firms. During  meetings with foreign journalists these young people reiterate  in the wake of official propaganda that the right to material  prosperity is more important than all other human rights.    Nonetheless, the lessons of 1989 have not disappeared  without  trace. They primarily gave a huge number of people an  opportunity to see the Communist Party in its true colors and  showed that it is willing to spill blood when its monopoly on  power is at stake. Second, the dissidents say, the glaring  contradiction between liberal reforms in the economy and the  preservation of the totalitarian political regime has become  particularly obvious against the backdrop of those events.    People see corruption and are indignant that party mandarins  in the localities are exploiting their absolute power and  filling their pockets at the treasury's expense.    In the events of 1989 workers played a secondary role and  peasants played none at all. Today they are less and less like  an inert mass. Bribery and corruption among officials and  conflicts over land are arousing peasant unrest in the  provinces. Although overt forms of protest are prohibited by  law, last year, according to the Ministry of Labor, there were  6,000 strikes and demonstrations by workers.    In the opinion of Xu Lianing, a 70-year old scientist who  openly declares his differences with the government, social  contradictions today are more acute than in 1989. If a slump  begins in the economy, as happened in the late eighties, or  overt struggle flares up in the party following Deng Xiaoping's  retirement, renewed upheaval cannot be ruled out. There is no  democratic mechanism in the country to ensure a smooth transfer  of power.</p>

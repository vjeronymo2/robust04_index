			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / C&amp;G cuts home loan rate by 1 point CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester, the sixth-largest building society, reduced its mortgage interest rate yesterday by a full 1 percentage point to 9.75 per cent (10.30 per cent APR), David Barchard writes. Other large lenders, including Halifax and Abbey National, have cut their standard rate by less than 1 percentage point to around 9.99 per cent since the 1-point cut in the base rate to 9 per cent. New customers will benefit immediately but Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's cut does not take effect for existing customers until December 1, a month later than most other lenders. TSB, the sixth-largest UK bank, has also cut its mortgage rate to 9.95 per cent.</p>

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / International Company News: Spanish bank climbs 17.8% BANCO DE SANTANDER, the most international of Spain's big banks, raised net group profits in 1991 by 17.8 per cent to Pta75.1bn (Dollars 777.1m) and will increase its dividend by 11.3 per cent to Pta240 per share, writes Tom Burns. Mr Emilio Botin, chairman, said the results had been positive despite lowered credit demand and a rise in doubtful debts. The financial margin rose by 8.1 per cent to Pta211.9bn and income from fees was Pta70.9bn, up 24.6 per cent on the previous year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Amanda Brown, Health Correspondent, PA News] </F>   [Text] An early warning system aimed at identifying a  nuclear accident abroad was unveiled today - the eighth  anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster.    Rimnet, the Radioactive Incident Monitoring Network, can  identify raised levels of nuclear fall-out, enabling UK-based  emergency services to spring into action.    Environment Minister Robert Atkins told a London news  conference: "Any significant increase in radiation levels  detected by the monitors will raise an alert on the Rimnet  system and trigger alarms in continuously manned offices at my  department."    "If Rimnet had been operating at the time of the Chernobyl  accident, it would have indicated clearly where levels of  radioactivity in the UK rose above normal background variations."    The system, which has monitoring stations across the  country,  can track radiation clouds by using sophisticated data and  mapping equipment, while Government departments could alert  water companies, local authorities and firms in the event of an  accident.    The system will record measurements of radioactivity levels  in air, water, food and people and store them on a database.</p>

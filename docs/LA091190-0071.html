			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO STATE;  </P> <P> SCHOOL TO STAY PUT IN THE WAC  </P> <P> San Diego State will remain in the Western Athletic Conference for at least  another athletic season after the current one. Athletic Director Fred Miller  said he did not notify the WAC of any plans to leave by Sept. 1 -- the date by  which universities must tell the conference if they intend to secede after the  current athletic season.  </P> <P> "There have been some published reports of the WAC talking about expansion,  which I think is healthy," Miller said.  </P> <P> And, he said, nothing is new on the university's hopes to join the Pac-10. That  conference announced a couple of weeks ago that it does not intend to expand.  </P> <P> "I'm glad they're not going to expand now," Miller said. "We need a couple of  years to catch up and expand our attendance. . . . We have to up our attendance  figures. They are very soft -- they are not Pac-10 numbers."  </P> <P> Miller said the Aztecs have sold about 13,000 football season tickets so far --  about 400 or 500 more than last season.  </P> <P> Injury Report: For SDSU, linebacker Lou Foster (hamstring) is probable for  Saturday's game at home against Cal State Long Beach, defensive lineman Steve  Matuszewicz (ankle) is questionable and defensive back Zac Stokes (shoulder) is  doubtful. For Cal State Long Beach, backup tight end Bryon Hamilton (shoulder)  is questionable. Linebacker Jamal Duff did not run in Monday's practice because  of a bruised thigh. . . . Coach Al Luginbill said there would be no major  personnel changes on special teams. "We evaluated and will give everybody the  opportunity to correct what they did wrong on Saturday. This will be it. If  corrections are not made, we'll give others an opportunity," he said. . . .  Luginbill said he was impressed that "30 to 40" players attended a  non-mandatory film session before Monday's team meeting. "There was legitimate  interest and concern as to the way we executed Saturday," he said. "I go the  feeling they're an extremely upset group of young men." SCOTT MILLER  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILD ANIMAL PARK DRAWS WARNING ON INCIDENT INVOLVING ELEPHANT  </P> <P> Discipline exceeding acceptable levels was applied by San Diego Wild Animal  Park keepers to Dunda the elephant in February, 1988, the U.S. Department of  Agriculture has concluded in a letter of warning to the Zoological Society of  San Diego.  </P> <P> The April 6 letter said that results of an investigation by the department's  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service show "repeated disciplinary  measures" on Feb. 17 and 18, 1988, to the 18-year-old female African elephant  "did cause bruising and damage to the skin on the elephant's head and signs of  behavioral stress."  </P> <P> James W. Glosser, inspection service administrator, said that while zoos have  to employ discipline to assure both the safety of animals and the public, "we  must warn you that any further documented use of such excessive disciplinary  measures (as occurred with Dunda) may result in legal action to secure  compliance" with federal laws.  </P> <P> Zoological Society spokesman Jeff Jouett said Monday that its officials  disagree with the letter's conclusion.  </P> <P> "We stand by our own investigation and the investigations by the San Diego  Humane Society, the San Diego city attorney and the American Assn. of  Zoological Parks and Aquariums, which found that Dunda's short disciplinary  training sessions were not excessive and did not cause unnecessary discomfort,"  Jouett said.  </P> <P> Zoo officials maintain that the discipline, which included chaining Dunda's  legs, pulling her to the ground and beating her on the head with ax handles for  short periods, was necessary to train Dunda not to lash out and try to injure  her keepers. The incident occurred shortly after Dunda was transferred to the  Wild Animal Park from the San Diego Zoo, where she had spent most of her life.  </P> <P> Several of Dunda's former keepers at the zoo criticized the sessions as  unnecessary and brutal, but the numerous subsequent investigations produced  conflicting conclusions. While the San Diego Humane Society and city attorney's  office concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute anyone on  animal cruelty charges, the Humane Society of the United States called the  incident a clear case of abuse.  </P></p>

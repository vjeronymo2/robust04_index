			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / A Year of Corruption: Brave judges pursue ministers - France A wave of French corruption scandals this year has led to the resignation of two ministers, the detention of a third and of a senator, the investigation of the presidents of Alcatel and St Gobain as well as of lesser company bosses, and widespread pressure for a divorce between corporate money and politics. As a result, just before Christmas, the French parliament passed a law banning company donations to political parties and candidates. Though he was later forced by public opinion to back new legislation, prime minister Edouard Balladur's initial reaction was to argue that the very fact that scandals were surfacing was proof that existing political financing laws were adequate. To a large degree, he was right. Magistrates are without doubt bolder in their targets and their tactics than they were. A Lyons magistrate had little hesitation in detaining Mr Alain Carignon, the former communications minister, in prison on charges relating to the award of a water contract to Lyonnaise des Eaux by the city of Grenoble, of which Mr Carignon is still mayor. A judge from Rennes has relentlessly pursued Mr Gerard Longuet, the former industry minister, over allegations concerning his personal finances and those of his Republican party. One particular politician-businessman, Mr Bernard Tapie, has complained of a witch-hunt, noting that over the past 18 months investigation of his tangled affairs has involved 60 fraud squad officers detaining 74 people and taking no fewer than 230 sets of fingerprints. Yet it could be argued that it was only Mr Tapie's inclusion in the last Socialist government that prevented these investigations from starting earlier. However, it appears that the the volume - not just the visibility - of corruption may be on the increase, for several reasons. One is that the crackdown on the Mafia in Italy has led organised crime to branch into neighbouring regions, such as the French Riviera. French magistrates now meet regularly with their Italian counterparts to tackle this. A more general problem is the consequence of the past 10 years of devolving more power from Paris to the country's 22 regions and 95 departments. This puts more power to award contracts into the hands of local politicians. And they have used this power. Part of France's new anti-corruption legislation is designed to make the award of public contracts more transparent and therefore less open to suspicion of sweetheart deals between contractors and local politicians. But the law's total ban on corporate contributions to political parties and candidates will return the country to its pre-1988 situation when such contributions were illegal - in theory punishable as a misuse of corporate funds, but in fact widespread and tolerated. 'This will just bring back the era of the bag men,' predicts Mr Guy Carcassonne, a Paris law professor who helped the Rocard government design its 1990 law. This legalised limited corporate political contributions and required them to be reported to a control commission. It has hardly had time to work, and the fear now is that corporate money will continue to flow to politicians, but in envelopes and suitcases.</p>

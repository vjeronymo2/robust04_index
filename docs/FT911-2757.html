			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Northern Telecom will shed 205 posts NORTHERN Telecom, the Ulster telecommunications company, yesterday announced 205 redundancies at its Monkstown factory near Belfast. That brings to more than 800 the number of job losses in Northern Ireland this week. The company, a subsidiary of Northern Telecom Incorporated of Canada, makes advanced transmission systems, terminals, telephone sets and fax machines. It said the job cuts were necessary to enhance long-term business prospects. 'A number of the redundancies will reflect lower-than-forecast levels of demand in some areas, symptomatic of the general economic climate.' Northern Telecom was formerly STC (Northern Ireland). In February, STC made 350 temporary employees redundant at the Monkstown plant. Mr Richard Needham, the province's economy minister, said: 'Northern Telecom (Incorporated of Canada) is a major multinational with an annual turnover of close to CDollars 9bn (Pounds 4.58bn) and 62,000 employees. With the telecommunications sector throughout Europe undergoing rapid and far-reaching change, the company has been examining how the former STC telecommunications operations might be restructured for the long term.' Mr Needham said that under the new business structure, the company would continue as a high-technology plant responsible for the manufacture and development of new products.</p>

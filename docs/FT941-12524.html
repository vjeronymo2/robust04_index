			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / International Company News: SAS may sell leisure unit to Thomson Travel Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) is discussing the sale of its SAS Leisure unit to Thomson Travel of the UK in a move which would combine two of Europe's leading tour operators. Disposal of the unit would be in line with SAS's new focus on core flying operations and would bolster Thomson's strong position in the European travel market. SAS Leisure is Scandinavia's leading tour operator through its Ving and Always units and it has a market presence in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Ving claims to be Europe's fourth or fifth biggest tour group. Other operations within SAS Leisure include a 50 per cent stake in Premiair, the charter airline, and a 49 per cent stake in Spanair. It owns 14 resort hotels, mainly around the Mediterranean Sea. SAS declined to indicate how the talks were progressing. 'We have no comment to make while talks are ongoing,' the company said. Mr Mike Frith, finance director of Thomson Travel, said it was company policy to make no comment. Thomson Travel - part of the Canadian Thomson Group - includes Britannia Airways and Lunn Poly. It is understood there have been other expressions of interest in the leisure unit which is expected to have incurred its first loss in 1993. Last year's performance was affected by recession and the weakening of the Swedish krona. At the nine-month stage, SAS Leisure had plunged to a SKr89m (Dollars 10.2m) loss on revenues of SKr3.43bn. This compares with a SKr64m profit on revenues of SKr6.4bn for the whole of 1992. SAS said it intended to focus on core business last November when it unveiled a SKr1.13bn pre-tax loss for the first nine months and a new round of cost-cutting. The back-to-basics strategy was reiterated by the group's chief executive elect, Mr Jan Stenberg, earlier this week.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL FORMS PARKS COMMISSION  </P> <P> A commission has been formed to oversee city parks, recreation facilities and  parkways.  </P> <P> The City Council created the seven-member commission to reduce the number of  park issues being brought to the council and to give them more intensive  consideration, said Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis.  </P> <P> Genis initiated the drive to form a parkways commission.  </P> <P> "I felt that it was a good idea in that we have a lot of issues relating to  parkways and trees coming to us, and they are important, but they don't have a  forum except for the City Council," Genis said.  </P> <P> "Our parks are important enough to have a committee looking at the issues and  the facilities, and to make sure we have parks that meet the needs of our  citizens."  </P> <P> The commission will consider such issues as how the city uses open space, how  it can incorporate water-saving plants in its landscape and whether to remove  or retain parkway trees.  </P> <P> Interested Costa Mesa residents may apply to the city for consideration. After  final adoption of the commission at the council's next meeting Sept. 3, the  city will review the applications and select the volunteer commission members.  </P> <P> The commission will meet on the first Wednesday of each month and will have as  much authority as the Planning Commission, which makes decisions that are final  unless appealed to the City Council, Genis said.

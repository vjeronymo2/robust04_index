			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / MPs to speed up gas deregulation probe The Commons trade and industry committee is to bring forward an investigation into the government's plans to deregulate the gas market amid MPs' concerns over the role of the regulator. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, is lobbying ministers to meet the deadline for deregulation, which is due to be phased in from 1996, by including a gas bill in the next parliamentary session. Mr Richard Caborn, Labour chairman of the committee, said: 'The regulators are there to regulate and not to develop policy. We must make sure they carry out their terms of reference and not try and formulate policy.' The all-party committee is to launch its investigation into the gas market after the party conferences at the end of next week and plans to publish a report by the end of the year. Ms Spottiswoode yesterday rejected suggestions she had overstepped her role. She said there was 'nothing wrong with the regulator adding her voice' to the debate over gas liberalisation if it helped to 'clear some of the fog'. She had a duty to warn the government that the political uncertainty surrounding a new gas act was damaging to the industry. Some companies keen to enter the domestic market are unlikely to retain their interest if the uncertainty continues, while others will delay making the necessary investments until they know whether full liberalisation by 1998 remains the government's intention. Ms Spottiswoode said she could not let the rumours and 'scare stories' about higher domestic gas prices go by unchallenged if they conflicted with the facts. She described as 'absolute nonsense' rumours that she had threatened to resign if new gas legislation was not put forward. Many MPs are concerned that if the gas market is opened up too quickly it could adversely affect gas prices. Mr Caborn said: 'The report into the industry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommended that deregulation of the market should be treated with caution.' However the Department of Trade and Industry is unlikely to bring forward its plan to open up the domestic gas market if it gains the cabinet's formal approval for the controversial sale of a 51 per cent stake in the Royal Mail.</p>

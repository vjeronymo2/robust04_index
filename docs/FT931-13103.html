			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Rockwell buys Sundstrand unit ROCKWELL International, the diversified US electronics manufacturer, is to acquire the data control division of Sundstrand, for Dollars 225m. Rockwell plans to merge the Sundstrand unit with Collins Commercial Avionics, its civilian avionics business. Sundstrand said in a statement that the sale would result in a 'significant, non-recurring financial gain'. Sundstrand Data Control manufactures flight data and cockpit voice recorders, ground proximity and wind shear warning computers, flight management systems and other instrument systems for use in aircraft. The company has operations in Washington and Arizona and had 1991 sales of approximately Dollars 216m. 'Our decision to sell Data Control is based on our belief that it will be better positioned to serve future integrated cockpit and flight safety markets by teaming with a company whose core business is avionics,' said Mr Harry Stonecipher, Sundstrand chairman, president and chief executive. The Sundstrand unit will be merged with Rockwell's Collins Commercial Avionics, based in Iowa, which produces communications, navigation, flight control and position location products. Rockwell recently reported first-quarter net income of Dollars 127.8m, up 4 per cent from the same period last year. Earnings per share were 58 cents, up from 54 cents. Its sales, however, declined to Dollars 2.49bn from Dollars 2.56bn in the first quarter of fiscal 1992. The company said sales of industrial automation and telecommunications products rose strongly, while earnings of its avionics operations also advanced. Defence electronics earnings declined slightly. Aerospace earnings were down, reflecting lower sales to the Space Shuttle programme.</p>

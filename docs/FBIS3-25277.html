			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Presidency in Lome on 14 February; </F> read by Aouzi Tshinpetse]    [Text] The president of the Republic was informed early  this afternoon about the death of three persons, including  Gaston Edeh Aziandouvo, legislator elect of the Action Committee  for Renewal [CAR] in the second Yoto constituency. He was  kidnapped on Sunday, 13 February, at the environs Agoenyive.    The president of the Republic expresses his indignation at  this odious, gratuitous, and criminal act which he condemns  vehemently. The head of state is asking the government to set up  a commission of inquiry to identify, arrest, and bring to book  those responsible for this crime. The president of the Republic  expresses his condolences to the families of the victims.    In the afternoon of Sunday, 13 February, four persons,  including Gaston Edeh Aziandouvo who was going for a cold drink  at LE CARMEN bar in the outskirts of Agoenyive, was allegedly  approached by two individuals in military attire. These two  individuals seized the vehicle in which the four persons were  and drove them to an unknown destination.    This morning, 14 February, the National Gendarmerie  continued  its investigations to find the lost persons and their  kidnappers, but I was informed this afternoon that three of the  four persons, including Mr. Aziandouvo, were found dead and  burned in their vehicle in the environs of Agoenyive. The  fourth person fled.    The government vigorously condemns these acts of violence  that are liable to jeopardize the peaceful climate that is  indispensable for the smooth running of the electoral process  that will lead to putting in place the democratic institutions.  The government will do all in its power to look for those  responsible for these criminal acts. They have refused to use  democratic means in achieving power and resorted to terror to  satisfy their political ambitions. The government will adopt  every measure to preserve public order, security of persons and  goods before, during, and after the proclamation of the results  of the second round of the legislative elections.    The security forces will look out for those responsible for  the criminal acts. All those who threaten such acts contrary to  peaceful, brotherly, and tolerant democracy to which all the  Togolese people aspire; these antidemocratic citizens will be  hunted down and brought to justice.</p>

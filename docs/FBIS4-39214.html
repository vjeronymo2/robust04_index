			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin has  arrived in Estonia. More details now from Hillar Nahkmann who  has just returned from Tallinn airport.    [Nahkmann] Vitaliy Churkin was welcomed by Raul Malk, his  interlocutor at the negotiations table. Both men emphasized  that this is already their second meeting, continuing the talks  which began in Geneva. During the meeting in Geneva there was a  very friendly and warm atmosphere. Today and tomorrow the two  major issues of the Estonia-Russian talks will be under  discussion -- troop withdrawal and the future of the pensioners,  Russian military pensioners, and their status in Estonia. Both  men were reluctant to speak about this issue. [passage  indistinct]</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY LIFE: GIRL WHO SAYS SHE'S HOMELESS ASKS IF SHE CAN LIVE WITH A NEW  FAMILY  </P> <P> Family Life isn't an advice column, and I'm certainly no Dear Abby. But this  week we have an emergency on our hands in the form of an anonymous letter we  received.  </P> <P> "To whom it may concern," the letter begins. "I am 15 years old. . . . I have a  bad family situation and a week ago I was kicked out. I have a family who will  take me in; I've known them all my life. . . . This family would like to be my  foster parents, but once my family finds out that I went to (them), my father  will flip and he will either kill me or a member of (the other) family. He is  very violent and has no common sense, obviously.  </P> <P> "What can be done in order for me to stay with this family legally? I want to  live a normal life, go to school and be somebody, which I could never do at  home. I only feel safe with (the other family) and I don't, and won't, go with  anyone else. What can be done? Is it possible for them to become my foster  parents? How long will it take? Who should we contact?  </P> <P> "Please help me. There has to be something that can be done, but everywhere we  go and everyone we talk to has all the wrong answers and solutions for me and  my questions regarding my problem and how I want to solve it. Thank you.  </P> <P> "Troubled Teen"  </P> <P> Dear Troubled Teen:  </P> <P> "To live a normal life, go to school and be somebody. . . ." It sure doesn't  seem like too much to ask, does it?  </P> <P> You didn't tell me much about yourself or your situation. I would like to talk  to you and find out more, but all I have are your initials and the post office  box you gave as your return address. For your protection, I've omitted a couple  of details here that could have made you recognizable to someone who knows you.  </P> <P> I wasn't sure what to tell you, so I called some people who could offer you  expert advice. It took several phone calls, and I spent almost as much time on  hold as I did talking to people. Unfortunately, says Agnes Trinchero, executive  director of Florence Crittenton Services of Orange County -- one of the  agencies available to help girls like you -- there is no centralized referral  number for the county.  </P> <P> "I know it can be really frustrating," Trinchero says. But her agency can't  help you, either, until you get things squared away legally.  </P> <P> The hard truth, T.T., is that you might not be able to decide on your own  solution. So says Robert Malmberg, social services director for the Orange  County Child Abuse Registry. Being a minor, you aren't free to make your own  decisions about where and with whom you will live.  </P> <P> Under ordinary circumstances, Malmberg says, the law requires that your parents  must not only know where you are but consent to whatever arrangements are made  for you. But if it's a dangerous situation -- and yours sounds like it may be  -- then legal steps could be taken quickly to protect you from your parents. Or  if your parents still refuse to allow you to come home, then you would be  considered an abandoned child, and they could be stripped of their parental  rights.  </P> <P> Child abandonment is a misdemeanor, punishable by six months in jail or a  $1,000 fine, Malmberg says. "But it's also illegal for (this new family) to  have (the girl) in their home. The law says that you may not sustain an  unrelated minor in your home if you are not licensed as a foster parent."  </P> <P> You aren't breaking the law yourself in being away from home, Malmberg says.  But you need to protect your potential foster parents from possible criminal  charges.  </P> <P> He adds, however, that you may very well be able to continue living with this  family as long as the necessary steps are taken.  </P> <P> Malmberg wants you to call him on the Child Abuse Registry's hotline at (714)  834-5353. You can call anytime, day or night. You may have to wait on hold for  a while, but please be patient. He is in the office during regular business  hours, or he can be paged. "I have a beeper with me 24 hours a day," Malmberg  says.  </P> <P> Or you can talk to one of the social workers there.  </P> <P> When you call, a social worker will arrange to come and talk to you about your  situation. Be open and honest about what's going on, and explain why you are  concerned about your father being violent. Is this something he has done before  to you or someone else? "If she is, of course, in danger, we're not going to  hesitate to find a protective environment for her," Malmberg says.  </P> <P> "As with most situations with adolescents, there are two sides to every story,"  he says. "But generally, when they identify themselves to be endangered, very  rare are the cases we've found to be fictional.  </P> <P> "We like to keep families together if at all possible, but only if it's in the  child's best interest."  </P> <P> You're fortunate, Malmberg says, to have another family to turn to. Most other  kids in this kind of situation aren't so lucky. And if it's determined that it  would be unsafe for you to return home, you "could keep staying with this  family, but they would have to apply immediately for a foster care license."  </P> <P> They would have to be fingerprinted and investigated for any criminal record,  and the house would have to be inspected to make sure it's safe and there is  enough room for you. "Most homes could probably qualify," Malmberg says.  </P> <P> To apply for a foster care license, the family giving you refuge should call  Carol Whelan at (714) 532-7762. Or write to her at 1517 Braden Court, Orange,  Calif. 92668.  </P> <P> If they would like some background information on what it's like to be a foster  parent, have them call Liz Lafferty at Advanced Resources for Foster Kids in  Anaheim, a support organization for foster families, (714) 939-0477. Lafferty  is also willing to talk to you anonymously, but she warns that she would be  required by law to report the situation if she knows who or where you are.  </P> <P> You don't consider yourself a runaway, but if you want to relay a message to  your parents without revealing where you are, you can call the runaway hotline  at 1 (800) 231-6946.  </P> <P> Or if you want advice but aren't ready to put yourself in the hands of the  authorities, call Tom Shaw at the Assessment and Treatment Services Center,  (714) 756-0994. ATSC's motto is "Arrest the problem and not the child." The  agency is focused on helping families and children deal with their problems  without going through the juvenile justice system. ATSC can offer counseling  for you and your parents, if you feel that's the way to go.  </P> <P> Trinchero recommends that you report either to the Orange County Probation  Department at (714) 834-6611 or the nearest police station. You will most  likely be dealing with the authorities at some point, and if you make the first  move yourself, "then they're going to hear your side of the story first, and  that could be to your advantage," she says.  </P> <P> It may or may not help you to know that there are a lot of other troubled teens  out there. "This is a fairly typical problem," Malmberg says.  </P> <P> I'm sending a copy of this column to the post office box you gave me, just in  case you don't see it when it comes out. I promised Malmberg and the other  experts that I would let them know if I hear from you again.  </P> <P> But they couldn't make the same promise to me because your case, like all the  others they deal with, must be kept confidential. Unless you call or write  again, I'll never know what became of you.  </P> <P> So do me a favor. When things settle down and you have a minute, let me know  how it worked out, not just because I'll be curious, but because by then you'll  be an expert, too, and some other troubled teen may be able to benefit from  your experience.  </P> <P> Until then, I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALASKA CLEANUP  </P> <P> I agree that the penalty be fair and not vindictive, but the problem with a  plea bargain in this case is that it can hide the facts, the truth, about what  happened from the public.  </P> <P> What's fair in this case doesn't have to do with dollars, it has to do with the  dishonesty of Exxon in saying that it had the resources available to handle a  spill of this nature and didn't. Exxon has demonstrated almost unbelievable  greed and arrogance throughout this whole matter, and whatever decision is  reached it needs to be one that is most likely to protect the public. Perhaps  it's time to start considering prison terms for corporate executives.  </P> <P> MICHAEL HALEY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

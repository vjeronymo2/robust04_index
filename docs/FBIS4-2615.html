			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Wu Yunhe: "Liu Flies to U.S. in Search </F> of Hi-Tech Farm Goods"]    [Text] Agriculture Minister Liu Jiang headed for  Washington yesterday for high-level meetings that he hopes will  step up farm aid between the two nations.    Liu's two-week visit to America coincides with the Sixth  Meeting of the Sino-U.S. Joint Commission on Scientific and  Technological Co-operation, scheduled for tomorrow.    He will lead a nine-member mission in talks with the U.S.  Agricultural Secretary Mike Espy, as well as join State  Councilor Song Jian's science delegation at the biannual  commission.    Liu is the highest-ranking Chinese agricultural official to  visit the United States this year.    During his talks with Espy and other officials, Liu is  expected to explore Sino-U.S. ties in the farm sector.    China wants to introduce the latest American technology in  high- quality seed breeding, bio-ecology and the processing of  farm and sideline products, the ministry said.    "We also hope to strengthen our technical and economic co-  operation with U.S. farmers, who have shown interest in China's  vast agricultural resources," said Liu Chongmeng, deputy  director-general of the ministry's International Co-operation  Department.    China and the U.S. have enhanced agricultural co-operation  over the past years, and China has provided America with more  than 12,000 scientific and technical research products on  agriculture, especially on disease-resistant plants.    In trade, the government has taken positive steps to  strengthen ties with the U.S., Liu Chongmeng noted.    Agreements signed by Minister Liu and Secretary Espy call  for  the Chinese to designate South China's Hainan Province for trial  production of the American TCK immune wheat seeds, starting this  year.    The government hopes the U.S. will take a positive attitude  toward improving quarantine procedures on imports of Chinese  vegetables, fruits and potted landscape, Liu Chongmeng added.    During Liu Jiang's U.S. tour, he also plans to visit New  York, Chicago and Los Angeles to look at American farms and  agricultural business, and to meet local leaders and  entrepreneurs.    Liu's farm delegation includes the vice-governors of  Liaoning  and Sichuan, the two top agricultural producing provinces.</p>

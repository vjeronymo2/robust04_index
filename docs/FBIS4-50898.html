			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Shanghai Chief Procurator Ni </F> Hongfu by staff reporter Sun Xueyu (1327 1331 0151); date, place  not given: "Newsletter from Shanghai": "New Problems  Encountered in Combating Corruption -- Shanghai's Chief  Procurator Ni Hongfu on Protection of Foreign Businessmen's  Rights and Interests"]    [Text] Shanghai, 25 Apr (TA KUNG PAO) -- Those enterprises  on the mainland which are solely funded by foreign businessmen  generally are private enterprises, and their assets are  privately owned. The management personnel who work in these  enterprises -- including the Chinese management personnel hired  by the enterprises -- are not state work personnel who discharge  public duties according to the law, so when they embezzle  enterprise property their actions do not meet the important  conditions of subject or object regarding the crime of  corruption, as stipulated in the current criminal law, even  though their behavior may correspond to the features of  corruption. Therefore, in the process of judicial practice, it  is difficult to mete out punishment on corruption charges.    Some investors in solely foreign-funded enterprises in  Shanghai have called for the perfection of legislation, prompt  handling of the embezzlement of "private" and solely owned  enterprises' property, and protection of the legitimate rights  and interests of investors. In light of this situation, I have  interviewed Ni Hongfu, Shanghai's chief procurator.  Number of Cases of Embezzlement of Enterprise Assets Increases  [subhead]    According to reports, more and more foreign businessmen have  established enterprises in Shanghai. Up to the end of last  year, registration approvals had been granted to 6,939  foreign-funded enterprises, of which 774 are solely funded by  foreign businessmen, and these sole enterprises have invested  $2.244 billion in Shanghai. At the same time foreign-funded  enterprises were developing in Shanghai, there emerged some  cases of law-breaking, in which some personnel who managed money  and materials in these enterprises abused their positions to  embezzle enterprise property. According to statistics,  Shanghai's procuratorial organs have received 14 complaints, and  the tendency is on the rise.    Ni Hongfu said that the main features of these complaints  are: Management personnel in solely foreign-funded enterprises  abuse their positions to steal and sell property belonging to  enterprise owners, illegally embezzle the money and property of  enterprise owners, transfer enterprise funds to make personal  investments, or use enterprise funds to speculate on the stock  market.  Legal Protection Is Urgently Needed [subhead]    He said frankly that there is a question of which law is  applicable to the handling of these embezzlement cases. These  cases, which have emerged in enterprises solely funded by  foreign businessmen, are new conditions and new problems  emerging since the reform and opening up. According to Ni  Hongfu, the current criminal law was promulgated in 1979, and  was drafted under the highly centralized planned-economy system  of that time, so it would be impossible to have clear  stipulations concerning criminal activities in which internal  personnel embezzle private property of enterprises solely funded  by foreign businessmen. However, whether the legitimate rights  and interests of the solely foreign-funded enterprises can be  protected has a bearing on the legal environment for foreign  businessmen coming to invest in Shanghai. Therefore, these  embezzlement cases also have caused great concern in  procuratorial organs. Not long ago, the municipal procuratorate  and the municipal society of legal studies held a joint seminar  on the protection of the lawful property of foreign-funded  enterprises, and leaders from the municipality's public security  department, procuratorate, and law courts, as well as well-known  legal experts and scholars carried out thorough discussions on  the application of the law to deal with this kind of  embezzlement case.    He disclosed that the participants in the seminar had  reached  a consensus that protecting the legitimate rights and interests  of foreign-funded enterprises is the demand of our country's  "Constitution" and of the "Law on Protection of Foreign-Funded  Enterprises," and that the embezzlement cases occurring in  solely foreign-funded enterprises already have infringed on the  lawful property ownership of citizens and foreign businessmen  protected by law in our country, and have done obvious harm to  society. At a time when calls are made for strengthening  legislation and perfecting the relevant criminal rules and  regulations, it is necessary to actively cite the crimes already  prescribed by the current laws so as to mete out punishment.  Regarding criminal activities that indeed cannot be punished by  directly citing the crimes prescribed by the current laws,  Article 79 of the Criminal Law can be cited for purposes of  deduction so as to mete out punishment. Judicial organs must  coordinate efforts and enthusiastically handle and investigate  criminal activities in which personnel abuse their positions to  embezzle the lawful property of foreign-funded enterprises.  They must steadily, precisely, and harshly hit those who  infringe on the rights and interests of these enterprises.    It Is Effective To Punish According to Criminal Law    Ni Hongfu briefed the reporter on the example of a case in  which a crime prescribed by the current criminal law was cited  to handle and crack down on embezzlement. The Minnesota Mining  Industrial Company Limited, an American company, has established  a solely-owned 3M Company Limited in Shanghai. Its manager  complained that one of his employees, Zhou Yu, while serving as  a warehouse assistant, used the method of dispatching amounts of  goods which were larger than the amounts he recorded in the  delivery record, thereby stealing 600,000 yuan of  telecommunications equipment from the warehouse which he later  sold. Initially, the public security organ thought that Zhou  abused his position to embezzle, so the procuratorate should  handle the case as a corruption crime, but the procuratorial  organ thought that to have a corruption case, the stolen goods  must be public property, whereas the 3M Company is a solely  foreign-funded enterprise, so it was difficult to handle the  case as a corruption crime. After the seminar on protection of  the lawful property of foreign-funded enterprises, the public  security organ and the procuratorial organ reached a consensus,  according to which Zhou's behavior met the theft crime  prescribed by the current criminal law, and the current criminal  law can be cited directly in order to punish him. The municipal  sub-procuratorate then prosecuted him on a charge of theft, and  the municipal intermediate court conducted the preliminary  hearing in late March, sentencing Zhou to death, with a two-year  suspension.    In conclusion, Ni said that the procuratorial organs will  take active measures to handle and crack down on embezzlement in  foreign-funded enterprises, and will spare no effort to optimize  the legal system environment and protect the legitimate rights  and interests of foreign businessmen according to the law.</p>

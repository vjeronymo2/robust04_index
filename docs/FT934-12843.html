			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Employers fear rise in industrial unrest ONE in six of Britain's largest and mostly unionised private-sector employers expect to see industrial conflict in their companies during the next 12 months, says a survey published today by Dibb, Lupton and Broomhead, the solicitors. 'Employers fear a marked increase in industrial unrest as the economy pulls out of recession,' said Mr Paul Nicholls, head of the firm's employment team. While 16.4 per cent anticipated industrial unrest in their companies over the next 12 months, 82 per cent did not. As many as 98.4 per cent of companies surveyed thought it useful to have the option of using the law in an industrial dispute, and the government had 'got it about right' in its labour legislation. But 90.2 per cent preferred to resolve disputes through negotiation rather than using the law. A third of the companies surveyed said they would consider using the provisions in this year's Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act that permit the offer of financial inducements for workers to leave their union. Large employers are prepared to use the law against unofficial strikes - 95 per cent they would do so to stop unlawful picketing. The survey covered 100 large private-sector companies employing a total of 1.5m workers.</p>

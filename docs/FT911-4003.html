			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / The Queen's Awards For Export and Technology 1991 (Company Profiles): Happy occasion for greetings card maker - Second Nature Mr Rod Schrager's business maxim is 'focus at the top end of the market'. In 10 years he has turned a chance holiday encounter into a successful greetings cards company using just that principle. 'A Queen's Award puts the seal on our success in building up a British presence in an international industry', he says. His company Second Nature, a publisher of quality cards and Christmas decorations, has a projected turnover of Pounds 7m this year, and expects to sell more than 1m cards a month - one quarter of which will be outside the UK. By contrast, most greetings card manufacturers do not export very much, he says. The reason is that they focus on the bottom end of the market. Low-priced cards can easily be produced locally, and some designs - including those with a particular country's humour - often do not easily translate to overseas markets. He points to three segments in the greetings card industry: those bought for associates; for family and close friends; and 'the one or two beautiful, more expensive cards for those you are closest to'. Second Nature focuses on the latter two categories, with a series of elaborate cards at higher prices. The company was launched in 1981 after Zimbabwean-born Mr Schrager, who was then working as an accountant for Peat Marwick in the UK, went on holiday to the US. He met a Californian designer who asked him to try to sell some of his greetings cards with floral patterns in Britain. Keeping up the theme, he also suggested a name: Second Nature. Schrager was surprised to find British retailers greatly interested, and on an investment of Pounds 3,000 of his own money, he started to produce the cards himself, with designs under license from the US. His big break came four years ago, when he began to sell pop-up cards. The pop-up was originally invented by the Victorians and then faded out in card designs, although a number of books using the same principle were beginning to emerge in the early 1980s. 'I just brought the idea back up to date,' he says. 'We wanted an unusual design, but one we could produce commercially. It was quite a bold move then.' Second Nature began selling cards at Pounds 2.50, at a time when the average card price was about 65p. 'But there was a definite need for a contemporary card with a higher price.' Now the company has a total portfolio of some 800 cards. Half a dozen of the designs have even been patented, and many use sophisticated paper engineering techniques. The cards are still entirely made in the UK, using labour-intensive hand assembly that can take up to three minutes for each card. The company searched overseas to see if they could be produced more cheaply, but the difference in costs was negligible. None of the company's 65 staff are involved directly in production, however. 'I don't believe it's good to vertically integrate,' says Schrager. 'By contracting out all our assembly work, we can stay on top of innovation and creativity.' The focus on higher-end cards also means that the company's business is less seasonal than for many manufacturers. Nevertheless, Second Nature has launched high quality Christmas decorations using similar sophisticated designs. In two weeks' time, representatives from the company will be anxiously sitting in New York's Waldorf Astoria hotel. They have 11 nominations for the 'Louie awards' - named after Louis Prang, inventor of US greetings cards. But it will be hard to improve on last year, when they were the first company outside North America to win 'Card of the Year'.</p>

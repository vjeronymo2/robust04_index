			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "Evening Information </F> Review"]    [Text] The seminar on business opportunities in Cuba,  sponsored in Havana this week by the British magazine THE  ECONOMIST, revealed the great strides that have been made by the  foreign investment process in Cuba's basic industry.    The basic industry sector includes eight [number as heard]  branches: the production of oil, nickel, glass, paper and paste,  as well as chemistry and mining geology, which have been offered  to potential investors over the past few years for exploitation.    As a result of these negotiations, thus far, Cuba has signed  26 contracts for mineral exploration and exploitation, two for  administrative functions, one for the exploitation of copper in  Pinar del Rio Province, and two partnerships have been  established to conduct feasibility studies of gold, lead, and  zinc deposits.    These agreements, which cover 50 percent of the area up for  bid, include work over an area of approximately 40,000 square km  of national territory; they do not include agreements for the  exploration and extraction of oil. This is another branch of  the basic industry that has made serious progress in the field  of partnerships between the state-owned Cuba Petroleum and  foreign firms.    Regarding oil exploration, 16 of the 33 high expectation  blocks into which the country has been divided, have already  been contracted to French, Canadian, British, and Swedish firms  and, according to Basic Industries Minister Marco Portals, all  of the blocks will have been contracted out by the end of the  year.    The nickel industry, meanwhile, is in the process of  increasing its production after a strong decline that began  following the severing of ties with Eastern Europe, which was  its primary buyer. Cuba diversified its nickel markets and today  exports the mineral to 26 countries. Thanks to economic  partnerships with Canada, The Netherlands, Great Britain, and  Italy, and the efficiency of Cuban specialists and technicians,  production will increase this year. Thus, the growth of vital  branches such as oil, nickel, and cobalt production is  guaranteed by economic partnerships with foreign firms, none of  which, in fact, are from the United States.    Therefore, the economic blockade it decreed against Cuba has  backfired on the United States, which is now deprived of  participation in attractive business opportunities.</p>

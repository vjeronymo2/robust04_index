			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Deming, US quality control expert, dies Mr W. Edwards Deming, the American quality control expert who became one of the most influential figures in modern industrial management, died yesterday peacefully in his sleep at his Washington, DC, home. He was 93. Mr Deming, one of several US quality control experts who taught in Japan after the second world war, playing a crucial role in revolutionising Japanese manufacturing tech- niques and helping the country gain a leading global position in many industries. Although he was revered in Japan, his ideas were largely ignored in his native US until the 1980s, when they contributed to the so-called Total Quality Management (TQM) movement which has helped improve American industrial efficiency. Trained as a statistician, Deming helped develop a theory of how management could gather statistics on subtle variations in manufacturing levels as a way to improve the quality of a company's output, and then expanded this into a theory of management that stressed worker involvement. Leading US companies yesterday expressed sorrow. General Motors said: 'In our view there is no single person in the world that has had a more profound effect on quality processes than did Dr Deming'.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / German economists see gloomy outlook: Institutes forecast conjunction of east's stagnation and west's near-recession GERMANY'S five leading economic institutes have issued a decidedly gloomy prognosis for the coming year, suggesting a dangerous conjuncture of stagnation in east Germany and all-but-recession in the west. Yet even that forecast is based on a series of crucial preconditions for economic recovery, including a gradual recovery of the world economy, strict control of government spending, modest wage demands, and, most important of all, a relatively swift decline in domestic interest rates. The headline figure of a 0.5 per cent growth rate for gross domestic and gross national product next year in western Germany - compared with GDP growth of 1.5 per cent and GNP of 1.0 per cent this year - thus requires a clear relaxation of monetary policy by the Bundesbank. Indeed, one reason for the expectation of a gradual recovery in the international economy is that the Bundesbank will bring down its interest rates sharply, thus allowing the rest of the European Community to follow suit. After a much more hopeful forecast for the German economy in the spring, economists suffered a double disappointment when the international economy failed to pick up and consumer spending in Germany remained sluggish. Industrial orders have been declining for several months, and investment in machinery and equipment is forecast to decline both this year and next. 'Given the obvious insecurity of consumers and investors, it cannot be excluded that the economic downturn will actually accelerate, and last longer than suggested,' they say. 'We do not think this is a probable development, but the dynamics of a downturn, once it is under way, are very hard to predict. 'Whatever happens, it requires strong positive signals to stabilise the confidence of the economic actors in renewed economic growth.' The institutes say that they 'assume such stimulation does indeed come about, and that therefore the downturn will be limited to the coming six months.' Dr Heiner Flassbeck, of the Berlin-based German Economic Research Institute (DIW), who co-ordinated the report, warned that there was a real danger that the downturn in western Germany would have a knock-on effect in eastern Germany, causing western investors to cut back on spending as their profits were squeezed back home. Already there are clear indications of a downturn in investment spending on machinery and equipment in the west: it is forecast to fall from DM239.6bn (Pounds 97bn) in 1991 to DM234.5bn this year and DM228bn in 1993. In the east, in contrast, the forecast is for a rise from DM40.4bn in 1991 to DM48.5bn in 1992 and DM56.5bn next year. The report blames three developments for seriously unsettling the climate in the west: the 'surprising' increase in the discount rate ordered by the Bundesbank in July; the political debate on tax increases which began in August; and the turmoil in the currency markets in September. The belated change of course in interest rates signalled by the central bank, when it cut the Lombard rate from 9.75 to 9.5 per cent in September, was not enough to counterbalance the effect, they say. As for eastern Germany, the problem was in coming up with any reliable predictions at all, given the unreliability of the statistical base. The east's labour market was in a 'desolate' state, with no improvement in sight, in spite of official unemployment figures suggesting a decline in joblessness. From a position at the end of 1989, when there were almost 10m people economically active, there were today barely 6m, of whom 400,000 were on job creation schemes. Official unemployment was 1.1m, or 14.6 per cent, and 250,000 more were on short-time working. 'Real unemployment' - including those on job creation schemes or re-training - was more like 2m, or one quarter of the potential workforce. The institutes argue that there ideally should be a renegotiation of wage contracts across the board, to stop the process of wage equalisation with western Germany until productivity in the east has caught up. Until then, they warn, the gap will mean a severe disincentive to new investors, and an encouragement of capital-intensive, rather than labour-intensive projects - the opposite of what was needed.</p>

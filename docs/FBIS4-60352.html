			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 21 May (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan  al-Alfi has affirmed that deceased lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani  held an important position within the extremist groups. He said  that some terrorists have confessed to the higher state security  prosecution that the lawyer was the direct contact link to  Tal'at Yasin Hammam, the amir of the organization. The latter  died on 25 April 1994 in a clash with the police.    In statements to the Cairo-based AL-AKHBAR newspaper today,  al-Alfi said that 'Abd-al-Harith was moving funds between the  leaders of the organization inside the prison and those outside  it. He was also responsible for funding the activities of the  organization by distributing the support funds from abroad.    In his statements, the interior minister said the dead  terrorist lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani never entered the state  investigations' building. Right after he was arrested, upon  orders from the prosecution, he was taken to the hospital where  he died from a severe asthmatic attack. The interior minister  affirmed that the prosecution had autopsied the body and the  coroner's report has been presented to the public prosecutor.    Al-Alfi noted that the events at the Lawyer's Union, which  were orchestrated by some lawyers who belong to the disbanded  Muslim Brotherhood group, are seen as another ring in the chain  of confrontation between terrorism and security. He pointed out  that these lawyers tried to cause tension among the Egyptian  people.    Al-Alfi said that the police forces were very patient and  showed great self-restraint regarding these events.    He added that he had asked police patrols outside the  Union's  headquarters not to storm the building. He pointed out that he  asked the lawyers to resort to legal channels in order to  present their viewpoints. However, they refused and insisted on  causing this hubbub. Some of them even threatened to march with  weapons.    The interior minister clarified that despite all this, the  police did not resort to the use of the emergency law because  they believe in the sovereignty and legitimacy of the law.</p>

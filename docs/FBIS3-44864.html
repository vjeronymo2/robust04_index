			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Tao Guangxiong (7118 0342 7160): "Luo Gan </F> Requires Public Security Organs To Exert Themselves to Safeguard  Social and Political Stability"]    [Text] Beijing, 8 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEH SHE)--Luo Gan,  state councillor and deputy secretary of the CPC Central  Commission on Politics and Law, today said: To deepen reform  and accelerate development, we must have a guaranteed stable  social and political environment. It is hoped that public  security organs and the armed police force will keep a strong  sense of political responsibility and mission and exert  themselves to do a good job in safeguarding social and political  stability.    When giving a speech at the national meeting attended by  directors of the public security departments and bureaus, Luo  Gan said that this year, a series of major reform measures will  be successively adopted for the finance-taxation, banking,  investment system, foreign trade, and price systems. The depth,  breadth, and intensity of reform will substantially exceed those  in previous years. In the long run, these reform measures are  of great significance for increasing China's comprehensive  national strength, enhancing the people's living standards, and  promoting well- coordinated economic and social development.  However, they will immediately affect various quarters in  different degrees and lead to adjustment of individual  interests. Some new contradictions may thus appear, and some  problems that affect social stability may also be brought about.  Therefore, it is particularly necessary to keep a "sense of  risk."    He said: With economic development, there will be no  foundation for stability and it will not be possible to keep  social order and stability over a long time. Similarly, without  a stable social environment, nothing will be accomplished.  Therefore, going all out to safeguard social stability and  promoting economic construction and advancing reform and opening  is a major point of China's experience in basic practice over  the past 15 years.    Public order and security is a major aspect of social and  political stability. Luo Gan said: In the last few years,  public order and security were stable on the whole, but we  should also note that cases of economic crime and other criminal  cases markedly increased, and various ugly social phenomena also  became rather prominent in some localities. In some localities,  organized crime bearing the character of secret societies also  occurred. Public security organs should adopt effective  measures in light of the new characteristics of law-and-order  problems under the situation of reform and opening, continuously  settle prominent problems in public order and security, and  effectively prevent the appearance of a lawless situation in  some localities.    He stressed the need to intensively and effectively crack  down on various serious criminal activities, and raise the  severe crackdown [yan da dong zheng 0917 2092 2435 3630] to a  new high. The crackdown should achieve a deterrent effect. A  number of prominent problems that threaten the safety of the  masses should be settled in a short time, thus frightening and  deterring criminals and also encouraging the masses. At the  same time, laws must be enforced strictly.    Luo Gan praised the public security organs for their  effective work last year in safeguarding social and political  stability and state security. At the same time, he also  required public security organs to do effective internal  anticorruption work. At present, efforts should be made to  investigate and handle major and serious cases, and effectively  check problems of offending and bending the law in the course of  enforcing it among public security personnel. Corrupt personnel  must be severely punished.</p>

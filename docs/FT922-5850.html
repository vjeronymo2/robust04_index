			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Bank of England faces action threat THE Bank of England faces the threat of industrial action from members of the Bifu finance union for making 41 computer staff compulsorily redundant. 'These are the first compulsory redundancies in the Bank's history,' said Mr Jim Lowe, Bifu assistant secretary. 'Staff are disgusted at the complete lack of consultation. Industrial action has not been ruled out.' The job cuts follow the Bank's decision to contract work out to computer services company Hoskyns. Bifu's information technology staff committee, which represents all IT staff at the Bank, is meeting this morning to decide what action to take.</p>

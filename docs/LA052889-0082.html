			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SHE POUNDED MY BEDROOM DOOR';  </P> <P> HERO DOG WINS PRAISE FOR SAVING HER OWNER  </P> <P> When the phone rings at Luella Ball's Arcadia home these days, the caller  usually wants to reach a resident named Shasta.  </P> <P> Shasta, however, can't come to the phone. She is usually napping on the car  seat of a '72 red Opel or hiding under a camellia bush.  </P> <P> A petite, 20-pound white spitz, Shasta is a hero dog in big demand. In January,  a fire engulfed Ball's den at 2 a.m., and before the flames spread to the rest  of the house, the dog awakened her sleeping owner. Recently, Shasta won an  annual heroism award from the Los Angeles Society for Prevention of Cruelty to  Animals.  </P> <P> "Every time the phone rings, it is something about Shasta," said Ball, 75, a  longtime Arcadia resident.  </P> <P> There have been offers of free dog food from a kennel club, requests for  interviews and an invitation to appear at a spitz show.  </P> <P> The fluffy, 4-year-old canine has been in the limelight ever since the pre-dawn  Jan. 13 fire. An ember from a fireplace ignited a recliner chair -- where  Shasta sleeps -- then spread to other furniture, the carpet and the drapes. A  television and a stereo melted into Dali-like forms. The smoke was thick and  the heat intense.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Overcome With Smoke'  </P> <P> "She was so overcome with smoke that she could not bark," Ball said. "Two times  she pounded my bedroom door with her body."  </P> <P> That noise was enough to wake Ball, who, with another dog, managed to make her  way to the kitchen to dial 911. Shasta was unable to walk any further, so Ball  had to push her out the back kitchen door.  </P> <P> Ball and the dogs were unharmed in the blaze. By the time the fire was  extinguished, they had recuperated from smoke inhalation. For the next five  months, they lived in Ball's recreational vehicle until repairs on the house  were completed.  </P> <P> Word of Shasta's bravery reached the Los Angeles SPCA, which decided to give  her the seventh annual Hero Dog Bruce Farrell Award. The award was established  by Pauline De Farrell when her dog, Bruce Farrell, saved her from an attacking  Great Dane. A plaque and a $100 check were presented to Ball and Shasta at a  recent ceremony.  </P> <P> "I feel she suffered an awful lot," Ball said, holding Shasta in her lap.  "During the fire, all I could think of was to get out with her."  </P> <P> The rescue is somewhat of a role reversal for Ball. For 20 years, she has been  a foster parent to abused and neglected dogs. She would often take in several  dogs at a time until permanent homes could be found. An avid gardener, Ball  would sell her staghorn ferns, citrus trees and iris bulbs to pay for  veterinary bills.  </P> <P> She says that before the fire, she was planning to retire from this  time-consuming role and put Shasta up for adoption because of her constant  barking and obedience problems. Several interested people called her and  offered to adopt Shasta.  </P> <P> But just as Ball had rescued Shasta from a neglectful owner a year and a half  ago, Shasta had saved her life from the fire.  </P> <P> "She has attached herself to me," Ball said. "In my heart that changed my  mind."  </P></p>

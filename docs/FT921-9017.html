			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy Government ministers rarely go so far as to admit that unemployment figures are horrible. But the employment secretary was unusually muted in his response to yesterday's heavy increase. If the trend continues, the forthcoming general election may prove even more finely balanced than the opinion polls suggest. The notion that the regional pattern of unemployment might actually benefit the government in marginal constituencies looks slightly weakened by the widespread nature of the most recent job losses. The political equation is further complicated by the welcome news that the annual increase in average earnings has fallen below 7 1/2 per cent for the first time in 25 years. Moreover, it will doubtless fall again as large pay increases from a year ago fall out of the equation: the three-month rate of increase is already touching 5 per cent and heading lower. The benefits to come from inflation are obvious. The question is whether the voters will care more about stable prices than unstable jobs.</p>

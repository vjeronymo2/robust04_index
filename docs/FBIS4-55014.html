			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Geneva, May 6 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Deputy Prime  Minister Zeljko Simic said on Friday U.N. special envoy for  former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi had confirmed his principled  stand that only peace for all of Bosnia-Herzegovina could  provide a sound foundation for a sensible and lasting political  settlement. In a statement to TANJUG, Simic said Akashi had  told him on the telephone he would continue to insist on  neutrality in the Bosnian civil war and non-use of force in  dealing with the problem.    Simic, who attended the sixth session of the working group  for economic issues of the Geneva-based international conference  on the former Yugoslavia, on Friday met with conference  co-chairman Thorvald Stoltenberg, Akashi's closest aides,  several influential international figures and representatives of  international institutions. Among others he met with the  director of the International Migration Service, with whom he  had what he described as a cordial and constructive meeting  which focused on a draft agreement on regulating the status of  the organization's Belgrade office.    During the meeting, Simic spoke of the intention of some  West  European countries to launch a coordinated action of  repatriation of Yugoslavs, mostly ethnic Albanians from the  Serbian province of Kosovo-Metohija. The Yugoslav official also  met with Croatian ambassador in Geneva Miomir Zuzula, with whom  he discussed normalization of bilateral relations.    Simic described the sixth session of the economic group as  unsuccessful and dismissed as unfeasible a proposal put forth by  chairman Jean Durrieu for reviving and reconstructing the  economic space of former Yugoslavia. This goal is unattainable  for as long as the civil war in Bosnia rages on and sanctions  against Yugoslavia are in force, he explained.    Later on Friday, Simic is due to meet with the other  co-chairman of the international conference on the former  Yugoslavia, Lord Owen, and the president of the World Health  Organization. He may also meet with U.N. Secretary-General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali before returning to Yugoslavia later tonight.</p>

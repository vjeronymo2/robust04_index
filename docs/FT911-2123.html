			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Observer: Sales pitch The world's art and property markets may be suffering from indigestion at the moment but Sotheby's, the ever-optimistic fine art auctioneers, still thinks it can find someone to pay at least Pounds 55m for a house in Spain. Admittedly, Barcelona's Casa Batllo is rather special. Designed by the modernist Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi in 1904 for a wealthy textile manufacturer, Josep Batllo, the eight-storey house is a national monument. Its soft curving lines, ornate towers and rooms shaped like water-worn caves, would make it an ideal home for an arts foundation or a trendy retailer. Don't forget Barcelona is the site of the next Olympic games. Iberia Seguros, the insurance company which owns the Gaudi extravaganza, picked Sotheby's because it wanted someone who knows something about art. Seguros' president Enrique Bernat, whose Chupa Chups is also the world's biggest lollipop manufacturer, says the sale 'is like launching a balloon into the air. It is impossible to put a price on a work of art like this and we will see how high it will go.' With that kind of sales pitch, one can see why there is no asking price. But do I hear Pounds 70m, or 16bn yen?</p>

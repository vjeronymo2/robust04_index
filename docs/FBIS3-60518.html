The report provided by that institution's public relations  office claims that its units are working in the town of  Chiquimula and other settlements in the department, transporting  the victims.    Between Wednesday and yesterday, Friday, the CVB [Volunteer  Firefighter Corps] ambulances have taken 85 patients to the  Chiquimula National Hospital, 54 of whom proved to have  contracted the disease.  <H5>  In the Urban Area </H5>   It was added that, in the town of Chiquimula, there are  cholera victims in the Cuatro de Febrero, El Angel, La  Democracia, and El Molina districts, to which the CVB ambulances  have been dispatched.    It was also noted that, of the cholera patients in the town  of Chiquimula, one adult and one child have died; however, more  deaths are feared, because the same circumstances are prevalent.  <H5>  In the Rural Area </H5>   It was further explained that seven more persons died of the  disease in the municipality of San Juan la Ermita, and that  there is evidence of many other victims in that entire section.    Elsewhere in the report, it was noted that another young  girl, aged 16, had died from cholera in Equipulas, and that  patients from the villages of Marraxco and Canan are appearing  at the national hospital.    The volunteer firefighters added that cholera victims have  also been reported in the villages of Shusho Arriba and Shusho  Abajo. Although these volunteers have but little equipment, they  are responsible for transporting the patients.    At the national hospital as well, work is being done with  only meager resources available. Nevertheless, the staff's major  effort is aimed at saving the lives of patients, many of whom  are already in an advanced state of dehydration upon arrival.    The volunteer firefighters explained that, if the rate  continues as it is now, they will have to request aid from their  headquarters in the capital, so as to be reinforced with  personnel and equipment, in addition to ambulances for moving  the patients.</p>

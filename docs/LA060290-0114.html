			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH FOR CHRIST HEADQUARTERS LEAVING ILLINOIS FOR COLORADO  </P> <P> Youth for Christ, an evangelical organization that had Billy Graham as one of  its first employees, has announced that it is moving its national headquarters  to Colorado Springs, Colo.  </P> <P> Its headquarters had been in Wheaton and Carol Stream, Ill., in suburban  Chicago, which has been called the nation's evangelical capital because of the  many Christian groups based there.  </P> <P> Youth for Christ has 235 chapters around the country, 900 staff persons and  8,000 volunteers.  </P> <P> Officials of the organization said that Dallas, Indianapolis and Orlando, Fla.,  were also considered for the new headquarters.  </P> <P> Reasons for the move included lower costs and a desire to develop "more of our  own identity" by relocating "out of an area where there are so many Christian  organizations."  </P> <P> Another large organization, Campus Crusade for Christ, last year announced that  it will move its headquarters from San Bernardino to Orlando.  </P></p>

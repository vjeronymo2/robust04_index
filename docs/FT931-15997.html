			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Laporte wins the battle for Evode LAPORTE yesterday won its battle with Wassall for control of Evode with a recommended Pounds 129.4m bid for the chemicals and plastics group. Wassall, the mini-conglomerate, immediately dropped its hostile offer worth Pounds 113.2m. Mr Chris Miller, chief executive, said: 'It took us just 50 seconds to make our exit. We were outbid by an expensive strategic buyer. Laporte must have really wanted it.' Laporte is also offering a full cash alternative of 115p a share compared with Wassall's 95p in cash. Mr Andrew Simon, Evode's chief executive, said the fight for Evode had enabled him to secure the best price. 'Laporte's offer has blown Wassall out of the water. It is the best possible deal for shareholders.' Mr Simon is to become a non-executive director of the enlarged Laporte, while Mr David Winterbottom, Evode's chief executive, is to become a full time consultant for a year. It is the first deal Wassall has failed to win since the two former Hanson exectuives founded the group four years ago. Mr Miller, said: 'We identified a good target which was undervalued and badly managed but we were not willing to overpay. Our failure to win does not put us off from going hostile again.' Laporte's shares fell by 27p to 583p. Since announcing its talks with Evode, its share price has fallen by 10 per cent. Evode's shares rose 13p to 119p, while Wassall's firmed 1p to 210p. Schroders, which is advising Laporte, yesterday bought another 6.1 per cent of Evode, which with irrevocable undertakings from shareholders, took Laporte's stake in Evode above 20 per cent. Laporte is also raising Pounds 84.4m via a placing and 1-for-10 open offer at 560p per share. At the close of business on December 13, it had outstanding net debts of Pounds 127.3m, while Evode had net debts of Pounds 41.9m. Laporte is offering 23 new shares for every 112 Evode shares, valuing each Evode share at 120p. The offer values Evode's convertible preference shares at 104p on the basis of five new Laporte shares for every 28 preference shares. There is also a full cash alternative worth 100p. The chemicals company has focused its activities into five core areas which comprise construction chemicals, organic speciality chemicals, absorbent chemicals, hygiene and process chemicals and metals and electronics chemicals. For the financial year to January 3 1993 Laporte is forecasting pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 86m (Pounds 97.2m) and earnings per share of not less than 39p (50p) with a total dividend of at least 19.5p (18.9p). Laporte also announced the acquisition of Silo, the Italian manufacturer of synthetic iron oxide colouring pigments, for Pounds 6m. Silo also has borrowings of Pounds 17m. In 1991, Silo's sales were Pounds 16.1m and operating profits Pounds 2.8m. Wassall is likely to cover the expense of its failed bid with the Pounds 1m it made from the sale of its 2.5m Evode shares which it bought at around 80p a share. See Lex</p>

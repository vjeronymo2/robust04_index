			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Carpizo urged to make arrests MEXICO'S new attorney-general, Mr Jorge Carpizo, is under growing pressure to make early arrests following the gunning down of 24 men of the Pena family in the state of Guerrero last week, writes Damian Fraser. The state's public prosecutor has named 18 of 30 suspects thought responsible for the massacre in the town of Tlacotepec and is investigating motives including competition over drug-trafficking, revenge between families, or a combination of the two. The men were killed, allegedly by a rival local clan, after attending the funeral of three other members of their family. The scale of the crime, even by the violent standards of Guerrero, has shocked Mexican opinion. The region of Tlacotepec is well-known for its bountiful crops of heroin poppies and marijuana, the mainstay of the otherwise impoverished local economy. Mr Carpizo has been ordered to crack down on drug-trafficking in an effort by the government to limit politically embarrassing incidents, such as that at Tlacotepec, usually associated with it. Over the weekend Mr Carpizo took some steps in this direction, arresting a former under-director of federal police, for alleged corruption. Another 22 senior or medium level officials from the judicial police are also being investigated.</p>

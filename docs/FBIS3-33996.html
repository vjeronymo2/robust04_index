This statement of  U.S. interference cannot be accepted. The U.S. President, in  reply to Congressman Gary A. Condit and 15 other legislators,  demanding an active U.S. diplomatic role in Punjab, has assured  them that his administration shares their "desire for a peaceful  solution that protects Sikh rights" and promised to take up the  issue with authorities in New Delhi. There should be no doubt,  however, that what is being cleverly camouflaged as defence of  human rights is in fact a brazen interference on the part of the  Clinton administration in India's internal affairs. Indeed,  contrary to a widespread illusion among New Delhi's policy  makers that Washington under a Democratic Party president would  hold India in a tight embrace, Mr. Clinton has lost no  opportunity to bare his fangs at this country. In fact, there  has not been a single issue in the past year which has revealed  that Mr. Clinton's set-up has the slightest consideration or  respect for India's autonomy. Instead what has been flaunted as  the administration's fresh "even handed" approach towards the  subcontinent has essentially meant a definite anti-India,  pro-Pakistan bias in U.S. policy pronouncements. Little wonder  then that the U.S. has chosen to treat Pakistani help for  terrorists in India as being no worse than the propaganda of  human rights violations in India. The tone for such a lop-sided  policy was set rather early through the blunt remarks of Mr.  John Malott, a senior U.S. official who visited Delhi last May  when he sermonised us on improving our human rights record,  especially in regard to Kashmir and Punjab. In so doing not  only did Washington choose to be blind to the "ground realities"  in both these states, where our forces are fighting a proxy war  against infiltrators sent by Pakistan, but also totally  overlooked the constitutional safeguards our democratic polity  and independent judiciary provide for protection of human  rights. Mr. Clinton admits "some recent improvements in the  Sikhs' situations" but maintains that "abuses still occur."  Perhaps he needs to be reminded that even in this country  Rodney King episodes do take place. On the question of human  rights, India would want Washington to keep in mind that it is  fully conscious of its responsibility to defend human and civic  rights. It has a human rights commission. These institutions  may have to be made more effective. But that is India's  concern. The fact that the U.S. has shown little appreciation  of India's stand on the issue shows that Mr. Clinton perhaps  find the human rights issue a clever means of arm-twisting India  into following policies tailored to suit American interests,  especially on the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] issue.  Curiously, Mr. Clinton wrote a similar letter to Dr. Ghulam  Nabi Fai, head of the pro-terrorism Kashmir-American Council on  the same day that he wrote to the Congressmen on Punjab. But  while the former statement to a lobbyist was said to be an  oversight, his communication to the Congressmen could hardly be  so. By replying to the Congressmen referring to the crisis of  "Khalistan", Mr. Clinton may have lent credence to a concept  which the same Mr. Malott had only last August announced as  having no official sanction. The Indian government has done  well to react sternly to Mr. Clinton's statement.</p>

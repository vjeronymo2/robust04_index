			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Laidlaw in deal to buy Union Pacific unit Laidlaw, the Ontario-based waste services and transportation group, expects to become North America's biggest hazardous waste operator with a proposed deal to acquire a subsidiary of Union Pacific, the US railroad conglomerate. Laidlaw has signed an exclusive agreement with Union Pacific to negotiate the purchase of United States Pollution Control, which operates several landfills, service centres and other hazardous waste facilities in the western US. The purchase price is expected to be about USDollars 225m, plus unspecified financial and environmental obligations. Laidlaw's board is due to approve the deal in mid-November, and regulatory approvals should be completed by early next year. Laidlaw said the addition of US Pollution would lift its hazardous-waste revenues to more than Dollars 800m a year. The hazardous waste business has been marked by fierce competition and tightening environmental rules. However, Mr Jim Bullock, chief executive, said 'these assets will make us an even stronger competitor in a rapidly consolidating market place'. Mr Bullock said US Pollution would expand Laidlaw's geographic coverage and provide facilities for incineration of solid hazardous waste.</p>

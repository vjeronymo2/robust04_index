			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Organizers of Save Venice Inc., a U.S.-based group raising money for preserving  art treasures of the Italian city, say they have raised more than $450,000 to  finance restoration of the church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli and of lunettes,  paintings and marbles in three other nearby churches. The money was raised at a  $1,500-a-person gala last week that ended a four-day festival of private  parties, concerts and art tours in Venice and nearby Vicenza. Those attending  the gala included Prince Andrew and his wife Sarah, and Paloma Picasso,  daughter of the late painter Pablo Picasso. SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / S Korea moves to curb growth of building industry SOUTH Korea is to deny permission for new public and commercial buildings until the end of September, the Economic Planning Board (EPB) said yesterday. The measure is part of a package aimed at curbing the growth of the construction sector, which has expanded rapidly over the last two years and is fuelling inflation and exacerbating a labour shortage. Under the terms of the package, drawn up by the EPB and related ministries, new construction by the government and by state-invested institutions will be delayed until the end of September. In addition, won 400bn (Pounds 326.4m) will be cut from funds supplied to financial institutions to provide housing loans. Permits for private construction of apartments outside Seoul and above 84.8 square metres will be withheld until October and will also be restricted for the building of department stores, hotels, public baths and pharmacies. In a separate measure, also aimed at easing the impact of rising land costs, the government said business groups which fail to sell land not directly related to their business activities will be unable to issue overseas securities. The policy is the latest step in the government's attempt to curb real estate speculation which is one of the main factors in rising land costs. In the first quarter, land prices in Korea rose by an average of 4.7 per cent. There is also concern that the rapid expansion of the construction sector is creating an imbalance in Korea's growth pattern.</p>

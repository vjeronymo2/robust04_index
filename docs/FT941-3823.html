			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / French struggle to find jobs Almost three quarters of young French people are so keen to find work that they will take any job they can get, according to an opinion poll published yesterday. The poll for the business daily La Tribune showed that 73 per cent of those aged between 18 and 24 would accept any job. It also showed that 66 per cent said job security was a priority, ahead of an adequate wage or a challenging career. France has an unusually high rate of youth unemployment - one young person in four below the age of 26 is out of work.</p>

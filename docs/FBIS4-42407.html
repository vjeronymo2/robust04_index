			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Piero Ostellino: "Alliances to the Test"] </F>   [Text] Ours is an extraordinary country. When membership  of the Atlantic alliance "cost little and yielded a great deal"  (U.S. protection against a definite "enemy," the Soviet Union,  in exchange for our relinquishing overly close relations with  U.S. enemies) our membership was often challenged both by the  opposition and by some sectors of the majority itself.    Now that membership of the Atlantic alliance "yields much  less and costs more" (due to the disappearance of our "enemy"  and the need to contribute to international stability outside  Europe), there are more and more appeals for "Italy's loyalty to  its alliances" even from the same people who used to challenge  our membership.    Unfortunately, however, nobody has wondered what loyalty to  the Atlantic alliance means now, after the crisis of European  communism and the dissolution of the Soviet Union have  eliminated the historical, political, and strategic reasons for  its existence; what loyalty to the European Union means, after  international speculation caused the "explosion" of the monetary  system, after the recession has called into question the German  model of development (approved by the Maastricht Treaty), and  after the Yugoslav crisis has revealed Europe's impotence.    The main concern has been to appear "loyal," without,  however, explaining "to what" and above all without wondering  what costs and benefits it entails for our country. Thus a  great opportunity for a serious discussion of foreign policy has  been wasted.    Having for years described our allies' reservations  concerning the PCI's [Italian Communist Party] possible entry  into the government as "an intolerable interference in our  internal affairs," the Left has now applauded foreign criticisms  of the appointment of National Alliance ministers. This shows  that for many Italians national independence is optional,  depending on whether it affects themselves or their adversaries.    The pressing need to immediately deny any possible suspicion  of "fickleness" has prevailed. This is a praiseworthy political  need, but it too is the result of guilt complexes and an  approach to the new international situation that are entirely  anachronistic.    Indeed, the concern with averting any suspicion of  "elaborate  footwork" seems to ignore the fact that "the music has changed"  and that so too have the "dancers," that the major powers are  able to keep to the same "beat"; that the important thing is not  Italy's membership of the Atlantic alliance and the European  Union but what specifically our country intends to do within the  international bodies to which it belongs.    During the Cold War era we were one of the most loyal  members  of an "unequal alliance": The weaker allies (the Europeans and  Canadians) were obedient inasmuch as they were protected, and  the stronger ally (the United States) provided protection  inasmuch as it was obeyed. Now that alliance, which was the  result of the bipolar international system (the United States  versus the USSR) is bound to change into a different kind of  international system.    The allies' common democratic and liberal background is no  longer enough to justify its existence. Neither is the aim to  transform it generically into the "custodian of peace." What we  need to consider is what the allies can still achieve, and at  what price, and what problems are involved in transferring the  alliance's original aims, which were defensive, to the new  international context.    A medium regional power such as Italy is no longer bound to  "passively" submit to the dynamics of the geopolitical or  geoeconomic context within which it operates, but can seek to  take part in it "actively." This has a whole series of  implications for our country.    First, the international context has less impact than in the  past on decisionmaking processes affecting our foreign policy;  the prevailing national interest is no longer security, but  economic development.    Second, the international framework has less impact than in  the past also on the decisionmaking processes of our domestic  policy; it is no longer a matter of reconciling objectives  derived from our alliances with the presence of opposition  forces hostile to them.    Third, the "scope of action" of our foreign policy is  extending from the regional to the global, from the  political-military to the economic, commercial, and cultural;  new markets are opening up that were until recently closed to us  either for security reasons (Russia and East Europe) or because  of our "obedience" to our American protector (China).    Fourth, the rules of conduct to which we have subscribed  remain (the need for loyalty); those connected with our  membership of the Atlantic alliance, more flexible, and those  connected with our adherence to international economic  agreements, more full of opportunities. There are increasing  incentives to bring the rules of the international market more  into line with increasing international competition.    Very appropriately, having paid rhetorical tribute to our  "loyalty to our alliances," Foreign Minister Antonio Martino has  immediately engaged in foreign policy at the practical level,  and has already imparted a more realistic approach better suited  to the changed international conditions. Even the diplomatic  corps which, despite a few "rotten apples," remains one of the  best areas of the public administration, has established an  internal "foreign policy organization" with the aim of placing  its unquestionable professional expertise at the service of a  new and more dynamic international action.    Why, then, not begin a major debate between the political  forces and throughout the country on "what is to be done in  foreign policy"? Why, basically, do we not abandon our  provincialism once and for all? Prime Minister Berlusconi,  Messrs. Bossi, Fini, Occhetto, Pannella, Buttiglione, Segni, and  whoever else: Will you please try this, instead of wasting your  energies on your own petty domestic quarrels?</p>

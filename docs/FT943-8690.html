			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Many 'food miles' apart Sir, You report (Management: 'Granting an end to the Food Trade Gap', August 11) 'a breakthrough for the UK's vegetable industry' in the form of lettuces and celery from Cambridgeshire being exported to Belgium. In April, you reported on a 50-fold increase in the past 10 years of imports of lettuces from Spain. The absurdity of this reflects the perversity of the UK's response to its trade gap in food and drink - a rising proportion of which is accounted for by foods which could be produced domestically. The Ministry of Agriculture and its agency Food From Britain have said the gap should be closed via export promotion rather than import substitution. One of the many consequences has been an increase in the distances food is transported. According to Department of Transport, in the 15 years to 1990 more than a third of the increase in demand for freight was accounted for by food, drink and tobacco - which account for well under a sixth of the UK economy. Those who worry about air pollution, congestion and new roads should ponder these increasing 'food miles' when deciding what to buy on their next trip to the supermarket.

			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / International Company News: Recession forces Dollars 95m shake-up at Maytag MAYTAG, the fourth biggest US domestic appliance maker, yesterday predicted a 33 per cent drop in underlying third-quarter earnings and said it would take a pre-tax Dollars 95m restructuring charge to cover reorganisation in Europe and the US. Mr Leonard Hadley, chief executive, blamed the erosion in earnings on 'continued losses in Europe, extra start up costs associated with the new dishwasher facility and the new Magic Chef ranges'. He said the group was also hurt by 'the stalled US economic recovery and fierce competition in the appliance and floor care industries both here and abroad'. Although analysts had expected a slowdown from Maytag's strong first-quarter growth, yesterday's announcement surprised Wall Street. The shares were halted in the morning and when trading resumed in the early afternoon they fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 12 7/8 . In the 1991 third quarter, Maytag earned 23 cents a share and most analysts had expected earnings of about 27 cents in the same period of this year. The company's balance sheet has been weakened by a string of large acquisitions in the 1980s, including Magic Chef in a Dollars 736m stock swap and Hoover for Dollars 961m in cash and stock, which significantly increased its debt burden. In addition, Maytag has been hit by the impact of the recession on the appliance industry. In a move to conserve cash, the company cut its dividend in February, 1991 for the first time since 1946. Mr Hadley said the reorganisation was 'an investment in our future, and we expect to recover the charge in approximately three years through improved earnings'. The company said its Hoover operations have been losing money, largely because of excess capacity and the deterioration of economic conditions in the UK and other European countries. 'In the past two years, we have implemented significant cost reduction activities throughout our Hoover Europe operations,' Mr Hadley said, 'but further reorganisation is necessary. Over-capacity is prevalent in manufacturing throughout Europe, and Hoover is no exception.' He added that the reorganisation would be aimed at reducing production capacity and streamlining sales, marketing, administrative and distribution operations in Europe. In the US, Maytag plans to consolidate the sales, marketing and most financial and information systems functions of its Magic Chef division into its Jenn-Air division. Its Hoover operations in North America will also be involved in the reorganisation.</p>

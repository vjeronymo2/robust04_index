The stage is set for the fourth summit-level  conference with the heads of state or government of five  countries arriving in the capital this afternoon. Those who  arrived are the president of Zimbabwe, Mr. Robert Mugabe; the  president of Indonesia, General Suharto; the president of  Nigeria, General Sani Abacha; the president of Senegal, Abdou  Diouf; and the prime minister of Malaysia, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed.  They were accorded a ceremonial welcome in the fore court of  Rashtrapati Bhavan [President House]. The president of  Argentina, Mr. Carlos Saul Menem, is arriving on Wednesday  [March 30].    The prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, will formally open  the  three-day summit as India is the current chairman of G-15. The  heads of state and government will discuss during the meeting  restructuring of the United Nations and the future course of  action of G-15 nations. Global issues of special interest to  developing countries will be discussed at length. These include  human rights and terrorism, eradication of poverty, world trade,  resources for development, and the environment. After the  inaugural ceremony tomorrow, the plenary will begin. It will be  followed by informal meetings. On Tuesday, the heads of state  and government will go for a retreat at Rashtrapati Bhavan to  continue informal consultations. A joint communique is expected  to be issued on Wednesday reflecting the consensus of G-15 on  South-South and North-South cooperation.    India has offered training facilities to G-15 countries in  the conservation of biodiversity and the development of gene  banks for medicinal and aromatic plants. It has already set up  three national gene banks and published an inventory of plants  and rare species of proven medical value. The project has been  taken up following a decision of the Kuala Lumpur summit of G-15  nations. New Delhi is also coordinating implementation of three  other projects. A status report on the project says that a data  bank on solar energy applications will be ready by the middle of  the year.</p>

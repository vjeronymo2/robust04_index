			<p>BFN     [Text] The closest political goal of the opposition  consists in the establishment of a single popular movement which  would gain the majority of seats in the Russian parliament  during the next parliamentary elections and thereafter win the  presidential elections, former Russian vice president Aleksandr  Rutskoy stated in an interview with Interfax today.    The Accord for Russia opposition movement will hold a  meeting  of its National Council in Moscow on Saturday.    Rutskoy stressed that the opposition should be careful not  to  let one more candidate from the present regime to take the  highest post. That is why the opposition needs a single  candidate.    Rutskoy said that each of the party leaders believed that he  must be elected the president. Rutskoy himself said that he  does not especially seek the presidency and that any candidacy  should be put forward taking into consideration the interests of  the cause.    Rutskoy suggested that a tough politician must take this  post  since the present situation in the country required rule with no  compromise, consensus or games with the law.    Rutskoy said nothing would be changed in the country as long  as Boris Yeltsin remained in power. Neither a government of  national confidence, nor a new composition of the parliament  will change the situation. It must go through radical changes,  Rutskoy affirmed.    Rutskoy said he was ready to lead the united opposition.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 23/06/1994 -- The parties  grouped under the name of the Democratic Convention of Romania  (CDR) and the Democratic Party (PD-FSN) have jointly forwarded a  censure motion, Civic Alliance Party (PAC) President Nicolae  Manolescu announced at his party's weekly newsbriefing.    He made it clear that, unlike other motions, the text of the  present one no longer blames the government for economic  mismanagement, but for the failure of having kept its promises.    "Very comprehensive" in contents, as the PAC leader  described  it, the fresh motion questions Mr. Vacaroiu's Cabinet's entire  activity.    As for the censure motion of the Agrarian Democratic Party  of  Romania (PDAR), and the invitation issued to the opposition  parties to join it, Nicolae Manolescu said the agrarians'  decision came a little late, but he agreed that most of their  objections were well grounded. As for the co-signing of the  agrarians' censure motion, this is out of question, he said,  because regulations allow for one signature along one  parliamentary session.</p>

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / France (13): The business elite is alive and well - School ties and other links MR GIANNI Agnelli, chairman of Fiat, patriarch of the Agnelli dynasty, may be one of the most powerful men in Italy, but this year he learnt exactly how much - or how little - power he had in France. In the late 1980s the Agnellis had peacefully and profitably expanded their interests on the other side of the Alps, by using their social contacts to smooth their path in to France. Everything went well until last autumn when the Italians felt confident to do a French deal on their own. Mistake. The Agnellis' attempt to take over Exor, the company that controls Perrier, the famous French mineral water, by doing a private deal with their old friends, the Mentzelopoulos family, dragged them into a fierce fight with their old French allies - Mr Antoine Riboud, chairman of the BSN food group, and Mr Michel David-Weill, senior partner of Lazard Freres bank - which ended in an embarrassing defeat for the Italians. Mr Agnelli's error was to underestimate the power of the French financial establishment - the labyrinthine network of influential bankers, bureaucrats, industrialists and financiers who occupy the most powerful positions in France's largest financial and industrial groups. One of the sharpest lessons of the Perrier affaire, to the Agnellis and to everyone else, was the extent to which the establishment still dominates corporate France. Why is it that a small group of people - mostly from the same narrow background of elite Paris lycees, the Grandes Ecoles and the finance ministry - still wield so much power? One reason is the tradition of family ownership in large French firms. Some of the most powerful figures in French business - Mr Francois Michelin, Mr Serge Dassault and Mr Martin Bouygues as well as Mr David-Weill - inherited their positions and often controlling holdings in their companies. These family interests are, in turn, reinforced by the complex web of holdings and cross-holdings that characterises France's corporate sector, together with the intricate system of voting and non-voting shares. As a result many of France's largest companies are virtually bid-proof, thanks to their blocking stakes. This offers considerable stability to those at the top. Another reason is the power of the state. So many large financial and industrial groups are state-controlled that the links between French business and politics are far closer than in most other capitalist countries. This closeness is accentuated because the government of the day chooses the presidents of all state companies. Many chairmen of the big banks, insurers and industrial groups - such as Mr Jean Peyrelevade of Union des Assurance de Paris, Mr Gerard Worms of Suez and Mr Jean-Yves Haberer of Credit Lyonnais - worked in ministerial offices earlier in their careers. As a result, as Mr Agnelli discovered to his cost, the members of the French establishment are not only well-entrenched, but well known to each other and extremely efficient at closing their ranks to repel outsiders.</p>

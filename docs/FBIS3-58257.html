He urged members of the centre-right parties behind the  coalition government to support the policy. Reforms would be  introduced at a speed compatible with the main concern of  maintaining social harmony.    Expressing the conviction that "as things stand, no other  policy is possible," he said: "The two absolute priorities of  the government in 1994 are the balancing of the health insurance  budget and control of the increase in unemployment by all the  means available to us."    Sarkozy, who is spokesman for the government, was giving a  New Year message to the press.    During January the government would announce "important  decisions" concerning health insurance.    He noted that Prime Minister Edouard Balladur wanted the  government to work hard for recovery without paying undue  attention to the timetable for a presidential election next year.</p>

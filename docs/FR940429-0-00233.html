			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary has modified the proposed regulation to provide that any initial decision by a hearing official that is appealed to the Secretary may be affirmed, reversed, remanded to the hearing official, or modified. The Secretary also notes that the regulations require a hearing official to uphold certain adverse actions when specific findings are made as set out in &sect;668.90. Although the Secretary reserves the discretion to review such rulings on appeal, these administrative decisions already reflect the Secretary's judgment that such action is appropriate under those facts, and modification of any such ruling will be rare. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary disagrees with the suggestion that an institution or third-party servicer should be able to introduce new evidence on appeal. The administrative process requires that the relevant information necessary for the decision will be presented to the hearing official within the time limits set out in the regulations. Any appeal to the Secretary must be based solely upon that information already in the administrative record and upon items which may be judicially noticed. Any subsequent opportunity to introduce new evidence on appeal would deprive the hearing official of the opportunity to have issued a decision based upon a complete record, and could discourage a respondent from placing its complete case before the hearing official at the appropriate time. This system of resolution is fairer and more efficient because it provides each party with an opportunity to have their complete case heard by a hearing official and then, where appropriate, have the initial decision reviewed by the Secretary on appeal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that it is appropriate to include fraud as a finding in &sect;668.90 for which an adverse action must be upheld where the hearing official makes a determination that the underlying activity has occurred. This addition to the regulation reelects the Secretary's determination that any fraud committed by an institution or third-party servicer is serious enough to warrant the imposition of the adverse action sought. In such instances, and consistent with the other items that have been placed into this category in the past such as missed audit submissions, it is appropriate to limit the discretion of the hearing official in accordance with the Secretary's determination that this category of finding warrants the adverse action initiated by the designated Department official. Furthermore, the regulation provides certainty to all parties concerning the gravity of the underlying violation, while providing an institution or third-party servicer an opportunity to request an administrative appeal to a hearing official concerning whether the respondent committed fraud. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations have been changed to provide that the Secretary may affirm, reverse, remand to the hearing official, or modify any initial decision that is appealed to the Secretary. Section 668.88 has also been amended to specify that no charge is made to provide one copy of the transcript to the hearing to an institution or a third-party servicer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.92&blank;Fines <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters responded to the Secretary's request for comment and agreed that repeated mechanical systemic unintentional errors should be treated as a single violation for purposes of assessing a fine against a third-party servicer. However, one commenter argued that total compensation for the value of the error should be expected. Another commenter suggested that the Secretary should address cases in which the third-party servicer deliberately failed to implement a regulation or failed to institute programming corrections relating to previously cited findings identified by an auditor, client, or the Secretary. The commenter believes that in these situations the fines should be significant based upon the risk of loss due to the servicer's negligence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters felt that it would be inappropriate to adjust the amount of a fine simply based upon the size of the institution or servicer, claiming that a small organization should not benefit and a large organization should not be penalized solely on their size. One commenter suggested that the purpose of considering the size of the servicer's business was to take into consideration the dollar value of the violation in comparison to the overall value of the contracts being serviced by the servicer and suggested that language be added concerning the assessment of materiality of the violation. A few commenters supported a position that the determination of the size of any fine take into account the extensiveness and gravity of the violation and should be assessed in direct correlation to any loss of funds. The commenters also felt that the fines should only be assessed against the party who was directly responsible for the violation and supported the provision that the servicer may provide evidence that the institution contributed to the violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter felt that any references to special arrangements should be deleted and noted that performing any statutory and regulatory requirement should cover all applicable situations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary agrees with the commenter who suggested that, in determining the amount of the fine to be assessed against a third-party servicer for a violation of a Title IV, HEA program requirement, a repeated mechanical systemic unintentional error need not be counted as a single violation if the servicer had been previously cited for this type of error and had failed to implement corrections. With respect to the commenter who suggested that in determining the amount of a fine with respect to a repeated mechanical systemic unintentional error, that the amount of the fine should at least be equal to the total value caused by the error, the Secretary does not agree with that comment. However, the Secretary does agree that the determination of the amount of the fine should take into consideration the amount of Title IV, HEA program funds that were lost due to the error. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

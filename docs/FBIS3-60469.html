Azarova; place and date not  given: "The Whys and Wherefores" -- first paragraph is  KALININGRADSKAYA PRAVDA introduction published in boldface]    [Text] The Kaliningrad Oblast Administration has adopted a  comprehensive regional program for epidemiological protection of  the oblast population in 1993-1996.    We have asked N. Zagorskiy, chief of the oblast epidemiology  service, to comment on this issue.    Zagorskiy: It is hard to overstate the  significance of this program. Everything it envisions is  connected with concrete problems crucial to the health of the  people. Unfortunately, the number of these problems is growing.  This is the reason behind the concern of the epidemiology  service and its goal-directed resolutions for overcoming an  array of alarming situations. Some of these situations require  immediate acting, some do not, however, all of them are equally  important. By the way, the program prepared by our specialists  falls in line with the program for socioeconomic development of  our oblast in many aspects.    Azarova: Could you outline the most important  aspects of the program?    Zagorskiy: There are no unimportant aspects of  epidemiological protection of the people. For example, water  supplies and the quality of water. Everyone knows that the  quality is very poor. It is enough to see the inside our  kettles covered with scale. It is necessary to boil water  before drinking. Additionally, there are norms for drinking  water specified by the State Standardization Office. Our water  does not comply with these norms, particularly in the cities of  Neman, Bagratinovsk, Pravdinsk, Ozersk, and Baltiysk. The  situation in rural ares is even worse in some cases.  Contamination of the water system is very dangerous. The  September events in the village of Petrovo, Gurev Rayon, where  17 people were infected with viral hepatitis, may serve as an  example. Also alarming is the situation in recreational areas  polluted with sludge, waste, and sediment. Construction of new  water treatment facilities have been postponed almost  everywhere. The program provides, among other measures, for the  completion of these projects.    Azarova: One can have the impression that there  is one big dumping ground around: You go to enjoy nature, but  instead you see garbage everywhere. The same situation exists  in cities and villages. One can feel disaster in the air.    Zagorskiy: One such disaster is already under  way. It is no secret that there is no facility for reprocessing  solid wastes. There are only dumping grounds that spread disease  and breed rats. Sometimes, dumping grounds self-ignite, such as  the one in the village of Kosmodemyanskiy. Additionally, we  should build a facility for utilizing toxic industrial waste  currently dumped in forests, open fields, and water intakes.  The Yantar factory was requested to conduct construction of  such a facility. The program also provides for similar projects  in various cities and rayons.    Azarova: Recently, the issue of protection  against electromagnetic radiation has appeared...    Zagorskiy: We addressed this issue long ago,  however... Currently, our specialists have managed to convince  appropriate authorities that this is a very acute problem. For  example, according to the program, the construction of the  Kaliningrad television tower is to be moved outside the city  limits in 1995. The issue of resettling people who live in zones  with increased electromagnetic radiation is currently being  examined. Permanent radiation control is being introduced at  all border checkpoints of the Kaliningrad Regional Customs  Office.    Azarova: Nikolay Nikolayevich, what does the new  program provide for protection against contagious diseases?  According to your statistics, the epidemiological situation has  deteriorated due to an array of diseases that, we thought, had  disappeared forever...    Zagorskiy: The reappearance of those diseases is  connected with many reasons: migration of people, appearance of  street markets, socioeconomic hardships, exacerbation of  hygiene... Each of these reasons has generated its own  consequences. Nowadays, we can observe increasing cases of  pneumonia and sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis  and viral hepatitis. The lack of appropriate hygiene has caused  the spread of mycosis and itch. Regarding the latter, it would  be expedient to return to the methods applied in the 1930's, and  to reintroduce special medical subunits for treatment of this  disease. Diphtheria has also been a big surprise to us. We are  trying really hard: We vaccinate the people, even in their  homes, however, there are still many who have not been  vaccinated.    The program provides for a complex of measures such as  construction of a contagious diseases hospital in Kaliningrad,  opening of a convalescent spa for those infected with pneumonia,  or allocating special places for burying infected cattle.  Nonetheless, the most important thing is to encourage the use  of prophylactics among the people. Everybody must change his or  her attitude today, and realize that they are the only ones  responsible for their health. We will introduce obligatory  health insurance and a massive vaccination campaign. The media  could be very helpful in propagating our initiatives. The most  important thing is that we are all healthy to work for ourselves  and Russia's prosperity.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] General Raul Castro, minister of the Revolutionary  Armed Forces [FAR], has participated in the extended military  council of the Central Army conducted by Division General  Joaquin Quintas Solas. Commander of the Revolution Juan Almeida  Bosque and Division General Ulises Rosales del Toro, both  members of the Politburo, were also present.    The military council of the Central Army agreed to further  increase defense training levels, to give priority to the unit's  seven main guidelines, to continue agricultural and fish farming  development, and to emphasize self-financing. In this way, they  hope to attain the best command status of the interarms  emulation program.    The agenda covered various topics of interest. Porfirio  Rodriguez, chief of the General Staff of the Central Army,  offered an overall view of the efforts of this command,  including efficient training of the troops, improvement of the  army's structure, the satisfactory preservation of combat  equipment and weapons, permanent commitment to preparation of  the theater of military operations, and fulfillment of tasks  ensuring capabilities and full combat readiness and the [words  indistinct].    Topics related to the Armed Forces' self-sufficiency,  particularly in this region, were also discussed. Martinez,  chief engineer of the army's farming detachment, described the  improvements in food self-sufficiency, such as plans -- already  progressing well -- to increase production by 30 percent in  comparison with last year. They have 325 hectares dedicated to  fish farming and also to raise chickens and pigs. The meeting  also emphasized the need to control production costs and  eliminate subsidies until profits are attained for contributing  to the self-financing of FAR. Raul pointed that in order to do  this, it is essential to keep strict accounts.    A special address was given by Jose Luis Rodriguez, minister  of finance and pricing, who cited the steps taken by the  government to mend the country's finances, measures already  adopted and others being prepared, such as the tax system for  certain nonsalary incomes. He also pointed out the importance of  the budget as a central element in the economy, and the  importance of restoring accounting and auditing in attaining  financial discipline. On this subject, Raul highlighted the  words of the commander in chief on the necessity to reestablish  economic discipline by all means, and added:    [Begin Castro recording, in progress] ...the total or  general  discipline of the country. The first step is to stop impunity in  every aspect and sector.

The excellent work accomplished in the municipality of  Caibarien on defense, the food plan, and the links between the  PCC and the masses was pointed out as a valuable experience  worth study by other municipalities.    Div. Gen. Ulises Rosales del Toro, vice minister of the FAR,  congratulated everyone for the satisfactory condition of the  army and its solid, stable combat readiness to defend the  region. This was reiterated by Raul on behalf of Almeida, who is  a founding member of this command, and himself.    [Begin recording] [Castro] This is the most stable command;  yet it is in the vanguard. [end recording]    Finally, Div. Gen. Quintas Solas challenged the other  armies,  stressing that the Central Army will strive to achieve the best  command status.    [Begin recording] [Quintas] Firmly rooted in the glorious  era  of the vigorous rebellions of slaves, in the land soaked in  Mambi and the rebel blood of the immortal army of Gomez and  Maceo, Camilo and Che, in the 5 September streets quenched with  heroism, in the mountains where we defeated the bandits, and in  the glorious sands where imperialism sustained its first great  defeat in Latin America, the fighting people of the Central Army  work together with you to guarantee, at any cost, the sacred  defense of the fatherland. [end recording]    This tour through the Central Army was reassuring to those  accompanying the FAR minister since it was evident that the  Armed Forces is headed in the right direction, and is increasing  its ties with the people.</p>

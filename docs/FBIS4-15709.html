			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ukrainian Naval Command today accused the Black  Sea Fleet of illegally removing radio-navigational and  hydrographical equipment from the port of Odessa. A statement  by the Ukrainian Navy's press service says that the  hydrographical vessel Cheleken left the port of Odessa overnight  and is at present heading for Sevastopol. The press center says  that Ukrainian border guards were prevented from boarding the  ship by armed Russian sailors who had allegedly been ordered to  open fire in the event of any action measures by the Ukrainian  side.    Interfax asked the Black Sea Fleet headquarters to clarify  the situation. The headquarters said that the incident is  linked to the fact that Ukraine has stopped financing the  navigational services in the Black Sea and, since by treaty they  are meant to be funded by Kiev as well by Moscow, Russia cannot  and does not intend to finance the services at its own expense.</p>

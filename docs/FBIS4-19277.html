			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Prime Minister and PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist  Movement] Chairman Andreas Papandreou's address at the party  congress, which began at noon today at the Athens Olympic  Stadium with the participation of 4,436 delegates from Greece  and overseas, was a message of unity and optimism. Papandreou's  address also included a political message regarding our  country's position in Europe but mainly in the Balkans.    For PASOK to continue its direction, Papandreou said, it  must  be revived. We must realize the big changes and contradictions  of the times and give answers with our philosophy and political  practice, he said. A party, Papandreou continued, which works  as a human-centered society cannot be a party of mechanisms, it  is a figure of autonomous people.    Papandreou said PASOK's orientation is, of course, European  but stressed that we are not Europe's poor partner. We are  Europe's arm in the Balkans, its eastern border, he said.  Papandreou blamed Europe for the tragedy in the former  Yugoslavia, talked about the revival of suffering and regional  hostilities and said that these clashes are cultivated by the  big powers to promote their special interests. With a tone of  optimism for the future, Papandreou said that wars and the  economic crisis cannot cancel, can only delay for a while, the  impressive development at the doorstep of which we find  ourselves. Following is that specific part of Papandreou's  address:    [Begin Papandreou recording] We follow the tragedy of war in  the former Yugoslavia with fear. We resist the attempt to  revive ancient Balkan disputes and serve the big powers'  shortsighted goals. However, no resistance can hide the fact  that the Greeks have begun to find their natural role in the  Balkans. Half of the foreign investments in Bulgaria now are  Greek. In Albania, Greek companies have set up 54 joint  companies and we are second after Italy. In Romania, there are  700 joint Greek-Romanian companies. The Balkans's greater area  calls on Greece. The Greeks, who throughout their history have  stood as a factor of progress and civilization in the Balkans  under historical conditions that are incomparably more difficult  that today's, are preparing, in cooperation with the peoples of  the Balkans, to rediscover their old position. [end recording]    Papandreou said that we should again discover our historic  optimism and added that PASOK's revival is firmly connected with  the restoration of political life in the country. The primary  role in this difficult mission belongs to the youth, Papandreou  stressed.    [Begin Papandreou recording] PASOK's revival is firmly  connected with the revival and restoration of political life,  not only of ideas, positions, platforms and choices, but mainly  of institutions, norms and practices. It is an issue that  regards the present and future of democracy and its principles.  Through this road, Greek youth and politics will be reunited.  It will be a necessary meeting for Greece itself. The country  moves ahead only when the youth are in the national and  political foreground, only then. [passage omitted] [end  recording]</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Antofagasta to raise Pounds 11.5m - Placing to fund 45% stake in world's third largest copper deposit Antofagasta Holdings, the UK listed Chilean mining, rail and banking group, is buying a further 45 per cent of the Los Pelambres mine, which controls the world's third largest copper deposit. The deal - which will cost Dollars 29.6m (Pounds 18.9m) - will give the group a 65 per cent stake in the mine. The remainder is owned by Midland Bank and Lucky-Goldstar, of South Korea. It is being part funded by an Pounds 11.5m placement; the balance will be satisfied in cash. The pricing was agreed at the time of a debt-for-equity swap by Midland in 1989, and is extraordinarily favourable to Antofagasta. A report by RTZ valued Los Pelambres' proven and probable reserves at Dollars 158m, suggesting a Dollars 71m valuation for the 45 per cent stake. The company is placing 3.74m new shares to institutions at 308p a share, compared with yesterday's closing price of 323p. Los Pelambres, which is in the Andes some 200 kilometres north of Santiago, is estimated to have more than 1bn tonnes of copper-bearing material, and some gold and silver deposits. Current production is around 5,200 tonnes per day, but the company has recently completed a feasibility study which suggests that open pit mining could increase production to 60,000 tonnes. Mr Christopher Jowett, finance director, said Los Pelambres would invest up to Dollars 120m in developing the mining operations over the next 6 years, in order to achieve these higher production targets. Antofagasta also announced that pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 fell from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 10.1m. This reflected a fall in the copper price from a 1993 average of 92.4c per lb to a 1994 average of 90.6c. Profits from mining fell from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 1.2m. The railway operations contributed Pounds 1.6m, down from Pounds 1.8m, as a result of its sensitivity to the mining industry. Associates contributed Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 7.7m). For every 1c increase in the copper price, Antofagasta's earnings should rise Dollars 700,000, and the current price of 115p suggests a stronger performance in the second half. The company increased its interim dividend from 1.2p to 1.45p. Earnings per share before exceptionals were 5.4p (6.9p).</p>

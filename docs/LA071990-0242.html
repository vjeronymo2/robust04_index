			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CLEVELAND U. FIRES MACKEY, CITES DRUG USE  </P> <P> Cleveland State University fired basketball Coach Kevin Mackey today, two days  after he admitted to a cocaine and alcohol problem.  </P> <P> "I fired Kevin Mackey, but really he fired himself," university President John  Flower said at a news conference.  </P> <P> Flower said Mackey's behavior had "made a mockery" of ethical and moral  standards.  </P> <P> Mackey was arrested Friday night as he drove away from a reputed drug house. A  urine test showed he had .20 of a gram of alcohol per 100 milliliters of urine,  above the legal limit of 0.14 of a gram. The test also showed some cocaine in  his system.  </P> <P> At a news conference Tuesday, Mackey called his problems with drugs and  drinking a "descent into hell."  </P> <P> He has pleaded innocent to charges of driving while intoxicated, consumption of  alcohol in a motor vehicle and violation of the open container ordinance.  </P> <P> Mackey, 43, was hired as Cleveland State's head coach in 1983, after he had  served as an assistant at Boston College since 1977.  </P> <P> Mackey last week had signed a new two-year contract.  </P></p>

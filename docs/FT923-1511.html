			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Letter: Withdrawal from ERM stylish and result unwittingly good, but resignations an issue Sir, May I be maverick enough to suggest that unwittingly, amid the chaos, the government may have achieved a near ideal policy mix (at the cost of putting back European integration a few years). By continuing in the ERM until now, inflationary pressures have been dramatically reduced thereby softening the inflationary blow from the downward float that has occurred; by leaving the ERM now when Germany's interest rate needs are still projected to be radically different from our own, we have set ourselves up for lower interest rates - as shown by yesterday's cut to 9 per cent - and a sustained period of low inflationary growth. Of course the government still has the small matter of re-establishing confidence in its economic policies and on the foreign exchanges, but since it is at the beginning of a five-year term and is clearly committed to low inflation (whether inside or outside the ERM), maybe that confidence will return surprisingly quickly. Would that chaos always led to such good results] Stephen J Popham, The White House, Grayswood, Surrey GU27 2DJ</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Police give pledge to businesses MR JOHN Stevens, the chief constable of Northumbria, has pledged that tackling the effects of crime on local businesses will be a priority in his force's use of its Urban Crime Fund money. The force has the country's highest crime rate per 1,000 population and per police officer. Under the new Urban Crime Fund initiative launched by the Home Office for additional policing measures, Northumbria, Merseyside and West Yorkshire forces have each been allocated Pounds 3.6m for 1992-93. The Northumbria Police Authority is also contributing Pounds 1.2m to the force. Proposals being submitted today to the Home Office, detailing how it plans to use its allocation, include closed-circuit television networks on industrial estates and in urban centres. Mr Stevens said earlier this week that he had been told by local industrialists that 'the only blight to this area is crime'.</p>

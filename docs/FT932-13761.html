			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Rail union fails to settle dispute THE rail dispute remained unresolved last night. After nine hours of discussion the executive of the RMT, the main rail union, failed to reach a decision on whether to support or reject British Rail's final proposals to resolve a conflict which has already brought two one-day shutdowns of the network. An RMT spokesman said the dispute remained 'unresolved'. The executive will resume its deliberations today but it remained unclear last night whether this would produce any definitive verdict on BR's peace plan. The RMT executive appears to be evenly split between those who want to settle and those who wish to press ahead with more disruption in the campaign to achieve a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies and a moratorium on the extension of contract work. Mr Paul Watkinson, BR employee-relations director, said the BR board had gone as far as it could to meet the union's demands. The BR document presented to the union leadership late on Tuesday night confirmed that it does 'not foresee the need for compulsory redundancy among its existing general staff during the next couple of years, providing there is opportunity for voluntary severance and staff avail themselves of the opportunities for redeployment and retraining spelled out in the various agreements'.</p>

The drugs were worth over 120 million new pesos and  were to be shipped to the United States.    Martin Torres Flores, Fausto Gonzalez Solis, and Jose Luis  Rivas Rosas were arrested by federal agents on the  Guadalajara-Tepic highway, eight km from the municipality of  Magdalena. They were carrying the drugs in compartments  concealed under the roof of a van with state of California  plates.    According to investigations conducted by the agent of the  Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, a vehicle with certain  characteristics was due to travel along that highway carrying  the alkaloid shipment.    Hence, at a checkpoint in the aforementioned locality, the  PJF agents intercepted these individuals riding in a red Dodge  Ram van with a detachable roof and license plates 30X100.    When the vehicle was searched, the drugs were found, and  those subjects, together with the cocaine, were taken into  custody and placed at the disposal of the agent at the Federal  Public Prosecutor's Office. In their preliminary statements,  they claimed that the alkaloid had come from Tuxpan, Jalisco,  and was bound for Tijuana, Baja California, to be smuggled into  the United States later.    It should be noted that, thus far in this administration, a  total of 225 tons of cocaine has been seized in antidrug  operations throughout the country. Moreover, 165 Federal  Judicial Police agents have lost their lives in direct  confrontations associated with the relentless battle against the  drug traffic.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, may 13 (XINHUA) -- Japan should pursue an  active and creative diplomacy to help establish a new world  order and settle regional conflicts, the Foreign Ministry said  in an annual report released today.    The ministry's diplomatic bluebook for 1993 said Japan  should  make diplomatic efforts commensurate with its international  position, adding that Japan's influence has grown not only in  the economic arena but also in politics and in global concerns  such as the environment and AIDS prevention.    The government report, approved by Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata's cabinet today, said much remains unsettled in the  international situation despite some hopeful developments such  as peace in Cambodia and the Israeli-Palestinian autonomy accord.    It noted that difficulties remain in regional conflicts,  including those in former Yugoslavia and Somalia, tension over  suspected nuclear weapons development on the Korean peninsula,  the sluggish world economy, and confusion in the former Soviet  Union.    The paper cited the need to strengthen the function of the  United Nations and the importance of cooperation among Japan,  the United States and Europe which share the common values of  democracy and market-oriented economies and whose combined gross  national product (GNP) accounts for 70 percent of the world  total.    United Nations-led peacekeeping activities have become more  important as regional conflicts increase; and the success in  achieving a Cambodian peace demonstrates the effectiveness of  such efforts, the report said.    Japan also will continue efforts to improve its assistance  to  developing nations both in quantity and quality as a way of  fulfilling its international responsibilities, the report  concluded.</p>

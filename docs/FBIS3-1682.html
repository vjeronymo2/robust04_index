Bai Enpei, deputy secretary of the regional party committee;  and Yun Bulong, vice chairman of the regional government,  accompanied Wang Qun to conduct the investigation and study in  Ulanqab League. They successively investigated Liangcheng,  several townships, households engaged in breeding industry, and  key enterprises; and inspected, on the spot, the construction of  the three-mu farmland projects, the development of the  socialized service system, the coordination of cropping,  breeding, and processing industries, the processing of farm and  sideline products, and the circulation and marketing situation.  They heard the reports made by responsible persons of 15  townships and held talks with some grass-roots cadres on the  issues of developing high-efficient agriculture and readjusting  the industrial structure. They also went deep to the peasant  households to hold heart-to-heart talks with the peasants; to  ask, in detail, about their production, living, and income  situation; and to solicit the opinions from the grass-roots  cadres and the peasants. They encouraged that in the new year,  the people should make persistent efforts to make new  achievements and make new headway.    During the investigation and study tour, Wang Qun pointed  out: Accelerating the pace of emancipating the mind and  quickening the development of agriculture and animal husbandry  is the principle for guiding the urban and pastoral areas' 1994  economic work. The setup of a perfect socialist market economic  system as set forth at the third plenary session of the 14th  party Central Committee has provided us with the best  opportunity to accelerate the pace of emancipating the mind and  the development of agriculture and animal husbandry. This is  the best external condition. The readjustment of farm and  livestock product prices will bring about gigantic benefits to  the peasants and the herdsmen. However, we must notice that our  internal factors have gigantic potential. To further accelerate  the agricultural and livestock development, we should first  accelerate the pace of linking agriculture with animal  husbandry. We have many typical examples in this regard. All  this has provided us with beneficial experiences. We must  cherish and pay attention to these experiences. So long as we  handle affairs according to the market law will we be able to  make acceleration in these two aspects and satisfy the people.    Wang Qun also pointed out: Our region has appropriately  improved the agricultural production. Particularly, the  construction of farmland water conservation projects, the setup  of the scientific and technological service system, the  cultivation of skilled persons, and the setup of the market  system have helped lay a better foundation for agricultural  production. How shall we be able to step onto a new stage? We  should [words indistinct] to create high efficiency and high  economic results. That is, we should take the path of  developing high-yield, high-efficient, and good-quality  agriculture. First of all, it is necessary to readjust the  structures within agriculture, including the cropping structure,  the cropping-breeding-processing structure, and the  trade-industry- agriculture structure. It is necessary to plant  crops according to market demands and to develop the crops with  good economic results. The readjustment pace should be  accelerated and the dynamics of readjustment should be expanded.  So long as the agricultural structure is reasonably readjusted  will we be able to take the path of favorable cycle. Second,  the pace of transforming cropping, breeding, and processing  industries should be accelerated. We must clearly notice that  the key to developing agriculture hinges on transformation, the  potential is changing, and the efficiency is changing. Only  when we firmly grasp the link of transforming cropping,  breeding, and processing industries will we be able to take the  path of becoming rich as soon as possible.    Wang Qun particularly stressed: The party and government  departments at various levels, particularly banners, counties,  towns and townships, and sumu, should accelerate the changes of  functions, strengthen the service for the people's life, and  streamline [words indistinct]. The personnel divorced from  departments are allowed to engage in economic entities.  Production should vigorously be developed and a large number of  cadres should be transferred from their work posts. The broad  masses of cadres should bring into play their wisdom and  intelligence in the rural socialized service. This is a need  for organizational reform as well as a need for deepening the  rural reform. According to the actual conditions, all  localities should work out [words indistinct] policies suitable  to themselves.    In regard to the issue of setting up a town and township  overall service system, Wang Qun pointed out: The overall  service stations of towns and townships are a key link of the  overall socialized service system. This link has the connection  between markets and households. So, we should bring into full  play the functions of this link. We should conscientiously  solve the problems relating to the service stations;  particularly work out some preferential policies toward them,  including distribution and taxation policies; simultaneously  strengthen the leadership over them; and [words indistinct].    Bai Enpei and Yun Bulong also made specific opinions on  positively guiding the peasants to enter the markets.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Housing starts leap in US A SURGE in apartment building during September pushed US construction starts to their highest rate for three and a half years even though building of single-family homes weakened, the Commerce Department said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. The overall annual rate of starts on new homes increased by 2.8 per cent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35m after a revised rise of 6.7 per cent in August. Starts were up everywhere except in the South, where they fell. The September pick-up was entirely in multi-family homes, which soared by 52 per cent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 210,000. By contrast, starts on single-family homes fell 3 per cent to a rate of 1.14m. Mortgage rates were moderate throughout September and by last week had touched a 25-year low of 6.81 per cent for a 30-year loan.</p>

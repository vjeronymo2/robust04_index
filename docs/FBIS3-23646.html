			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Aleksandrov: "Flat Antenna Improves </F> Appearance"]    [Text] Western Europe has a problem, one which is somewhat  humorous to us: Large numbers of satellite television receiving  antennas are spoiling the view of residential and administrative  buildings. American, European, and Japanese firms have attempted  to resolve this problem by rendering the antenna flat and  unnoticeable. Alas! The laws of physics relentlessly dictate a  definite shape, such that antennas continue to assume the  configuration to which we have become accustomed.    The above brief introduction should make it clear why the  European press ("The Times," in particular), not the Russian,  was the first to report the successes attained by domestic  electronics specialists. It was the latter, if one is to believe  that press, who were able to "trick" the laws of physics to  create flat antennas of any configuration which can be easily  "camouflaged" to blend with the color of a building. The  newspaper accounts were marred by inaccuracies, lacked any  mention of the sources of the information, and failed to name  the manufacturer. Perhaps that was due to fear on the part of  each country that her competing neighboring countries would be  the first to get to Russia. Another reason could be that what  was reported was nothing more than a false rumor.    Nonetheless, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondents did manage to  obtain a confirmation in the Russian Ministry of Communications:  "Yes, something like that was done in the Urals." They were  provided an explanation of why the sensational invention was not  reported by the domestic press: The antenna was made for  military purposes; it is simpler to both transport and  camouflage in a combat situation.    Although the Urals are a large area, a single telephone call  to the editorial office of VECHERNYY CHELYABINSK was sufficient  to "ferret out" the hero of the day: "Yes, it was done here in  our city. There has been no need to advertise, since as yet  there is nothing to sell."    "We lack the means to tool up for production of the  antenna,"  was an admission made to the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent by  Sergey Ponomarev, who experimented with flat miracle antennas  over a long period of time in a laboratory of the Chelyabinsk  NII [Scientific Research Institute] of Measurement Technology.  The Institute had been contacted by specialists from the USA,  Great Britain, Germany, and South Korea who wished to purchase  the antenna or acquire patent rights with the intent of  undertaking its manufacture.    Ponomarev proceeded to speak at length in glowing terms of  the unavailable antenna, finally asking surprisingly: "When will  it show up here in Russia? Well, round antennas do not harmonize  with detached buildings in our country, also."</p>

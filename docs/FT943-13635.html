			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Portfolio of work gets jobless off the dole: A look at an employment scheme being tested by Tecs Six months ago Mr Brian Richards, an agricultural drainage worker, had been unemployed for two years. Now he is self-employed and working on a variety of drainage jobs including one at Nottingham Forest football ground. The opportunity for Mr Richards, 56, to get off state benefits was provided by a pilot scheme operated by Lincolnshire Training and Enterprise Council. It is based on the premise that most of the new jobs being created are part-time, but the benefits system discourages the unemployed from taking them. The scheme is called Job Match. It is one of 26 job-creation experiments being piloted by Tecs, which administer training programmes in England and Wales. Job Match helps long-term unemployed people assemble a portfolio of part-time jobs, or take a part-time job in the hope that it may become a full-time one. In one pilot - considered to be one of the most successful - participants are provided with a subsidy of Pounds 50 a week for up to six months. They can also apply for a one-off grant of up to Pounds 300 for training. Mr Richards, who was not eligible for family credit, started with a part-time job and eventually built up enough work to become self-employed. He used his Pounds 300 voucher to update his skills by undertaking a course on drainage technology and installation. He feels the future now looks 'very promising'. Many unemployed people reject part-time work because the wages are often close to, or sometimes below, benefit levels. Single people and the childless are not eligible for state top-up benefits, called family credit. Others take a part-time job and still claim benefit. Lincolnshire Tec regards its experiment in 'portfolio' working as a success. Mr David Rossington, chief executive of Tec, said: 'There are no miracle cures for unemployment, but this is a useful tool and I would like the scheme extended. Long-term unemployed people need practical support to get back to work. 'It takes a lot of confidence to leave a secure benefits arrangement. Most people are earning more on Job Match than they would have received on benefit.' The scheme's apparent success with its clients is of particular relevence at the moment because Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is considering extending family credit, a benefit for low-paid workers with children, to cover single people and childless couples. Mr Peter Ashby, a consultant with Full Employment UK, an employment consultancy, said: 'The crucial lesson from Lincolnshire is that unemployed adults need to know where they will stand before they take the jump into employment. Family credit can be complicated to obtain, which is why a new style family credit would need to be simpler and more vigorously marketed.' About 350 people in Lincolnshire have taken part in the scheme, which started in September. Portfolio working typically is concentrated on the lower end of the wage scale and involves the unskilled. So far 126 people have completed the six-month period during which they receive the subsidy. Only five of these have gone back on benefits. Several participants are using the scheme to get back to self employment, including single parent Mrs Julie Elphick, who has used Job Match to take a part-time teaching job and develop a knitwear design business. She said: 'It is so difficult in this country for single parents to lift themselves out of the poverty trap. But this scheme has got me back into the jobs market. I am very grateful for it.'</p>

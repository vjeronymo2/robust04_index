			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEIJING REPORTEDLY AGREES TO CAMBODIA TALKS WITH HANOI  </P> <P> China has agreed to have direct talks with Vietnam next month on a possible  settlement of the Cambodian guerrilla war, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, son of a  key Cambodian leader, said Thursday.  </P> <P> The talks would bring together the two principal non-Cambodian forces in the  decade-long conflict for the first time since momentum toward a settlement  began building two years ago.  </P> <P> "I have just learned that China has agreed to receive Vietnam's minister or  deputy minister of foreign affairs in early February," Ranariddh said in a  statement broadcast by the radio station of the Cambodian resistance faction  headed by his father, Norodom Sihanouk. Foreign Ministers Siddhi Savetsila of  Thailand and Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam concluded two days of talks in Hanoi on  Wednesday with a joint statement saying that "both sides agreed that it was  necessary for them to work together in accelerating the process toward  achieving a political solution to the Cambodian problem."  </P> <P> The two sides, until now ardent antagonists on the issue, made no mention of  Hanoi-Beijing talks.  </P> <P> Ranariddh said in his broadcast, which was monitored here and reported in the  Bangkok press, that the Soviet Union had asked Chinese officials to meet with a  Vietnamese delegation and that Moscow would initiate talks with Sihanouk if  there is a Sino-Vietnamese meeting. The Cambodian issue has been a major  stumbling block in Moscow's efforts to improve relations with Beijing.  </P> <P> China has sponsored the Khmer Rouge guerrillas in the conflict, while the  Soviets have backed the Vietnamese.  </P> <P> Last week, Hanoi officials said the withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops from  Cambodia could take place as early as September if outside military aid to the  resistance guerrillas is halted. But they attached conditions that have been  unacceptable to the resistance and its allies.  </P></p>

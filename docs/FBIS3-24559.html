			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V.M. Lisitsyn, K.V. Obrosov, N.N. Pasechnyy and </F> V.A. Stefanov (GosNIIAS, Moscow)]    [Abstract] The article examines a method for segmentation  and analysis of a class of multidimensional images characterized  by a statistical relationship between the observed value of one  component and validity of the estimate of the value of another  component. Such relationsip is typical for multi-dimensional  speckle images formed using remote sensing means. The proposed  method makes it possible to use a common approach to the  segmentation procedure, regardless of peculiarities of physical  processes of formation of analyzed images. A formula for the  decision rule for image segmentation based on the maximum a  posteriori probability criterion in the case of a normal  distribution of parameter estimates is derived. The algorithm  output is not only a segmented image, but also characteristics  of each identified area, so the algorithm makes it possible to  analyze the initial scene. Figures 6, references 16.</p>

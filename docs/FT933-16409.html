			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / EC argues over Pounds 121bn aid package THE 12 European Community member states were last night at odds over how to divide up the Ecu157bn (Pounds 121bn) structural aid and regional development budget for 1994-99. As each country tried to secure more EC funds, the larger states also launched an assault on the European Commission's right to decide how money for the Community's industrially stricken regions is allocated. Mr Willy Claes, foreign minister of Belgium, which this week took over the EC presidency, said that 'either we reach a timely decision, or we betray our jobless and break the promises of Edinburgh', where EC heads of government decided on the development package last December. Ireland and the Netherlands threatened to block any agreement on disbursing what is the largest amount of development aid in EC history unless they received guarantees on the share they are seeking. Germany, Italy and the four poorest member states - Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland - also insisted that the eligibility threshold for Objective 1, which includes the most deprived regions, be held at 75 per cent of average per capita EC income. These regions will get Ecu96.3bn, plus the Ecu15.5bn Cohesion Fund, which is for the four poorest countries, on the most flexible terms reserved for the Community's most backward areas. The Commission wants Objective 1 status for Merseyside and the Scottish Highlands and Islands in the UK, Hainaut in southern Belgium, and Cantabria in northern Spain, even though they are above the 75 per cent limit. This will almost certainly be approved, to preserve a 1988 political deal making Northern Ireland and Corsica eligible for the most generous funding. Since then, Corsica has effectively set a new eligibility benchmark, by raising its per capita income to 79 per cent of the EC average. The areas proposed by the Commission are just inside this. But Germany, by far the largest net contributor to the EC budget now, wants allocations on a strictly proportional per capita basis. Its eastern Lander  -or states - where average income is around half the EC poorhouse threshold, would thus get much more. Germany, France and the UK were also seeking to deny the Commission the right to decide on 'Objective 2' areas - those regions in industrial decline. In addition the UK was blocking Brussels' plans to spend part of the package's money for training the unemployed on retraining workers still in jobs but in danger of losing them because of industrial restructuring. The UK also wanted tight limits on the amount Brussels allocates to Community-wide programmes, like those to revive former coal and steel areas, even though the UK has been a principal beneficiary. Among those yesterday volunteering the share they intended to take away were Spain (Ecu40bn); Ireland (IPounds 8bn); and the Netherlands (about Ecu3bn). The UK appeared to be aiming at around Ecu6bn.</p>

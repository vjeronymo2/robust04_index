He said in  particular, that "Yuriy Meshkov is not a president today for the  Crimean Tatar people," because his program envisages a revision  of the existing borders. The chairman of the Majlis said that  "of all the states of the former union, Ukraine is the only  country today that renders the most effective assistance to us.  We are well aware of how complicated the current economic  situation in the country is and therefore we are not putting  forward any particular claims."    Replying to the question: "Is Russia extending any help to  you," Dzhamilev said: "We do not receive any practical  assistance from Russia, however, we should not forget that in  the years when our people were subject to deportation, Crimea  was under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation, and we  hope to intensify all-around methods of influencing Moscow,  which bears the bulk of responsibility for the genocide of the  Crimean Tatars. We will strive to achieve that Moscow finance  the process of the repatriation, rehabilitation [of the Crimean  Tatars], and compensation for the losses inflicted on our  people."    Replying to the questions "how does he assess the statement  by President Yuriy Meshkov to the effect that Ukraine should  pull its troops out of the territory of the peninsula, and does  the Black Sea Fleet ensure Crimea's security," Dzhamilev said:  "This is an irresponsible and provocative statement... the  Black Sea Fleet issue should be solved quicker and the  stationing of the foreign state's ships near our shores is one  of the elements that destabilizes the political situation in  Crimea."</p>

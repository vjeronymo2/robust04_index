			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION SOFTBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS POUNDS LOMPOC, 8-1  </P> <P> Alicia Zinner of Thousand Oaks High threw a two-hitter and struck out seven,  including the side in the seventh inning, to lead the fourth-ranked Lancers to  an 8-1 victory over Lompoc in the first round of the Southern Section 5-A  Division playoffs Thursday at Thousand Oaks Community Park.  </P> <P> Zinner (16-4), a junior right-hander, did not allow a hit until Tausha Pico  singled to produce Lompoc's only run with two out in the fourth. The fourth was  Zinner's problem inning as she walked the leadoff batter on four consecutive  balls and took two others to three-and-one counts before allowing Pico's  run-scoring hit.  </P> <P> "I guess I was down on myself because I was making mistakes that you can't  afford to make in a CIF game," Zinner said.  </P> <P> Zinner's teammates helped make her few mistakes insignificant, however, banging  out 10 hits in the game and taking a 5-0 lead into the fourth.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks (24-5), which beat the Braves, 4-3, two months ago in the second  round of the Righetti tournament, rocked starter Adrian Villalobos (11-9).  </P> <P> Phronsie Franco, the second batter in the Lancers' first inning, hit a solo  home run down the left-field line, her second of the season. The junior  shortstop finished three for four and had two runs batted in and scored two  runs.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks will play Marina of Huntington Beach, a 2-1 winner over Santa Ana  Mater Dei, Thursday at a site to be determined.

			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> The Denver Symphony also will lose its conductor in June. Phillipe Entremont is  resigning because budget cuts made his vision of the orchestra's future "like a  bird being shot in midair." The symphony has struggled financially in recent  seasons, and four months ago the symphony board announced it would seek  protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. After studying the  situation, a panel recommended a budget for next season of $6.5 million,  $800,000 less than the 1988-1989 budget. "This orchestra deserves much better  than it got. It's really a first-class orchestra," Entremont said. "With the  division of opinion between myself and the board regarding the orchestra's  musical goals, I had no other choice (but to resign). I never cheat artistic  matters." The symphony board accepted his resignation "with regret." Entremont,  54, has been principal conductor of the Denver Symphony since 1986 and music  director since 1987. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

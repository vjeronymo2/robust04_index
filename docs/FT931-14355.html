			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / BSN and Unilever form joint venture for iced snacks UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, and BSN, France's largest food company, have formed a joint venture to develop and market worldwide a range of new products combining ice cream and yoghurt. Unilever is the world's largest maker of ice cream, with sales last year of about Pounds 1.6bn in 30 countries, while BSN is the biggest producer of yoghurt, with sales of almost FFr24bn (Pounds 2.8bn) last year. The venture appears intended to exploit growing demand among health-conscious consumers for new types of frozen desserts and snacks. Demand is strongest in the US, where sales of products such as frozen yoghurt have recently increased rapidly. However, the joint venture will focus initially on France and Spain, where it plans to launch products soon. Sales will be expanded to other countries later. The two companies said the worldwide market for the venture's products, described as 'combining the ideal properties of yoghurt and ice cream', could eventually amount to hundreds of millions of litres. Marketing of the products is expected to rely heavily on the companies' leading brand names. Unilever's ice cream brands include Motta in France, Frigo in Spain and Wall's in Britain, while BSN's main international yoghurt brand is Danone. No figure was given for the initial investment in the joint venture, which will be equally owned and use existing facilities provided by the two partners. Based in Paris, it will be headed by a steering committee of three managers from each company under a rotating chairmanship, while Unilever will provide operational management. Mr John Campbell, food industry analyst with County NatWest, said the venture would probably enjoy reasonable growth potential, though prospects in Europe were uncertain because the market was still largely undeveloped there. BSN has relied increasingly on alliances and partnerships to enter new markets, such as Italy, China and Japan. However, Unilever has traditionally preferred to have full control of its businesses. However, the Anglo-Dutch group recently formed a joint venture with PepsiCo, the US soft drinks and snacks group, to sell canned iced tea.</p>

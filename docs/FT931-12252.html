			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Bonds: First collared issue in sterling A RUSH of new issues in sterling and both US and Canadian dollars dominated market activity yesterday. The most innovative deal of the day was a Pounds 100m 10-year issue for the Leeds Permanent Building Society, the first issue of collared floating-rate notes in the sterling sector. The collared structure incorporates a minimum interest rate (floor) and a maximum interest rate (cap). Investors are offered floating-rate notes which pay more than current money market rates, but will not benefit from rises in rates above the level of the cap. Close to Dollars 8bn of collared floating-rate notes have been issued in the dollar market in the last six months. The steep yield curve in the US market has made it possible to buy caps and floors in the derivatives market, and use them to subsidise the cost of the issue to the borrower, while offering the investor an initial coupon higher than current money market rates. The one-point cut in the UK base rate to 6 per cent on Tuesday finally made the structure viable in the sterling market, by causing the yield curve to steepen, according to lead manager Salomon Brothers. The Leeds deal offers a minimum coupon of 7 per cent,  7/8 point higher than the six-month London interbank offered rate, and a maximum of 11 per cent. More UK building societies and banks are expected to take advantage of the structure, because of the opportunity to reduce funding costs. Meanwhile, the Royal Bank of Scotland took advantage of strong demand for longer-dated sterling bonds among UK institutions to launch a Pounds 150m 20-year issue of subordinated bonds, priced to yield 140 basis points more than the comparable UK gilt. Bayerische Landesbank, the German regional bank, also raised subordinated debt in the sterling market. The Pounds 100m issue of 10-year bonds, arranged by SG Warburg, was priced to yield just 37 basis points over the comparable gilt. However, because it is backed by the Bavarian state, Bayerische Landesbank's subordinated debt benefits from the same triple-A rating as its senior debt, so that investors make little distinction between the different tiers of debt. Both deals will count as lower tier two capital under the new international capital guidelines which came into force this month. Buying in dollar securities remains strong, and General Electric Capital's second Eurobond offering this week sold out rapidly. The Dollars 250m issue due 1999 was arranged by UBs Phillips &amp; Drew. Swap opportunities in the Canadian dollar sector prompted three new issues, but dealers said that supply was likely to outstrip demand in the sector. KFW, the German agency, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and Bayerische Vereinsbank, the German Bank, tapped the market for CDollars 700m. Moody's Investors Service, the US credit ratings agency, will review long-term debts of Bank of Yokohama, which owns Guiness Mahon Holdings, the UK merchant bank, and Ashikaga Bank, both rated at A1, due to concerns over the banks' real estate related lending, writes Emiko Terazono from Tokyo.</p>

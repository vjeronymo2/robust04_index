			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / IMF will back Dollars 250m credit, says Manila THE International Monetary Fund will approve resumption of the remaining Dollars 250m (Pounds 138m) of a standby facility in support of the Philippines' economic stabilisation programme, it was claimed in Manila yesterday, Jose Galang writes from Manila. President Corazon Aquino said the IMF management was circulating a staff report on her government's request for the financial support among its executive board. Mr Jose Cuisia, central bank governor, said approval by the IMF executive board in early March would be a formality. IMF approval should trigger separate talks with Manila's commercial bank creditors on restructuring Dollars 5.3bn debt, and with the Paris Club of donor countries and multilateral financing institutions in March. The IMF management's approval came after Manila won new revenue measures from congress last week before it wound up its last session under the Aquino administration. The new tax measures helped the government to produce fiscal targets within ceilings sought by the IMF.</p>

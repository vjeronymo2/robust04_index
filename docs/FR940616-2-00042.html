Riverside proposes to convert a nearly depleted gas field to gas storage use. The proposed storage facility would have 5.1 billion cubic feet (BCF) of storage capacity (3.1 BCF working gas capacity). To develop the Riverside Gas Storage Field, Riverside would:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Recomplete 21 existing wells as injection/withdrawal wells;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Recomplete one existing well as an observation well;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Plug and abandon 9 existing gas wells (all remaining wells in field);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Construct 3.42 miles of 12-inch-diameter gathering pipeline;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Construct 2.44 miles of 6-inch-diameter pipeline (22 segments of various lengths to attach wells to the gathering pipeline);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Construct a new 3,150-horsepower compressor station; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Construct ancillary facilities at the compressor station including meters, dehydrator trains, storage tanks for oil and glycol, access roads, and water and electric utilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The general location of these facilities is shown in appendix 1. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The appendices referenced in this notice are not being printed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> .

Of this total, 10 acres would be used for the compressor station, 43.4 acres would be associated with well pads (1.4 acres per well) and 47.9 acres would be associated with the right-of-way for the storage pipelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following completion of construction, approximately 12.6 acres associated with the nine plugged and abandoned wells would be allowed to revert to the land use desired by the property owner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Riverside proposes to use a an 85-foot-wide construction right-of-way for its 12-inch-diameter pipeline and a 50-foot-wide construction right-of-way for its 6-inch-diameter pipeline. Riverside proposes to use an 85 to 100-foot-wide right-of-way for construction across streams.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The EA Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''. The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By this Notice of Intent, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues it will address in the EA. All comments received are taken into account during the preparation of the EA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EA will discuss impacts that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> could <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project under these general headings:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Geology and soils; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Water resources; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Vegetation and wildlife; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Pipeline safety; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Land use; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Cultural resources; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Air quality and noise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our independent analysis of the issues will be in the EA. Depending on the comments received during the scoping process, the EA may be published and mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for this proceeding. A comment period will be allotted for review if the EA is published. We will consider all comments on the EA before we recommend that the Commission approve or not approve the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Currently Identified Environmental Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have already identified several environmental issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review of the proposed facilities and the information provided by Riverside. Keep in mind that this is a preliminary list. The list of issues will be added to, subtracted from, or changed based on your comments and our analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The list of environmental issues:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Riverside would recomplete 22 existing wells in Greene and Fayette Counties, Pennsylvania: one observation well and 21 injection/withdrawal wells. These wells and drilling operations have potential groundwater impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Riverside may affect up to five wetlands in the project area while constructing its pipelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;There may be noise concerns at residences surrounding Riverside's new compressor station.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;There may be federally listed threatened or endangered species in the project area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

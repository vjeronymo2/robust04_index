Workers of Atomic Stations in Kursk Continue Hunger  Strike"]    [Text] Leaders of the Central Committee of the  Atomenergoprom trade union, "Electroprofsoyuz," as well as  chiefs of the "Rosenergoatom" concern told journalists in a  press conference in Moscow yesterday that a dangerous situation  has currently taken shape at virtually all nuclear stations of  Russia which carries "a real threat to the country's security  and, unless urgent measures are taken, may result in emergency  situations in the regions entailing grave social and ecological  consequences." According to Vladimir Kashkin, deputy chairman  of the Central Committee of the Atomenergomash trade union, the  situation results from nonpayments and the lowering of the rate  of payment for electric power on the part of the "Single Power  Supply System of Russia" joint-stock company. Owing to the  absence of monetary funds, atomic electric power stations [AES]  could not buy nuclear fuel and did not carry out in good time  the scheduled repairs, reconditioning, maintenance, and  reconstruction. The remaining stock of nuclear fuel at most  AES's around Russia is enough for them to operate at nominal  capacity for not longer than one month. Specialists think that  a forced shutdown of AES generators would result in nuclear  stations' becoming, instead of producers, major consumers of  electric power to remove residual energy from nuclear fuel, and  would serve only as storages for highly radioactive materials.    Vladimir Kashkin also stated that an extremely tense  situation has taken shape in the collectives of nuclear  stations, including nuclear safety personnel, over delayed  wages. Mass protest actions against the government's economic  policy have already begun. For example, five workers of the  Kursk AES continue their hunger strike announced on 11 March.  According to Kursk AES director Vladimir Gusarov, the strikers  demand that debts for the already supplied electricity be  settled, and that wages for December, January, and February be  paid. They also insist on meeting with Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin to prevent a social explosion in work collectives.    The press conference organizers announced that owing to  explosive developments, the coordination committee on joint  actions, set up three days ago at a joint conference of  Atomenergoprom and "Elektroprofsoyuz" trade unions  representatives, forwarded yesterday an appeal to the Russian  president, prime minister, and chairmen of the Federal Assembly  chambers. It says that "the work collectives' patience is not  limitless." It also contains a demand for an urgent discussion  in the government of issues connected with ending the crisis in  power engineering, and for the passing of Russian Federation  laws "On Atomic Energy" and "On Electric Power Engineering."    [Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian at 0400 GMT on 19  March adds, in a report from Murmansk: "The Kola nuclear power  station has four power units. Two of them have already been  closed down. The planned close-down of the third power unit is  scheduled for 22 March. Naturally, such a sharp reduction of  power supply to enterprises in the oblast will immediately  affect the economic situation in the region, because the nuclear  power station provides 60 percent of all the electricity  produced in the Kola Peninsula. The Murmansk Oblast enterprises  will certainly feel the power shortage, but first of all the  supply of power will be stopped to neighboring Karelia and  Leningrad Oblast. The nuclear power station has no guarantee  that the fourth power unit will not be closed down as well."]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, June 8 (XINHUA) -- After hard bargaining  over the past three days, the warring factions in Bosnia agreed  here today to a month-long ceasefire, the first of its kind in  more than two years of bloody conflict.    The accord, signed by top representatives of the Bosnia's  Muslim-Croat Federation and Serbs in the form of a statement,  will take effect at noon (1000 GMT) on Friday [10 June].    As a first step both sides agreed to avoid any offensive or  provocative military operations and give time to broader truce  negotiations.    "This period of military stabilisation is required in order  to give time for reflection leading to a resumption, within the  next several days, under U.N. Protection Force (Unprofor)  auspices, of negotiations on a comprehensive cessation of  hostilities," said the statement released here.    Speaking to reporters after signing the agreement, Yasushi  Akashi, the U.N. envoy to the former Yugoslavia, said the  ceasefire is a "first step" toward the overall truce in the  war-torn Bosnia.    However, he admitted it fell short of his four-month  ceasefire target sought in the past three days of talks here.    "But under the circumstances such a more ambitious  undertaking was not within reach," he added.    He said that the Unprofor would convene negotiations within  a  few days either in Sarajevo, Pale (Bosnian Serbs' stronghold) or  at Sarajevo airport.    Meanwhile, the U.N. force will continue to monitor and  report  all military activity along the present line of conflict, the  statement said.    The accord also provided for an "immediate and complete"  release of all prisoners of war under the auspices of the  International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).    Akashi said that the accord was a "short agreement reached  after a great deal of effort," referring to the long mediation  drive by the international community.    Last month major power ministers met in Geneva, where they  made a call for cessation of hostilities to be followed by  territorial negotiations in the former Yugoslav Republic.    The major power "contact group" on Bosnia asked Akashi and  his military commanders to negotiate the ceasefire.    Under the terms of Akashi's original proposal, a ceasefire  would have been followed quickly by separation of forces,  withdrawal of heavy weapons and the interposition of some 5,000  extra peacekeeping troops along front lines.    However, the warring sides had long argument over the  duration of the proposed truce.    The Bosnian Serbs had accepted Akashi's original proposal,  but the Bosnian Muslims and Croats had resisted a long  ceasefire, fearing it would cement Serbs' military gains on the  ground.    Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic told reporters after  signing the accord today that he had accepted a "moderate  result" for the sake of peace, while leaders of the Muslim-Croat  Federation seemed also pleased by the result.</p>

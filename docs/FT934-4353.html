			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Interest rate cut boosts franc The French franc strengthened yesterday following the announcement that the Bank of France will cut its leading interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Monday. The announcement, which will reduce the Bank of France's intervention rate to 6.2 per cent and its 5-to-10 day rate to 7.25 per cent, followed the news on Thursday of a similar cut in the Bundesbank's repurchase rate. It represents a continuation of the cautious policy pursued by the French authorities since last summer's exchange rate mechanism crisis of protecting the value of the franc by shadowing Germany on interest rates. The French currency, which has rallied in recent weeks, was bolstered by the news to close at FFr3.437 against the D-Mark compared with FFr3.446 the previous day. This leaves the franc close to its old ERM floor of FFr3.4305. The Paris stock market was boosted by the news. The CAC 40 Index, which has faltered recently on concern about the slow progress of interest rate reduction and fears of an impasse over the Gatt negotiations, rose by 1.29 per cent during the day to close at 2,188.4.</p>

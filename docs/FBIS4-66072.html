			<p>BFN     [Text] The Vatican has asked that the United Nations  intervene in Rwanda "as soon as possible and with an effective  presence" in order to help put an end to the massacres.    The statement was made by the representative of the Holy  See,  Monsignor Paul Tabet, who was in Geneva addressing the UN Human  Rights Commission on the Rwandan tragedy.    According to the Vatican, the United Nations must encourage  a  dialogue between the belligerents in order to bring about a  negotiated settlement.</p>

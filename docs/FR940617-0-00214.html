			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d) The pass and fail decision numbers associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cumulative number of engines tested are determined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using the tables in appendix A to this subpart, ``Sampling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Plans for Selective Enforcement Auditing of Nonroad Engines,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to the projected sales as made by the manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in its report to EPA under &sect;89.505&hyph;96(c)(1). In the tables  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in appendix A to this subpart, sampling plan ``stage'' refers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cumulative number of engines tested. Once a pass or fail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision has been made for a particular pollutant, the number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of engines with final test results exceeding the emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard for that pollutant shall not be considered any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further for the purposes of the audit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Passing or failing of an SEA occurs when the decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is made on the last engine required to make a decision under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (c) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) The Administrator may terminate testing earlier than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required in paragraph (c) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;89.511&hyph;96 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Suspension and revocation of certificates of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The certificate of conformity is suspended with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to any engine failing pursuant to paragraph (b) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;89.510&hyph;96 effective from the time that testing of that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine is completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The Administrator may suspend the certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformity for a family which does not pass an SEA, pursuant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to paragraph &sect;89.510&hyph;96(c), based on the first test or all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests conducted on each engine. This suspension will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occur before ten days after failure of the audit, unless the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer requests an earlier suspension.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) If the results of testing pursuant to these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations indicate that engines of a particular family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced at one plant of a manufacturer do not conform to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations with respect to which the certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformity was issued, the Administrator may suspend the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate of conformity with respect to that family for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines manufactured by the manufacturer at all other plants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Notwithstanding the fact that engines described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the application may be covered by a certificate of conformity,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Administrator may suspend such certificate immediately in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whole or in part if the Administrator finds any one of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following infractions to be substantial:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The manufacturer refuses to comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of a test order issued by the Administrator under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;89.503&hyph;96.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The manufacturer refuses to comply with any of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of this subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The manufacturer submits false or incomplete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information in any report or information provided to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator under this subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted under this subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) An EPA enforcement officer(s) or EPA authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative(s) is denied the opportunity to conduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities related to entry and access as authorized in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart and a warrant or court order is presented to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer or the party in charge of a facility in question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) An EPA enforcement officer(s) or EPA authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative(s) is unable to conduct activities related to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entry and access as authorized in &sect;89.506&hyph;96 because a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer has located a facility in a foreign jurisdiction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where local law prohibits those activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The Administrator must notify the manufacturer in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> writing of any suspension or revocation of a certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformity in whole or in part; a suspension or revocation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective upon receipt of the notification or ten days, except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the certificate is immediately suspended with respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any failed engines as provided for in paragraph (a) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) The Administrator may revoke a certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformity for a family when the certificate has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed remedy for the nonconformity, as reported by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer to the Administrator, is one requiring a design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change or changes to the engine and/or emission control system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as described in the application for certification of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected family.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

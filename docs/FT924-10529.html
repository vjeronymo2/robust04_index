			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Vital profits plunge to NKr226m VITAL Forsikring, one of Norway's top three insurers, yesterday disclosed a plunge in nine-month profits to NKr226m (Dollars 36.1m) from NKr1.02bn. The company blamed a sharp fall in the value of its securities portfolio and interest rate instability in the domestic bond market for the slide. It was forced to charge accounts with a NKr453m write-down on shares and warned of lower profits for the year as a whole compared with last year's profit of NKr718m. 'These are weak figures,' said Mr Bjoern Elvestad, president. 'Although the financial markets have developed more favourably in the fourth quarter, it is unlikely the overall return in 1992 will match last year's result.' Vital's free shares yesterday closed 10.4 per cent down at NKr60 on the Oslo bourse. Group financial income in the nine-month period was cut by NKr807m to NKr1.621bn, but Vital said it had realised and unrealised gains on bonds and equities in October of an estimated NKr320m. 'Since the end of the third quarter the bond market has stabilised and the stock market has shown signs of recovery,' Vital said. Premium income increased by 12 per cent to NKr1.98bn in the period as operating expenses remained at NKr399m. Vital said it had secured several new corporate pension scheme agreements, but not all of these had been included in nine-month accounts. Group assets grew to NKr34.17bn from NKr33.11bn in the nine-month period. Vital said losses on property loans were a modest NKr20m, or 0.14 per cent of aggregate lending.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] President Askar Akayev has asked the Finance  Ministry to explore the opportunities for early subsidies to the  hydro power plants under construction and to find about 30  million soms (about $10 million) for the purpose. The order  follows President Akayev's trip to the Jalalabad region in the  south of the country in the middle of the week, the Presidential  Press Service has told IF.    In the course of the trip Akayev met with workers of the  "Narymgidroenergostroi" joint stock company. Hydro power plant  construction workers have not been paid wages for many months  and the situation is critical. The joint stock company is faced  with the risk of a strike.    President Akayev visited a semi-conductor factory in  Tash-Kumyr, where he met with city leaders and factory managers  to discuss the possibility of subsidizing the expansion of this  factory, one of the biggest producers of mono-crystals in the  CIS.    The question of closing down unprofitable pits was discussed  at President Akayev's meetings with Tash-Kumyr coal workers.    Experts blame the country's grave financial and economic  position on inadequate taxation. Akayev asked the government to  draft new tax legislation by September 1.    Presidential adviser on social and economic affairs, Talai  Koichumanov has told IF that the adoption of a better system of  taxation at the forthcoming session of parliament would be  crucial to forming the budget for 1995 on fundamentally new  principles. Koichumanov said the budget was the main tool of  social-economic policies. He said that currently the treasury  was receiving a mere half of the minimum necessary to keep the  economy going and most of the budget revenue was spent on the  social safety net for the population.    The presidential adviser said that the economic and  financial  position of Kyrgyzstan grave as it is, there has to be a  comprehensive, stable and flexible tax legislation promptly  responding to market changes. He hopes this would encourage  private enterprise and increase budget revenues.    About the situation in individual branches of the economy  the  presidential adviser said that Kyrgyzstan's industries needed  fundamental reconstruction. Some unprofitable enterprises will  simply be closed down.    A full-scale agrarian reform, which, experts hope, will  improve the situation in agriculture, can be launched no earlier  than the autumn of 1994.    Koichumanov warns that structural reforms in the economy and  urgent measures to increase production contained in the  three-year-plan may end in failure, unless Kyrgyzstan receives  favorable credits from the IMF, the World Bank and  donor-countries. The Kyrgyz presidential adviser fears that in  the near future his country may find itself in a position  similar to that of many African countries having poorly  developed industries, huge foreign debts and quick population  growth in rural regions. The sole difference would be that  Kyrgyzstan has a far higher education level.    T. Koichumanov strongly criticized the Cabinet for letting  debts snowball. In 1993-1994 most credits were spend on the  social sphere and on purchases of grain and fuel, and not on  developing production.    However, the presidential adviser believes that Kyrgyzstan  has certain chances of coping with the crisis. He sees a way  out in attracting foreign credits and investments into the  production sphere in carrying out realistic projects. He  believes that only the maximum preferences for private  investors, in particular, the biggest multi-national  corporations, would attract foreign capital into Kyrgyzstan.    Presidential adviser Koichumanov believes that Kyrgyzstan  should follow in the footsteps of Southeast Asian countries,  which are expected to make a new economic leap in 2000 and the  vacant niche in the world commodity production market of may be  taken by Central Asian countries, including Kyrgyzstan.</p>

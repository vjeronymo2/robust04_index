			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: World seeks to break a spell of recession - Leading economist Giles Keating forsees a difficult 1992 for financial markets LAST YEAR was a tough one for the world economy and 1992 looks to be little better. Mainstream forecasters such as those at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development envisage little pick-up until the second half, and the reality is that the recovery may have to wait almost until 1993. The problem is one that always bedevils macro-economic policy making: politicians and central bankers are so concerned with looking in the rear-view mirror that they fail to see the dangers ahead. As 1992 begins, the bias of policy-makers around the world appears too concerned with containing inflation. Promoting growth is still a very secondary consideration. A short tour around the world's major economies illustrates the point. In the US, gruesome pre-Christmas data finally turned the Fed decisive, the discount rate being cut by a full 1 per cent. But all the rest of the year had seen only a slow and cautious easing. Result: output and employment have been flat or falling, and the near future looks no better, given collapsing consumer confidence, auto layoff plans, and weak money supply. Plans for fiscal stimulus have become so embroiled in the battle between Administration and Congress that their only contribution has been to depress growth by making the bond market nervous. In Japan, the reduction in interest rates has been miserly, reflecting the determination of the Bank of Japan's governor Mieno to avoid a return to the 'bubble economy', which in 1989 saw a land price boom and the Nikkei Dow at almost twice today's level; and taxes are actually being raised to offset weak revenues. The result is that growth is likely to fall below 3 per cent in 1992, which Japan counts as a recession. One bright spot is that massive funds from the Postal Savings Bank could be mobilised for emergency investment spending, if the recession gets out of hand. Closer to home, the Bundesbank is imposing high interest rates on every European country. This policy is right for Germany, where it is needed to curtail inflationary pressure left over from the post-unification boom. It means a continued period of stagnation in the German economy, but that is acceptable because unemployment is reasonably low. However, harsh monetary policy is not right elsewhere in Europe, where unemployment is high and rising, and inflationary pressures are subdued. Unless there is a realignment of currencies within the ERM, lower interest rates will have to wait until German rates start to fall - in late spring or beyond. The result will be a miserable first half year in the European economies, and then not much improvement until lower rates finally have an impact well into the second half. The impact of this international gloom on the UK is compounded by domestic factors: the weak state of the banks, with at least one clearer paying liquidating dividends; a moribund housing market which will be no more resuscitated by Norman Lamont's offer to pay stamp duty than it was by more generous deals from the housebuilders last year; and political uncertainty, which damages consumer confidence and increases the interest rate-premium over Germany demanded by the foreign exchange market. Dealing with this outlook requires some unusual thinking by private investors. Policy-makers' excessive concern with reducing inflation is good news for fixed-interest government bonds worldwide, so a global bond fund should form a significant part of any private investor's portfolio. If they are well-managed they should be able to take advantage of the rise in the dollar that is likely now German interest rates have peaked and US rates are near the trough. In the UK, gilts have benefited from the worldwide trend to lower inflation and should do so again in 1992, because yields - still around 10 per cent - are attractive to institutional investors, many of whom expect inflation to stay close to 4 per cent. But as the election approaches, political uncertainty will at times push gilt prices down temporarily. The equity market outlook is more equivocal. Provided that long-term interest rates really do come down further, valuations in the UK, the US, Japan and France would be slightly conservative. So if there are no unpleasant shocks, there will be significant support for prices at current levels, especially for companies with dollar earnings, once investors sense that recovery is finally coming. Be warned: it may be necessary to wait to mid-year or beyond for that to occur and the risk of unpleasant shocks is substantial. Worldwide, the rumblings in Russia are compounded by the much closer threat of banking difficulties. In the UK, the market has the election roller-coaster to cope with. It is a situation in which the upside potential is not large, while there is a small but clear risk of a substantial downside move. So buy one of the special funds that go up in line with any rise in the equity market, but offer your money back if the market falls. These option-based funds have very high hidden charges but right now may be worth the money. What better way to finance them than by selling any bank shares you may still hold? You could also check the banks and building societies where you hold cash deposits. If you have more than Pounds 20,000, it could be wise to spread it round to take advantage of deposit insurance schemes. Some canny people will have unusually large amounts of cash on deposit this year, since they will have sold their house and be living in rented accommodation. Rental yields, at least in London and parts of the south, are currently so low that you can sell (if you can find a buyer), move into better accommodation, and finance the rent out of money from those deposits, or from saved mortgage interest. When you come to buy back in a year or two, prices will not be any higher and could well be down further. Giles Keating is chief economist for Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>

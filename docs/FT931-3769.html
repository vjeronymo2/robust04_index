			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Pilkington Pilkington looked rather silly three years ago when rival Saint Gobain swept up the Solaglass distribution business and strengthened its grip on the UK market. The acquisition of Heywood Williams' glass merchanting arm helps spare its blushes. The deal gives Pilkington 24 per cent of the distribution market, delivering a firm customer base and the critical ability to increase the utilisation rates of its float lines. The move makes so much strategic sense that one wonders why Pilkington did not act before. After all, such vertical integration is common in most other European markets. The main worry is the cost. Pilkington is doubtless right that it could not afford to pass up the opportunity. Nevertheless, Pounds 95m looks a lot for a business that made profits of just Pounds 2.7m last year. Although the purchase will enhance earnings and will ease Pilkington's ACT burden, it will also nudge year-end borrowings close to Pounds 1bn. Yet events are beginning to swing Pilkington's way. The pound's devaluation has enabled it to recapture market share. Its 8 per cent price rise in the UK has a reasonable chance of sticking. The likely sale of its US Sola business in the early summer seems set to realise more than Pounds 200m. Even so, Pilkington will face a dilemma whether to maintain another uncovered dividend. The company must hope that its recovery prospects by then will be strong enough to render such worries obsolete. It is a tight call.</p>

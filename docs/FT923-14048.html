			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: Amoco and Unocal plan job cuts TWO US energy groups - both affected by declining earnings and the weak US demand for oil and gas products - yesterday announced wide-ranging job cuts, asset disposals and corporate restructuring plans. Amoco, the fifth-biggest US energy company, said it would take an Dollars 800m after-tax charge against second-quarter earnings to cover costs of write-offs, restructuring and workforce reductions. The company, which aims to save Dollars 600m of annual operating costs a a result of its 'strategic reassessment' of business operations, said that by the end of 1993 it expected some 8,500 employees to have departed. This would represent a cut of nearly 16 per cent of the Amoco workforce, which totalled 54,120 at the end of 1991. Amoco also said it would cut its planned 1992 capital spending by 12 per cent, to Dollars 3.3bn. This would leave the 1992 capital and exploration budget some 17 per cent below the 1991 spending level. The Dollars 800m Amoco charge includes about Dollars 250m to cover anticipated losses on the abandonment of oil and gas producing properties, Dollars 220m for write-offs and reserves in Amoco' chemical operation, Dollars 160m to cover other reserve and asset write-offs and Dollars 170m to cover the cost of workforce reductions. Unocal, the California-based energy group that in April unveiled plans to sell at least Dollars 700m of assets and reduce the size of its workforce, yesterday announced a corporate reorganisation that would eliminate 1,100 jobs. Like other US oil and gas companies, Amoco and Unocal are feeling the pressure of reduced margins, weak demand and recession. A number of companies, such as Chevron and Mobil, have announced asset disposals and cuts in capital spending budgets as part of their efforts to struggle through the difficult operating environment. Unocal said its decision to reorganise its corporate structure would help to accelerate its plan to lower group debt by Dollars 1.5bn - from Dollars 4.6bn at present - over the next five years. Another key step the company said it was considering would be the decision to try and raise about Dollars 500m by way of a private placement of securities that would be convertible into 7 per cent of Unocal's outstanding share base. The 1,100 job cuts include 450 positions in petroleum and geothermal energy exploration and production and 400 jobs on the downstream side of the business. Unocal also plans to reduce its corporate and research staff numbers from 1,600 to 1,350. The company's total workforce at the end of 1991 was 17,000. Unocal reckons its cost reductions will increase its after-tax cash flow by Dollars 200m a year, starting in 1993. The company said its after-tax cash flow in 1991 was Dollars 1.24bn. Unocal also said it would close it regional office in Schaumburg, Illinois by September 1993, either transferring or making redundant the 600 people who work there. Unocal plans to take a Dollars 35m charge in its third quarter as a result of the cuts.</p>

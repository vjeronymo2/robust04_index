Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SEARCH TEAM FINDS 2 LOST HIKERS  </P> <P> Two San Fernando Valley women who were lost in the San Gabriel Mountains  overnight after being separated from other hikers were found this morning by a  team of searchers, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said.  </P> <P> Nicole Taylor of Studio City and Joell Hansen of La Crescenta, both 22, were in  good condition despite the cold, Deputy Roger Hom said. They had been separated  from two other hikers about 4:30 p.m. Monday near Devil's Canyon Trail, north  of Monrovia, he said.  </P> <P> "They were wearing tank tops and shorts and were obviously not prepared to stay  overnight up there," Hom said. "They were tired, cold and hungry."  </P> <P> The women were found about 6 a.m. by five members of the Sheriff's Department  Montrose search and rescue team, Hom said. The search had begun at 7:30 p.m.  when the two other hikers, whose identities were unavailable, reported the  women missing.  </P> <P> Taylor and Hansen were flown by helicopter to the Chileo campground, where they  were examined by paramedics and released, Hom said.  </P></p>

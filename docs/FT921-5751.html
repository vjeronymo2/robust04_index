			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Albania swept by tide of violent crime MR Shkelzen Maliqui, head of the Social Democratic Party of the Yugoslav southern province of Kosovo, is unlikely to forget his recent visit to Tirana, the capital of Albania. While out walking, he was attacked by a gang of youths, robbed of his personal possessions, stripped of his clothes, and was forced to wait in a car until someone was kind enough to find him a pair of trousers. Mr Maliqui's experiences pale into significance when compared to what is happening in the smaller towns and villages. Mr Ilika Spiro, a reporter for Albanian radio, last week described a scene in the town of Pogradec, a few miles from the border with Macedonia and Greece, which stepped up its border security at the weekend. 'Thousands of people, mainly between 18 and 25, attacked the warehouses of the workers' supply enterprises, and the privately owned retail stores ..the police tried to stop them. Then large crowds of people headed for the industrial area, broke into the warehouses and food and industrial products were looted. Two people were crushed to death, others have been injured.' Other correspondents, some from western countries, have had their cars stolen, have had to pay protection money to the police, and when possible, travel throughout the countryside with an armed guard. These reports are broadcast every day by Albanian radio. They paint a picture of a country in which daily life has slipped into anarchy, partly as a result of the political and economic vacuum left by the violent overthrow of the communist system more than a year ago. The chronic shortages of almost every food item and medical supplies have also led to random violence, especially among the youth, whose frustration grows as they see no possibility of emigrating. Albanian radio recently reported how schools are no longer safe havens of education. For example, teachers and students from the north-western city of Shkoder last week protested against violence and terror in the schools after a local teacher was stabbed. The shiploads of food sent in almost daily since September from neighbouring Italy and from the European Community appear to have had little impact in stabilising the country, which saw industrial production fall by over 50 per during the last half of 1991. Residents from the city of Lushnje, about 45 km south of Tirana, blame old communist bureaucrats and the hated Sigurimi, or secret police, saying they are behind the demonstrations and violence in order undermine the opposition parties in the run-up to parliamentary elections due to be held on March 22. 'Bureaucracy and corrupt officials are to blame for the whole incident,' a resident from Lushnje told state television. 'The warehouses turned out to be full with goods which they had not distributed to the people. They deliberately opened the doors of the warehouses to cover their own tracks after stealing the goods for themselves,' the local added.</p>

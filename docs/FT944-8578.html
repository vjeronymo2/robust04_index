			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Argentina bans new public spending for 1994 All new spending by the Argentine public sector for the rest of 1994 stopped yesterday following a presidential decree banning all expenditure that had not already been approved. The Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 793m) that the measures are expected to save will be used to pay pensions and Christmas bonuses to Argentina's 3.2m retired people. The cuts - said to include a virtual ban on travel and on the signing of new government contracts - will enable Argentina to finance its social security deficit without the need to borrow, according to Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister. Earlier in the week, Mr Cavallo had threatened to unleash 'savage' budgetary cuts if Congress failed to pass legislation requesting emergency funds and incorporating measures to curb future social security payments. Signs that Congress was unlikely to pass this legislation quickly prompted Mr Cavallo to act. He said cuts were necessary 'to offset the excess spending of this year'. With only 43 days of 1994 remaining it is 'safe to assume that money not yet spent is not now needed or that, if it is required, it can wait until January 1', he said. Mr Cavallo blames the deterioration of the fiscal account, which showed a deficit for the third quarter - the first in more than two years - on a spate of court decisions backing pensioners' claims for higher payments, undermining government attempts to uncouple pensions from indexes of historic inflation and current wages. Without such adjustments, officials say, the pensions system faces bankruptcy. Some feel the Economy Ministry is exaggerating the significance of pension payments to mask spending laxities. Mr Cavallo admitted to visiting foreign investors recently that he was deliberately raising the stakes in order to persuade cabinet and Congress to accept cost-cutting legislation. 'If I say that the deficit is manageable then everyone will come to the ministry asking for more money,' he said. In emphasising fiscal problems to a domestic audience, Mr Cavallo risks alarming foreign investors. Last month, Argentina had to pay 350 basis points above US treasury bond prices for a sovereign five-year bond issue, a sign that international confidence in Argentina has waned.</p>

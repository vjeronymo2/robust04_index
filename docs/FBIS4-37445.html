			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 20 Jun (INA) -- A delegation of French  businessmen arrived in Baghdad today on a four-day visit to Iraq.    The delegation, representing 28 French trade and industrial  firms, will hold meetings with Iraqi officials on ways to  promote Iraqi-French cooperation and relations in the economic  and trade fields.    It is worth noting that the national union of French  employers held an expanded meeting in Paris late last month to  discuss Iraqi-French trade and economic relations as well as the  need to activate and promote them in a way that will serve the  interest of both peoples.</p>

Happily gathered  in a hall were leaders of the provincial party committee, the  provincial people's congress, the provincial government, the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]  provincial committee, and the provincial party discipline  inspection commission, as well as leaders of military and armed  police units stationed in Zhejiang. They freely enjoyed the  harmonious ties between the military and the masses and  discussed general plans on further improving double-support  programs under new circumstances.    Li Zemin, secretary of the provincial party committee,  chaired the meeting.    Military and local leaders attending the meeting fully  affirmed the accomplishments Zhejiang has made on double-support  work in 1993. They pointed out: Various localities in Zhejiang  have earnestly implemented the instructions and guidelines of  the party Central Committee and the State Council on paying  attention to and supporting military and local reform and  construction projects. They have conscientiously involved  themselves, have performed realistic tasks, and have actively  helped military units resolve various problems, including  fulfilling duties for combat-readiness, enhancing military  training, raising production, and improving living conditions.  Various relevant provincial departments have closely  coordinated with one another and actively supported military  units to enhance production and operations in an effort to  effectively improve the placement of retired soldiers.  Consequently, these efforts have considerably enhanced army  building and have further consolidated and strengthened the  unity between the military and the government and between the  military and the masses. Attending comrades indicated: In 1994,  we should strictly concentrate our energies on the overall task  of economic construction, proceed from grass-roots units, pay  attention to achieving realistic results, and actively join in  Zhejiang's reform and opening-up undertakings. Meanwhile, we  should continually and actively support army building and  properly serve the military units. We should improve our  campaigns, whereby military units and localities perform  realistic tasks for one another, and whereby the military, the  police, and the masses can develop jointly.    Li Zemin listened to attending comrades' speeches. Then, on  behalf of the provincial party committee, the provincial  people's congress standing committee, the provincial government,  the provincial CPPCC committee, and the people of Zhejiang, he  extended festive greetings and lofty respects to officers and  men of military and armed police units stationed in Zhejiang.  He said: In 1993, Zhejiang earnestly implemented the party's  basic line, seized opportunities, deepened reform, and promoted  development. Consequently, the province has maintained political  and social stability, has enhnaced economic progress, and has  contniually raised living standards. The overall situation has  been good. Such results are inseparable from the effective  support and help given by all the officers and men of military  and armed police units stationed in Zhejiang. Besides executing  their duties in safeguarding coastal and border defense in 1993,  officers and men of military and armed police units stationed in  Zhejiang also joined in protecting local social order and in  waging anti-smuggling struggles, thereby maintaining social  stability. The broad ranks of officers and men also  enthusiastically participated in local key construction  projects. They have, as always in the past, joined in  emergency-rescue work and in providing disaster relief.  Wherever there is a disaster, there will be the People's  Liberation Army, which regards emergencies of the locality and  the people as its own. Officers and men of military and armed  police units stationed in Zhejiang have also joined in campaigns  that facilitated "the joint development of the military, the  police, and the masses" and have done a lot of work to enhance  spiritual civilization drives in various localtities. He  pointed out: While doing double-support work in 1994, Zhejiang  must obey and serve the overall requirements for performing the  whole party's work in accordance with the central authorities'  instructions: We must "seize the opportunity, deepen reform,  open up wider, promote development, and maintain stability."  Additionally, we must regard developing grass-roots units,  promoting education programs, and performing realistic tasks as  our major work. We should pay attention to enhancing army  building and living conditions of officers and soldiers so as to  further foster the ties between the military and the government  and between the military and the masses. Leaders at various  levels should pay close attention to double-support work. They  should intensify education programs among the broad ranks of  cadres and people, stressing the importance of unity between the  military and the government and between the military and the  masses. Consequently, various double-support tasks can be  earnestly carried out at the grass-roots units, and Zhejiang's  double-support work can be raised to new heights.    Provincial party, military, and government leaders, as well  as leaders of various military units stationed in Zhejiang,  attended the meeting.</p>

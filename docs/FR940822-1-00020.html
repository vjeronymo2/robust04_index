			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is proposing to amend 10 CFR Part 20 of its regulations to provide specific radiological criteria for the decommissioning of lands and structures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC is using an enhanced participatory process for developing the criteria. This process included a series of seven workshops held from January through May 1993. The workshops were conducted at a very early stage of rulemaking to enhance participation of interested parties and the public with the following objectives: (a) To ensure that the relevant issues have been identified; (b) to exchange information on these issues; and (c) to identify underlying concerns and areas of disagreement, and, where possible, approaches for resolution. In July 1993, the NRC staff also conducted eight scoping meetings for the development of the Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) supporting the rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed criteria would apply to the decommissioning of all facilities licensed under 10 CFR Parts 30, 40, 50, 60, 61, 70, and 72, as well as other facilities subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, (AEA) and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974. The Commission would apply these criteria in situations where remediation of radioactive material residues resulting from use or possession of Source, Byproduct, and Special Nuclear Material is undertaken. For high-level and low-level waste disposal facilities (10 CFR Parts 60 and 61), the criteria would apply only to ancillary surface facilities that support radioactive waste disposal activities because criteria for closure of the remainder of the facility and termination of the license are specified in 10 CFR Parts 60 and 61. For uranium mills, the criteria would apply to decommissioning of the facility but not to soil cleanup or the disposal of uranium mill tailings, which is covered in Appendix A of 10 CFR Part 40 and Environmental Protection Agency standards in 40 CFR Part 192. The criteria would apply to decommissioning of nuclear facilities that operate through their normal lifetime, as well as to those that may be shut down prematurely. However, they would not apply to sites currently covered by a decommissioning plan approved by the Commission before the effective date of this rule, if it is adopted as a final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the rulemaking is to ensure that decommissioning will be carried out without undue impact on public and occupational health and safety and the environment. The proposed amendments enhance the existing regulatory framework by providing a clear and consistent regulatory basis for determining the extent to which lands and structures must be remediated before a site can be decommissioned. The Commission believes that inclusion of criteria in the regulations would result in more efficient and consistent licensing actions related to the numerous and frequently complex site decontamination and decommissioning activities anticipated in the future. The Commission has developed the basis for the residual contamination levels in light of changes in basic radiation protection standards, improvements in remediation and radiation detection technologies, decommissioning experience obtained during the past 15 years, and comments received from workshops held as part of this rulemaking effort.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current regulations do not explicitly address radiological criteria for decommissioning. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The NRC presently allows decommissioning on a site-specific basis using existing guidance. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  However, the Commission believes that codifying radiological criteria for decommissioning in the regulations would allow the NRC to more effectively carry out its function of protecting public health and the environment at decommissioned sites by providing for more efficient use of NRC and licensee resources, consistent application across all types of licenses, and a predictable basis for decommissioning planning. In addition, it would eliminate protracted delays in decommissioning which result as licensees wait for NRC to promulgate regulatory criteria before proceeding with decommissioning of their facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> On June 27, 1988 (53 FR 24018), the Commission published a final rule on General Requirements for Decommissioning Nuclear Facilities. However, this rule did not specifically address radiological criteria for decommissioned sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory guidance, criteria, and practices include the following with emphasis on contamination levels that are As Low as Reasonably Achievable (ALARA): ``Disposal or On-site Storage of Thorium or Uranium from Past Operations'' Branch Technical Position, October 23, 1981, 46 FR 52061; ``Termination of Byproduct, Source, and Special Nuclear Materials Licenses,'' Policy and Guidance Directive FC 83&hyph;23, November 4, 1983; ``Termination of Operating Licenses for Nuclear Reactors'' Regulatory Guide 1.86, June 1974; letter to Stanford University from James R. Miller, Chief, Standardization and Special Projects Branch, Division of Licensing, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, NRC, Docket No. 50&hyph;141, April 21, 1982; ``National Primary Drinking Water Standards,'' 40 CFR 141; ``Radiation Dose Guidelines for Protection Against Transuranium Elements Present in the Environment as a Result of Unplanned Contamination,'' 42 FR 60956, November 30, 1977. Guidance is specified in terms of acceptable levels of residual contamination at decommissioned sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has the statutory responsibility for protection of health and safety and the environment related to the possession and use of source, byproduct, and special nuclear material under the AEA. One part of NRC's responsibility is to ensure safe and timely decommissioning of the nuclear facilities that it licenses and to provide guidance to licensees on how to plan for and prepare their sites for decommissioning. Decommissioning, as previously defined by the NRC, means to remove nuclear facilities safely from service and to reduce residual radioactivity to a level that permits release of the property for unrestricted use and termination of the license. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See, for example, 10 CFR 40.4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the AEA and Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the statutory responsibility to establish generally applicable standards for protection of the public from radioactive material (i.e., outside the NRC licensees site boundaries). The NRC is responsible for ensuring, through licensing requirements and other restrictions, that activities at facilities under NRC jurisdiction do not lead to radiation doses outside the facility boundaries that exceed EPA's generally applicable standards. For this reason, NRC has been coordinating closely with EPA in the development of the proposed decommissioning standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by NRC and EPA in March 1992 provides a basic framework within which NRC and EPA will endeavor to resolve issues of concern relating to the regulation of radionuclides in the environment. Under the guidelines of the MOU, EPA will make a determination as to whether the proposed decommissioning standards provide a sufficient level of protection for public health and safety and the environment. If EPA concludes that the NRC standards are sufficient, EPA will publish its findings in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for notice and comment and propose that NRC licensees be exempt from the standards developed by EPA for non-NRC licensed facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Decommissioning activities are initiated when a licensee decides to terminate licensed activities. Decommissioning activities do not include the removal and disposal of spent fuel, which is considered to be an operational activity or the removal and disposal of nonradioactive structures and materials beyond that necessary to terminate the NRC license. Disposal of nonradioactive hazardous waste not necessary for NRC license termination is not covered by these regulations but would be treated by other appropriate agencies having responsibility over these wastes. If nuclear facilities are to be reused for nuclear purposes, applications for license renewal or amendment, or for a new license are to be submitted according to the appropriate existing regulation. Reuse of a nuclear facility for other nuclear purposes is not considered decommissioning because the facility remains under license.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After licensed activities have ceased, licensees are required to decommission their facilities so that their licenses can be terminated. At present, this requires that radioactivity in land, groundwater, surface water, buildings, and equipment resulting from the licensed operation be reduced to levels that allow the property to be released for unrestricted use. Licensees must then demonstrate that all facilities have been properly decontaminated and that, except for any residual radiological contamination found to be acceptable to remain at the site, radioactive material has been transferred to authorized recipients. Confirmatory surveys are conducted by NRC, where appropriate, to verify that sites meet NRC radiological criteria for decommissioning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> CBS Tries to Revise Baseball Pact: CBS Sports, which may have lost up to $100  million in the first year of its Major League Baseball pact, has asked baseball  for some of its money back.  </P> <P> CBS Inc. said last month that it expected losses in 1990's fourth quarter,  largely because of its $1.06-billion, four-year deal, and now the network  apparently wants Major League Baseball to help share the load. Published  reports have also said that if baseball is not willing to give CBS a rebate,  the network wants more games. CBS showed only 16 regular-season games in its  first year of the deal, while ESPN, which paid baseball $400 million for four  years, showed 161.  </P></p>

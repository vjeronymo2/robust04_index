			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: Hershey may seek further European deals HERSHEY Foods, the largest publicly traded manufacturer of chocolate and confectionery products in the US, may be looking for more acquisitions in Europe. Mr Richard Zimmerman, chairman, was reported to have told securities analysts the group was 'looking for two to three good acquisitions that might string together to become a potent force'. There was no immediate comment from Hershey's head office in Pennsylvania. According to reports from the meeting, Mr Zimmerman suggested the US company was looking for market niches that would give it exposure to Europe without creating a backlash from competitors. Hershey Foods has taken one recent step into Europe with the purchase last May of Gubor Schokoladen, which makes pralines and seasonal chocolates under the Gubor name.</p>

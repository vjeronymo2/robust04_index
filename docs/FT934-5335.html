			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: News Corp forces the super-share issue at ASX - Nikki Tait looks at Rupert Murdoch's plan for a new class of stock with stronger rights Super shares became a hotbed of controversy after Mr Rupert Murdoch announced in September that his media group News Corporation would seek to introduce them. But differential voting rights do not feature in Australia, and the move requires a change to Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) listing rules. Critics fear such schemes would be used to entrench management positions. The potential problem for the ASX is that News Corporation - the second largest company, in terms of share turnover, on the exchange - could move its listing overseas if its wishes are not accommodated. The most frequently mooted alternative is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The strength of this threat has also been debated. Yesterday, the Australian Investment Managers Group (AIMG) said it understood, from informal talks, that NYSE rules would not allow News Corporation to move and then introduce super-voting shares, if ASX rules continued to forbid this. However, 'if News Corp were to put its proposal in place, be delisted in Australia, and then go to the NYSE with the arrangements already in place when seeking domestic US listing, the NYSE seems likely to list on the basis that the arrangement is already in place.' The AIMG comments came as the deadline for the submission of views to the ASX on the super-share issue was reached. But the exchange said it would accept some late submissions, including those from the London Stock Exchange and the Business Council of Australia. The BCA has asked for a December 9 deadline. But the late arrival of some comments calls further into question the timetable for a decision. Already, a parliamentary committee and the Attorney-General have suggested that more time should be allowed to debate all the implications of differential voting rights. The Australian Securities Commission will also wants to review the implications of any change for company law - especially in terms of takeover rules. According to the ASX, however, News Corporation is seeking a speedy decision. 'We have one company with tight deadlines. I understand that News Corp has commercial opportunities open to it,' said Mr Ray Shoer, the national director, companies. He said December 21 was the earliest possible date for a decision, but the timing should become clearer after the meeting between the chairman of the ASX and the Attorney-General later this week. Ironically, News Corporation was among those parties which failed to deliver a submission by yesterday's deadline. 'I think the Thanksgiving holiday made them late - we're expecting it at any minute,' said the ASX. No one was available to comment at News Corporation. The Australian Mutual Provident, the country's largest life company and owner of the Pearl Assurance in the UK, also expressed its support for the AIMG's stance - the first time it has spoken out separately on the issue. 'There is no benefit to shareholders in departing from the principle of one share, one vote. The reputation of the Australian market has improved significantly and it is important that our reputation and integrity be maintained and fostered,' it said.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Tarmac Tarmac's management has done a fine job in getting from where it was two years ago to where it is today. But that does not mean it is best placed for tomorrow. Debt has been cut, peripheral businesses sold and the balance sheet restored, thanks to a Pounds 215m rights issue. But by starting to rationalise too late, Tarmac has been left with its capital deployed in the wrong places at the wrong time. Tarmac pulled out an impressive amount of working capital last year. But that partly came from cannibalising its land bank. Capital employed in housing has been cut from Pounds 581m in 1990 to Pounds 196m last year. The company vows not to repeat past mistakes by chasing volume at the expense of margin. But rival housebuilders are already better placed, having sunk rights issue money into new housing land. The other worry concerns the US, where Tarmac makes profits of just Dollars 5m on Dollars 724m of assets. Either there is much scope for improving margins; or those assets are overvalued. Despite these drawbacks, Tarmac boasts great long term promise in quarrying and contracting. Any company making a pre-tax margin of less than 3 per cent on turnover of Pounds 2.4bn must have much room for profits growth. But whether Tarmac can catch up with this business cycle is open to doubt. Consensus expectations for 1996 earnings put its shares on a premium forward rating. But by then, the cycle should have turned and building materials stocks should be returning to a discount to the market.</p>

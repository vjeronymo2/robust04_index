			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Major draws on wide range of party views in shake-up MR JOHN MAJOR showed evi-dence of determination to draw his government from all elements of the Conservative party in his first full-scale ministerial reshuffle. He promoted Mr Jonathan Aitken, a long-standing backbench Euro-sceptic, and Mr Michael Mates, who ran Mr Michael Heseltine's leadership campaign. But the largest shake-up of government posts since 1979, including the cabinet moves, hit an unexpected obstacle when Mrs Edwina Currie turned down the chance to return to government. The sharpest promotion is that of Mr Stephen Dorrell, who moves from junior health minister to become financial secretary to the Treasury. Other new Treasury ministers are Sir John Cope, a Tory party deputy chairman previously a minister, and Mr Anthony Nelson, who joins the government as economic secretary. Mr Major has appointed some longer-serving MPs whose abilities languished on the back benches during the Thatcher years. These include Mr Nigel Forman, parliamentary private secretary to Mr Nigel Lawson as chancellor, who becomes a junior education minister, and Mr Charles Wardle, who goes to the Home Office. Mr Aitken becomes a defence minister while Mr Mates, chairman of the cross-party Anglo-Irish Group and a former army colonel, becomes a minister at the Northern Ireland Office. The most rapid promotion goes to Sir Derek Spencer QC, elected Conservative MP for Brighton Pavilion last week, who collected a knighthood on being appointed solicitor-general. Sir Derek, 56, parliamentary private secretary to the attorney-general in 1986-87, was MP for Leicester South from 1983 until the 1987 general election when he lost the seat to Labour by 1,877 votes. The reshuffle is also intended to strengthen the ministerial team in the House of Lords. Baroness Denton becomes a junior trade and industry minister, and Baroness Cumberlege a junior health minister. Mr John Redwood, former corporate affairs minister, and Mr David Maclean, who was at the agriculture ministry, become Environment Department ministers of state. Mr Tim Eggar and Mr Richard Needham become the trade and industry ministers. Mr Robert Atkins, the sports minister, becomes a minister of state, Northern Ireland. There was surprise at Westminster that Mrs Currie turned down the opportunity to be a middle-ranking minister. The speculation was that she had been offered a minister of state post at the Home Office. She said she thought someone else could 'do the job far better than I, so I have declined'. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, was health secretary at the time Mrs Currie resigned as a junior health minister over remarks about British egg production being infected with salmonella. Taking into account the cabinet changes and those ministers who lost their seats, 22 have left the government, though only six of those resigned yesterday.</p>

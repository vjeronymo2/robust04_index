			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / A snail on Mogadon The Labour party is whingeing and wailing fit to wake the dead. If it is not careful it will disturb the voters. 'We wuz robbed', the party yells. Its leader, Mr John Smith, has taken to observing, with understandable acerbity, that the Conservatives deceived the electorate last year. Goodness me. 'I do not know how the right honourable gentleman can sit there as prime minister of a government who are capable of deceit on such a scale,' charged Mr Smith in the Commons on Tuesday, staring straight across the despatch box at Mr John Major. He had a point. The Conservatives fought the 1992 campaign on the basis of a tax-reducing Budget and many assurances that taxation would not have to be increased. In his reply to the Budget speech, the shadow chancellor, Mr Gordon Brown, took full advantage of his opportunity. 'There will be tax rises now, tax rises later, and tax rises two years later,' he crowed on Wednesday. That is a . . . triple Conservative tax whammy.' It was Mr Brown at his best. Yesterday, Mr Smith put it to the prime minister that, following Tuesday's Budget, the typical British family would pay Pounds 442 a year more from April 1994 and Pounds 650 from April 1995. Mr Major did not leap to deny that arithmetic. He dodged it. Labour is right to protest. Most of us remember the April election very well. There are two possible explanations for the message of the Conservative campaign, which might be summed up as 'read my lips - no new taxes'. One is that it was based on a strategy of deliberate deception. Heaven forfend. Deceive? Such honourable gentlemen? Surely not. A more charitable interpretation is that the prime minister and the chancellor were so witless that they allowed themselves to be fooled, as I was from time to time, into believing Treasury assurances that the end of the recession would become apparent during 1992. They were therefore free to assure the cameras that no tax increases were 'planned' or 'needed', without going into tedious explanations of the use of those code words, so familiar to political practitioners. What they actually mean is: 'No increases planned this afternoon. None needed this evening. Tomorrow may be different.' The chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, proffers a third interpretation. He says that the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel and power, and the higher rates of taxation on petrol and cars, are all part of a package designed to meet Britain's commitment to reduce CO emissions, made at Rio last June. That was three months after the election. Those of us who take our environmentalism seriously are perhaps too easily softened up by such arguments. Harder heads will wonder whether Mr Lamont was merely looking for the VAT increase that would be easiest to camouflage with pious excuses. It is the task of the opposition to instil a recollection of 'Tory promises betrayed' into the folk-memory. Yet not all voters will be overly impressed. They are aware that during election campaigns politicians regard 'truth' as a quaint conceit. Who can recall a British contest that was not an auction of false promises of cost-free benefits for all? Consider. Sir Anthony Eden bought the May 1955 election for the Conservatives by knocking 6 old pence (2 1/2 p) in the pound off income tax and abolishing purchase tax, the precursor of VAT, for certain goods. He and his chancellor, Mr R A Butler, knew this was irresponsible, but they sedated their consciences with a bowl of soothing Treasury advice, prepared by time-serving officials. The stratagem was effective. The Tories won. Within a month sterling was under pressure. Messrs Eden and Butler, purveyors of political veracity, did not flinch. They presented an October Budget, taking back in indirect taxation what they had given away in direct tax relief in April. In 1959 the then Mr Harold Macmillan ach-ieved a dubious victory by hiring Colman, Prentis &amp; Varley, that year's equivalent of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, to advertise the Conservatives as the party of prosperity. The Tories won. Within a year the pre-election inflationary 'go' was followed by a post-election deflationary 'stop'. The voters had been suckered once again. Although the Conservatives are champion practitioners of electoral deceit, they do not command a monopoly of the methodology. The 1966 election was preceded by a copious outpouring of spending promises and plenty of smart footwork by the Labour prime minister, the then Mr Harold Wilson. His government assured the electorate that no increase in tax would be required. Labour won. Almost immediately afterwards, the second Wilson administration introduced special employment tax. The following year the Labour chancellor, now Lord Callaghan, was obliged by the International Monetary Fund to deflate, and devalue. He had the grace to resign. All of this is most reprehensible, but it is a fact of political life. Mr Bill Clinton became president because he recognised that in contemporary two-party democracies, the governing party will always bluff. The task of the opposition is to double-bluff. That is so obvious that even the British Labour party is beginning to absorb the lesson. The danger is that it will absorb it too well. Nothing would be more fatal to the opposition's chances of returning to government than a strategy based on the myth that the sole explanation for the Conservatives' victory last April is that they pulled the wool over our eyes. That may - must - have had something to do with it, but the true reason for the defeat of Labour is that more than 65 per cent of the electorate did not want the party then led by Mr Neil Kinnock to rule the country. Mr Smith's task, which he is undertaking at the pace of a snail on Mogadon, is to refashion his party into one that voters actually want. He and his colleagues have made a tentative start. They have jettisoned some of the policies rejected last year, adopted a new line on constitutional reform, and reduced the power of the trade unions over their affairs. More is coming. Meanwhile they should hesitate before expending excess energy on protestations against Tory deception. They cannot afford to be distracted for too long from their real task, which is to create an electable opposition.</p>

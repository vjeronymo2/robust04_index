Alternative Enforcement Options  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters offered alternatives to EPA's proposed enforcement scheme. The alternatives proposed include: EPA should rely on cease and desist orders; EPA should only presume liability where a violation is found and allow private contract law to insure the violator against upstream causation; EPA should require willful and knowing negligence for vicarious refiner liability; and EPA should impose sampling and testing requirements on all tank truck carriers, even if sampling and testing is already performed by an upstream party for the carrier, to avoid economic advantage over for-hire carriers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has considered these alternative enforcement schemes and has determined to implement the scheme as proposed or modified and discussed above. This enforcement scheme is unified, consistent with EPA's enforcement in the gasoline volatility, diesel sulfur and lead phasedown programs, and focusses enforcement attention at the points in the distribution system where the pollution forming potential of gasolines may be affected by parties in the manufacturing and/or distribution process. A stringent compliance oversight and enforcement program, as described in detail in the final rule and this preamble, is necessitated by the significant financial incentives that exist for parties to not comply. EPA's experience in the lead phasedown and gasoline volatility programs has been that financial incentives will result in cheating and that a vigorous enforcement presence will result in diminished incidence of non-compliance. Accordingly, EPA believes that an enforcement program relying on cease and desist orders alone for encouraging compliance by parties would not be effective in deterring violations and would fail to remove economic incentives for non-compliance. Further, EPA believes that reliance on private contract law to insure the violator against upstream causation would be ineffective in providing for maximum compliance due to the uncertainty of the resolution of contract disputes and the amenability of such disputes to resolution for reasons other than the interests of compliance with the Clean Air Act. Also, EPA has determined not to require willful and knowing negligence for vicarious refiner liability due to the difficulty of establishing knowledge and due to EPA's belief that such a requirement would ease the obligation of refiners to strictly monitor the quality of their product as it is distributed. Finally, EPA has created a system of sampling and testing that creates the most thorough oversight scheme necessary while avoiding unnecessary redundancies. The regulations require each party to conduct sampling and testing at appropriate points in the distribution system. However, as discussed above, EPA will exercise its enforcement discretion so as to allow parties the flexibility to jointly assume responsibility for the accomplishment of required testing. This exercise of enforcement discretion is intended to avoid redundancies. EPA cannot justify the imposition of unnecessary sampling and testing on the regulated community to alter economic advantages associated with this program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Baselines for Imported Gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA received comments on the appropriate baseline to apply for gasolines produced at foreign refineries and imported into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's regulations prescribe the procedures for establishing 1990 baselines for refiners and importers. Compliance with the anti-dumping standards is measured by comparison to these baselines. In addition, during the period 1995 through 1997, the reformulated gasoline emissions standards are based in part on maximum parameter levels measured against these baselines. Section 211(k)(8) provides for refiners, blenders or importers to determine individual 1990 baselines predicated on adequate and reliable data. In the absence of such adequate and reliable data, Congress prescribed a summertime baseline and mandated that the Administrator would establish a wintertime baseline.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 66 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 66 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The statutory baseline is intended to approximate the national average gasoline parameter values for gasoline used in the United States in 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule provides mechanisms for establishing accurate and verifiable refinery baselines, while avoiding options that might provide incentives for the regulated community to ``game'' the baseline-setting process. These two principles that underlie the baseline-setting mechanisms (accurate, verifiable, and no opportunity for ``gaming'') serve the environmental purpose of ensuring that the quality of gasoline used in the United States beginning in 1995 is properly compared with the quality of the gasoline used in the United States in 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequent to January 1, 1995, all conventional gasoline marketed in the U.S. will be subject to emission standards established with reference to an individual baseline. Between January 1, 1995 and January 1, 1998, all reformulated gasoline marketed in the U.S. also will be subject to standards established with reference to an individual baseline. The consequence of a baseline-setting mechanism that would result in baselines that, overall, are less stringent than 1990 average gasoline quality, would be that the environmental benefits intended for reformulated and conventional gasoline beginning in 1995 would not be achieved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If refiners had the option of presenting the data necessary to establish an individual refinery baseline, or being assigned the anti-dumping statutory baseline, each refiner's choice would be clear. Each refiner would calculate whether the individual baseline or the statutory baseline is more stringent for that refiner, and would simply select the least stringent option. In consequence, if parties were given more than one regulatory option to establish a baseline, the cumulative effect of each individual refiner's exercise of the baseline-setting option would be that the environmental benefits intended for reformulated and conventional gasoline would not be achieved. Accordingly, EPA has avoided providing options within the baseline-setting scheme.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

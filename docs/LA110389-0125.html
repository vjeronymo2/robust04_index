			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> OPRAH: It's billed as "An Afternoon With Oprah Winfrey," but no one -- not even  Winfrey -- knows exactly what the TV talk show queen will do on stage Sunday at  Anaheim's Celebrity Theatre. . . . A press release mentions "an inspiring and  uplifting mix of stories, anecdotes and dramatic interpretations" but her  spokesman says Winfrey never knows in advance what she is going to talk about.  . . . Fans don't seem to care: the 2,500-seat theater sold out three weeks ago.  Steve Emmons and Rick VanderKnyff  </P></p>

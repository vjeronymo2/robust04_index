			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Nissan Motor Co. said  Thursday [14 April] that one of its U.S. subsidiaries will  start production of Nissan electric forklifts in the second half  of 1995.    Nissan Forklift Corp., North America (NFC), based in  Marengo,  Illinois, made the decision in order to further advance  localization as well as to help shorten delivery time and cut  production costs, the second-largest Japanese automaker said.    NFC now produces internal-combustion-powered forklifts  mainly  for the North American market. It also makes electric forklifts  under the Barrett brand name.    NFC is owned 2 percent by Nissan, 88 percent by a Nissan  subsidiary, Nissan Industrial Equipment Co., and the remaining  10 percent by Marubeni Corp., a giant Japanese trading house.</p>

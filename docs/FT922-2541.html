			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Politics raises passions in riverbank rumpus: The competition to develop London's County Hall is focusing on Whitehall Ever since Mr Ken Livingstone, the Greater London Council's last leader, preached defiance at the Thatcher government from its roof, London's County Hall has been a source of fierce controversy. It is now as acute as ever. The Thames-side buildings are in the hands of a Japanese developer, but they are keenly sought by the London School of Economics. The LSE wants to swap them for its cramped site off Aldwych, and is pulling out all the stops to get them. The School has strong backing, and not just from a broad range of London luminaries. A cross-party Commons motion to be tabled today calls on Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, to delay the sale 'whilst full and detailed consideration' is given to the LSE's proposal. Its success will probably turn on the moods of two individuals, Prime Minister John Major and Mr Takashi Shirayama, the Anglophile whose Shirayama Shokusan company bought County Hall earlier this year. Mr Major returns from the Earth Summit to find rumours swirling about his imminent intervention in the deal, while Mr Shirayama, is increasingly frustrated by the political controversy that came with the buildings. The LSE's campaign against the Japanese purchase echoes painfully in Mr Shirayama's ears. The chirpy 45-year-old Osaka businessman has a certain sympathy for the institution, but not for its argument that the site's fate should be determined by non-financial considerations. Of particular concern to Mr Shirayama are the persistent whispers that he is another got-rich-quick Japanese speculator who may not have the resources to develop the site. He wants it to be known that he is an eighth-generation Shirayama, that his family's wealth resides in extensive land holdings in the Osaka area, that he is of modest taste and does not regard County Hall as anything more than a sound business venture. 'I am not obsessed by money, but the County Hall project should be commercially viable and the LSE proposal is not. We have chosen British architects who will make a realistic plan, and we are very aware of the concerns about the building's heritage,' said Mr Shirayama, who admires Arnold Toynbee and Shakespeare. Professing a deep love of things British and American is not, however, enough to ward off the LSE, which argues that County Hall is a public building which should be employed for more vital national purposes than the hotel, shops, convention space, sports club and disco complex that Mr Shirayama has in mind. Dr John Ashworth, the LSE's ebullient director, has spent the last 18 months campaigning to move the School, Britain's foremost social science university. He is not solely concerned with raising the LSE's profile and prestige: the extra space available at County Hall would, he says, make an ideal base for outside bodies to rent for applied research - embracing everything from City analysts to highly specialised research institutes. The net cost of the LSE scheme - after refurbishment and disposal of the School's present site - is set at around Pounds 60m. 'There could be no more appropriate use for County Hall,' says Dr Ashworth. 'All we are asking is for the government to take a broad view of the issue - and not to determine the future of this prize national asset on the basis of a one-off financial gain.' The vision is appealing but it has yet to inspire a change of mind at the London Residuary Body (LRB), the quango charged with disposing of the assets of the Greater London Council and the Inner London Education Authority, which occupied County Hall until its abolition in 1990. In purely financial terms, the Shirayama offer - estimated at a net Pounds 50m to Pounds 60m - is too good for the LRB to refuse. The LRB is legally obliged to obtain the best price possible in its asset sales, unless otherwise directed by the environment secretary. But the deal, signed in March, is not yet done, as the contract has an escape clause that allows the government to change its mind before the year is out, subject to a penalty fee which rises the later it is invoked. In the House of Lords last week a government spokesman pledged to 'weigh very carefully' the LSE's case. Ministers are reportedly divided on the matter. Mr Michael Heseltine's departure from the environment department is a plus for the LSE: Mr Michael Howard is thought to be more open-minded, with positive enthusiasm for the LSE from sections of the employment and education departments. The Treasury, though, is none too keen on the projected cost of transferring the LSE, and the climate surrounding public spending claims by ministries could hardly be more hostile. The environment department's current line is that responsibility remains with the LRB - and that it will unpick the Japanese deal only after the LRB asks it to do so. Given the divisions in the cabinet, Mr Major's personal intervention will be needed to get the LSE across the Thames. The prime minister's scepticism about the value of academic qualifications is renowned; but the LSE is convinced he can be won over. In any event, a review of the decision would involve a closer look at Mr Shirayama. This may, however, prove difficult. His insistence on privacy has meant that he is little known outside Osaka, even though he came 20th on the list of individual Japanese taxpayers last year, having given over Y1.1bn (Pounds 4.7m) to the government. There are no accurate estimates of his total wealth. He claims ownership of 70,000 tsubo (about 231,000 square metres) in the Osaka area, and has the McDonald's franchise in the region, oil and liquor distribution businesses, and a chain of sports clubs. Under his guidance, Shirayama Shokusan has ventured abroad, buying a Madrid hotel, the Villa Magna, for Pounds 48m in 1989 and investing Dollars 70m in a Pacific resort near Guam. These investments were the first overseas ventures by the company since the pre-war period, when some of the family fortune was lost in Manchurian industrial projects. The financial basis of the company seems, however, to be secure. In Japan, Mr Shirayama escaped the worst effects of the recent sharp falls in Japanese asset prices by selling his Tokyo stock investments four years ago. His disposal were prompted by a Bank of Japan report warning of the dangers of rapid appreciation in real estate and share prices. 'I was influenced by that report. Now I keep all of my money in the bank. I am not interested in buying stocks again,' Mr Shirayama said. An official at the Osaka Chamber of Commerce who has attended meetings with Mr Shirayama said that he has a reputation as a modest and likeable individual: 'He is regarded as a very clean businessman. He's not one of these gang types or someone who made a lot of money from speculation. He's very solid.' Mr Shirayama remains confident about County Hall's commercial prospects, in spite of the property problems down river at Canary Wharf. But he is concerned by the gathering political clouds over his purchase. 'I want nothing to do with the politics,' he pleads. No such disclaimer issues from Dr Ashworth, who recognises that politics, and politics alone, will determine County Hall's future.</p>

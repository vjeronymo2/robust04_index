These leading personnel also delivered their  important speeches at the gathering.    Niemenggu University is the only key higher educational  institution of the autonomous region. Over the past 36 years,  it has turned out 15,118 graduates of various categories for the  state and the autonomous region. In order to meet the challenge  of world technical revolution and to accelerate the development  of higher education in the country, the state put forward the  enforcement of "211 project" in 1992, in which the state urged  localities across the country to successfully foster 100 key  universities and a large number of courses so as to enable the  teaching quality and scientific research and management to reach  the higher level both at home and broad as much aspossible in  the beginning of next century. The autonomous regional party  committee and people's government have attached great importance  on this project and decided to support Neimenggu University to  strive to join in the state "211 project." Over the past six  months, the university has formulated its eight- year plan for  construction and development by making careful preparations and  conducting repeated studies and multiple appraisals in the  fields of schooling scale, establishing specialized courses, and  making more investments in school. In line with the plan, the  university's student number will increase from more than 4,000  at present to 7,000 by the beginning of next century and its  specialized courses' number will increase from 27 at present to  44. It will have 19 new courses for master-degree students and  five new courses for doctor-degree students. Its graduate  students' number will reach to 500 and its standards of key  courses, teaching, and scientific research will reach to the  advanced levels both at home and abroad.    After hearing the report Wang Qun fully acknowledged the  work  done by the university and delivered an important speech on the  issue of how to operate a socialist university with Chinese  characteristics and how to train transcentury talented  personnel. He said: We should never shake our will in upholding  the party's education line and the socialist schooling  orientation and in training "four haves" new successors. At  present we should earnestly and successfully study Volume 3 of  the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, arm our minds  with the socialist theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, and correct the weaker situation in the  political work undertaken by the higher educational  institutions. Efforts should be made to uphold the principle of  scoring achievements in both political and professional work.  He urged Neimenggu University to do a good job in taking the  lead in this regard. Only by successfully studying Volume 3 of  the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, defining the  schooling orientation, fostering targets, can the university do  a better job in various fields for striving to join in the "211  project" and lay a solid foundation for turning itself into an  advanced socialist university with Chinese characteristics.    Wang Qun said: The task undertaken by the university in  striving to join in the state "211 project" has been decided by  the autonomous regional party committee and people's government.  Thus, the university should only go ahead with the task without  retrogression and only do a good job in the task without giving  it up halfway. The task of joining in the state "211 project"  requires a large amount of financial and material resources and  represents a mission with hard work. Units from top to bottom  should overcome difficulties together and do a good job in  fulfilling the task because the autonomous regional party and  people's government have made up their mind. Meanwhile, efforts  should be made to uphold the spirit of seeking truth from facts  and to refrain from separating the region's reality from the  task. Just following the spirit of "the Chinese People's  Anti-Japanese Military and Political College", Neimenggu  University has scored marked achievements in improving its  former poor schooling conditions. Such a spirit should be  carried forward forever and we should never cast away the spirit  even if our schooling conditions have become good in the future.    Wang Qun pointed out: Various work cannot be separated from  the programs of reform and opening up and so does the university  in joining in the state "211 project". It should dare to  pioneer and to try in the task and change its concept at  present. First of all it should change its concept of running  the university under the guidance of the planned economy. The  university should have all its work meet the needs of building  the market economy and train talented personnel for next century  suitable to the economic development of China and Inner  Mongolia. At present the region's college graduates are many  and those who are suitable to the needs of developing the  socialist market economy are few. In order to deal with the  shortage of talented personnel in the region, it is imperative  to accelerate the reform among the higher educational  institutions. Neimenggu University should dare to pioneer and  to try in the reform. It should tap its internal potential and  while seeking development, it should also tap the potential in  setting up cooperative programs with outside places. It should  not only operate its activities in an open way but also set up  its training courses in outside places. In conducting the  teaching of some specialized courses, the higher educational  institutions should regard enterprises as reliable partners and  set up cooperative programs with economic and productive  departments. In conducting scientific research, these  educational institutions may have these departments define their  courses and provide funds so that both of them can commonly  achieve development. They should place the programs of  developing and manufacturing high scientific and technological  products on the first position and also strive to win support  from various social circles. They should correctly deal with  the relation between institutions' development and reform,  stability so as to apply stability to ensuring development and  to regard reform as a motive force in promoting development.    Wang Zhan and Zhao Zhihong also delivered their speeches at  the gathering.</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> BUILDING MORATORIUM OKD  </P> <P> An urgency ordinance to temporarily stop "mansionization," the replacement of  single-story homes by larger multistory homes, was introduced Tuesday by the  Pasadena Board of Directors.  </P> <P> Under the ordinance, no building permits will be issued for single-family homes  taller than 27 feet or for second-story construction that exceeds 50% of the  square footage of the first floor.  </P> <P> While the ordinance is in place, city staff members will complete a zoning  study to determine how to stop the loss of smaller homes.  </P> <P> City Director Bill Paparian cast the sole vote against the measure, saying the  approach was too broad. City Director Rick Cole abstained.  </P> <P> The ordinance was drafted after residents from the Madison Heights, Lower  Hastings Ranch and Oakdale neighborhood associations complained that small  homes were disappearing as developers tear them down to build larger  residences.  </P></p>

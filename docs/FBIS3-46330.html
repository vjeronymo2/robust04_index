The talks mainly focused on the growth of bilateral  relations  and exchanges between the two parliaments.    A NPC official said the talks proceeded "in a cordial and  friendly atmosphere."    Qiao said the relations between China and Austria have been  good since they established diplomatic ties in 1971.    Recent years see new development of such relationship thanks  to the efforts made by Fischer, Qiao said.    He noted that the two sides have shared identical or similar  views on most of the issues.    Qiao expressed the belief that his visit to Austria will  surely help increase mutual understanding and friendship and  contribute to the development of the two countries in every  field.    Fischer described Qiao's visit to Austria as "a very  important event in the history of bilateral ties."    He said the two countries have a long history of contacts,  adding that it is worthwhile for the two countries to establish  diplomatic ties.    Austria pays great attention to China's development, he  said,  adding that China's economic growth in the past or in the future  is of great significance to the whole Europe.    During the talks, Qiao also expounded his view on the human  rights issue.    Fischer expressed his understanding of China's position on  this issue. Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the NPC Standing  Committee, and Heide Schmidt, the third president of the  National Council of Austria, were present at the meeting.    Also today, Qiao met with Robert Lichael, the second  president of the National Council of Austria, and other leaders  of the Austrian parliament.</p>

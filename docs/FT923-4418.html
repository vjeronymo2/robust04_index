			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Observer: What crisis? What's the world coming to if a country has to cancel it's annual cocktail party? Its almost as bad as hauling down its flag, especially when there is a crisis on back home. Hence, a certain incredulity at the explanation given for the abrupt cancellation of one of the highlights of London's summer cocktails season - today's annual celebration of Brazil's independence day. Paulo-Tarso Flecha de Lima, Brazil's ambassador to London, is having to stay in Brazil on account of 'force majeure'. It is understood that he is not the only Brazilian ambassador to be suffering from FM. When pressed, de Lima's officials explain that he has problems back home on his farm. Given that de Lima is one of Brazil's most senior diplomats and a close ally of President Fernando Collor, who is insisting on making an appearance at today's national day parade in Brasilia, de Lima's excuse sounds rather lame. It certainly wouldn't wash with Sir John Kerr, the UK's urbane permanent representative to the European Communities. The see-saw of French opinion polls - tilting the future of Europe this way, then that, with  nearly half of voters unable to make up their minds - has the Brussels Eurocracy on edge. But Britain's man in Brussels insists that come what may, his cocktail party on the day after the French referendum, will go ahead as planned. Make mine a large one, Carruthers.</p>

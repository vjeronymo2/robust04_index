			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Now for the great UK inflation crossover What would a physician say about an instrument which emitted symptoms of heart failure while he was administering successful treatment, but gave false reassurance if he stopped too early and endangered the patient's health? Such is the UK Retail Prices Index - which rose to alarming levels when interest rates were being raised to control inflation, but which would for a period show near-zero price increases if the chancellor took risks with inflation and reduced interest rates too far and too fast. The worst unfavourable distortions were last autumn when headline inflation of 10.9 per cent was three percentage points above the underlying rate. Even the March figure is distorted upwards. But the April RPI will show the start of a dramatic reversal, when the figures will unduly flatter both the inflation rate and the government - as I am sure the chancellor, Norman Lamont, will point out, even if the Conservative chairman, Chris Patten does not. The Treasury has already forecast a headline April inflation rate of barely more than 6 per cent, although the underlying rate will still be 7 per cent. The pro-Tory distortions will then become more dramatic. Goldman Sachs projects a headline inflation rate of 4.7 per cent in June and one of as little as 3 per cent in October. The underlying rate will also be falling, but much less dramatically to, say, 5 1/2 per cent. The projections assume 10 1/2 per cent base rates by winter. Obviously, 1992 is more tentative. But Goldman Sachs's best guess is that the underlying inflation rate will continue to fall gradually to reach about 5 per cent by June 1992, the last date for a general election, and then continue further towards 4 per cent by the end of the year. On the other hand, the headline rate will bounce up and down between around 3 and 4 3/4 per cent as shown in the chart. There are several reasons for seeking out an underlying or 'core' inflation rate. The RPI inflation, because of its distorted treatment of housing. The best pure inflation measure is probably that of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which excludes mortgage interest and the Community Charge, but brings in house prices indirectly. Even that index still has the defect of including random and erratic fluctuations, which would still be there if the inflation trend were zero, and which policy could never hope to eliminate. Smoothing out these vagaries can never be a mechanical operation. The nearest to an ideal index, if we could have it accurately and on time, has the off-putting title of 'GDP deflator at factor cost'. But the deflator has the great disadvantage of appearing only once a quarter, two or three months late, and is often revised. So we are driven back on to adjusted versions of the RPI. But if the underlying rate which the Treasury has preferred to date - the RPI excluding mortgage interest and the poll tax - were followed, this could show a large inflation jump to 8 3/4 per cent in April because of the 2 1/2 percentage point Budget increase in VAT. The Goldman Sachs index in the chart excludes mortgages, poll tax, VAT and petrol. * * * Although sterling's position in the ERM allows further interest rate reductions, it certainly does not require them. Friday's half percentage point fall in UK base rates to 12 per cent is the last that can be justified as part of the return journey from the abnormally high rate of 15 per cent. In seven out of the past 12 years three month rates averaged more than 12 per cent. Further reductions need to be justified to the hilt by underlying inflation pressures as well as by recession fears. The fact that the Civil Service unions can even contemplate rejecting a pay offer of nearly 8 per cent - itself related to private sector settlements - shows how far inflationary psychology is from being eradicated. Any idea that base rates should move automatically down with the year-on-year headline Retail Prices Index would be a recipe for disaster. Although the Bank of England is not yet independently accountable, it would find ways of making the fact known if it were forced into rate cuts against its better judgment.</p>

The body is the Preliminary Committee for the Preparatory  Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)  of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. It  went into high gear following its second plenary session in the  middle of December after the British Hong Kong authorities  decided to submit an electoral bill to the Legislative Council  there.    So far, all the five specialized groups under the  preliminary  working committee have fulfilled their work plans and will get  down to substantial work early next month.    Starting January 5, 1994, the five specialized groups of the  working committee, namely the groups on political affairs,  economy, law, culture, and society and security, will hold their  meetings in Beijing to discuss concrete problems, and make  suggestions and proposals.    The economic group will hold its meeting first, discussing  issues related to construction of the new airport in Hong Kong,  and harmonious development of large capital construction in Hong  Kong and the mainland. Financial issues such as the handing  over and administration of land funds, and the issue of social  insurance for retired workers will also be discussed.    Priority will be given to the issue of the new airport.    The group on political affairs will focus its discussion on  the principles for the formation of the first Legislative  Council and district boards in Hong Kong.    The law group will check the laws of Hong Kong, including  the  issue of the court of final appeal of the Hong Kong SAR.    The group on society and security will discuss the  definition  of the permanent residence of Hong Kong residents and the  freedom of exit and entry.    The group on culture will discuss the publicizing of the  Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR.    The five specialized groups will hold six meetings next  month. The group on political affairs will hold two meetings.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cusiana biggest BP field since 1970s BRITISH Petroleum, the UK oil company, announced yesterday that reserves in Colombia's Cusiana field are estimated at 1.5bn barrels. This confirmed it as BP's biggest find since the early 1970s when it discovered the Forties field in the North Sea and the Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska. BP accompanied its long-awaited announcement with news of a second discovery north of Cusiana at Cupiagua, with estimated reserves about one-third the size of Cusiana. However, only one well has been drilled so far. 'It is difficult to be clear about the size of the field,' said Mr David Harding, chief executive of BP Colombia. Four more wells are planned over next year. Ecopetrol, the Colombian oil company, put reserves for Cusiana at a slightly more conservative 1.3bn barrels. That caused an unfavourable reaction on the London stock exchange, where BP's shares slipped 3 1/2 p to 231p in heavy trading. However, a final figure will only be available in early 1993, once appraisal wells are completed and tested, and many experts believe the field could be as large as 2bn barrels or more. Cusiana and Cupiagua lie in the foothills of the eastern range of the Andes mountains, and the geological trend may continue yet further north into another block where the Pauto-2 exploration well is now being drilled. Production partners in the Cusiana and Cupiagua fields are BP (15.2 per cent), Total (15.2 per cent) and Triton (9.6 per cent), but BP is the only contractor of the northernmost block. Drilling in the Andean foothills is complicated and expensive, with the oil between 12,000 and 15,000 ft below ground and wells costing some USDollars 24m each. However, Mr Harding said the cost was dropping as BP acquired experience in the area. USDollars 200m has been invested in exploration this year and another Dollars 200m is planned for 1993. Analysts estimate development costs for the Cusiana field at Dollars 2 to Dollars 3 a barrel, with lifting and operating costs about Dollars 2 a barrel and pipeline charges also Dollars 2 a barrel. The tax regime is said to be less stringent than that in the UK. The president of Ecopetrol, Mr Juan Rendon, said he expected Cusiana to be declared commercial in May 1993. Ecopetrol would then take up its 50 per cent share and development would begin. The field should produce 50,000 barrels a day in 1994, rising to about 150,000 b/d by the end of 1995. Although Cusiana also has considerable gas reserves - estimated at between 2,000bn and 3,000bn cubic feet - the gas will initially be reinjected to maximise crude production. BP has built a 1.5km spur from Cusiana to the Central Llanos oil pipeline across the eastern mountains, which is to be upgraded. From there, oil will flow into another existing pipeline to the port of Covenas. Colombian guerrilla groups have been particularly aggressive in recent months, dynamiting pipelines and other oil installations. However, Mr Harding said guerrilla activity had had 'no significant effect' on work at Cusiana. Colombia produces about 470,000 b/d and exports about 250,000 b/d of crude and fuel oil. The Cusiana find will more than offset the future fall in reserves at Cano Limon, allowing Colombia to export more than half of its crude production from 1994.</p>

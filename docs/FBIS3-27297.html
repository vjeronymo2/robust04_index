China's chief representative on the Sino-British Joint  Liaison Group, Guo Fengmin, said the two sides would set the  date for the meeting next week.    Speaking at the Xinhua News Agency local office Lunar New  Year banquet yesterday, Mr Guo said it would be difficult to  hold the Airport Committee talks next week.    "There will be expert talks on security and defence land  next  week, and it would be difficult to hold the two sets of talks  simultaneously," he said.    He said the date for resuming the Airport Committee talks  would be arranged by the time the two sides' experts met next  week.    The Chinese representative on the security and defence land  committee, Luo Jiahuan, said he hoped next week's talks would  lead to an agreement. "Although the issues are very complicated,  there is still hope of reaching a resolution," Mr Luo said.    He was not sure if the British side would be able to resolve  the differences.    He said the main argument would be on the garrison and  redevelopment.    It was proposed that the British military hospital in Tsim  Sha Tsui would be scaled down and Shek Kong garrison would be  redeveloped.    Mr Luo said the Chinese and British sides would arrange a  joint tour to the sites next week.    Meanwhile, another new airport contract has been awarded,  despite the Sino-British impasse over funding.    The Provisional Airport Authority yesterday announced it had  awarded the contract for the airport's baggage handling system  to Swire Engineering Services, in conjunction with Van Der Lande  Industries of the Netherlands and Siemens of Germany.    A political party yesterday urged the government to make  contingency plans to relieve traffic in Kowloon in case the  airport railway link was not completed by 1997.    "It seems to us the government is very optimistic about the  financial arrangement and thinks that the railway will be  completed," Leung Kwong-cheung of the Association for Democracy  and People's Livelihood (ADPL) said.    "It (the government) says it has no special plans as it is  optimistic."    But Mr Leung said in case the railway could not be completed  as scheduled, the government should now start preparing measures  to cope with extra transport demands in West Kowloon, Tsing Yi  and the future No 3 route after the airport opened in 1997.    At a meeting with Principal Assistant Secretary for  Transport  Arthur Ng, the ADPL proposed four contingency plans, including  extending the Kowloon-Canton Railway to Central.</p>

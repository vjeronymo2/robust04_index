			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Arts: A sadly misconceived Sylvia - Dance I reported on David Bintley's Sylvia last October, when Birmingham Royal Ballet first exposed us to it on their native heath. I cannot but feel that it would have been better to expose it on a hillside at birth. For it is, alas, a monster, a 24 carat, copper-bottomed, fully-guaranteed brute, which I find misconceived, misbegotten, and a miserable indictment of artistic taste and policy. Delibes' score is one of the greatest ever made for dancing, unfailingly mellifluous, grand, witty. (And Ashton's realisation of it in 1952, when he was at the height of his powers, ideally matched the music's beauties, as did the design by the Ironside brothers. That version, of course, has long been abandoned by our national ballet). The story of the nymph Sylvia and her love for the ninny-ish Aminta is no great shakes, but it appealed to the academic taste of the 1880s, which delighted in such classic nostalgia, be it in the music of Saint-Saens or the canvases of Bouguereau. Bintley mistrusts the tale, and its implicit style, and has sought by an inept up-dating - which mingles classic myth with a dinner-jacketed hero arriving in a Bugatti - to make it seem more apt. In fact, his revisions, the conflicts between modern dress and antique manners - Eros shown as an old buffer in natty summer suiting; Orion, the villain, moving from rags to evening dress - fatally undermine any charm the narrative might have had. His Sylvia has less dramatic cogency than the original. All this camping about with a classic past would be less tiresome were there compensations of step or design. What can bring on a flux of rage is the cussed, ungrateful choreography Bintley has made - his customary facility and felicity of means rarely apparent - and the awfulness of Sue Blane's design. A quasi-permanent set encroaches crudely on the stage (the dance looks cramped) and is seemingly made from giant crumplings of elephant-grey linoleum. An outburst of candles in Orion's grotto suggests we are in a maniac Lourdes (replete with pier glass, chair and sarcophagus bar). The last act is a muddle of antique columns as unlikely and rickety as the choreography's academism. Costuming ranges from the dull to the desperate - Aminta's last act rig includes a jerkin made from what I take to be ruched loo-paper: it makes him look like Quasimodo intent on a white wedding. I have no patience with the piece, which I have seen three times. The BRB artists appear seriously undermined as classic dancers, their style optimistically busy and distinctly fuzzy round the edges. Nothing they do seems clear, true. At Monday's performance, which opened this short Opera House season, Miyako Yoshida repeated her pretty but recessive interpretation of Sylvia, with Kevin O'Hare as the dimmest of heros. On the next evening, Sandra Madgwick made much more of Sylvia - dance and character came into focus, bright in temperament, fleet in step - and Sergiu Pobereznik showed that Aminta was something more than the wimp he had been the night before. He has a fluent technique which deserves better. I report with continuing disbelief that, in the third act, Eros appears as a one-legged Pirate, a rat tacked to the back of his coat, spinning on his peg-leg, and reducing part of the audience to hysterics. The ballet reduced me to a state of ferocious depression. Sylvia is wholly unworthy of a national ensemble. Birmingham Royal Ballet appears at Covent Garden with varied programmes until 8 April.</p>

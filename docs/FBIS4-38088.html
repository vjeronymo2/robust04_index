			<p>BFN     [Text] According to reports, fierce fighting continues in  southeast Afghanistan. A spokesman of Prime Minister Golboddin  Hekmatyar has claimed that the combined forces of Hekmatyar and  General Abdol Rashid Dostam have reoccupied one out of two  strategic positions in the country's southern region.  Independent sources, however, have not confirmed this claim.  The reports say at least 35 people have been killed and 360  others injured in the latest flare up of fighting.    Meanwhile, a meeting of the jehad leaders assessed the  current situation in Afghanistan. A joint statement issued  after the meeting calls for an urgent meeting of the Leadership  Council to decide on the future government as the term of office  of President Borhanoddin Rabbani and Prime Minister Golboddin  Hekmatyar expires today. Among those who attended the meeting  include former president Professor Mojadeddi, Shaykh Asef  Mohseni, Pir Seyyed Ahmad Gilani, and Maulvi Mohammad Nabi  Mohammadi.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Veronika Romanenkova and Semen Ivanov: "There Is </F> an Alternative to Baykonur. Get to Work, Comrades!"]    [Text] According to the calculations of specialists, only  two years are needed for beginning launches of light boosters  from the new Russian cosmodrome Svobodnyy. And although a  special decree of the government on its establishment and a  directive of the president of the Russian Federation on the  designation of Aleksandr Vinidiktov as the head of the Main  Center for Tests and Use of Space Equipment is expected in the  immediate future, the Military-Space Forces are already in  action.    The end of the cold war brought to the brink of extinction  the one-time most powerful branch of the armed forces: the  Strategic Rocket Forces. Under the conditions of the agreement  on reduction of strategic aggressive arms (START II) the two  powers are continuing the process of mutual disarmament, thus  reducing the confrontation to a lower level. According to the  agreement, up to the year 2003 in Russia, in particular, surface  intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) of six types will be  destroyed, including the heavy RS-20 (SS-18 in the American  classification) which caused the greatest worry beyond the  ocean. This 30-m "cigar" was the most powerful missile in the  world and not without reason in the United States was nicknamed  the "Satan." With a launch weight of more than 200 tons it  carried 10 individually guided nuclear warheads (the power of  each of which was equal to 11 of the atomic bombs dropped on  Hiroshima) and it could transport 8.8 tons for a distance of 11  thousand kilometers. The latest American 10-warhead Peacekeeper  ICBM with a launching weight of 88 tons could deliver only 3.95  tons for this same distance.    As a result of implementation of Start II, only one kind of  ICBM will remain in Russia -- the solid-fuel RS-12M (SS-25) --  both in the now-existing mobile variant, and in the permanently  based variant to be developed. This creation of Votkinsk machine  builders (Udmurtia) has no standard-produced analogues in world  rocket building.    The first to be destroyed will be rockets developed and  constructed at earlier times: RS-10 (SS-11), RS-12 (SS-13) and  RS-16 (SS-17). In addition, those ICBM which are constructed  outside Russia, in the Ukraine, will be removed from the  armament of the Strategic Rocket Forces: these are the RS-20 and  the RS-22 (SS-24). American ICBM also will be destroyed (the  Peacekeeper, known in our country as the MKh) or will be rebuilt  into single-warhead missiles (Minuteman 3).    By the beginning of the 21st century some of the 20 Russian  regions of deployment of combat rocket complexes of the  Strategic Rocket Forces will cease to exist.    Until recently Svobodnyy-18 remained the most easterly  region  of deployment. The armament there consisted of 60 RS-10 ICBM  aimed at targets of the probable enemy. It so happened that a  similar decision on the reoutfitting of the defense facility at  Plesetsk into a space facility was made almost 30 years ago. Now  the same decision has been made with respect to the rocket  division at Svobodnyy-18.    It is very simple to blow up the tens of silos outfitted  with  unique equipment, which, however, had already been partially  done at Svobodnyy-18. But the defense capability of Russia and  its guaranteed access to space would remain in question due to  the unresolved status of Baykonur and the possibility that the  Kazakh side will advance ever-newer leasing conditions.  Accordingly, the former military facility will be preserved, but  it will play a different role, as the Main Center for Tests and  Use of Space Equipment, as part of the Russian Military Space  Forces.    As planned by the Military Space Forces, the Svobodnyy  cosmodrome in the initial stage will consist of two launch pads.  After two years, in 1996, light space boosters of the Rokot type  will be launched directly from the former silos. They also were  constructed on the basis of RS-18 (SS- 19) combat missiles and  already have been twice launched from Baykonur. Later three  additional silos will be allocated to the Rokot.    But the principal task of Svobodnyy will be the launching of  heavy boosters, for which two additional launch facilities will  be constructed. Now the NPO Energiya, Khrunichev Scientific  Production Center and the Makeyev Design Bureau at Miass  (Chelyabinsk Oblast) are developing projects for a new  generation of heavy two-stage boosters to be called the  Angara-24.    Among the requirements imposed on the future rocket the most  important is ecological cleanness. As the fuel for it  specialists most likely will use nontoxic components -- liquid  oxygen and hydrogen, as well as kerosene. The first stage and  the nose cowling will fall to the ground. In the future the  first stage will become multiply reusable and will make a  gliding descent to the launch site. The second stage will be put  into a reference orbit by command and will burn up in the  atmosphere.    The deployment region of the rocket division occupied  several  tens of square kilometers in Amur Oblast. With the reoutfitting  of the facility the area will be reduced in size and lands will  be returned to the oblast. Svobodnyy-18 -- the "capital" of the  cosmodrome and the former military city -- is located  approximately 200 km from Blagoveshchensk.    As stated by Vladimir Polevanov, doctor of geological and  mineralogical sciences, administrative chief of Amur Oblast,  clear sunny weather prevails here 300 days a year. In winter, in  January, there are only several days when the temperature drops  to -30 degrees. Even melons and grapes grow here in summer. Amur  Oblast is a far-outlying province of Russia.    The head of the oblast is convinced that with the appearance  of the new cosmodrome the region will "boom"; not only state  investments will come here under the federal program for  construction of the spaceport, but money will begin to be  invested for development of the infrastructure, industry and  commerce. In addition, due to the cosmodrome the oblast will  receive new technologies and jobs, will receive profits from  possible commercial launches and information from satellites  launched at Svobodnyy will help in exploring regions where  minerals may be present.    Most of the local population for the time being is against  the plans of the Military Space Forces and the oblast  administration. The people feel that launches of space rockets  are more dangerous than the nuclear warheads positioned here  earlier. Here an unprecedented flourishing of the environmental  movement also is noted, despite the fact that the future  builders of the spaceport vow to preserve the ecological purity  of the region.    The Russian Space Agency (RSA) also is wishy-washy about the  new idea. The opinion prevails at the agency that the project is  unrealistic because Russia does not have the funds. It is true  that the disapproval of the RSA may be related to the desire  that the Military Space Forces not "retreat" from Baykonur,  where they fully support all launches.    So that the words of Colonel-General Vladimir Ivanov,  commander of the Military Space Forces, that Svobodnyy is "not a  retreat, but on the contrary, an active advance," have a dual  meaning. On the one hand, this is a base for the development of  Russian unmanned cosmonautics. On the other hand, it represents  a strengthening of the position of the Military Space Forces in  its relations with Kazakhstan (in the event of the next  unrealistic demands which it advances with respect to Baykonur)  and in its relations with the Russian Space Agency, which will  be forced to play second fiddle at Svobodnyy if it becomes the  sole possible place for implementing manned programs.</p>

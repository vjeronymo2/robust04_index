			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IRAN OFFERS TO AID HOSTAGES IF U.S. AGREES TO PROD ISRAEL;  </P> <P> BUSH SEES SOME 'HOPE' IN PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani told the United States today that he is  ready to help free hostages in Lebanon but that Washington should abandon  military solutions and pressure Israel to free a kidnaped Muslim cleric.  </P> <P> "I address the White House: There is a solution for Lebanon, a solution for  freeing the hostages," Rafsanjani said at a mass prayer meeting in Tehran.  </P> <P> "Take a sensible attitude, and we will help solve the problems there so that  people of the region may live in peace and friendship."  </P> <P> President Bush, asked about Rafsanjani's proposal, told reporters in  Washington: "When you see a statement that offers hope about the return of our  hostages, I want to explore it to the fullest."  </P> <P> Rafsanjani, in his first foreign policy remarks since taking office Thursday,  said the United States is wrong to seek military solutions for the hostage  crisis in Lebanon.  </P> <P> "You cannot solve anything by bullying and arrogant approaches," he said in a  sermon broadcast on Tehran Radio.  </P> <P> The pro-Iranian Revolutionary Justice Organization suspended a death threat  against American hostage Joseph J. Cicippio, 59, on Thursday but said the  reprieve would last only several days.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Appeals to Iran  </P> <P> The United States had pressed Iran to use its influence with Shiite Muslim  groups in Lebanon to prevent the killing of Western hostages after the reported  hanging Monday of Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, 44.  </P> <P> Rafsanjani said that if the United States wants to end the crisis, it could  pressure Israel to free the Muslim cleric it kidnaped from south Lebanon a week  ago.  </P> <P> The captors of both Higgins and Cicippio have demanded freedom for Sheik Abdel  Karim Obeid, a leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah movement.  </P> <P> "It will be received well in the world if you demand that a criminal (Israel)  give up its crime," Rafsanjani said.  </P> <P> Rafsanjani also questioned whether U.S. military action in Lebanon could be  effective.  </P> <P> "How stupid you are. . . . You have been to Lebanon once, and you saw how the  Lebanese kicked you out," he said, referring to the 1983 killing of 241 U.S.  Marines by a truck bomb in Beirut.  </P> <P> Christian Army commander Michel Aoun, Israel and Iraqi Baathists "are raining  shells on Lebanon. What can your fleet do to stop that? Is there any place in  Lebanon not hit by a shell already?" he asked.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Warships on Alert  </P> <P> U.S. warships are on the alert near Lebanon and Iran.  </P> <P> Rafsanjani heaped scorn on the U.S. military buildup, saying Washington is  backing the wrong side in what he termed a clear-cut case of Israeli  intransigence.  </P> <P> "The clear point is that a government (Israel) has formally admitted that it  has committed a crime," he said.  </P> <P> He said Iran did not know Higgins, who was serving as a U.N. peacekeeping  officer when he was captured in February last year, and he could be innocent  although his captors described him as a spy.  </P> <P> "We don't know who (Higgins' captors) are, or whether they are good people or  not. But we know that the people of Lebanon are oppressed and they cannot be  condemned for no reason," Rafsanjani said.  </P></p>

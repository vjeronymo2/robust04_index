			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with National Defense Minister Mehmet </F> Golhan by Mehmet Ali Birand; place not specified -- live]    [Excerpts] [Birand] How are you, Mr. Minister.    [Golhan] Fine, thank you. This is the first time in 15 years  I have attended the opera. I have left the hall to watch your  program.    [Birand] We thank you. Hundreds of thousands of people are  waiting to hear what you have to say. We are sorry to have  interrupted your opera. What I would like to ask is the  following: Military affairs are always planned in advance. We  are well aware that both the National Defense Ministry and the  Chief of the General Staff's Office are very meticulous on the  issue. It was your government that shortened the military  service. Were you not aware that you would be faced with the  current situation? If you were aware, then why did you shorten  it? This is what everyone wants to know.    [Golhan] Mr. Birand, naturally the problems and the  potential  risk facing Turkey when we shortened military service and the  situation about a month or two ago -- or even the current  situation -- are very different. In other words, we did shorten  the military service from 18 to 15 months last year. It was the  right decision at the time. Since then, however, certain  changes have taken place in our neighbors. I would not like to  name them now. Everyone is well aware to whom I am referring  and which countries I would like to include in this basket. Our  viewers are very intelligent and they will understand. If,  however, I name names now, then there will be talk about the  defense minister creating adversity against that country.  Certain conclusions will be drawn. The foreign threat Turkey  was facing yesterday is different than the one it is facing  today. The current potential foreign threat is very different  than the one in the past. This is the first issue.    Secondly, we have for the last five or six months been  repeatedly saying that we should be taking every necessary  measure to end the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] curse we are  facing. These operations will be concluded this winter and  spring. Turkey will be rid of this problem. We have, for the  last six months, been saying loudly that every possible measure  will be taken to render these bandits ineffective. No doubt,  certain decisions have to be taken in connection with these  measures. These are the reasons for deferring the discharges  from the armed forces.    [Birand] Mr. Minister, the PKK problem existed last year as  well. In other words, this problem existed when your government  shortened the military service. As far as I know, threats  against our country, whether they are from Syria, Russia, the  Caucasus, or any other country, have not increased in the last  few months. There is something here that no one can  understand...    [Golhan] Mr. Birand, I am sure you read the papers.    [Birand] I read much more than the papers.    [Golhan] Our viewers also read the papers. Have you not  heard the voices rising from one of our neighboring countries?  It was in the papers yesterday and today.    [Birand] Obviously, but Mr. Minister...    [Golhan] Did they exist yesterday? Did they exist five  months ago? They did not, categorically not.    [Birand] I do not believe that you can counter a threat  against Turkey from Russia, Syria, Iran, or Iraq with 110,000  soldiers. What I am saying is that there is a mathematical  error here.    [Golhan] There is no mathematical error. Turkey has not  declared mobilization. We are not seeking a mobilization cadre.    [Birand] This is the atmosphere that has been created.    [Golhan] We are obliged to maintain our peace cadres. We are  obliged to maintain this cadre. This is what we are doing.  Furthermore, it is obvious that we cannot discharge the current  soldiers and place the new young recruits, who are fresh out of  training and inexperienced in guerrilla warfare, to fight the  PKK.    [Birand] Could you not have met this shortage by  transferring  troops from other regions? May God bless it, we do have a large  army.    [Golhan] You cannot do that. As I have said earlier, Turkey  is facing certain risks. In many regions you cannot reduce the  number of troops to zero. You cannot reduce the forces and  units deployed in certain regions. You cannot do that. We are  implementing certain transfer of forces anyway. You cannot  reduce the number of troops below a certain level. There are  certain rules in the military. There are possible risks,  threats which have to be taken into consideration.    [Birand] Did the reaction to the decision disturb you? You  are a politician and it was your government -- although you were  not the defense minister at the time -- that first reduced the  military service and is now increasing it.    [Golhan] This is not true. We have not yet increased it.  This is only a measure. We have told you that we will be  carrying out an operation during the winter and spring. The PKK  will definitely be rendered ineffective. In order to fulfill  that promise, we need experienced soldiers who are familiar with  the region.    [Birand] What you are trying to say is that military service  will be reduced again when the PKK is defeated. Is that the  message?    [Golhan] Naturally; the extension is on a one-time basis.  The discharge of soldiers who were to be released in February  and May has been deferred, on a one-time basis, for four months.  This was the decision made by the Council of Ministers.    [Birand] Does this mean that the next batch will serve a  shorter term?    [Golhan] Naturally, if Turkey attains the goals we have set.  The government is determined on the issue. No matter what the  consequences.    [Birand] Then there is a condition.    [Golhan] Of course there are conditions. The conditions were  different yesterday and they have changed today. I hope Turkey  will not be worse off in the next five to 10 months. I hope the  situation will not be more critical.    [Birand] If we want to summarize the conditions based on  what  you have told us, military service will be reduced after the PKK  is defeated, and after Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Russia stop being  a threat.    [Golhan] I am not naming names. I am not naming the  neighbors, you are.    [Birand] Yes, I am naming them not you.    [Golhan] You will remember, elections were held in our  neighboring countries. You are also aware of the foundation  these elections were based on.    [Birand] Then those who will be drafted in the future will  have to wait a while for these conditions to be fulfilled.  [passage omitted]    [Golhan] Turkey has always aspired for peace. For the last  70 years, we have been repeating the slogan "Peace at home,  peace in the world." In spite of this, you are well aware that  certain of our neighbors view Turkey as a potential threat and  plan their deployment accordingly.    [Birand] In a while, we will be broadcasting an interview  with Zhirinovskiy, who described Turkey as a threat.    [Golhan] See, you have already disclosed one of them.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Gas turns up the heat British Gas's decision to submit itself to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is of central importance for the UK's privatised utilities as a class. British Gas may be in some ways a special case. It is the only utility to have suffered a breakdown of relations with its regulator. But that makes it the ideal test case on how far and how frequently a regulator can change the rules. It is also the purest monopoly of the lot: the others either suffer competition at the consumer level, like BT, or are broken into regional monopolies like water and electricity. But that makes Gas the ideal subject for establishing the central question of what kind of rate of return a monopoly should enjoy. For the other utilities - BT especially - the effect is that of a free ride at Gas's expense. Going to the MMC is a fairly desperate expedient, given the risk of an adverse ruling and the burden on senior management time. It is not clear whether Gas did so because of stubborn resistance to change, or in the realisation that the regulatory impasse was making change impossible. Either way, it could ultimately benefit from the experience, not least in being obliged or allowed to slash costs in the BT manner. Investors must now resign themselves to a becalmed share price until the spring. But an MMC reference was mostly in the price already. There is always the chance that the findings will change Gas still further from the animal described in the original prospectus. But for investors, as for the management, there is value in knowing where they stand.</p>

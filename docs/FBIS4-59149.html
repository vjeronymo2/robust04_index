			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kamran Qurrah Daghi: "Russian Official: `We Have </F> Lost Hope of Lifting Blockade on Iraq Soon'"]    [Text] London -- A high-ranking Russian diplomatic source  has told AL-HAYAH that Moscow has lost hope of lifting the  blockade on Iraq soon. The source revealed that a scheduled  visit to Moscow by Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister Riyad al-Qaysi  may not take place, as the Russians have told him they cannot  receive him before 16 May "because his opposite number, Boris  Kolokolov, will not be in Moscow."    The source said that the Iraqis' "interest in the visit has  subsided, because they had hoped it would be made before the  [UN] Security Council discusses continuing the economic  sanctions against Iraq in the middle of the month."    The source pointed out that Moscow has lost hope of the  Security Council changing its position, and that the council  will decide to continue the sanctions, "despite the  Russian-French-Chinese proposals" calling for easing the  sanctions.    As is known, Moscow, Beijing, Paris, and Ankara are exerting  pressure to lift or ease the blockade imposed on Iraq. But the  U.S.-British position is unrelenting.    The Russian source added that two other factors have made  Moscow more certain that lifting the blockade on Iraq is not  easy: First, the U.S. Administration informed a high-level  Russian official who visited Washington two weeks ago of its  intention of continuing the sanctions against Baghdad. Second,  the article written by U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher in THE NEW YORK TIMES a week ago, warning of the  danger of lifting the blockade on Iraq.    The sources went on to say that Moscow and Paris are  studying  a new draft proposal to be submitted to the Security Council,  calling for transcending Resolutions 706 and 712 concerning  selling Iraqi oil under UN supervision. The proposal provides  for increasing the quantity Baghdad is allowed to sell, namely  increasing its value from $1.6 billion to $4-5 billion. But the  problem is that Baghdad is not enthusiastic about the proposal.  The Russian diplomat said the reason is that 60-70 percent of  the revenue would not reach Iraq, but would be transferred to  the Gulf war compensation fund, a part of which would be used to  finance UN operations.</p>

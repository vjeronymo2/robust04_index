			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Fiction: Life after apartheid THE FIRST LIFE OF ADAMASTOR by Andre Brink Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 7.99, 136 pages TAKE LEAVE AND GO by Karel Schoeman Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 14.99, 279 pages ANDRE BRINK, a writer made famous by a series of large-scaled, energetically plotted novels capturing the violent complexities of South African life past and present, here attempts something completely different. End-of-apartheid fiction - moving away from anguished verismo or else didactic accounts of political turmoil to new or previously neglected areas of South African novel-writing sensibility - is already well into its first phase. Writers are reclaiming 'personal' modes of utterance, re-examining history (their own and that of the country itself), re-discovering a wider range of story-telling formats. In a fascinating recent series of Radio 3 interviews with South African authors conducted by Christopher Hope, this point emerged again and again; and one of its most forceful articulators was Brink. His migration from, say, Looking on Darkness or A Chain of Voices to The First Life of Adamastor is a modulation of form, scope, focus, tone of voice: the pessimism that emerges from the juxtaposition of paradisal landscape and the comedie humaine it has engendered, is essentially the substance common to all those works. The new book is a slimline exercise in consciously applied archaic style. Brink found his starting point in the great Portuguese poet Camoens, and in particular the Cantos from the Lusiads dealing with the transformation of the Titan Adamastor into the rocky Cape peninsula as Zeus's punishment for his obsession with the nymph Thetis. This is the inspiration for a new and, for much of its course, freshly invigorating fable on the eternal conflicts of race, culture and religion that have stratified South African history, and the dark strands of sexual attraction that have constantly cut across those politically imposed strata. Adamastor is here leader of a Khoi - in debased South African usage, Hottentot - tribe. One day he finds a white woman deposited on the beach, as if hatched from an egg. In the ensuing tale of mutual incomprehension, growing sexual attraction, courtship and downfall, ruin is inevitable not only for Adamastor but for the whole tribe - a fair amount of it brought about by the size of his own sexual organ, which increases with such unstoppable rampancy that only a lucky painful accident solves the problem. One of the madder myths to have fogged white relations with black Africa is of the black male and his sexual equipment and endowment. Touching symbolically on this and much else, Brink infuses his material with a piquant blend of sophisticated naivety and comic robustness. Quite often, unfortunately, the tone wobbles - it almost always does at diverse points in Brink's fiction - in this case, into irritating cuteness. At times the control of allegorical function seems threatened with debilitating artifice. In the end, though, the author brings it off: a dark subject treated with peculiar imaginative lightness. A younger and less well-known Afrikaner writer, but one with a wonderfully fastidious command of tone, texture and subtly placed descriptive detail, is Karel Schoeman. (Unlike Brink, who has long abandoned Afrikaans for English, he continues to work in his native tongue.) Tale Leave and Go, his third novel, affords its own distinctive example of the newly expanded South African approach to fiction. Set in a near-future gripped by civil war, it achieves through the sustained finesse of its writing an understated vision-in-depth of white society on the edge of the new era, and/or the precipice: its tight webs of personal relationships inexorably loosened and privileged assumptions about art and culture put to the test. In the foreground the narrative is deceptively limited in incident: Adriaan, a poet who has just published an admired volume, functions equally as central character and witness to the disintegration of the social and political fabric. Episodes of dream and fantasy, elusive yet beautifully precise in patterning, enlarge and enrich the poetic and psychological canvas, all the more so since at its centre there unfolds a disquietingly pertinent examination of the very nature of artistic creativity and the artist's role in a society convulsively undergoing change. This novel, serious but never stuffy, subtle but never laboured, is, I think, the most impressive to have come out of South Africa for a very long time.</p>

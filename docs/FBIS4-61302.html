			<p>BFN     [Text] The continuing use of the Chernobyl nuclear power  station is a permanent source of danger not only for Ukraine,  but also for other countries of the world, head of the G-7  working group for nuclear security, Antonio Puri Purini said in  Kiev Wednesday [4 May]. He is the head of a G-7 mission in  Ukraine probing into the republic's nuclear security.    At his meeting with the mission's officials, Ukrainian  Environmental Protection Minister Yuriy Kostenko drew everyone's  attention to the fact that his ministry was the only body which  insisted on immediate shut down of the station.    In Kostenko's opinion, measures taken to ensure the  station's  safety are not a guarantee that the surrounding territory would  not be contaminated in case of an accident.    Kostenko pointed out that under the difficult economic  situation faced currently by Ukraine a prompt solution of the  Chernobyl issue was possible only provided "adequate" financial  and technical assistance by G-7 countries. The minister pointed  out that the situation was further complicated by nuclear  disarmament underway in Ukraine, "which is an expensive and  laborious process."    Commenting on dumping nuclear waste and exhausted fuel,  Kostenko said the only acceptable variant for Ukraine would be  storing such waste in temporary facilities until a stationary  storage is constructed.    As INTERFAX-Ukraine learned, the deputies' group preparing  the first session of the newly elected republican parliament had  failed to include the commission for Chernobyl issues in the  panel of commissions to be approved by the new parliament's  first session.    The Ukrainian Party of Justice and the Chernobyl Union held  a  news conference in Kiev Wednesday calling on the deputies not to  abolish the commission.</p>

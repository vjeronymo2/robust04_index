			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mate Basic: "Serb `Kolos' Supercannon, With </F> Range of 60 Kilometers, Threatens Zagreb and Sarajevo!"]    [Text] Based on the plans drawn up by Canadian  engineer Gerald Bull, the designer of the Iraqi supercannon who  was assassinated in Brussels by Mossad, the Serbian military  industry has developed a giant 203-mm cannon with a barrel  measuring 12 meters in length, with which Zagreb can be hit from  Petrinje and Sarajevo can be shelled without violating the NATO  ultimatum.    Mate Basic uncovers one of the most strictly guarded  Yugoslav secrets. Illustrations by Zdenko Svircic.    The withdrawal of Serb artillery to a distance of 20 km  around Sarajevo will not prevent the destruction of the capital  of Bosnia-Herzegovina!    The majority of the Serb artillery can launch destructive  projectiles at two or even three times the distance established  in the ultimatum on the withdrawal of Serb heavy arms. But the  greatest danger is a hitherto unknown weapon, guarded as one of  the biggest state secrets--a Serb 203-mm howitzer! This weapon  was developed under the code name KOLOS!    The investment program to develop a Serb 203-mm supercannon  ended back in 1985, but the medium-term plan for the period from  1985 to 1990 included a program for additional production of  90,000 155-mm and 203-mm shells, a completely new type with a  significantly greater range!    The financing plan for the all-Yugoslav "Kolos" project was  concluded in 1987: Investments were approved for the Slovene  steel works in Store and Ravne na Koroskem (new furnaces and new  presses for forging barrels), for the "Bratstvo" factory in Novi  Travnik (forging and deep drilling of barrels), for the factory  in Vogosca, near Sarajevo (forging and machining of 120-kg  shells), for the "Ivo Lola Ribar" factory in Zeleznik, near  Belgrade (computer control systems for processing gun breeches  and for robots).... Besides these major plants, more than 500  factories all over the former Yugoslavia were involved in the  overall project. "Kolos" was only the main beneficiary of the  investment, since the machines were also used to produce other  weapons or parts of them. The total value of the investment at  the time was more than $2 billion!    Reliable information indicates that even after 1987 the  Serbs  were working on realizing the "Kolos" project! In early 1993,  "14 October" in Krusevac presented a finished transporter tank  whose chassis was intended as a carrier for the Serb  supercannon! Then, at the newly opened weapons testing range  across the border from Prevlaka on the Montenegrin coast, tests  were conducted in the fall of 1993 on a long-range system to  record on radar screens the movements of ships from the Western  European Union (WEU) and NATO that were enforcing the blockade  on Montenegrin harbors! Thus, the threats previously expressed  by General Zivota Panic, the former chief of the General Staff  of the Armed Forces of Yugoslavia, and chetnik duke Vojislav  Seselj concerning attacks against targets in Europe with  long-range missiles must in fact be regarded as extremely  dangerous. Specifically, these threats were expressed only as  sheer disinformation, because the attention of the world public  was supposed to be directed toward the development of Serb  missile systems (which they cannot do, just as they cannot start  up production of the "Orkan"), while in reality intensive work  was being done on developing a long-range artillery gun!  <H5>  Shells for Only $800 </H5>   Qualified missile experts who are well-acquainted with the  technological scope of the Serb military industry responsibly  assert that the "Orkan" missile with a range of 50 km  constitutes their maximum capability in developing  surface-to-surface missile projectiles. Any increase in the  range of missile projectiles requires the development of  completely new, high-energy rocket fuels (which they do not  have!) as well as the development of projectile-guidance systems  if they want to achieve firing accuracy. Serbia lacks both the  material and the personnel for such essentially new  technological ranges, especially under sanction conditions.    Moreover, the cost of firing missile projectiles is much  greater than the cost of firing artillery shells.    Specifically, according to the price list of the Commission  for JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] Property Succession, one  launcher-vehicle for a 262-mm M-87 "Orkan" multibarrel rocket  launcher costs $540,000 and one launcher-vehicle for a FROG-7  "Luna" also costs $540,000, while one launcher-vehicle for a  128-mm M-77 "Oganj" multibarrel rocket launcher costs $360,000.  Right now, a 130-mm M-46 cannon costs $228,000, while a 152-mm  M-84 "Nora" howitzer costs $280,000.    There are also large differences in the price (which Serb  military-equipment experts too are certainly keeping in mind) of  missile projectiles and artillery shells: While the price of one  missile is $2,600 for the "Oganj," $6,000 for the "Orkan," and  $15,500 for the "Luna," a shell for the 130-mm cannon costs  (only) $180, with $260 for the "Nora," while it would cost only  around $800 for the long-range 203-mm cannon ("Kolos")!    The final argument on behalf of the development of a Serb  supercannon is the complete technological independence from  foreign partners! With the production capacity and machinery of  special-purpose industry at its disposal, the former Yugoslavia  was able to produce all the elements necessary for the  production of artillery guns and ammunition of calibers 130 to  203 mm.    After the disintegration of Yugoslavia, some parts of  special-purpose industry also disintegrated, and the Serbs lost  control over certain important factories. For example, the  "Bratstvo" heavy artillery factory in Novi Travnik, which had an  annual capacity of around 300 heavy artillery guns.    But although they lost this factory, the Serbs retained  enough capacity to regenerate almost the entire previous  production of artillery guns: At the "Prva Petoletka" factory in  Trstenik, there is machinery for deep drilling of barrels and  for superfinishing (honing) them to a depth of 16 meters and a  diameter of 400 mm; at the "Cer" factory in Cacak furnaces are  produced for heat treatment of barrels; and several other large  and small Serbian or Montenegrin factories can also be included  in the overall system ("I.L. Ribar" in Zeleznik, "Zeljezara" and  "Aluminijski Kombinat" in Niksic, and so forth). Steel to  produce Serb supercannons can be easily procured on the market.  This commercial type of steel is called "maraging" (an  abbreviation for "martensite generation"), and its only drawback  is that it is expensive. Specifically, one kilogram costs $100!  Moreover, all the equipment for producing ammunition has  remained in Serb hands.    This equipment was previously tested at the firing range in  Prevlaka, one of the most modern ranges in the world: It is  known that the Germans have conducted target practice there  while testing the 30-mm "Gepard" antiair gun. Today, a similar  firing range has been set up on the Montenegrin part of the  coast, across the border from Prevlaka. There is also a testing  range in Syrmia, near Nikinci. It was created by seizing  farmland from Croats and expelling them after World War II, and  is also exceptionally well-equipped. This is confirmed by the  fact that the Swedes used it to test their antitank missiles....  <H5>  Secret Cooperation With Iraq </H5>   The crucial role in launching the "Kolos" project was played  by Dr. Gerald Bull, a Canadian known throughout the world as the  designer of Saddam Husayn's never-completed "Babylon cannon"  (the powder for which was produced in Vitez), with barrels  measuring one meter in diameter and 52 meters in length. The  range of this gun was supposed to be around 600 km. Bull began  official cooperation with the Military Technology Institute  (VTI) in Belgrade in 1984, by way of the Federal Directorate for  Trade and Commodity Reserves (SDPR) and SRC (Space Research  Corporation) in Brussels, of which he was the founder and owner.  At the same time, Bull was cooperating with Iraq (which was a  scrupulously guarded secret), but also with South Africa,  Canada, and even China. He was engrossed with the idea of  creating a cannon that could shoot down satellites, and he  called the project HARP (High Altitude Research Program).    After he was assassinated in Brussels by Mossad, the Israeli  intelligence service, his associates published a book entitled  From the Paris Cannon to HARP, in which they  described exhaustively the genesis and development of the new  cannon project. Specifically, Bull began by studying the 210-mm  "Paris cannon," with a range of 130 km, with which the Germans  shelled Paris in 1918. He then proposed an improved version to  the Americans, and after they turned him down the Canadians sent  him a million dollars for his annual expenses, as part of the  long-range "Barbados cannon" project. When that contract  expired, he became an honored guest of VTI in Belgrade, but also  of other institutions and factories involved in the production  of artillery. With his team of experts, he offered everything  that he had--his know-how--but in return he gained the  opportunity to use one of the world's most modern artillery  testing ranges, the one in Prevlaka. Still, his work in Iraq  continued to be classified top secret, although people knew  about the 210-mm "Iraqi cannon" (the same caliber as the "Paris  cannon" with barrels of 52 caliber (210 mm x 52), and thus a  length of 10 meters. This was only the transitional phase  preceding the construction of the planned "Babylon cannon"....    Besides gaining use of modern testing equipment for all  calibers between 130 and 203 mm, Gerald Bull, through the SDPR,  also sold his highly modern shells, produced according to his  plans. Thus, the government of the former Yugoslavia, through  the SDPR, was one of the biggest suppliers of Bull's products.  For each sold shell produced under his license, the military  industries who used his services paid Bull 10 percent of the  value. Logically, part of the debt-servicing costs were settled  through barter transactions....    What did Bull work on in Yugoslavia? Yugoslav military  researchers managed, independently of Bull's license, to  increase the range of the "Nora," using the TF152 projectile,  from 23,932.9 meters to 28,893.1 meters, and through later,  additional testing they increased the range of that gun to a  total of 39.5. Bull also participated in the startup of  production of the ERFE-BB long-range projectile, with calibers  of 130 mm, 155 mm, and 203 mm. Besides increasing the range of  the projectile, Bull also helped solve certain design problems  in the cannon itself. Based on his ideas, conversion of the  famous 130-mm Russian M-46 cannon was carried out. A completely  new 155-mm barrel was placed on the old pedestal, which made the  shells significantly more deadly, and their range was increased  to 39 km. The cannon bears a new name: M-46/84. But a special  shell with a greater range was also developed for the old  caliber (130), so that now it launches projectiles at a distance  of 38,000 meters instead of 27,490 meters. The development of  the M-87 "Nora" (an abbreviation of New Artillery Weapon)  project lasted two years, until the advent of Bull and his  associates. It was only after their expert intervention that the  project was completed under the name M-84....    Gerald Bull's main associate, to whom he passed on his  knowledge, was a full professor at the School of Engineering in  Belgrade with the rank of general, Dr. Anastas Paligoric, the  director of the artillery section at the VTI, and also the  designer of the 152-mm howitzer, better known as the "Nora."  Based on the knowledge transferred from SRC, the entire team of  military scientists conducted further research into increasing  the range and improving the design of artillery ammunition, and  on the design of the gun itself, with a barrel length of 52  caliber.    Zorica Subotic and Slobodan Jarmaz published work on the  Projection of Gas Generators to Increase Artillery  Range, Milojko Ignjac and Slobodan Jarmaz analyzed  The Selection of Fuel Characteristics for Gas Generators  to Increase the Range of Artillery Projectiles, and  Dragoslav Negoicic and Toni Arsic published the results of the  study Gas Generator Lighter to Increase the Range of the  TH 152-mm NORA Artillery Projectile.    What is remarkable about the Bull projects? This ingenious  designer devised a way to enormously increase the range of  artillery pieces by reducing the resistance of the artillery  projectile.    Indeed, the biggest problem was how to reduce the resistance  created by the projectile itself, as a result of the turbulent  air current caused by the motion of the projectile itself  (so-called background resistance, which accounted for nearly 50  percent of the total resistance). This problem was solved  through the revolutionary introduction of the "Base Bleed"  natural gas generator. The innovation here is that during the  flight of the projectile the gas generator released gas at the  rear of the projectile, the volume of which filled the vacuum  behind the projectile, thus almost completely eliminating the  biggest share of resistance.    Just as the introduction of the jet engine revolutionized  aviation, the introduction of the gas generator revolutionized  artillery. Indeed, it involves an extremely complicated chemical  process, which Serbia was unable to achieve alone. That is why  the Croatian chemicals industry was involved, especially  research teams at Ina [Petroleum Refining and Sales Enterprise].  This was the biggest military secret at that enterprise. The  technology for producing high-level polymer materials was  studied--hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB). Today, based  on the results of that research, Serbs at "Miloje Zakic" in  Krusevac can product HTPB, the key raw material for the gas  generator.    By applying additional improvements (higher-quality steel  for  the barrels, use of better powder, greater barrel length), the  range of artillery weapons was increased almost twice over.    In this way, the Serbs have produced much cheaper and more  deadly artillery pieces, with much greater accuracy! According  to some data, this product would pay for itself if 18 units were  sold abroad....  <H5>  Menacing Shell Weighing 100 Kg </H5>   According to the final plans, the "Kolos" itself was  supposed  to be a self-propelled 203-mm howitzer modeled after a similar  Russian weapon known as the "Piton." Two variants were  developed: the towed version with the option of independent  movement on the battlefield, and the self-propelled version on  the chassis of the known tracked vehicle. Initial testing was  conducted on a sample of the U.S. "M 110" howitzer, but the  concrete results are not known. All that is known is that in the  joint project between SRC, Yugoslavia, and Iraq, Saddam Husayn's  howitzer achieved a range of 57 km with its caliber of 210 mm!  At that range, the cannon known as "Al Fao" launched a  projectile weighing 109.4 kg, the kind produced at the factory  in Vogosca....    What is bewildering, however, is the fact that top officials  at NATO are uninformed of the real possibilities of the Serb  cannon's range. Or is this once again a game of compromise with  the Serbs, whereby Sarajevo is removed from mortar range but  left within range of heavy artillery? For now, we can expect  that shells weighing 100 kg will be arriving from a distance of  60 km away from Sarajevo, or from any other target in  Bosnia-Herzegovina or Croatia. However, if the production of  artillery pieces with a range greater than 100 km (like the  "Babylon") is allowed, territory outside the former Yugoslavia  will also come under Serb attack! For now, it is known reliably  that the Serbs have the original powder for producing a  supercannon like the "Babylon"--made for that purpose in  Vitez--together with enough know-how to begin implementing a new  and deadly project.</p>

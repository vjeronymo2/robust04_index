			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australia rejects wool price plea THE Australian government yesterday rejected calls for the reimposition of price fixing to increase returns to wool producers hit by record low prices. Mr Simon Crean, the federal primary industries minister, said calls for a return to the floor price system abolished in 1991 were 'nonsense - the government cannot solve the problem by artificially fixing the price. That is not the solution to the problem - it caused the problem'. Mr Crean was responding to calls by growers for urgent action to reduce the impact of a collapse in the national market indicator to 412 cents a kilogramme from nearly 550 cents in November. The market indicator, a weighted average of auction prices for 15 grades of wool, stood at 729 cents before the abolition of the 700 cents floor price two years ago. Many growers blame the slide in prices on a 3.9m bale stockpile of unsold wool held by the Australian Wool Realisation Commission (AWRC), a government-appointed body set up after the abolition of price fixing. The AWRC has resisted growers' calls for the stockpile to be destroyed or sold to the former Soviet Union, once a major buyer of Australian wool, on generous credit terms. However, the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC), the industry's marketing organisation, left the option of barter or credit sales open at its annual meeting yesterday in the wool growing town of Tamworth. Mr Mac Drysdale, chairman, said that a 'crippling imbalance' between supply and demand was the main reason why the industry was facing 'the worst downturn of its long, proud and tumultuous history'. Production was expected to total 794m kilogrammes in the year to the end of June, compared with average production of 675m kg in the five years to 1985, when the industry was consistently profitable, he said. Mr Drysdale was careful not to question the commission's legal responsibility to manage the stockpile. However, he said the commission 'could look at' several non-commercial ways of disposing of it. These included barter trading with countries where hard currency is in short supply; establishing joint venture processing facilities with such countries; and using stockpile wool to fulfil foreign aid commitments. The wool industry's problems stem from over-production following a boom in prices in 1987-88, when the market indicator (then calculated on a slightly different basis) rose from 781 cents to 1,269 cents. Production rose steadily in response to high prices, but the market indicator collapsed to just over 700 cents following the partial withdrawal from the market of the Soviet Union, China and Japan. At its peak, the stockpile of unsold wool purchased by the corporation under the floor price system stood at 4.8m bales, financed by government guaranteed debt of ADollars 2.8bn and a 25 per cent levy on growers' incomes.</p>

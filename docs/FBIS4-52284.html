			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Roundtable discussion with MITI Deputy Vice Minister </F> Sozaburo Okamatsu, University of the Air Vice President Motoo  Kaji, and Former Deputy Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs  Koichiro Matsuura; moderated by Keidanren Managing Director  Kazuo Nukazawa, on 4 March: "What the U.S.-Japan Economic Talks  Have Thrust Before Us"; place not given]    [Text] How To Evaluate the Uruguay Round Agreement    [Nukazawa] The GATT Uruguay Round reached agreement on 15  December last year. Looking at developments since then, I think  there are two issues. The first is: Following conclusion of  the U.S.-Japan summit on 11 February this year, I feel as if  some of the Uruguay Round's results have been blown away. Why  has the world trade atmosphere not improved, even though the  Uruguay Round reached agreement? Is the United States not fully  satisfied? Could it be that, because the results on "multi"  (multilateral) issues were insufficient, domestic pressure was  brought to bear on the "bi" [bilateral relationship with Japan.]    The second issue: In contrast to meetings with global  objectives such as the Uruguay Round, there are movements such  as NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) and the EU  (European Union). The question is, in particular, how the  Clinton administration will strategically tackle regional  groupings such as NAFTA and, at the same time, tie them to APEC  (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation). What is your opinion?    [Matsuura] I do not think the results of the Uruguay Round  were blown away. The Uruguay Round has determined establishment  of a new multifaceted trading system for goods and services.  The decision to establish the World Trade Organization (WTO) as  a part of it was a very significant result. As for the  agreement establishing the WTO, which consolidated the results  of the Uruguay Round, the target for implementation is 1 July  1995. But voices are becoming stronger urging a quickening of  the pace. I hope each country will finish the necessary  domestic procedures quickly so this agreement will come into  effect; the WTO will start functioning from 1 July next year  (sooner if possible); and disputes will be handled  multilaterally.    As for the situation surrounding the current U.S.-Japan  framework talks, this is occuring during the interim between the  Uruguay Round and initiation of the WTO. If the Uruguay Round  had not been concluded it would have been much worse.    It is regrettable that the negotiations centering on  priority  areas such as government procurement, insurance, and automobiles  and automobile parts were not concluded by 11 February. But it  does not mean the negotiations broke down. Although the United  States came up with such tactics as the resurrection of the  Super 301 clause, it has not yet decided what it will do to  implement it. Japan is also trying independently to come up with  a market-opening policy by the end of March. So, through these  market opening measures, we need to do everything we can.    [Okamatsu] As I look back at the seven years and three  months since the start of the Uruguay Round negotiations, I  think that, because GATT was set up to maintain the free  economic sphere's unity, there was a period of stagnation  because of the socialist sphere's disintegration. What made  GATT go forward, however, was the increased regionalism in  various places. There are NAFTA, the EC, and APEC, and if these  had been left unchecked, there was the possibility that they  would have formed blocs. I wonder if the centripetal force  toward the Uruguay Round was revived because of apprehension  about the formation of blocs.    At the same time, developed countries, with limited  financial  and monetary resources for rebuilding the stagnant world  economy, had great expectations for economic expansion which  would be derived from establishment of this free trade  structure. I think this is the first point we must keep in mind  when we evaluate the Uruguay Round.    [Kaji] I thought the Uruguay Round, rather than the  U.S.-Japan framework talks, would not reach agreement. I think  it was a very positive thing that the Uruguay Round reached  agreement, not only for Japan, but also for the entire world  economy. At a time when GATT was promoting free and  nondiscriminatory multilateral economic relationships, the  United States took the lead during the 1960's. But since the  Tokyo Round in the 1970's, the United States has come to act in  a not necessarily positive manner. As for the Uruguay Round,  especially since the Clinton administration began, even among  economists the theoretical argument has emerged that the benefit  of free and non-discriminatory multi- lateralism need not be  guaranteed under all circumstances. As such, there was a fear  that the United States might stop supporting free trade  principles. But this did not happen, so the scope for the  future has opened up.  <H5>  GATT Going Through Changes </H5>   [Nukazawa] I see that in the Uruguay Round, agreements were  made with limited participants. It appears to me that the  principle of MFN (most favored nation) has been lost. Does this  mean that GATT has changed?    [Matsuura] The GATT was an agreement that had a  homogeneous economic structure and which was created with the  advanced industrialized countries at its center. So if I may  exaggerate, there was essentially no difference between  reciprocity and MFN. But as developing countries and former  communist countries began to join GATT, the homogeneous economy  could no longer control it. In such a situation the use of MFN  would have been excessive. So regrettably, reciprocity began to  be favored. Theoretically, it is obvious the use of MFN would  definitely be better, and with this leverage the United States  could have utilized all the power it possessed. But U.S. power  has relatively decreased, and reciprocity began to emerge when  the United States adopted the idea of "give and take." But I do  not think it is a good idea to give reciprocity too central a  role. So in the Uruguay Round this time, we tried to restrain  reciprocity, especially for the service trade and such, and  tried to make use of MFN as much as possible.    [Okamatsu] That is the fundamental issue concerning GATT. I  was in Geneva for a week before the final stage of the  negotiations. I remember that when I met Secretary General  Sutherland, he asked me: "What do you think of financial  reciprocity, which the United States is advocating?" I replied:  "If we accept, it will be the death of GATT itself. Could such  an idea exist in GATT? If we permit the existence of  reciprocity which is discriminatory, it will be the end of  GATT." He said: "I think so, too. I will never accept it."    I think agreement was reached in the Uruguay Round this time  because of the determination, in such a crisis, to try to make  one more effort for a liberal system. As you pointed out, this  time quite a few developing countries actively participated. As  for the lowering of tariffs, which was GATT's original function,  such countries as Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, which in  the past were not bound, have agreed to be. As for Indonesia,  it will bind its tariff rates at 91 percent. This is a sign of  their commitment to the liberal trade system.    [Kaji] As Mr. Nukazawa said, the nature of GATT is clearly  changing. But I feel its fundamental direction as an  international organization has been maintained and this was  guaranteed by the agreement.    One reason the framework negotiations have turned out the  way  they have is that President Clinton and Prime Minister Hosokawa  are both different from past presidents and prime ministers in  terms of their position in their respective nation's domestic  political situation. In the United States Clinton is the first  president born in the postwar era. Moreover, the international  economy and the entire range of international relationships have  changed drastically; all of this contributes to the impulse for  change. As for the Japanese, the representatives differed from  those who had been supported by the LDP majority. Such points  might have been contributing factors for bringing about a very  unusual situation.  <H5>  Where the Framework Talks Will Go -- Objective Criteria </H5> Have Taken Off on Their Own    [Nukazawa] About the framework talks: Mr. Kaji, do you also  take the position that we should not set numerical macroeconomic  targets?    [Kaji] On that point, first, I think that terms such as  objective criteria and numerical targets took off on their own  this time. Let us consider the macro indicators and micro  indicators separately. As for the macro, assume for example,  the United States were to recall the case of semiconductors and  argue "we can do something similar again." The Japanese should  take the position that the semiconductor case was one we should  never repeat. From the start we thought it was a bad idea to  consult on the market share of individual products between  governments.    As for macro indicators, when making earlier long-term  economic plans, in some cases the Japanese Government published  a numerical projection for the way the international balance  should be. But since the early 1970's, setting the number has  become very difficult. One reason is that, because foreign  exchange has been changed to a floating system, to project  exports and imports in dollar terms in three to five years has  become difficult.    Another reason is that when the U.S. balance-of-trade  deficit  became extremely large and Japan's proportion in it great, the  reality was that half the deficit was with Japan. This made it  impossible for Japan to determine the numerical figure by itself.    I certainly think the Japanese surplus today is too large.  It is too large in macroeconomic terms and too large with the  United States. But it is not good simply to decide  quantitatively to what extent we should reduce it. That is my  position.    [Matsuura] It is true that when we discuss numerical  targets, we need to separate macro from micro. As for macro, so  far as the U.S.-Japan negotiations are concerned, it was settled  in July 1993. At that time, the United States was also seeking  numerical indicators for macro--in other words, it wanted our  global surplus in the current account balance to be reduced by  half in terms of GDP ratio within three years (3.2 percent for  1992), or held below 2 percent of GDP. But Japan could not make  such a commitment, and in the end, we agreed in the medium term  to reduce the balance of our current account surplus in a  meaningful way.    What is important is that we make steady progress toward  such  a goal. Concrete policy measures should be implemented to  stimulate domestic demand-oriented economic growth, and we  should make steady progress toward such a medium-term goal by  adopting a policy to further open markets.    The issue is how to handle numerical targets for the micro  area. At the beginning, the United States sought goals which had  the characteristics of numerical targets. But its attitude  changed in midcourse so as not to seek such targets. In fact,  in his 11 February news conference, President Clinton declared  the United States would not seek numerical goals. But the  problem is the United States wants to establish objective  criteria. In the negotiations, U.S. officials began mentioning  that quantitative criteria were to be set up within the  objective criteria to measure progress. But to measure results  after-the-fact would not work. It meant, from our perspective,  setting numerical targets first and measuring the state of  progress accordingly. That was a difference we could not  overcome until the end.    [Nukazawa] When the negotiations began, it was to discuss  issues limited to areas where government had responsibility  ("government reach"). The opinion of the Japanese private  sector was that the government had various means available to  it, such as public investment and so on. But the current  account balance surplus and GNP movement were not within the  realm of government responsibility, though this was a fairly  close call. If we were to make concessions, it should have been  in the macro area. Public finance authorities, however, would  not take any action. Things moved no further than their front  door, where they stopped, so far as they were concerned. But,  as a result, demands kept being made on the private sector. And  the emphasis ended up on the micro area, which is far from the  realm of government responsibility. This is the candid view of  the private sector. What do you think?    [Okamatsu] There are three principles in the framework  talks. One is that discussion must run in both directions;  second is that of "government reach"; and third is the principle  that the results of these talks be mutually and equally  beneficial under MFN principles. As for objective criteria,  there was a question if this was in the realm of government  responsibility. Since government procurement, insurance, and  automobiles and auto parts were priority areas, we gave priority  to discussions of these issues.    In discussions of these three principles, the argument on  "government reach" came very much into the open. As for  government procurement in particular, we agreed that making  procedures transparent is a government issue. As for insurance,  deregulation is a government issue. Therefore, we discussed how  to do these things in a reciprocal manner.    As for automobiles and auto parts, which were private sector  business activities, discussions took place on areas where  government could have a role. The United States also agreed  that automobiles and auto parts were in the private realm. But  there was a different recognition of the arm length of  government reach. This was in the background of discussions.    On this subject, discussion focused on the sphere where  government could have a role. As a result of this debate, the  United States stopped mentioning the government's setting  numerical targets on completed automobiles.    As for the private sector setting targets, many scholars,  both in the United States and Japan, oppose the idea. Moreover,  there is the question of what this has to do with free trade  principles in the first place.    Also, once a number is set, it takes on a life of its own.  As a result, it will be viewed as a government commitment. As  for the presence of a stated number in a U.S.-Japan agreement,  there is the purchase of auto parts--$19 billion (fiscal year  1994). But this number was drawn up with utmost caution and  given as the numerical target for efforts by the private sector.  Yet, after one year, the United States interpreted this as a  government commitment and started making arguments accordingly.    [Kaji] It is a fact that a great imbalance still exists. I  understand that, on this point, Japan does not think the status  quo is good. Therefore, if there is an opportunity, I think the  relationship can be improved on both sides.    Is the Japanese Market Really Closed?    [Nukazawa] As for objective criteria, some people in the  Japanese business sector argue that, since President Clinton  declared he would not demand a set market share as was the case  with semiconductors, based on his words, we should take the  initiative to reopen dialogue. On the other hand, as I read the  contents of the President's news conference, he touched on some  five areas, such as import levels, comparison with the other six  G-7 nations, exchange rate fluctuations, the state of Japanese  domestic demand, and American business efforts. Two or three of  these can easily be quantified. So, the United States may not  demand a market share, but I am apprehensive it will want  something very close to numerical targets. What do you think?    [Matsuura] The United States keeps saying it will not demand  market share. But it cites objective criteria in concrete  terms: One is the average market share of the G-7 nations, other  than Japan, and another is continuation of past trends into the  future, in connection with which medical equipment, auto parts,  and so on are mentioned. The idea is to carry the increase in  past trends up to 25 or 30 percent in the future as one of the  criteria. Such are the two ideas.    Thus, if what President Clinton said was true, Japan has  also  made concrete proposals concerning government procurement and  even made amended proposals at the final stage. I think  President Clinton's comments at the news conference by and large  matched our proposals on government procurement. We need to  refine them further in the future.    [Okamatsu] Their theory goes as follows: Japan has a $120  billion trade surplus. Compared to Europe, the market share for  American products in Japan is low; that is because the Japanese  market is closed. Looking at past agreements, with some  exceptions, positive results are not in evidence. The reason  why results were not achieved is because only a process was  prescribed and results were not. The whole setup is designed to  deter progress. Therefore, in light of the foregoing theory,  this time around we must establish some mechanism to measure  progress and pry open the Japanese market.    In rebuttal, we say: First, the global imbalance is derived  from the investment-savings imbalance. Japan will certainly try  to improve on this point, but the United States must also try to  reduce its fiscal deficit.    Concerning the comparison of market share for some specific  products, the argument that, compared to other markets, the  Japanese market is closed is not based on sound theory, because  the supply structure and demand structure are totally different  for each market.    Second, about past agreements. These are classified into  three types: The first is deregulation. We have complied with  the agreements, the market has been opened, and imports have  increased.    The second is our attempts on open procedures. This is for  government procurements. We have pledged we would simplify  procedures on items such as supercomputers and computers; we are  enforcing this. The market will determine what the outcome is.    The third is cooperation in the private sector. This must be  settled in the future through the efforts of both sides. It is  not rational to say that, because success is not visible now,  results have not been obtained.    I am rebutting the structure of the argument, but the  question is how we overcome such fundamental misconceptions.  Will the way be opened by comments such as those President  Clinton made? But U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Kantor's  comments at negotiations had a different nuance. I wonder if  they have an unambiguous policy within that administration.  During the negotiations, we had repeated difficulties because  of this.    [Kaji] It is natural that in past negotiations, processes  were agreed on but results not obtained. Results would emerge  as the consequence of market movement and economic rationality,  and the economic mechanism would not guarantee that the results  would be the same as the G-7 average. Here, the American  thinking is wrong.    But still, I cannot help but admit there are various  regulations in Japan. I think there are many products which  could enter if we relaxed regulations. Many people also  fervently advocate deregulation for the sake of the domestic  economy. I think it would be best if we take bold steps on  deregulation.    [Nukazawa] It would also be good if domestic demand were  expanded. About the summit meeting: The evaluation of the  Europeans was that it was natural for Japan to say no to  numerical targets. But the Japanese surplus was a problem, so  domestic demand should be expanded. That is my reading. GATT  Secretary General Sutherland said he was opposed to numerical  targets and the use of Super 301. What is the reaction in Asia?    [Matsuura] The reaction in Asia is basically the same as  in Europe, but the nuances are different. In Europe, when I met  with the EC Committee members headed by Committee Chairman  Delors on 14 February, they said they evaluated Japan  positively, first of all for not going along with bilateralism.  However, they did not want the United States and Japan to start  a trade war and wanted us to avoid this by any means. Also,  they wanted Japan, which holds such a large current account  surplus, to do better in the macro area.    The Asian countries have similar feelings, and they too  evaluate the first point highly. But at the same time, they  feel that if Japan and the United States got into a full-scale  trade war, Asian countries would become entangled, and this  would have a very negative effect. So they want this to be  avoided by any means.  <H5>  Theory of Japanese Differentness </H5>   [Nukazawa] Representative Kantor says: "Japan is a very  unique and different country," and "the market is the most  closed." Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten also gave a  speech at Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations]  (3 March) saying: "I have visited Asian countries where I have  told each of them Japan is the most closed country in Asia.  Therefore, we have assumed the kind of policy we have toward  Japan, but we will not assume such a policy toward other  countries in Asia." Is Japan really that different?    [Okamatsu] I think they are judging Japan to be so different  based on statistics. It is true that, when I look at market  shares, some individual products have gained no share in the  Japanese market. But this is determined by each country's  supply and demand structure. And moreover, even if the volume  of all import products is small, we must consider systems and  geography. The United States shares land borders with Canada,  which is an almost equally industrialized country. Europe has a  system called the EU, and moreover, it is all connected by land  borders. Such a system does not exist for Japan. And another  factor is that Japan is an island nation. We must keep this in  mind.    Therefore, when we include all these factors in our  calculations, the ratio of imports compared to GNP is not all  that different from other countries.    Other countries' citing such indicators and declaring that  we  are different rubs us the wrong way. But does it mean that we  can maintain the present situation? That is not the case.  There are some aspects on which we must frankly reflect and  reexamine ourselves.    As for the industrial sector, considering the recent high  yen, we must work to expand new dealings which would exceed old  transaction relationships. In other words, if we find products  which are cheap and useful, we should also include them in the  process of sorting out Japanese products. Or enterprises will  start to think about export projects. These efforts and  deregulation of the system by the government will gradually  change the environment.    [Nukazawa] Dornbusch (Massachusetts Institute of Technology  professor) and some revisionists have been saying that the ratio  of imported products to Japanese GNP is extremely low compared  to that of other G-7 countries. Can the fact that the so-called  intra-industry trade index is extremely low be evidence the  market is closed?    [Kaji] I do not think that is the case, since each country  has its own demand and supply structure. If countries become  united as Europe is, the trade ratio will naturally go up. And  the argument that a country is different based on differences in  numerical results is not the same as the original theory of  difference which Chalmers Johnson and others put forward. The  original theory of difference was a theory that noted the  difference in the connection of political and economic  relationships or differences in social arrangements. The  Dornbusch argument says we are different because results are  different.    [Matsuura] The United States has been saying the Japanese  market is the most closed of G-7 members. On this, two measures  are cited: The ratio of imports to GNP and the rate of  investment in foreign countries. The United States says that  those indicators for Japan are extremely low. In Asia, with the  exception of Hong Kong and Singapore, it is obvious Japan is far  more open than other countries. The problem is that it is very  difficult to make a comparison to the degree of openness within  the G-7. But it does not make sense to make comparisons using  only these two indexes. So, if we are compared to the United  States, it is true that overall it is far more open. But I  cannot agree that we are the most closed of the G-7 members.    [Okamatsu] As for investment, arguments have been raised  about that recently, so I investigated it. When the amount of  U.S. investment in major manufacturing industries is compared to  that of Japan and the major European countries, there is no  substantial difference in the actual amount. Therefore, we can  say that there may be a gap developing in the other areas, but  as for the major manufacturing industries, U.S. investment is  similar to ours.    [Nukazawa] Because Japan keeps saying "market opening,  market opening," others think the protected market remains in  place, is that not it?    [Matsuura] Still, it is true that there remain further  measures which we must take. Those are the so-called  traditional trade barriers. The number of nontariff barriers  has come down, but the number of items still requiring a permit  is said to be 11,000. We need to examine how much impact these  have on trade.    How Will a Multinational Trade Framework and  Bilateral Negotiations Be Harmonized?    [Nukazawa] When a dispute-handling mechanism in GATT already  exists--and is being further improved--why are so many bilateral  negotiations taking place? Is it not better to strengthen  organizations such as GATT which deal with multiple nations?  Some people offer the criticism that bilateral negotiations  between the United States and Japan will have a hollowing effect  on GATT.    [Matsuura] I think we should basically manage trade with  multilateral organizations; we should utilize GATT and then the  WTO [World Trade Organization] as much as possible. But when  the other side approaches us bilaterally, we cannot flatly  refuse to respond, especially since at the bottom of U.S.  frustration with us is the huge trade deficit. But the Japanese  response should persistently stick by principles, and complete  bilateralism must be eliminated.    [Okamatsu] I think that when there is some dispute between  two countries they should move their case onto the multilateral  stage. When the United States unilaterally applied Super 301 in  connection with the semiconductor issue, we heatedly discussed  whether or not we should go to GATT. But at that time, the  situation in Japan was such that we were not ready to go to  GATT. I think the time has come that, when an issue arises, we  should manage it at the multilateral level rather than in a  bilateral context--that should be regarded as the basic response.    When the parties appeal to GATT, first, a bilateral  conference takes place. There is a rule that when no agreement  is reached, a neutral third party will pass judgment. I think  one way of responding would be to utilize such a solution for  future disputes.    [Kaji] You are right. The principle is that we talk  bilaterally while keeping in mind the global implications or the  effect on the entire world. I think it would be sensible for us  not to stubbornly insist only on the multilateral level, and  that we seek a solution bilaterally when the bilateral  significance is very important.    [Nukazawa] Some people offer criticism that the United  States will act both as prosecutor and judge when we negotiate  with sanctions in the background, because there are no set rules  to begin with.    [Matsuura] You are correct that there are people who  criticize unilateral measures taken by the United States, such  as application of Super 301. But does it mean multilateral  action such as GATT's is enough? As I witnessed the U.S.-Japan  negotiations on electronic communications and medical  technology, I think it is understandable why the United States  does not feel that regulatory actions by GATT are sufficient and  seeks something additional. That is why we had detailed  negotiations.    GATT's action is quite elastic. It says that the approach A  is taking is all right and so are those by B and C. It is  understandable that the United States wants something with a  somewhat more strict direction.    [Nukazawa] But as other countries see it, they must want the  United States to correct matters such as the protection of  maritime transportation and the grandfather clause (agriculture  protection).    [Mtsuura] Exactly. From the outset, the United States held  back on maritime transportation in the negotiations on services.  So Japan and other countries were very unhappy about this  point. The United States also has its own problems.    [Nukazawa] In that case, in world trade, everything that  inconveniences the United States is quickly improved, but even  if something is caused by a deficiency of GATT, improvements are  hardly made on issues where the United States does not suffer  much. I feel it is so unfair.    [Okamatsu] The WTO has been created, but still, we cannot  solve everything there. First, as to dispute contents, we can  appeal an infringement of interest which falls under the  competence of the WTO. As for elements which do not fall into  this category, the situation is different. For instance, if  Japan makes some special pledge during future U.S.-Japan  negotiations, then the special regulation or some individual  contract rather than general regulations will take precedence,  even when we take the case to GATT.    Moreover, from now on among the cases brought, a  determination will have to be made on whether the retaliatory  measure being challenged comes under WTO regulations or is  outside of it. So, if we are hit with retaliatory measures  outside the competence of the WTO, there would be nothing we  could do. Therefore, the WTO is not all mighty.    So in that sense, we must uphold the abovementioned great  principles. But, at the same time, bilateral issues will remain  in the future, and naturally we must adhere to bilateral  agreements which decide the trade relationship of two countries.    Where Will the Free Trade System Go--Prospects for  Post-Uruguay Round    [Nukazawa] Regarding the Uruguay Round, in order to turn  every country into the same economic society, the harmonization  of competition, environment, and trade policies and so on will  emerge as the big issues. Do you have any suggestions in this  regard?    [Matsuura] The issues you just mentioned mainly concern  trade and environment, but there are others: Trade and science  and technology, trade and labor, and trade and investment.  Although the recent Uruguay Round took up a wide range of  issues, there are still more which have not been taken up.    The Tokyo Round concluded in 1979 and the Uruguay Round  began  in 1986; there was a gap of seven years. The question is how to  link this Uruguay Round to the next round. Will we take up  individual issues such as trade and environment, rather than  conduct a large-scale round? Or will we include everything and  try for another big round? If it were to be big round, it would  make fairly tough demands on the developing countries on those  single issues. To bring the developing countries along, the  developed countries must be ready to give up something at the  next round. Altogether 117 countries participated this time,  and 87 of them are developing countries. We must give careful  consideration to the question of how to gain a consensus from  these 87 countries at the next round.    [Okamatsu] The discussion of specific issues mentioned above  has already taken place at the OECD or GATT. And I think  discussions of environment and investment issues in particular,  are advancing. Because of the strong interest in environment  issues, some even say the next round will be the Green Round.    Environmental policies, however, are naturally determined by  each country's history, society, or developmental stage, so it  is not right to squeeze the developing counties with the  developed countries' standard of environmental policy. Beside,  when you speak of the environment, there are global  environmental issues and local pollution issues for specific  countries. We must be mindful of these distinctions when we  discuss them. Otherwise, negotiations which would put unfair  burdens on developing countries would not be realized as  negotiations.    As for the issue of the environment and trade policy, in the  past there have been faulty trade policies which were colored by  environmental considerations. In that regard, what we are  advocating about the environment is, first, the absence of  discrimination between domestic and international measures, in  accordance with domestic measures. Second, we should adopt a  policy which involves the least "distortion" for trade. Even  when we adopt measures for the environment, we must choose ones  which have the least effect on trade policy. Further, the  choice must be based on an international agreement on the  environment, not merely determined by the interests of some  specific country.    Another point: An argument arose for reevaluating NAFTA  concerning environmental and labor issues. It is good reference  to note how the United States dealt with the possible problem of  a substantial amount of goods produced under low wages and low  environmental standards in Mexico entering the United States.  It was dealt with as follows: First the United States  established the principle of honoring current Mexican  sovereignty, examined its structure, and judged it satisfactory.  But the United States will monitor the situation to ensure that  practices are actually followed. If there are any problems,  consultations between the two countries will be held to seek a  solution.    [Nukazawa] I think every country has a stage which Charles  Johnson called the "developmental state." As Alexander  Hamilton's time in the United States was an era of industrial  policy, every country has experienced such a phase in order to  arrive at its present-day stage. If developing countries are  told that they are not permitted to have such a stage, they will  have difficulty achieving growth. I wonder if the developing  countries might not have trouble obtaining growth if they are  levied with the task of homogenizing too rapidly.    [Kaji] That is a difficult issue. GATT started with tariffs  and trade, and has gradually expanded to include services and  investment; now, it is even covering the environment. I think  GATT will provide a powerful platform if it is utilized  appropriately. But it will not function well unless some  countries demonstrate leadership.    But the issues which will be taken up in the future will be  ones for which guarantees of mutual interests will be difficult.  As for trade, it is the situation that 99 out of 100 economists  would agree that free trade is in the interests of the country  concerned. But as for movement in capitals, quite a few will  have reservations. Furthermore, when environmental  considerations come into play, it is going to be difficult to  guarantee that there will be common interests. That is why I am  somewhat worried that progress on future issues will not be  achieved in as "clear cut" a manner as was the case with trade  and tariffs.    [Nukazawa] Each country's economy has been formed from  the background of its design as a country, national  characteristics, and culture. One after another, each country  has contributed to the history of world civilization. But if we  are too eager to make them all homogeneous, then some  interesting and different "DNA" might be lost. For living  things, the preservation of diversity is necessary.    [Matsuura] As economic relationships have become so close  and relationships of mutual dependency have increased, it is  insufficient to focus only on tariff and nontariff barriers  which are beachhead measures. In that regard, it is  understandable that an argument would emerge along the lines  that we should "harmonize" economic structures as much as  possible because fairness will otherwise not be maintained.    [Okamatsu] It provokes our antipathy when the theory of  differentness is used. Following recognition that every country  is different, then exchange and trade start. If all countries  become the same, then it will result, in a way, in a parallel  situation. I think, however, that there must be some way to  seek "harmonization"--economic "harmony"--while still preserving  the virtuous aspects of differences.    [Nukazawa] Then, do you mean that a sense of balance rather  than a legal approach is important now?    [Kaji] As you all know, rivalry between the two systems has  not disappeared. In other words, it is safe to say that the  central/directed economic structure has lost. But now, various  differences within the former Western side have become evident,  and the economic differences of each country are showing up.  Here, in fact, an economy motivated by the market mechanism is  fundamentally functioning in most countries. So, in letting  differences remain, we should fundamentally pursue the free  economy. I think that, as for the macroeconomic management of  each country, most nations have a fiscal and monetary policy,  albeit while following the free economic principle.  Coordination of all this will also remain a future task. I  think that international cooperation at the macro level and the  functioning of the market mechanism at the micro level will be  important.    Then, all will mutually recognize that the minor differences  of each country--I intentionally call them minor  differences--remain different. Situations have changed today  when compared to those 30 years ago even in the same country.  The United States and Japan have seen changes. And Europe has  changed even more. So rather than compare the differences, it is  better to recognize the greater similarities.    [Nukazawa] Japan is said "not to have changed," but last  year for instance, the Administrative Procedure Registration Law  was passed and enforcement will begin in October 1994. If the  Japanese government, in response to a request by the U.S.  government, were to give the business administrative guidance,  and if this were administrative guidance in violation of GATT,  it would become extremely difficult for the Japanese government  to give such administrative guidance in violation of the treaty  when industry asks for written guidance rather than oral.    When I told an American that the business response would be  different because litigation would be brought by stockholder  representatives with the complaint: "Why did you follow  noncompulsory and oral administrative guidance? You caused the  firm X amount of losses. You, as management, must personally  pay the firm for the loss incurred," he understood the idea.  The structure of Japanese industry and government is gradually  going through change. Yet Americans in general seem to believe  things are the same as in the past.    [Okamatsu] It is significant that the Japanese position in  the world has changed from that of 30 years ago and of 10 years  ago. It is the case that one behaves without noticing one's own  height. This is something we must keep in mind.    I have been a government official for over 30 years. Today  the Japanese position in international conferences is totally  different from what it was when I started out. As a  consequence, we must be aware of the weight of our comments and  of our responsibility. We Japanese as a whole must deal with  such a situation with self-awareness from now on.    [Matsuura] I totally agree. When we are working on bilateral  negotiations, we tend to forget Japanese significance in world  society. But it becomes apparent in multinational negotiations.  That is why last year, when Japan chaired the G-7 Tokyo summit,  we felt that very strongly. The Japanese presence was very  different between the first and second Tokyo summits. But the  Japanese presence has grown further compared to the second  summit held in Japan in 1986, both in the G-7 and in  international society. We must recognize the fact that our  responsibility has increased, and the number of things Japan  must do is rapidly increasing.    [Nukazawa] Thank you very much.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> CITY IMPOSES PACT ON FIREFIGHTERS  </P> <P> After more than four months of negotiations with the city's firefighter union,  the Garden Grove City Council has voted to declare an impasse in talks and  impose a contract covering the Fire Department.  </P> <P> The vote was 4 to 1 Monday night in favor of the city proposal, which calls for  a one-year contract with a 4% wage increase and a $58 monthly increase in the  city's contribution to medical benefits. Councilman Frank Kessler voted against  the pact.  </P> <P> Contract negotiations began in late December and have been stalled since early  April. A contract similar to the one enacted by the council Monday was rejected  by the union membership 82 to 0. The union's most recent counteroffer was a 7%  pay raise.  </P> <P> Under state law, public safety employees cannot strike. If an impasse in  negotiations is declared, a city council may impose a contract, regardless of  the union's objections.  </P> <P> In one concession to the firefighters, who are members of Garden Grove  Firefighters Local 2005, the council agreed to make the wage and fringe benefit  increases effective as of March 17. Generally, the city has opposed any  retroactive pay or benefits.  </P> <P> The action came after more than three hours of discussion among firefighters,  their supporters and the council. The council chamber was filled with men and  women bearing picket signs that supported higher wages for the firefighters.  </P> <P> "Be responsive to your employees. Use your authority to request a state  mediator to come here and help in negotiations," urged Richard A. Levine, an  attorney representing the firefighters' union. A dozen citizens spoke to the  council on behalf of firefighters, many of whom credited paramedics with saving  their lives.  </P> <P> "I have a responsibility to the people in this town to see that the city  doesn't go broke," said Mayor W. E. (Walt) Donovan. "I can't in good conscience  give it all to the Fire Department because they'll save me if I have a heart  attack."  </P> <P> Kessler opposed the contract on the grounds that he felt that firefighters  should be paid on the same basis as the Police Department, which uses a formula  comparing salaries of Anaheim, Santa Ana and Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> "We cannot offer quantity. We've always attacked the problem with quality. And  you cannot recruit and keep quality people unless you pay a competitive wage,"  he said.  </P> <P> To call attention to the stalled contract talks, firefighters have picketed  city buildings and busy intersections. The possibility of making public safety  salaries an election-year issue was raised.  </P> <P> "We'll see you in November," several cried out after the council vote. JAMES  TORTOLANO  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: ATLANTIC STARR "WE'RE MOVIN' UP." WARNER BROS.***: POP STARS *****  GREAT BALLS OF FIRE **** KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S DOOR *** GOOD VIBRATIONS ** MAYBE  BABY * AIN'T THAT A SHAME  </P> <P> Porsha Martin, the group's third female lead singer, makes her debut on this  album, bridging the gap between original singer Sharon Bryant's strong, gutsy  soulfulness and her successor Barbara Weathers' creamier crossover flavoring.  Martin gets to solo on only one track here ("Don't Start the Fire"), and it's  not even a particularly good one. Founding members David and Wayne Lewis save  the best cuts for themselves, although the vocal pairing of Martin and Wayne  Lewis on "My First Love" results in a polished showcase for them both.  Continuing to move in a pop direction, Atlantic Starr can attribute its success  to well-crafted songs and its crafty selection of stand-out female group  members to help embellish them.

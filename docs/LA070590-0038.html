			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS DISCLOSED  </P> <P> Regarding "Mayor Gets Council to Take a Dry View," (Times, June 15):  </P> <P> Shawn Hubler, the reporter, informs us that Mayor Brad Parton "is a 30-year-old  'born again' Christian."  </P> <P> She does not tell us the religious beliefs of any other speaker or council  members quoted.  </P> <P> Come on, let's be fair. If personal beliefs are important to the story, why not  tell us if Ernie O'Dell, Mark Conte or Councilwoman (Barbara) Doerr are  atheists, Catholics, Baptists or Jews?  </P> <P> Better yet, should we know if they are "born-again" Catholics, etc.? I fail to  see what anyone's personal beliefs along those lines have to do with attempting  to provide a healthy, safe environment for the public. Mayor Parton serves on  the Beach Cities Coalition for a Drug Free Youth and is trying to take  constructive action toward that goal, unlike the alcohol and other drug  pushers.  </P> <P> JUNE WILLIAMS  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach  </P></p>

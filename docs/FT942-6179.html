			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Factories short of paper and steel British factories reported a significant shortage of paper, pulp and steel in May as manufacturing output continued to surge across the country, the latest Purchasing Managers Index shows. The index, released today, shows that monthly growth in recruitment accelerated to its highest level in the index's three-year history, providing further evidence of economic recovery. Purchasing prices were reported to be up significantly, however, possibly indicating inflationary pressures. The purchasing managers' price index was 57.8 per cent. The index, which surveys 250 purchasing managers, measures changes in economic performance between consecutive months, with any figure above 50 per cent implying a monthly rise. The reported rise in prices is slightly at odds with the Confederation of British Industry's most recent survey, which implied a more modest growth in prices. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, the organiser of the index, said the main reason was that rising factory demand was creating shortages of vital manufacturing components. Pulp and steel were said to be in particularly short supply, affecting the prices of production and packaging materials. The shortages are feeding through to delivery periods. The suppliers' delivery times index fell to 42.7 per cent - its lowest recorded level. The institute said the fall reflected shortages in many sectors. These trends appear to tally with the broader output figures, which showed that the engineering and vehicle manufacturing sectors - significant users of steel - had recorded the highest level of monthly growth of any sector, with the output index at 68. Strong growth was recorded in timber, paper, textiles, and food and drink, as well as in the office machinery and electrical sectors. The chemical industry, rubber and plastics processing, and mining performed worse, with monthly output growth reported to have slowed. Monthly Trends.

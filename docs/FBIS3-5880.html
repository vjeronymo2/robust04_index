"If nothing is done, U.S. sanctions will come one day  suddenly. I believe private companies understand this well,"  Kumagai told a press conference.    The U.S. Government has warned that it may impose sanctions  against Japan if Tokyo does not open its markets, including  those for autos and auto parts. Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa is trying to hammer out a package of voluntary measures  to boost imports by the end of March with the aim of thwarting  possible U.S. sanctions.</p>

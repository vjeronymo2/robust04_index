			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Pension funds sue May Stores, Morgan Stanley A GROUP of US state pension funds and insurance companies have filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit against Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street securities house, and retail group May Department Stores, claiming the two companies illegally attempted to buy back high-interest debt they issued in the 1980s. The suit, which asks for Dollars 24m in compensatory damages and Dollars 100m in punitive damages, claims that Morgan Stanley and May Department Stores committed fraud and breach of contract earlier this year when the retailer used money raised from Dollars 200m new low-interest bonds to pay off Dollars 425m of high-yielding bonds it had issued in 1988. The pension funds and insurers who bought the bonds - the Alabama, California and Montana state pension programmes, and a bond fund and two affiliated insurance companies controlled by Boston-based insurer John Hancock - say they lost Dollars 24m in earnings they would have made between 1992 and 1998 because of the early call on the bonds. Morgan Stanley would not comment on the lawsuit.</p>

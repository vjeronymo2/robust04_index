			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 3 Jan (EFE) -- The former Revolutionary  Workers Clandestine People's Union Party (Procup) dissociated  itself from the rebel Zapata National Liberation Army (EZLN),  which has revolted in Chiapas State, Mexico.    Maria Vera, a former Procup member imprisoned since 1990,  said in statements published by the newspaper EL FINANCIERO  today, Monday, that Procup backs the EZLN armed movement  although it has no relations with them. "The EZLN has our  acceptance and moral support. We are sure other armed groups  will salute, in their own way, the struggle of the companions in  Chiapas," she stated.    The government's only option is a political one. The  situation will become very critical if it represses the EZLN and  the people of Chiapas, she added. In her opinion, the  government is interested in presenting an image of a country  with social and political stability due to the start up of the  North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This is the only  explanation for the government's willingness to negotiate with  the rebels, Vera added.    She believes the EZLN's appearance is one of the most  important events for the armed struggle in Mexico, and she  warned that the confrontations in Chiapas could generate similar  actions in other parts of the country. "This is due to the fact  that there are large sectors of the population that live under  conditions of extreme poverty similar to those in Chiapas," the  former guerrilla said. It will be very difficult, she said, for  the government to choose an increase in "its low-intensity war  against the people and to annihilate the Zapatist army, as such  actions would have a high political cost."    Vera revealed that she had heard reports on the formation of  a guerrilla movement--although it had not proclaimed itself as  the EZLN--in the Chiapas region for several years. She said  that the clashes in Chiapas could prompt rebel movements to  arise in Mexico; events have shown that the EZLN has an  authentic belligerent character in the country.    Procup has its roots in the guerrilla movements that  developed in the southern State of Guerrero during the 1970's.  The group was allegedly headed by former Oaxaca University  Director Felipe Martinez Soriano, who is imprisoned for his  responsibility in the attack against the Mexican newspaper LA  JORNADA, in which two guards lost their lives, in April 1990.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: THEATER / NANCY CHURNIN: CHILLING MEMORY OF HITLER WAS THE  GENESIS OF PLAY  </P> <P> Robert Landis was a 16-year-old American schoolboy on a holiday when he saw  Adolf Hitler rumbling through Berlin. The shock of the adulation the crowd held  for Der Fuhrer still haunts him.  </P> <P> Fifty-three years later, Landis has written a play, "The Canaris Enigma," about  a real German agent, Adm. Wilhelm Canaris, who helped put Hitler in power and  later plotted to bring him down. The show premieres at the Westminster Theatre  in Point Loma March 3-19.  </P> <P> Landis, a retired ad executive with the San Diego Union-Tribune, was bicycling  through Berlin, hoping to catch a glimpse of the Olympics, when he and a German  friend saw Hitler and staff members Joseph Goebbels, Hermann Goering and Rudolf  Hess riding in their limousines to the Games.  </P> <P> "The thing that I still remember with great clarity was the mass hysteria of  the crowd," Landis said, taking a break from painting the set of "The Canaris  Enigma."  </P> <P> "The whole town was festooned in blood red banners and swastikas. They yelled  'Sieg Heil!' at the top of their voices, thrusting their arms out. As the  cavalcade went down the neighborhood, you could hear the sound reverberating.  And, in the distance, you could hear it rising and falling. It was electric. It  was shocking. It was terrifying because I had no idea people could be so taken  by a charismatic leader. There was this sense of impending doom and war all  through the city."  </P> <P> Landis, who later served in naval intelligence, said his German friend did not  seem to be taken in by Hitler at the time. But, over the years, as they  corresponded, their friendship eroded as the German's letters grow more  strident in defense of Hitler.  </P> <P> "It could be that he wrote those things because of censorship. The Gestapo was  reading mail going out to other countries at that time. But it turned me off.  He did survive. The last letter I had from him was after the war and he was  begging for clothes and help. I'm ashamed to say I didn't respond. It was the  close of a very dreadful war, and I was still angry. All of that is background  for my play."  </P> <P> They did it for Mary Martin, David Bowie, Bob Hope, Lucille Ball, Jack Benny,  Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Liberace, Lily Tomlin, Raquel Welch, Carol  Burnett, Jerry Lewis, Ray Bolger and Howie Mandel.  </P> <P> Now, Flying by Foy, a company that specializes in flying, swimming and  weightlifting effects, will be sprinkling the fairy dust on former Olympic  medal-winner Cathy Rigby when she takes the title role in the Starlight  production of "Peter Pan," May 24-June 4.  </P> <P> Can a company really make a living making people fly? Since 1950, when  British-born Peter Foy helped Jean Arthur soar on Broadway as the boy who won't  grow up, Foy has been the wings behind 3,000 subsequent productions of "Peter  Pan." (In that 1950 production, Boris Karloff made his American stage debut as  Captain Hook.) The show didn't become really complicated, though, until 1954  when it became a musical with Mary Martin. The addition of a 2 1/2-minute song  to be delivered airborne created a need for flight choreography.  </P> <P> In between soirees to Never-Never Land, Flying by Foy has worked for "High  Spirits," "The Wizard of Oz," "The Flying Nun," "Hair!" "Funny Girl," "The  Fantastic Voyage," "Disney on Parade," and "The Ice Capades."  </P> <P> They didn't get the "Superman" account, but they're not complaining.  </P> <P> "We're busy enough," said Garry Foy, who minds the Las Vegas shop while father  Foy is helping operatic stars in London literally scale new heights. "Half of  'Superman' is done with wires and half on film. We usually do things of a more  theatrical nature."  </P> <P> For "Peter Pan," Peter and the Darling children will wear girdles under their  costumes that include a small eye hook between the shoulder blades. A small  cable is attached through the hook to a track system 80 feet above the stage  floor. The track system, operated by as many as three stage technicians per  actor, allows for vertical and horizontal movement. Happy landings.  </P> <P> PEOPLE: "Cousins" opens Friday in San Diego movie theaters, and Old Globe  playwright Stephen Metcalfe, who wrote the script, utters the one comment that  screenwriters so rarely say: "I enjoyed it." No wonder. "Cousins" may be based  on the French film "Cousin, Cousine," but the emphasis on generational family  interactions in "Cousins" is right out of Metcalfe's "Vikings." The La Jolla  resident also said he is looking forward to the March opening of "Jackknife," a  film adaptation of his play "Strange Snow," starring Robert DeNiro and Ed  Harris. In the meantime, he is working on the film adaptation of his play  "Emily," as well as a new play. . . . Leon Singer, who plays the cook in the  "Lonesome Dove" miniseries, took a break from his restaurant duties at El  Tecolote, his Mexican restaurant, to sigh over how much of his part was lost on  the cutting-room floor. "After doing 'Burning Patience' (at the San Diego  Repertory Theatre) and seeing myself here like a shadow on the wall, and you  don't even know who the shadow belongs to, it was disappointing," he said. He  had no complaints, though, about the stars, especially Robert Duvall, whom he  described as "a real gentleman," or the series itself. "The director did a  beautiful job, and the cast is perfect. It's as if I had played a little part  in 'Gone With the Wind.' I'm proud of it." . . . Ralph Waite, who played the  grandfather in "The Waltons" has signed on for Athol Fugard's "The Road to  Mecca" opening March 4 at the Old Globe's Cassius Carter Centre Stage. . . .  August Wilson's latest play, "The Piano Lesson," will have its West Coast  premiere when it replaces Martha Clarke's "The Garden of Earthly Delights" at  the Old Globe Theatre May 4-28. "The Piano Lesson" is the fourth in Wilson's  projected series about the African-American experience. The others were  "Fences," "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" and "Joe Turner's Come and Gone."  </P></p>

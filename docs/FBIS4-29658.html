			<p>BFN     [Text] The following is the gist of a letter sent by the  representatives of the party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] in  Phnom Penh to Phnom Penh residents informing them about the  closure of the PDK office in Phnom Penh by the two-headed  government's Ministry of the Interior:    1. We, representatives of the PDK in Phnom Penh, would like  to inform the brothers in all circles in Phnom Penh that on 16  June 1994, at 1830, the two-headed government's Ministry of the  Interior handed us a letter setting a deadline for all of us to  leave Phnom Penh no later than 19 June.    2. We have been staying at the PDK office in Phnom Penh in  conformity with the Paris agreement and later, at the august  decision of His Majesty the king, who has graciously given us  permission to occupy this crown property so that we can maintain  sustained, uninterrupted contact with the aim of gradually  fostering mutual understanding pending the procecss of national  reconciliation. However, the two-headed government's Ministry  of the Interior has just set a deadline for us to leave Phnom  Penh before 19 June. We therefore feel compelled to leave Phnom  Penh.    3. We would like to thank the people in all circles for  giving us all kinds of support and assistance throughout our  stay in Phnom Penh.    4. We want to live with all of you in Phnom Penh forever  within the framework of national reconciliation and national  concord and within the framework of genuine peeace.    5. However, we are compelled to take temporary leave of you  and we hope that one day we will be able to return and see you  again.    6. We pray that there will be national reconciliation and  national corcord in the near future so that peace returns and  Cambodia's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity  are restored.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Thorn sells majority stake in security arm Thorn EMI yesterday announced the disposal of a majority stake in its lossmaking security business for Pounds 38.6m, and said it was in discussions regarding the sale of part of its electronics division. The music and rentals group is selling 60 per cent of Thorn Security to its management in a deal backed by Hambro European Ventures, the venture capital company. Some Pounds 11m of the sale price will be paid with interest to Thorn between 1998 and 2000. The disposal was widely expected following comments from Sir Colin Southgate, Thorn's chairman, earlier this week that a sale was imminent. The group will book a post-tax exceptional gain of about Pounds 1m, before the Pounds 16m goodwill write-off. Thorn EMI has reserved the right to increase its holding by 2.5 per cent in the event of a trade sale or flotation. It is likely the company will seek a listing in 1995. The security division, which pre-dates the Thorn merger with EMI in 1979, has been pegged a non-core business for several years. In the year to March 31, Thorn Security incurred a Pounds 3.5m operating loss on sales of Pounds 160m. Before restructuring charges, the division was marginally profitable. The management has invested Pounds 500,000 in return for an unspecified stake. Mr Allan Hendry, Thorn Security's technical director, said the main difficulties had now been dealt with. The group, which claims a market share averaging 20 per cent in its UK businesses, expected to expand in east Asia and the US. Thorn EMI's decision to retain a 40 per cent stake is in character with many of its disposals in recent years. It retained an 8 per cent stake in Kenwood, sold in September 1989, 20 per cent in Thorn EMI Software, disposed of in 1991, and 12 per cent in Thorn Lighting, which was shed in 1993.</p>

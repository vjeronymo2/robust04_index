			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Bophuthatswana President Dr. Lucas </F> Mangope at the meeting of Freedom Alliance leaders in Kimberley  by unidentified correspondents on the "Newsline" program --  recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] What is the purpose of this meeting  today?    [Mangope] Well, it is to look generally at the situation and  to determine the strategy forward.    [Correspondent] Doctor, what is your position in the  politics  right now?    [Mangope] I have no intention to give up political activity.  I am determined politically to fight because, as you are aware,  there has in Bophuthatswana been a lot of looting that has taken  place. The African National Congress [ANC], the [South African]  Communist Party, and the National Party government have looted  Bophuthatswana politically also, and I must fight to correct  that situation.    [Correspondent] Doctor, you have been dismissed as president  of Bophuthatswana by the South African government. Do you  accept it?    [Mangope] When Mr. Pik Botha and Mr. Maharaj of the TEC  [Transitional Executive Council] came to see me to tell me that  I would no more be president, I told them first of all that I  had done no wrong at all, constitutionally. I had not broken  any law at all. I told them that they have no right whatsoever  to remove me; it was the Batswana people who elected me as  president, and to show that they were out to loot Bophuthatswana  politically, they refused me even to address my people to tell  them that they had come to tell me that I would no more be  president.    [Correspondent] Do you still regard yourself as president of  Bophuthatswana?    [Mangope] I am still president of Bophuthatswana.  Constitutionally and legally, I am president of Bophuthatswana.    [Correspondent] Where are you operating from at this point  in  time? What's the status of your office?    [Mangope] Well, I'm operating from my private residence.    [Correspondent] So the South African Government took over  control of Bophuthatswana. What's your reaction on that?    [Mangope] They didn't take over control. They looted  control. There was a lot of criminal looting in Mmabatho, and  the South African Government looted political power.    [Correspondent] Doctor, in short, your reaction, your  feelings on what has happened, the events of the past week, and  your position right now?    [Mangope] Well, I think it augurs frighteningly for the  future. The future is bleak with the type of communistic  political activity that I've seen. I think we have reason to be  terribly concerned for the future.    [Correspondent] Is your party going to take part in the  election?    [Mangope] Do you know, it is very interesting. When I told  Mr. Pik Botha and Mr. Maharaj, after they had told me that I was  deposed, that I would be taking part because I have political  principles and convictions that I want to espouse, they said I  would not be allowed. They have no right to stop me from taking  part in politics.    [Correspondent] Do you still have all your cabinet ministers  in your government?    [Mangope] My cabinet ministers are 100 percent behind me. My  Christian Democratic Party is still intact. We are doing  everything we can. If we are allowed, we want to register and  fight the elections, because we want to expose the ANC, the  Communist Party, the National Party government, for what they  are. You know, Mr. Pik Botha came accompanied by Mr. Maharaj,  who apparently came to ensure that Mr. Botha carried out his  instructions -- Mr. Maharaj's instructions...    [Correspondent, interrupting] Can I ask you, please, the  last  question from my side. The South African Government, the  National Party government, gave independence to Bophuthatswana  many years ago. Now the same National Party comes and says to  you, fine, you are dismissed as president, and you are not  independent anymore.    [Mangope] If that is not a diamond bright example of  dishonesty, then I don't know what is. Freedom and  independence, once given, can never be taken back.    [Correspondent] Are you considering any steps to gain  control  of Bophuthatswana?    [Mangope] I am going to be about, politically. I am not done  with it. I want to assure you that. I want to expose, for the  good of South Africa, for the good of South Africa, I want to  expose the ANC, the Communist Party, and the South African  Government for what they are. For much too long, ever since the  beginning of the negotiations, we have had secret deals between  the National Party government and the Communist Party, and the  ANC. As a result of that, as a result of such secret deals,  such as is evidenced by the Record of Understanding, we have  this flawed constitution. And I want to tell the South African  public, you know, each time they have come to me, it has always  been at night. Even Mr. Pik Botha and Mr. Maharaj got to my  house at night. I don't know what the reason is for that.    [Correspondent] What's your comment about this irony that in  the 1988 attempted coup, Pik Botha came to your assistance, and  today it is the same man who orders you out of office?    [Mangope] Doesn't that expose the man for what he is? Does  that not expose the man for what he is?    [Correspondent] There's an observation that people voted  with  their feet to ensure that they have free political activity.  Your comment?    [Mangope] I told Mr. Botha and Mr. Maharaj on the 15th of  this month, this is next Tuesday, that's tomorrow, my parliament  would be taking a decision on whether to register or not, and  flowing from that decision, free political activity would ensue.  I also told them, flowing from that decision, that my  parliament would endorse the South African law that puts into  being the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission]. But do you  know what? They would not allow me those two days only to put  this matter to my parliament. They would not allow me to  address my people, my people who elected me as president. They  would not allow me to address my people and tell them that I had  told Botha, that I had told Maharaj, that they do not have the  right to remove me. They have no legal or constitutional right  to remove me. They would not allow me that.    [Correspondent] Do you still regard yourself, then, as the  president?    [Mangope] I am constitutionally and legally president. They  have looted political power.    [Correspondent] What is then going to happen to this  parliamentary session? Are you going to go ahead outside of  Mmabatho or whatever?    [Mangope] Well, I think you should direct that question to  Dr. van der Walt, who is the so-called administrator of  Bophuthatswana.</p>

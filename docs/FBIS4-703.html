			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The attempted international mediation between the  South African Government and the ANC on the one hand, and Chief  Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party, IFP, on the other, to bring  the IFP into the election process has ground to a halt even  before it has begun. The mediators -- Henry Kissinger and Lord  Carrington -- are kicking their heels after IFP negotiators  refused to go to the venue where the mediation talks were  supposed to take place. Chief Buthelezi claims that the ANC has  gone back on its word given at the weekend meeting and is  insisting that the election dates, between April the 26th and  April the 28th, aren't up for discussion. The whole process is  stalled, while government, ANC, and IFP officials try to sort  out the deadlock. On the line, Jeremy Skeet asked Chief  Buthelezi if he held out any hope of the mediation talks getting  off the ground.    [Begin recording] [Buthelezi] Well, it is difficult to be  optimistic when people shift things around like that because  after all the consolidated agreement or the consolidated terms  of reference were actually something we considered because the  ANC insisted, and we were surprised that they have brought in  these issues now which have stalled the process we should be  starting by now, you know, if it hadn't been for that purpose.  So, I just hold my tongue that things will work out. I don't  want to abandon hope, but I am just holding tongues in the hope  that things will work out.    [Skeet] Now, it was Inkatha and you yourself who originally  called for international mediators. The international mediators  have come, but at the moment it looks as though that's broken  down, and some people are going to blame you for this. They are  going to say: Well, you never really wanted to take part in the  elections.    [Buthelezi] Blaming for what? I am not surprised, Mr. Skeet,  that you are asking me this question because the BBC is also in  that game of trying to heap blame on me. I don't think that I  could have been more explicit than I have been even now to say  that even now my delegation is waiting to go to the venue. Now,  you are putting that question precisely because you are putting  in the minds of listeners that we are to blame for this when  actually the thing has been stalled by the ANC.    [Skeet] Okay, let me ask you another question chief  minister.  What needs to be done by the government and the ANC to bring you  on board in these elections?    [Buthelezi] But surely it (?wasn't a) matter for mediation  now, because there was a deadlock. What more can I say than  that? Because we asked for a mediation in the first place  precisely because there is a deadlock. I don't think that I  have any thing to contribute to that question more than that.    [Skeet] But now with the mediation effort apparently failed,  does that mean that Inkatha will definitely not take part in the  elections?    [Buthelezi] Well, as far as I am concerned it has not  failed.  I have told you very explicitly in clear terms that we are  waiting to hear now what happens at the meeting in which the  IFP, the government, and the ANC are participating at this  moment as you are talking to me.    [Skeet] But so, if nothing comes out of this meeting this  afternoon, that is it as far as you are concerned?    [Buthelezi] No, that is a decision you are asking me to  take.  Fortunately, I don't take decisions like that. It will be the  IFP Central Committee that will take decisions if that happens,  and even now I have not abandoned hope that this thing can be  sorted out.    [Skeet] You say that you haven't abandoned hope, but [words  indistinct] an outside observer it looks as though there is no  hope in South Africa at the moment. There is a lot of killing  going on in Natal.    [Buthelezi] You are entitled to your opinion, of course, on  that. I mean, I don't begrudge you that, Mr. Skeet. You are  quite entitled to make that conclusion, but it isn't necessarily  mine.    [Skeet] How do you think you can help stop the killing that  is going on daily in Natal and kwaZulu?    [Buthelezi] How can Major stop the killing that goes on with  the IRA there?    [Skeet] But people ask him that question. I am asking you,  how do you think you can help in bringing about peace in  Natal-kwaZulu?    [Buthelezi] We have just been discussing at length with me  the fact that the deplorable problems of this country have not  been resolved. As long as those problems are not resolved, I  don't think I have a magic wand to stop, you know, what is going  on, which has been going on for 10 years. You should know from  your library or cuttings which you have in your library that the  peace accord which was signed in this country in which Mr.  Mandela, Mr. de Klerk, and myself, and other leaders signed, and  that my people, IFP, have been involved in the peace committees,  but a few days ago, right here where I am in the Reef, one of  the leaders was shot by the members of the South African Defense  Force, you know. But in spite of that we have not withdrawn  from the structures which are trying to bring about peace. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / French troops poised to enter Rwanda French troops flew into eastern Zaire yesterday in readiness for Operation Turquoise - the controversial military expedition to rescue civilians trapped in Rwanda's genocidal war. Transport aircraft landed the first soldiers of a 2,500-strong force at airfields in Bukavu and Goma on the shores of Lake Kivu. From there, the military intends to make short forays into western Rwanda, where thousands of persecuted Tutsis are herded in concentration camps guarded by Hutu militias. France won the UN Security Council's blessing for its mission of mercy despite international scepticism, a shortage of allies on the ground and the bitter opposition of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which believes France is intervening to deny them an outright victory in the civil war. Yesterday, however, the RPF seemed to be softening its opposition to French intervention. 'If the French stick to their humanitarian mandate, and do not interfere in our struggle, then we will have no quarrel with them,' Dr Emmanuel Ndahiro, the RPF's military spokesman, said from the capital, Kigali. 'But we still have misgivings about the French operation. We cannot exonerate them from the crimes committed by the Rwandan government.' The rebels distrust Paris because of its military and financial support for the government of Gen Juvenal Habyarimana until his death in an air crash on April 6. Having bolstered Rwanda's crumbling army with military advisers, weapons, armoured cars and helicopters, France is regarded as an accomplice to the slaughter of Tutsis and Hutu opponents of the Habyarimana regime which followed his death. France plans to lead quick missions into Rwanda to rescue endangered civilians, but has pledged not to make deep raids or to be drawn into fighting between government and rebel forces. The UN mandate authorises French troops to use force if attacked. In Paris Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, yesterday sought to downplay the military and political risks for France intervening almost alone in Rwanda, in the face of hostility from rebels controlling two-thirds of the country. 'Senegalese soldiers will be at our side and discussions are in train with Guinea-Bissau,' he told the French Senate yesterday. Senegal is apparently to send troops it had already agreed to contribute to the planned UN force due in Rwanda in late July, at which point France has said it will pull its troops out. Mr Juppe said he hoped European countries would give France the logistic support the US has already pledged. France will be pressing its European Union partners for backing when the Twelve start their summit in Corfu later today, Mr Alain Lamassoure, French EU affairs minister, said yesterday, adding that while 'there might be 10 good reasons for not intervening, the one essential reason for doing so is that a whole people is in the course of dying'. The French are setting up field hospitals on the Zaire border. But it is not clear whether they will just seek to evacuate refugees and wounded to the hospitals, or try to set up safe zones as they and other UN peacekeepers have sought to do in Bosnia. Although Operation Turquoise is meant to be a bridging operation until the UN can muster a multinational force, it has inadvertently undermined the work of the 400 UN military personnel who remained in Kigali after the majority of UN troops and all foreigners were evacuated in April. Thousands of Tutsis have also demonstrated against the French expedition in Bujumbura, the capital of neighbouring Burundi, which is bristling with the tensions of the Rwandan conflict. With anti-French sentiment rising in the RPF-controlled areas of the capital, the UN decided to relieve 42 French-speaking African soldiers from their duties. They were flown to Uganda on Wednesday.</p>

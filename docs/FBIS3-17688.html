According to chief Vladimir Movsisyan of the national Agency  on the Affairs of Refugees, the deportees enjoy all the civic  rights and freedoms but no special status. They are regarded as  people without citizenship. The 16,000 people deported in 1988  from Sumgait, in Azerbaijan, have by now been provided with  housing facilities or live in houses of their own. 28,000  deportees enjoy the right to permanent residency in Armenia and  another 35,000 have been given plots of land.</p>

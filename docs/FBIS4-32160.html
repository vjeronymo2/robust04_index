			<p>BFN     [Text] Brno, South Moravia, June 18 (CTK) -- A new Moravian  party, the Movement for Self-Governing Moravia and Silesia  (HSMS), was established today electing Jan Smejkal its chairman.  Smejkal told CTK that the priority goal of the HSMS, registered  on June 1, was self-rule for Moravia.    He said that the participants in the constituent congress  considered the movement a successor organisation to the original  Self-Governing Democracy Movement for Moravia and Silesia  (HSDMS) which was transformed into the present Bohemian and  Moravian Centre Party (CMSS) in January. Some members of the  original movement, especially those active at Brno's local  administration, disagreed with the move.    Delegates from the Brno organisaton accused CMSS Chairman  Jan  Krycer at the CMSS congress on June 4 "of a loss of prestige of  the party, disintegration of the organisational structure and  decline in the party's popularity." The CMSS has 9 out of a  total of 200 parliamentary seats. But according to the latest  public opinion polls, it would not cross the parliamentary  border of 5 per cent now.</p>

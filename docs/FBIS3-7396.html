The agreement calls for Korean communication firms'  participation in communications network-building in China and  joint development of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM).    South Korean companies will join in a cable-laying project  between Beijing and Guangzhou, communications network-building  in Hunan Province and construction of the Chinese posts and  Telecommunications Ministry's project for computerizing the  financial market.    Meanwhile, Korean Ambassador to Beijing Hwang Pyong-tae and  Chinese State Science and Technology Commission Minister Zhu  Lilan signed an agreement Monday allowing Korean youth  volunteers to work in China.    Seoul will send 12 volunteers to China in the second half of  this year, with the number to rise further in the future.    Hwang and Zhu also signed a memorandum of understanding on  exploring for minerals in Fujian Province. The Korea  International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and the China National  Nonferrous Metals Industry Corp. will perform a three-year  feasibility study on the project.    Seoul will provide technology worth 1 million U.S. dollars  for exploration work and, if profitable minerals are found, it  will be given priority in development.</p>

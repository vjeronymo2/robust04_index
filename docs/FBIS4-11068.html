			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gregorio Salazar] </F>   [Text] The Miraflores Presidential Palace was engulfed in a  foul and irritating cloud yesterday morning, as police used tear  gas at the nearby Fermin Toro High School. The sound of gas  canisters going off and bird shot rifles being fired at the  demonstrators served as a backdrop to a news conference by  General Barry McCaffrey, commander of the U.S. Southern Command.  Gen. McCaffrey is here to discuss regional security and drug  trafficking matters.    Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom made a midmorning  statement: "We are living in an atmosphere of tranquility,  stability, and trust in the government. The polls and what the  people on the street are saying demonstrates this."    Reporters focused their attention on the pipe bombs placed  at  the doors of the of Banco Latino. This forced the minister to  say that "these events do not have the significance or the  weight that some people would like to give them..., and they are  not big enough to pose any kind of threat to the nation."    When addressing a question about the identity of those  responsible for what he called "these scattered uprisings," he  answered with a question: "Who do these attacks against the  Banco Latino benefit or who could they benefit at this moment in  time? Ask yourselves those same questions. I am not going to  answer it. Let public opinion make up its own mind."    "None of those responsible for yesterday's events has any  real political significance." The minister was not clear; the  reporters presumed that he meant the government employees'  strike and the farmers' demonstration at the Central Bank of  Venezuela last Wednesday.    Another ongoing investigation is one looking into alleged  terrorist plans, based on a report by Zulia State Governor  Lolita Aniyar against ranchers in the Perija region. Escovar  said that the commission he sent there has interviewed many  people and that even the director of the weapons and explosives  department was in Zulia.    The minister also said that he did not know if Commander  Hugo  Chavez was planning any sort of uprising or conspiracy. Finally,  the minister gave a flat "no comment" to a question about the  "switch" on the Board of Directors of Aeropostal, allegedly  carried out by Gustavo Velazquez and Mrs. Tarazona.    Some reporters rewound their audio cassettes to listen to  the  minister's opening statements: "We are living in an atmosphere  of tranquility, stability, and trust...."</p>

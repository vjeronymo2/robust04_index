			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- Japan's economic planning  chief called for effective use of both macroeconomic and  microeconomic measures Friday [25 February] as a way to reduce  the nation's huge current account surplus. The large Japanese  surplus is not "satisfactory" for the global economy, Manae  Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency [EPA],  told a regular press conference.    As one of the macroeconomic measures, the EPA will hammer  out  ways to shift huge individual savings in Japan to housing  investment and social infrastructure, Kubota said.    The booming housing sector has a great potential for further  demand, she said.    Quicker improvement regarding the current account balance  could come with deregulation and other microeconomic policies  that have "sharper" effects on a short-term basis, she said.    Kubota cited import promotion and government procurement as  possible microeconomic areas in which the government could take  more action. She said the EPA will include these macro and  microeconomic measures in a market-opening package to be  unveiled by the government by the end of March.    Kubota reiterated that the 2.8 percent forecast by the  government as the ratio of the current account surplus against  gross domestic product (GDP) in fiscal 1994, starting April 1,  is not a target but is only a reference figure. Such an area is  not within government control, she said, noting that a country's  trade balance is affected by external factors such as the  international situation and economic activities of foreign  countries.    She said Japan's current account balance figures have failed  to meet original government projections in most years since  fiscal 1955.    Kubota called for effective use of her agency's trade  ombudsman system in monitoring Japan's trade balance changes.  The office of trade and investment ombudsman was inaugurated  Friday as a way to gauge the openness of Japan's markets.</p>

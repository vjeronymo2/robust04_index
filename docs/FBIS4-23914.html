			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 16 SAPA -- Agriculture Minister Kraai  van Niekerk has approved a broad plan for the implementation of  tariffs on agricultural products, the Agriculture Department's  chief marketing director Attie Swart announced on Thursday [16  June]. Mr Swart said the plan was drawn up by the department in  consultation with the Board on Tariffs and Trade and the  Department of Trade and Industry.    The implementation plan provided for differentiated action  to  be taken on each of four categories of product grouping. The  first category included all tariff products already identified  and to which qualitative import restrictions no longer applied,  or whose quantitative restrictions would be removed at a  determined future date. The second category covered products  with reasonable tariffs already in place but in respect of which  quantitative import controls still applied. The third category  included products to which certain tariffs and import controls  currently applied. The fourth category includes products in  respect of which specific statutory marketing measures were in  place.    According to the statement, the successful outcome of the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's Uruguay Round of  multilateral negotiations obliged South Africa to put tariffs on  all agricultural products and to lift remaining quantitative  import restrictions before the agreement's implementation date  on January 1 next year. "Starting from that date South Africa  will have six years to phase- in its implementation commitments  according to predetermined formulas," Mr Swart said.    "Notwithstanding South Africa's obligations under the GATT's  Uruguay Round, it has been the official policy of the Department  of Agriculture to move away from a policy of quantitative import  control in favour of a tariff protection-only approach," the  statement said.    The successful implementation of the Uruguay Round had not  brought about major changes in departmental policy, but had  rather placed an urgency on its implementation.    The statement said the Department of Agriculture was in  favour of the abolition of surcharge on agricultural products.</p>

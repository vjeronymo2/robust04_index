			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The situation in Kigali has deteriorated  dramatically. This sums up the reaction of the international  community after the unleashing of violence following the deaths  of the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi the day before  yesterday. Yesterday, armed rival factions fought in Kigali,  where armed men carried out a veritable cleansing of political  circles and those in favor of democratization. Priests also  paid the price in this settling of scores, as well as Belgian  soldiers. The spokesman of the UN force in Rwanda -- 2,000  soldiers in all -- this morning released the names of 10 Belgian  peacekeepers shot dead by Rwandan soldiers. The soldiers, all  Belgians, were responsible for ensuring the safety of the prime  minister, Madame Uwilingiyimana. [passage omitted]    Listen to what Colonel Marchal, who leads the Belgian  contingent in Rwanda, has to say about it.    [Begin Marchal recording] The soldiers were part of the  mortar platoon of the battalion, which was carrying out escort  duty for ministers and VIPs, it was a security escort.  Yesterday, during the day, some of them were separated from  their ministers, because the ministers were either killed or  abducted, and they found themselves in the midst of the Rwandan  armed forces. They were disarmed, taken to a district in the  center of town, the Kigali camp [as heard], and there,  apparently, they were maltreated by certain soldiers and shot  dead. [passage omitted] [end recording]    Apart from the prime minister, the speaker of the National  Assembly and the chairman of the Constitutional Court were also  murdered, as were several leaders of opposition parties, along  with their families. The president of the Human Rights League  was shot dead by soldiers while she was speaking on the  telephone to a Belgian interlocutor. [passage omitted]    The Belgian reaction was rapid: A meeting of the cabinet was  held yesterday evening until 0100 this morning. The prime and  foreign ministers, Dehaene and Claes, who are visiting abroad,  have been recalled to Belgium, and a further meeting of the  cabinet is due to be held this morning. The king and the queen,  who are also visiting abroad, are also returning to Belgium.</p>

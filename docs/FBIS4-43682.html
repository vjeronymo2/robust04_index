			<p>BFN     [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- In the view of the  Bundesbank, the evident recovery of international trade is now  also pulling the Germany economy out of an economic low. "In  the past few months, the west German economy seems to have  overcome recession, and signs for sustained economic recovery  are increasing," the Bundesbank writes in its recent monthly  report. "In the weakest area of the economy -- the  manufacturing industry -- the situation has improved lately."    In the Bundesbank's view, the "harbingers of lasting  economic  recovery" have come mainly from foreign markets, whose  stagnation was "one of the primary reasons for the recession."  Starting in North America and Southeast Asia, impulses have  spread to "a wide range of countries." "German exporters are  obviously able to participate in the resulting acceleration of  growth in world trade." Should export demands further rise,  negative effects at home -- such as a drop in real income,  rising taxes and rates -- would be more than set off.    So far, the Bundesbank had assessed the prospects for the  economy very cautiously. In its recent monthly report it now  speaks of a "remarkable turn for the better," which, however,  does not yet promise a change in the job market trend. The  Bundesbank's national economy experts point out that, following  the major slump, the west German economy was still at a very low  level. "With regard to capacity utilization, we are now at the  1988 level, that is to say the period before German  unification," and economic growth expected for 1994 is not  sufficient "to prevent a further limited increase in  unemployment." In eastern Germany upward development has  clearly continued in the Bundesbank's view. "More and more  enterprises are recovering shares in the east German market that  they had temporarily lost, and are establishing themselves in  western Germany," the monthly reports notes. "Successes on the  domestic market are the first signs of increasing competitive  strength for east German products following the restructuring of  enterprises." The economy in the new laender, however, will  require a lot more time in the search for new markets abroad.    The Bundesbank argues that, in the long run, competitiveness  and new jobs cannot be achieved with a one-time effort. "This  will require a rather longer process, which also includes, not  least, reduction of the tax and rate burden for enterprises."  According to Bundesbank estimates, in 1995, the rate quota  --taxes and social insurance contributions together -- will  reach 45 percent of the GDP, compared to 40.5 percent in 1990,  the tax reform year.</p>

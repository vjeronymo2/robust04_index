			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chang Yu-ying] </F>   [Text] Chen Ming-chang, director of Economic Affairs under  the Mainland Affairs Council [MAC], today [12 January] said that  the issue of "direct shipping between designated points" across  the strait will definitely not be put on the agenda of a meeting  to review mainland work that has been slated for 6-7 June this  year. However, it has been learned that the MAC has arranged for  its Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian to personally explain to the  people our policy and stand vis-a-vis why it is inappropriate  for cross-strait "direct shipping between designated points" at  the present stage.    It has been learned that the MAC still holds that before the  removal of substantive barriers in politics, law, and security  confronting the issue of direct navigation between the two sides  of the strait, various forms of shipping links such as "direct  shipping between designated points" and "unilateral opening to  shipping" may just slightly improve on the subject of opening up  navigation in terms of volume or mode, but their practicality is  not great. Nevertheless, the MAC still has not ruled out the  possibility of carrying out such a link as "direct shipping  between designated points" or "unilateral opening to shipping"  in the initial stage as a transitional measure after direct  navigation has been opened up.</p>

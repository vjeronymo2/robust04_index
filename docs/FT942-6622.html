			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Arts: Berlioz in Brighton - A look at the musical highlights of the festival For a decade and more Gavin Henderson has guided the Brighton Festival with a wise and generous hand. In this, his last, there is a nod towards the 'International year of the Family' with its 'Kindred Spirits' theme 'to accentuate the tensions of family conflict as much as the power of love'. The most notable musical event was the Romeo and Juliet dramatic symphony of Berlioz given in its still rarely heard complete form in a performance of high quality from the Festival and Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields choruses and the visiting National Orchestra de Lille, under Mark Elder. Shakespeare's tragedy does indeed illustrate the coming together of two bitterly opposed families. The concert, appropriately sponsored by Eurotunnel, was an unmistakable gesture towards recent events further up the Channel; the Brighton chorus will pay a return visit to Lille. The platform lay-out was unfamiliar. The brass occupied the Dome's apology for an inner stage and there were several rows of empty seats in front of the strings. From the circle the sound was clearer and brighter than usual. The 'open' timbre of the French brass lent a splendid ring to Berlioz's grand rhetorical phrases, the woodwind did not so much draw their lines as etch them, the strings were nimble and finely-shaded, the percussion made the most of the virtuoso writing. The chorus, sparingly used in the first two parts, comes into its own towards the end, after the death of the lovers, and is capped by the sermonising of Friar Laurence. Some visual interest is desirable: in the Dome the slow, processional entry of the full chorus, dark-robed, provided this. For the Friar's solemn address one simply needs the best available bass singer. The American David Pittsinger has a fine voice and the right manner (authoritative but not portentous) without quite the power of French declamation at its grandest. The other soloists, Martine Mahe (mezzo) and Leonard Pezzino (tenor) performed their lesser duties stylishly. Elder's direction showed an impressive grasp of the whole as well as penetrating insight into detail. One has heard more passionately sensual accounts of the love scene but few so clear, so probing. Queen Mab, in her first, fleeting appearance as in the famous scherzo, was fantastically brittle, light-footed, evanescent, uncaring, venomous. Notoriously, Brighton lacks an opera house and a satisfactory concert hall - the Dome does not deserve that description. There is, however, a wonderful assortment of smaller venues, including the unique Music Room in the Royal Pavilion. The usual series of recitals included a debut recital by the Elmhirst Ensemble, whose aim is to rescue neglected works by British composers of the present century. Pride of place on last Monday was given to Constant Lambert's Concerto for piano and an instrumental ensemble written in the early 1930s. That work's sunny indolence can be recognised at the opening of the Concerto's first movement ('Overture') but the mood soon darkens. The period of composition was marred for Lambert by the deaths of his father and of two close friends, the painter Cristopher Wood and the composer 'Peter Warlock'. The jazz Lambert sound is soured. The last movement, a loving elegy, almost suggests that Duke Ellington's Mood Indigo has been transformed into a funeral march. Ian Munro was the persuasive soloist. He and his colleagues must see to it that the Concerto is restored to the repertory, where it rightly belongs. Walton's Facade in the original version with speakers - Linda Hirst and Thomas Hemsley - was, I understand, the group's first attempt at this popular extravaganza. well It cannot, I fear, be called a total success. The amplification too often distorted the speakers voices (they deserved a kinder fate), balance favoured the instruments. The conductor, Stephen Dummer, will surely persuade the players that in Facade at least they are accompanists, not competing soloists. Dynamics throughout were ferocious.</p>

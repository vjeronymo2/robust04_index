			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPEC PRESIDENT CALLS FOR SLASH IN OIL PRODUCTION  </P> <P> The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries needs cut to oil production  by as much as 1.5 million barrels a day to help crude prices recover from their  recent slide, OPEC's president said Tuesday as cartel ministers arrived for an  emergency meeting.  </P> <P> The cartel's president, Algerian Oil Minister Sadek Boussena, called the  meeting for today to try to curb overproduction and boost prices that have  dropped by more than 20% since January.  </P> <P> At issue is whether OPEC should lower its official production ceiling or  alternatively cut its output, thus officially acknowledging violations of  individual member quotas.  </P> <P> Another issue is whether quota violators should bear the burden of any  reduction or whether all 13 members should contribute equally.  </P> <P> Analysts say violations by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates  have pushed OPEC output above the cartel's self-imposed ceiling of 22.1 million  barrels a day for the first six months of the year.  </P> <P> On arriving in Geneva, Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim Chalabi said OPEC's  daily output currently was between 23.7 million barrels and 24 million barrels.  </P> <P> Overproduction has caused a glut during a time of seasonally slackening demand  in the second quarter. That has depressed prices well below OPEC's minimum  reference price of $18 a barrel.  </P> <P> The average price of seven crudes monitored by OPEC stood at $15.37 per  42-gallon barrel last week.  </P> <P> North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded international crude oil, fetched  a spot price of $16.45 a barrel late Tuesday in London, unchanged from late  Monday.  </P> <P> The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,  settled at $18.81 a barrel Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The  near-month contract traded at more than $24 in late January.  </P> <P> Boussena said: "The single target is clear, how to eliminate the surpluses  existing in the market in order to allow a price recovery. It is a single  target, and I'm certainly hopeful we can achieve that target."  </P> <P> Asked how much output needed to be cut, he responded: "It certainly is  something between 1 (million) and 1 1/2 million barrels a day." When asked if  such a cut would come from current production, he replied affirmatively.  </P></p>

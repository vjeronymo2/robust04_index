			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANCER NOW THE LEADING KILLER OF MIDDLE-AGED, STUDIES SHOW  </P> <P> Cancer has overtaken heart disease as the leading killer of middle-aged  Americans, researchers reported Tuesday.  </P> <P> They reported also that the overall death rate among Americans fell 35.6%  between 1950 and 1986.  </P> <P> "It is evident that the patterns of . . . mortality in the United States are  changing," the Southern Illinois School of Medicine researchers wrote in the  Journal of the American Medical Assn.  </P> <P> The studies analyzed death rate data from the National Center for Health  Statistics from 1950 through 1986 in relation to six illnesses that are or have  been the most frequent causes of death.  </P> <P> The drop in the overall death rate was due to fewer deaths from important  killers such as injuries, childbirth complications, flu and pneumonia, the  researchers said.  </P> <P> For those 35 to 64, cancer has "now overtaken heart disease as the leading  cause of death," the researchers said.  </P> <P> Heart disease is currently the leading cause of death among people 65 and older  and accounts for nearly half of all deaths among those 85 and older, the  researchers said.  </P> <P> "Almost 20% of our population dies after age 85, and, if present trends  continue, within the next 10 or 20 years almost half of all deaths will occur  after age 80," they said.  </P></p>

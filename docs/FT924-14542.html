			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: Share deals may explain Ciments loss THE off-balance-sheet losses suffered by Ciments Francais of France, the French cement maker being taken over by Italy's Italcementi group, are thought to have stemmed from agreements to repurchase shares in the company's foreign subsidiaries. Details are not available about the size, timing, or location of the transactions. However, they are believed to have taken place after the French group's recent international expansion. On Wednesday, Ciments Francais admitted to losses on off-balance sheet financial dealing. Mr Pierre Conso resigned as chairman following an emergency board meeting. Italcementi announced the surprise acquisition of a 34 per cent stake in Ciments Francais last April, in a deal lauded in Italy after a string of unsuccessful big cross-border takeover attempts by other Italian groups. However, while investors welcomed the continuing international expansion of Italcementi, many were unhappy about the terms of a linked rights and convertible bond issue to finance the transaction, while a share placing by Ciments Francais in July was poorly received in the French market. The transactions, thought to have been known to a very limited group of managers, involved selling shares in mostly foreign subsidiaries for cash, subject to an agreement to repurchase them later. The arrangements were made with a variety of third parties, including banks. Financial transactions kept off a company's balance sheet and regularly rolled-over have been used as a means of hiding losses in the hope of plugging the gap later. Ciments Francais, which is the subject of a 'due diligence' examination by KPMG, the international accounting and consulting group employed by Italcementi, is believed to have used both the cash and interest from the repurchase arrangements. The French group is reviewing its accounts for the first half of the year following disclosure of the losses. Having expected to publish its interim results almost two weeks ago, it will not now release official first half figures until next month at the earliest. The board is expected to examine outline results when it meets later this month. Ciments Francais shares yesterday fell sharply on the Paris stock market when they returned to trading after being suspended on Wednesday. World stock markets, Page 41</p>

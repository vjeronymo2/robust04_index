			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Argus Newspapers - Other companies Argus Newspapers, the new company holding the publishing interests of South Africa's Argus group, is due to list on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange today. With the listing, Mr Tony O'Reilly's Dublin-based Independent Newspapers group will become the largest shareholder in the group. Although the share had been tipped for a strong opening - its pre-listing statement, forecasting earnings of 72 cents a share for the next financial year up from a pro-forma 64 cents in the year to March, was well received by the market - its prospects have been overshadowed by a wage dispute with journalists in the group's newspapers. Although a threatened strike by the two major press unions appears to have been averted pending the outcome of mediation on Tuesday, pickets are still planned outside the stock exchange this morning, and the continued threat of industrial action is likely to deter several prospective purchasers.</p>

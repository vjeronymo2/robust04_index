			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Esteemed listeners, at this moment we  have Ejup Ganic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency and  vice president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, on the  line. Mr Ganic, please inform our listeners about [words  indistinct] the negotiations in Geneva:    [Ganic] The negotiations yesterday lasted late into the  night. (?This morning they) resumed at 1100 and at this moment  -- it is approximately 1500 -- we are still here in the UN  building. (?The UN) team, which is lead by Yasushi Akashi, came  out with (?an entirely new) proposal by which [words  indistinct]. This is a sort of proposal that envisages [words  indistinct] sides. This is first. Second, it [words  indistinct] a plan to gather heavy arms and naturally a more  permanent cease-fire that would be a result of perhaps wider  talks and elaboration of the details that (?are accompanying)  the negotiations, which assumes [words indistinct] exchange of  prisoners and exchange of information about missing persons.  The UN Protection Force agrees to further supervise and monitor  the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, in brief this  is a UN proposal (?aimed at) halting military operations for the  period of one month, with the commencement of [word indistinct]  time.    We informed Mr. Akashi that as concerns us such a proposal  is  acceptable on the condition that it will not slow down the peace  process. As regards our side, that is, the state delegation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mr. Akashi is satisfied with our stance,  that is to say, [words indistinct] UN are satisfied with our  stance [words indistinct] (?formulated by UN). Therefore, this  involves [words indistinct] a month.</p>

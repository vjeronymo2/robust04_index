			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions CONTINUED uncertainty over France's referendum on the Maastricht treaty has kept the UK market nervous. With sterling only inches from its floor level in the ERM, share prices are likely to remain volatile over the next few weeks. But even these anxieties have failed to deter the more resolute directors from buying. Throughout 1991, insurance broking was sold heavily by many directors at a time when it was showing relative strength against other market sectors. The wisdom of those sales is only now becoming apparent as brokers donwgrade forecasts after some very disappointing results, notably the Sedgwick Group. Against this background Lord Pearson, chairman of PWS Holdings, picked up 277,500 shares at 32p. He also made a non-beneficial purchase of a further 75,000. Pearson remains by far the largest shareholder on the board, with just over 1.7m. PWS is due to report final results in January. When Charles Hambro, chairman of Guardian Royal Exchange, bought 50,000 shares at 128p in March this year, they rose promptly to 160p. Since then, however, they have fallen back again. Now, Sir Anthony Tennant, a non-executive director, has bought 25,000 at 131p. They were acquired on the same day as interim results were revealed showing losses before tax reduced to Pounds 39m from Pounds 88m the previous year. The improving trend owes much to GRE's strategy of raising premiums at the cost of volume.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              No of Company                     Sector    Shares    Value    directors  --------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- MacDonald Martin A           Brew     13,760      77          1 MacDonald Martin B           Brew      5,067      34          2 Plasmec                      EngG     75,000      64          1 Sainsbury J                  FdRe     23,696     106          1*  --------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Aerospace Eng                EngG    174,229      18          5 African Lakes                BuSe     29,242      11          2 Argos                        Stor      5,000      10          1 Asda Group                   FdRe     40,212      10          1 Boots                        Stor      2,168      10          1 French Connection            Stor     75,000      16          2 Great Portland               Prop     15,000      16          1 Guardian Royal Exch          InsC     25,000      33          1 Hazlewood Foods              FdMa     30,000      33          1 Lister                       Text    100,000      20          1 Low (Wm)                     FdRe     15,000      27          1 McAlpine Alfred               C&amp;C     12,500      13          1 Molynx                       Elec     35,000      13          1 NSM                           C&amp;C    100,000      20          1 PWS Holdings                 InsB    282,500      90          2 Royal Bank of Scot           Bank     10,000      15          1 Southend Property            Prop     25,000      10          1 Transatlantic A prf          InsL     19,200      55          1  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

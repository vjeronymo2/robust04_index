			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Surfing across the screen Broadcasters around the world are starting to take notice when two rather technical words are mentioned - 'digital compression'. They refer to techniques dating from the 1970s by which the 400,000 or so individual elements in a single frame of a television picture are turned into digital form and broadcast to the viewer. What will soon be on offer is nothing less than an entertainment revolution. British viewers who have scarcely had time to get used to the 20 or 30 channels now available on cable and satellite, in place of the conventional handful of national broadcasting choices, may soon have to start contemplating the possibility of several hundred television channels coming into their homes from all over the world. Experts at this week's Financial Times Cable and Satellite conference seemed in agreement that 180-channel systems using digital technology are now no more than two years away. The changes about to hit the small screen are so significant that new words are being coined to cope with the concepts: for example, 'grazing', the term used to cover the behaviour of viewers dipping into and sampling a wide range of channels, is giving way to 'surfing' a word describing the likely behaviour of viewers skimming gracefully over the surface of an endless choice. To Goldman Sachs, the US merchant bank, the merging of sound, pictures and computers in digital form is creating a new 'Communicopia'. No one can forecast precisely how many channels will prove to be commercially viable. But Mr Celso Azevedo, technical director of Societe Europeenne des Satellites, the Luxembourg-based company which runs the Astra satellite system, promised at the conference that the option of 180 channels would be available by 1995. Another satellite with a further 180 channels was being considered by Astra, he said. Using digital compression, 10 channels could be squeezed into the space now occupied by one, said Mr Azevedo. Microchip technology makes this possible. With pictures arriving on the screen at the rate of 25 a second, each frame is not very different from its predecessor. An individual frame is held in the microchip memory and only the differences between one frame and the next are identified and transmitted. This means a huge saving in channel capacity. However, there is a trade-off between the number of channels and the quality of the picture: if viewers want higher-quality pictures, or wide-screen television, it will mean fewer channels. Digital compression is not just being considered in Europe. In Asia, the Hong Kong-based Star Television satellite company currently broadcasts five channels of television, including BBC World Service Television, to 38 Asian countries. It is considering moving to 180 channels by 1995. In the US, Hughes Communications plans to launch a 150-channel system next year using digital compression. But why should anyone want 180 or even 360 channels? The driving force is coming from movies on demand. Pay Dollars 5 and see a hit movie now - or almost now. Compression will dramatically cut the cost of satellite transmission and make it possible to devote six channels to showing the same film. Because of staggered starts, viewers will rarely be more than 20 minutes away from watching the film of their choice. With more than 15 years' experience of pay-per-view movies on conventional cable systems, Mr Edward Bleier, a senior Time Warner executive, can offer straightforward advice on how to make the business a success. 'Concentrate on the hits. Like theatres, video stores, airline terminal book racks, almost all the business is in the hits,' said Mr Bleier. The new pay-per-view for 'hit' movies, which could over the longer term undermine the video store, will help to bankroll a wide range of low-cost existing entertainment channels from the US, and programmes for ethnic minorities or special interest groups. At the moment it costs about Pounds 4m to lease a satellite transponder which receives a single channel from earth and beams it back again. Divide that channel distribution cost by 10 and suddenly a lot of things become possible. Already, there is no shortage of people interested in using digital compression to provide happy surfing in a new Communicopia.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Brussels, Feb 6 (AFP) -- The European  Community, goaded by the weekend shelling massacre in Sarajevo,  is under increasing pressure to back military intervention in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, several EC countries have indicated.    The strongest European reaction to Saturday's shelling of a  market in the Bosnian capital which killed at least 66 people  came from Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes.    Speaking ahead of a meeting of EC foreign ministers here on  Monday [7 February], he called on the United Nations to  authorise air strikes on Serb batteries around Sarajevo.    In Germany, the government said "the use of targeted  military  action, as NATO proposed to the UN on August 9, should no longer  be ruled out."    At the time, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which  includes most EC countries, proposed mounting air strikes to  prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo, which is surrounded by  Bosnian Serb forces. But although the organisation has often  repeated its readiness to use air strikes, if it got a UN  go-ahead, the threat has not been implemented.    The French Government called for a clear plan of action from  the UN and NATO to end the siege of Sarajevo, including the  possible use of air strikes.    German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, for his part,  condemned  the attack as a "barbaric act of violence" Sunday adding that  the Bosnian people's "misery and suffering must end."    Military intervention has been resisted by Russia and  Greece,  which have generally pro-Serb sympathies.    Opposition to air strikes has also come from countries with  large military contingents backing UN aid missions in Bosnia,  particularly Britain, which fear reprisal attacks on their  forces.    Diplomats predicted that the mounting bloodshed in the  Bosnian civil war, and the EC's impotence to stop it, would fuel  a drive at Monday's meeting not only for military intervention  but also for a rethink of EC policy. [passage omitted]    Claes said ahead of Saturday's massacre that a greater U.S.  role was necessary in Bosnia, particularly to reassure the  Moslems that a peace agreement would stick, and to press the  Serbs and Croats into accepting it.    Another EC official said: "It seems clear the Moslems are  raising the stakes and that all parties (Serbs, Croats and  Moslems) seem completely confident they have more to gain from  fighting than from negotiating."    A spokesman for the EC's Greek presidency said on Friday  that  the Community was sticking to its peace proposals for the  three-way division of Bosnia into Serb, Croat and Moslem  republics. "We believe it is a good plan which can still work,"  he said, adding that Monday's meeting would include a "general  review, an open debate" on Bosnia. [passage omitted]    Some EC countries, notably France, have criticised U.S.  reluctance to get involved in the Bosnian civil war since the  Europeans rejected U.S. proposals last year to arm the Bosnian  Moslems and launch air strikes against the Serbs.    But the chief of the French Armed Forces Admiral Jacques  Lanxade on Sunday warned against "simplistic ideas like a  military intervention against the Serbs or a lifting of the arms  embargo."</p>

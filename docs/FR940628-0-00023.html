An analysis of the comments and the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows. Substantive issues and significant technical changes are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Numerous comments were received to the effect that the proposed regulations did not reflect OBRA or the 1993 Technical Amendments changes and suggested that the Secretary publish a revised notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) indicating which sections were superseded by subsequent changes in law. Other than those provisions that are self-implementing and are reflected in this package, the Secretary will issue regulations to implement most substantive provisions from OBRA and the 1993 Technical Amendments in a separate rulemaking package.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also notes that technical corrections to the regulations governing the FFEL Program were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 17, 1994 (59 FR 25750). Some comments made on the NPRM are addressed by those corrections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.100&blank;The Federal Family Education Loan Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 682.100(a)(2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters suggested that the regulations be revised to reflect the elimination of the SLS program by OBRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As the commenters noted, OBRA amended the HEA to end the SLS program effective July 1, 1994. However, the Secretary does not agree with the commenters that references to that program should be removed from these regulations. SLS loans will remain outstanding for many years after the program ends and the regulations need to reflect the requirements relating to those loans. However, the Secretary revises the regulations to make reference to the SLS program as in effect prior to July 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations have been revised to refer to the SLS Program as in effect prior to July 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.100(a)(4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters suggested that the Secretary delete the reference to parent PLUS loans made on or after October 17, 1986 because the statutory use of this term was ended by the 1993 Technical Amendments. The commenters also suggested that the reference to a requirement that a borrower must consolidate at least $7500 in eligible student loans in the Consolidation Loan Program be deleted to reflect the elimination of this requirement by OBRA. The commenters noted that this change needs to be reflected in other sections of the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary agrees that it is appropriate to reflect these statutory changes. The reference to parent PLUS loans made on or after October 17, 1986 was deleted in the technical corrections package.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations have been revised to reflect the commenters' recommendations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.102&blank;Obtaining and Repaying a Loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 682.102(e)(1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter suggested that the regulations imply that all FFEL debt is forgiven for borrowers in certain areas of teaching or nursing professions or community service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary agrees that the regulations could be interpreted to indicate that the borrower's entire obligation to repay a debt may be forgiven for borrowers performing certain public service. However, section 428J of the HEA only authorizes the Secretary to repay limited portions of certain Federal Stafford loan obligations for individuals who enter certain specified teaching and nursing professions or perform certain other national and community service. Moreover, the loan forgiveness program is a demonstration program which is not currently funded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, based on the plain language of the statute, a clear reading of the legislative history, and mindful of relevant Court opinions on the application of the BIA provision of the statute, the Department must reject Krupp's interpretation as contrary to all three. We conclude, therefore, that there is no legal basis which would prevent the Department from using petition information for purposes of the final results of the administrative review in question. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 4:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Krupp also claims that the Department's use of information submitted in support of the petition as BIA for this administrative review is an unprecedented departure from Department practice. Krupp contends that the Department has clearly and repeatedly stated that its policy is to use as BIA the higher of the highest rate for any firm: in the current review; a previous review; or the final LTFV determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Krupp notes that in Replacement Parts for Self-Propelled Bituminous Paving Equipment From Canada; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 56 FR 47451 (September 19, 1991) (Canadian Paving Equipment), the Department discussed that in the preliminary results of review that it had the authority to consider petition information as BIA. However, the Department rejected the petition information for purposes of BIA in the final results of review, despite the respondent's repeated failure to respond to the Department's requests for information. Citing industrial Belts and Components and Parts Thereof, Whether Cured or Uncured, From the Federal Republic of Germany; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 56 FR 2500 (January 23, 1991) (German Belts), Krupp contends that the Department's statement that it preliminarily used a rate from the petition as BIA is misleading, because the rate used is actually the margin from the final determination of the fair value investigation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : As we stated in Canadian Paving Parts, ``because each investigation and administrative review present the Department with a unique set of facts and circumstances, the Department often must select an appropriate unique BIA rate to achieve the purpose'' of the statute.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . at 47453. See also Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review; Steel Jacks from Canada, 52 FR 32957 (Sept. 1, 1987) (``Selection of the best information is made on a case-by-case basis.''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Canadian Paving Parts we selected a less adverse BIA for the final results of review rather than a higher rate based on information submitted in support of the petition because the respondent had made several attempts to cooperate with our requests. However, the only reason the Department decided not to use the petition-based rate for the final results of the review was because the respondent made some attempt to cooperate, not because the Department determined it was legally precluded from doing so. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contrary to Krupp's assertions, the Department has used petition-based rates as BIA in numerous administrative reviews. For example, in the administrative review of Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from Germany, 56 FR 31692 (July 11, 1991) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> AFBs <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), we applied the most adverse BIA to companies who refused to respond to the Department's questionnaire or otherwise significantly impeded the conduct of the administrative review. While the notice of final results indicated that the rate used as BIA was the highest rate from the final determination of sales at LTFV, the final LTFV determination notice clearly stated that the information used as BIA for that determination had been submitted in support of the petition. Also, in Cellular Mobile Telephones and Subassemblies from Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 54 FR 48011 (Nov. 20, 1989) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> CMTs <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and in Industrial Belts and Components and Parts Thereof, Whether Cured or Uncured, From the Federal Republic of Germany; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 56 FR 9673 (Mar. 7, 1991) (German Belts), we used, as BIA, margins from the final LTFV determinations, which were based on information submitted in support of the original petitions. See CMTs final LTFV determination, 50 FR 45447 (Oct. 31, 1985), and German Belts final LTFV determination, 54 FR 15505 (Apr. 18, 1989), respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 5:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Citing Rhone Poulenc, where the Court found that it is an acceptable interpretation of the best information statute that the Department can presume that the highest prior margin is the most probative of current margins in BIA situations, Krupp asserts that the Department may only consider prior margins for purposes of BIA. Krupp argues that, because the petition-based BIA preliminary determination rate was superseded by a final calculated determination rate in the LTVF investigation, the preliminary LTFV rate ``is not a prior margin'' and thus may not be used as BIA for the final results of this administrative review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

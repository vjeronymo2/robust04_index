			<p>BFN     [Text] On 28 April, the provincial government held a  provincial televised conference on financial and tax work to  comprehensively implement and accurately understand the new  financial and tax system, to support enterprise production, to  promote economic development, to safeguard social stability, and  to comprehensively fulfill the 1994 financial and tax revenue  tasks. The conference reported on the situation emerged since  the implementation of the new financial and tax system, set  forth some policies and methods for solving some specific  problems, and studied and arranged the next-step financial and  tax work. Liu Xilin, vice governor of the provincial  government, made an important speech.    On the provincial economic situation, Liu Xilin pointed out:  Since the beginning of this year, according to the requirements  and arrangements of the party Central Committee and the State  Council, our province has grasped favorable opportunities,  deepened reform, expanded the scale of opening up, promoted  development, maintained stability, and continued to promote the  development of the national economy on the basis of the faster  economic growth rate of last year. A good rural economic  situation rarely seen before has emerged. The investment scale  is controlled strictly within the plan. The construction of key  projects is further strengthened. The scale of opening up has  ceaselessly been expanded. Noticeable progress has been made in  inviting businessmen, bringing in foreign capital, and  developing foreign export trade. Revenues have been increased.  The credit scale has been expanded. The financial situation is  stable. However, worries still exist. The industrial  production growth rate was changed from the faster development  in 1993 to a slow speed in the first quarter of this year.  Thus, great difficulties have been added on enterprises,  enterprises' economic results tend to decline, and the burdens  on price hikes are rather high.    On the issue of how to treat the new situation and new  problems cropping up since the implementation of the new  financial and tax system, Liu Xilin pointed out: The general  situation over the past four months has been good since the  implementation of the new financial and tax system. No bigger  fluctuation has been created by the reform of the tax system.  The increase in the revenues has been maintained. Affected by  the fact that the implementation of the new financial and tax  system is related to the readjustment of the interests of  various fronts as well as an all-round and integrated structural  reform, it is unavoidable that different trades, enterprises,  and products have different burdens and different changes.  Besides, the new tax system should embody equal tax burdens and  the state industrial policy requirements to promote equal  competition. Some enterprises that used to rely on the  protections of tax reductions and profit concessions for  development will lose their preferential conditions.  Simultaneously, the industries that should be readjusted  according to the state industrial policies and the enterprises  with unreasonable economic scales, poor quality, and high  production costs will naturally come across serious challenges  and difficulties. We must be sober-headed to treat the problems  in this regard. We should also understand that problems of this  or that kind still exist in course of implementing the new  system due to the fact that the new system is being replaced by  the old one. Some large and medium-sized enterprises' tax  burdens rise by a big margin. Meanwhile, with the strain on  capital, the decline in economic results, and the changes in  markets, enterprises actually have great difficulties. Both the  state and the province have paid full attention to this and have  studied or are studying measures to solve the problems in this  aspect.    Liu Xilin particularly pointed out: Although the financial  and tax revenues have kept on increasing since the  implementation of the new financial and tax system, the  situation in the implementation of the new situation is not  ideal enough. The revenues in the first quarter of this year  increased by 10.5 percent over the same period of last year and  accounted for 15.7 percent of the annual plan. The industrial  and commercial tax revenues in this period increased by 3.4  percent and accounted for 14.3 percent of the annual plan. The  financial and tax situation is comparatively grim. This aspect  is related to the current economic situation. Simultaneously,  the people have prejudice against the new financial and tax  system. A very important content of the new system is to  guarantee the 1993 vested financial resources of the localities.  Although the consumption taxes belong to the central revenues  and the value added taxes are divided between the central  financial department and the localities, the central financial  department do not obtain the portions covered in the base  figures of consumption taxes and value added taxes. That is,  the portions covered in the base figures will totally be  obtained by the localities. If the localities do not reach the  1993 levels this year, the state should reduce the 1993 base  figures. In this way, both the balance between this year's  revenues and expenditures and the development of the province as  a whole and all cities and counties will be affected. It is  extremely wrong that we continue to follow the habitual methods  of putting the collection of the local fixed revenues before  that of value added taxes, as stipulated in the previous old  system. This must be changed. The governments at various  levels, all departments concerned, and enterprises should seek  unity of thinking, comprehensively implement the new financial  and tax system, realistically strengthen the collection and  management of tax revenues, try every possible means to support  production, specifically carry out the system for responsibility  for fulfillment of fixed work, and ensure a balance between this  year's revenues and expenditures.    The provincial government urged that the financial and tax  departments at various levels should foster the idea of  supporting production and positively promote increases in  production and revenues. Particularly in the course of  reforming the financial and tax system, we should realistically  strengthen the coordinate service for enterprises, help  enterprise resolve practical difficulties, timely implement the  state financial and tax preferential policies, and study ways  for solving some specific problems. The financial departments  at various levels should mainly concentrate turnover funds on  the current industrial production. The tax departments should  find out ways to reduce burdens for the enterprises with special  difficulties according to the "tax law" and timely report to  higher levels the problems that cannot be solved by themselves.  According to some state tax policies and in line with the  provincial specific situation, the conference defined 13  specific policy measures for supporting the development of  enterprises.</p>

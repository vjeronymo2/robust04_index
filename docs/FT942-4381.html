			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Congress moves on healthcare The US Congress has at last started to make some procedural progress in its efforts to draft healthcare legislation, but consensus on how to reform the system is as far away as ever. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the Senate finance committee, yesterday presented his committee members with a proposal closely modelled on President Bill Clinton's reform plan, while the House of Representatives ways and means committee, which handles tax issues, is expected to start next week on line-by-line consideration of a bill proposed by its new chairman, Congressman Sam Gibbons of Florida. The Senate labour committee, chaired by Senator Ted Kennedy, was meanwhile expected by last night to become the first of the five big congressional committees with jurisdiction over healthcare to complete its work on a bill that also bears a close resemblance to the Clinton plan. Even their proponents do not suggest that any of these versions is close to being the sort of magic compromise that could pass both the House and the Senate. 'The important thing is that the main committees get bills marked up, then we can slug it out on the floor,' an administration official said. Mr Kennedy has achieved some progress, winning unanimous votes on a handful of measures that could form part of the final bill. On most measures, however, his committee, regarded as more left-wing than the Senate as a whole, has split along party lines. The only Republican to vote consistently with the Democrats was Senator James Jeffords of Vermont, who is generally far more left-wing than most centrist Democrats. Mr Moynihan, meanwhile, has failed after weeks of negotiations to come up with the Republican support that he has said is essential for the passage of healthcare reform. His proposal broadly follows the Clinton plan, including the requirement that employers pay 80 per cent of the cost of health insurance for their employees. But congressional healthcare experts said yesterday that Mr Moynihan's purpose was to prove to the White House that its scheme is truly dead, by demonstrating how little support it gets in his committee. Other centrist senators are working on proposals aimed at finessing the controversial employer mandate while still reaching universal coverage. Among these ideas is a 'hard trigger', in which the employer mandate would only come into effect if, after a specified number of years, market reforms in a voluntary system have not resulted in 85 per cent of currently uninsured workers obtaining coverage.</p>

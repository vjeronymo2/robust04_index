			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 15 February, a meeting was held at 1100 local  time [1000 GMT] at the Independence Square in Minsk, attended by  7,000-8,000 people. Representatives of the Belarusian Popular  Front [BNF] and the Belarusian Strike Committee Council spoke to  the participants. BNF Chairman Zyanon Paznyak appealed to the  workers to continue the strike, which in his opinion is the only  way to achieve early legislative elections and bring about the  government's resignation. Syarhey Antonchyk, Strike Committee  Council deputy chairman, pointed out that pressure was exerted  on the organizers of the strike. Many enterprises, including  the Minsk motor vehicle plant, announced 15 February a day off.  The participants in the meeting demanded that the government  led by Vyacheslav Kebich be dissolved by 22 February, and new  elections to the Supreme Council be called. After the meeting,  the strikers marched along Skaryna prospect to the Supreme  Soviet building. The building was surrounded by metal barriers  and a line of militiamen, so the meeting was held in front of  the right entrance facing Engels street. While amplifiers and  loudspeakers were being installed, the strikers were shouting:  "Resignation! Resignation!"    The meeting near the Supreme Soviet was opened by Syarhey  Antonchyk, after which the floor was given to Minsk City Soviet  Deputy Anatol Hurynovych, Supreme Soviet Deputies Yawhen  Tsumaraw, Zyanon Paznyak, and Syarhey Navumchyk, as well as to  intellectuals, students, and workers. The speakers bitterly  criticized the activities of the legislature and the government  which "having led the nation to complete poverty are continuing  to sell Belarus."    Syarhey Antonchyk called on the people to help appoint  former  Interior Minister Uladzimir Yahoraw to the same post in the new  Council of Ministers. The participants reiterated their  demands: The resignation of the Kebich government, the  formation of a provisional government of people's trust, early  elections in March 1994, and granting strike committees 15  minutes of broadcast time every night after the Panorama  newscast [1900 GMT]. The Supreme Soviet has been given until  1200 on 22 February to discuss these demands.    After reading their demands, the demonstrators started to  exclaim: "We want Hryb," because they expected that the Supreme  Soviet chairman would come out of the building to receive the  petition. After Mechyslaw Hryb failed to show up, a delegation  was formed to hand the petition to him. The delegation  represented by People's Deputies Syarhey Navumchyk and Aleh  Papkow and Belarusian Strike Committee members Mikalay Zimin and  Alyaksandr Lysenka entered the building and handed the petition  over to Mechyslaw Hryb. According to Syarhey Navumchyk, "we  received no concrete answer, but Hryb pointed out that the main  thing to be done for Belarus now is the adoption of the state  [word indistinct]. Asked about his attitude toward the  government's resignation Hryb said that he could do nothing  about it. I understood that the Supreme Soviet chairman was  dumbfounded."    At 1340 the meeting at the Supreme Council finished. There  were no incidents involving either the militia or the strikers.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Shanyuk, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA reviewer: </F> "Russian GAZPROM Shackling Terms for Ukraine: Landyk Team  Transfers Pipeline Control to Russia and Undermines Ukrainian  Independence"]    [Text] A year ago the president of Armenia, Levon  Ter-Petrosyan, paid for Turkmen natural gas with diamonds air  delivered to Ashkhabad, and not with Russian rubles or other  freely-convertible currency. Ukraine is as dependent as some  other CIS countries on Moscow for energy. However, unlike  Armenia, our payments were not in diamonds or gold, but in  sugar, meat, our fleet, nuclear weapons and, now, by renting out  our territory. On top of that, our former premiers and  vice-premiers responsible for this state of affairs pose as  Ukraine's saviors. For example, Fokin claimed to have secured a  direct source of gasoline after visiting the Tyumen oil fields,  a promise that turned out to be as ephemeral as Fokin himself.  Yuliy Yoffe also disappeared after promising rivers of Iranian  oil, and is now working in the USA. Leonid Kuchma did not let a  day pass by without talking about Russian altruism. What that  meant was that Chernomyrdin gave Ukraine a drop of gasoline as a  birthday present for Kuchma! After the drop, agriculture and  transportation came to a standstill and power stations were  starving for fuel. Water transport suffered and the economic  solutions advocated by Kuchma brought Ukraine into subservience  to its northern neighbor.    Now the Russian energy monopolists have developed an  unquenchable appetite for Ukrainian pipelines, and ordered a  so-called Ukrainian government delegation to Moscow. `Ukrainian'  in name only since Vice-Premier Landyk, who headed the  delegation, recognizes only Russian as the official state  language. The personages accompanying him, and who were also  disinterested in Ukrainian national interests, were as follows:    Mykhaylo Kovalko, Director, Derzhkamnafthaz;    Valentyn Kolomiyev, Director General, UKRHAZPROM; Volodymyr  Novytskyy, First Deputy-Minister of Industry;    Anatoliy Volkovskyy, First Deputy-Head of Derzhpromresursy;  and    Viktor Hladush, Deputy Minister of External Economic  Relations; as well as an entire cohort of lower-ranking  ministerial minions.    The Russian side, represented by Rem Vyakhirev's  stock-company GAZPROM, immediately went on the attack! They  demanded that Ukraine pay its energy debts within a month or  fuel deliveries would stop. True, they made a concession and  allowed last year's debt to be paid in cash and industrial  goods. But this year's debt, they insisted out of sheer  friendship, has to be paid in either Russian rubles or American  dollars. Furthermore, beginning with April 1st deliveries will  depend on prepayments and the Ukrainian industry was accused of  `stealing' Russian gas from the pipelines.    The first attack was immediately followed by another:  Vyakhirev demanded that Ukraine immediately turn over its  pipelines, refineries and other fuel supply facilities in  Western Ukraine, as well as port facilities in Odessa and  Illichiv to GAZPROM and that Russians have exclusive control.  Those are conditions for "taking pity" and agreeing not only to  resume gas deliveries in full but also to make up for 80 percent  of the lost Turkmen deliveries. Even Rem Vyakhirev gloated  before Moscow journalists that "This agreement is not to  Ukraine's advantage!"    The Landyk team was shown to be completely ineffective; the  only remaining unresolved issue is who is to have the final  control over the Ukrainian fuel supply network. However, one  doesn't have to be a politician to realize that our northern  neighbor, pretending to make concessions, continues to press his  own interests.    Ukraine and the other `near abroad' countries are of vital  importance to the Russian gas interests. It is through Ukrainian  territory that Russia exports 90 percent of its gas to Western  Europe at a considerable profit. Russia cannot enter the  European market without Ukraine, although plans are being made  to go through Belarus and Poland. But that will cost a lot and  GAZPROM doesn't have the resources. Even so deliveries to  Bulgaria and Turkey will have to go through Ukrainian pipelines.    Can you image the hue and cry in Moscow if the Khokhols  [derogatory Russian term for Ukrainians] suddenly emulated the  so-called older brother's power play by demanding remuneration  for transit rights in hard currency? This is not something that  I advocate, but in an extreme situation it might become  necessary if we are forced to it. What prevented the Ukrainian  emissaries from responding in kind to this type of one-sided  pressure? Surely we have the right to look after our own  interests. Unfortunately, Landyk gave in and agreed to joint  oversight over Ukrainian pipelines, and wherever you have two  bosses you are going to have problems.    At present we have neither the dollars nor the rubles to pay  Russia for energy. But that does not mean that we have to sell  our territorial rights. Our debts could be covered by a rational  economic reforms but for the failure of our present and past  governments to act in a responsible manner.    The second round of negotiations will take place in Moscow  on  April 10. Russia won't back off and will continue to demand a  controlling block of shares. Belarus is already on her knees for  the 21 billion cubic meters of gas that GAZPROM promised to  provide for a 51 percent share in the BILORUSTRANSHAZ concern.  Ukraine needs almost five times as much gas, and this need is  playing into Russia's hands.    How do our specialists feel about Landyk's position?    Taday Mykhalevych, chairman of the Joint Dispatching  Administration of UKRHAZPROM, has stated that "We cannot give  Russia Ukrainian pipelines on the basis of a forced, one-sided  agreement... Suppose we pay our present debts this way. Then  what of the future? Will we sell our remaining gas pipelines?"    Our officials should listen to Mr. Mykhalevych, who has  risen  through the ranks in UKRHAZPROM from an operator to chairman of  one of its main administrations. Mykhalevych suggests that  Russia cover some of the construction costs of the  Urengoy-Pomari-Uzhhorod pipeline. We could also help Russia  develop some of its resources in its northern regions, but all  of this would have to be on the basis of fair financial  arrangements. Today such financial arrangements cover the cost  of only 23 percent of the gas we need, and the rest has to be  financed from other sources. Last year we used over 100 billion  cubic meters of gas, a figure suggesting that there is  considerable room for greater efficiency.    This problem was previously addressed by academician Ihor  Yukhnovskyy who pointed out that gas use could be reduced by at  least 25 billion cubic meters. A more rational approach to  efficient utilization of our resources, exploratory efforts,  strict regulation and legal sanctions against wasteful practices  could improve our situation considerably. In addition, the best  exploratory equipment should be obtained from abroad in  combination with appropriate political and diplomatic  initiatives.    Unfortunately, the government generally relies on  administrative sanctions, and its efforts have been limited to  construction of a new, semiprivate terminal near Odessa.    Search for new gas fields is in disarray. Half of the  boreholes remain unused because of lack of special pipes, and  only three of 12 new gas fields scheduled for production this  year are being developed. Because of lack of funds geologists  have almost stopped exploratory projects. Exploitation of the  Sea of Azov and Black Sea shelves lies in the distant future.  The reserves of the available fields are too small and  production is too costly because the fields are too scattered.  On paper everything looks fine, but in practice the national  energy program has too many holes in it and Russia is using this  knowledge to her advantage.    What will our delegates do at the next meeting in Moscow? I  could get no answer despite making every attempt to get such  information from the ministries and departments that are  involved in these negotiations. Kovalko, the director of  Derzhkamnafthaz, on returning from Moscow immediately repaired  to Poltava for pre-election campaigning for a parliamentary  seat. Yevhen Sukhin, his first deputy, didn't have a minute to  spare for me for a telephone interview. Viktor Hladush, Deputy  Minister of External Economic Relations, was also conscientious  in avoiding me, and a fierce secretary blocked my access to  Valentyn Kolomiyev, Director General, UKRHAZPROM. Anatoliy  Volkovskyy, First Deputy-Head of Derzhpromresursy, escaped  through a side door. Their assistants -- heads of various  administrations and departments -- angrily rebuffed me with "We  will not give you any information! We have received no  instructions on this score; we don't know what course of action  we will take!"    So what are the conclusions? Basically, we see a repetition  of last year's story with the Black Sea fleet which Ukraine  agreed to give up to Russia and the current defense minister  finds it an acceptable solution. I am certain an analogous  outcome awaits the `gas talks' if Ukrainian interests are  betrayed. The pipelines should have only one owner! Russia is  demanding prepayments from us, and we should demand prepayments  from Russia for using our distribution networks.</p>

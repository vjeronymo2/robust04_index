			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend from BAe pleases SHARES in British Aerospace (BAe) rose sharply, brushing aside the announcement of Britain's largest ever corporate profits loss at just over Pounds 1.2bn, for the year to December 1992. The market had braced itself for the big loss from the UK's largest manufacturer but was cheered by a lack of black holes in the figures, and the higher than anticipated 4p dividend, against market expectations of a 3p final. There was strong demand for the stock and at the day's best, the shares were up 17 at 269p, before coming off the top to close 13 up at 265p, after UBS Phillips and Drew advised investors to switch out of BAe and into Rolls-Royce. Turnover was a hefty 9.7m. Analysts also put the decline down to a closer examination of the poor performance of the defence division. Once again there was speculation that GEC could be considering a bid for BAe, although this was largely disregarded by aerospace specialists. Mr Paul Ruddle at NatWest Securities said: 'This marks a turnaround for the group, and shows the management has got to grips with the problems.' He retained his current year forecast at Pounds 60m, putting him at the bottom of the range with brokers such as Hoare Govett, BAe's broker, said to be on Pounds 125m and Smith New Court reported to be predicting Pounds 150m. Analysts are due to have another meeting with the company tomorrow when further details about the trading outlook are expected to emerge. Shares in GEC eased 3 to 293p, while Rolls-Royce closed unchanged at 128p. Kwik Save strong Rumours continued to circulate around Kwik Save as the shares continued their upward climb, yesterday adding a further 14 to 842p on talk of an imminent bid from Dairy Farms. The shares' strength in recent weeks, in stark contrast to a weak food retail sector, has been underpinned by the continuing buying by the Hong Kong food group, which has taken its holding in Kwik Save from 26 per cent to over 28 per cent this year. Although Dairy Farms has always said it is a long-term passive investor in Kwik Save, excitement was generated early on yesterday following market talk in Hong Kong that Dairy Farms would make a big rights issue when it announces results on March 16. With only around 8 per cent gearing, the speculative implication was that the group was lining up a bid, with Kwik Save the obvious contender. However, such a move would break all agreements between the two groups. UK food analysts, largely dismissive of a Dairy Farms bid, suggested that the group may have been buying Kwik Save shares ahead of a possible rights issue from the UK group, the proceeds of which could be used to buy stores from Gateway. New bid seen There was almost universal support in the market for the necessity of an increased bid from Airtours if it is to succeed in capturing its larger rival Owners Abroad. The speculation followed the decision by the secretary of state for trade and industry not to refer the bid to the Office of Fair Trading. Mr Hamish Dickson at Hoare Govett forecast that Airtours would probably produce a cash incentive of around 17p on top of their current 113p a share all-paper offer. Hoare's is advising Owners investors to sit tight in expectation of a renewed offer, with Airtours a strong buy also. Smith New Court believes Airtours may not be so generous, with analyst Mr Bruce Jones suggesting an increased offer of 125p, with a possible cash alternative. Some speculative investors thought otherwise, with the Owners shares spurting to close 13 ahead at 129p in big turnover of nearly 9m. Airtours put on 5 to 302p. Suggestions that LTU, the German travel group which had planned a co-operative shareholding in Owners, might ride to the rescue did not find much support among analysts. ICI on alert On the eve of its results due today, ICI shares put on a late spurt as rumours abounded over the fate of the demerger and the threatened rights issue. Analysts declared themselves none the wiser, as the shares first languished on the belief that a Pounds 1bn cash call would be forthcoming today, and then spurted forward as wild talk suggested that Glaxo was putting together a bid for ICI's proposed bio-science division, Zeneca. ICI shares added 8 to 1082p. Glaxo slipped a penny to 652p. Bank shares continue to suffer from selling triggered by NatWest's poorly received figures released on Tuesday. NatWest lost 8 more to 435p while Barclays, the next high street bank to report, fell 3 1/2 to 424p. Hambros was the pick of the merchant banks, moving up 8 to 316p. Royal Insurance eased 2 to 285p in front of today's preliminary figures which are expected to show losses sharply reduced at around Pounds 120m, compared with last time's Pounds 373m loss. The main action in insurance, however, was in Guardian Royal (GRE) which ran up 6 to 186p amid stories that a buyer of 5m had been operating in the market; turnover of 9.3m in GRE was the highest single day's business since November last year. GRE is scheduled to report preliminary figures on March 3. A single big selling order of 1.2m shares at 559p unsettled General Accident, 6 off at 567p. Activity in the oil sector was concentrated on Shell and Royal Dutch. Dealers reported heavy switching operations, out of Royal Dutch and into Shell with the latter said to have been 8 to 8 1/2 per cent too cheap against the Dutch group. Shell closed a shade firmer at 582p following substantial turnover of 7.4m shares, ahead of today's preliminary figures. Building stocks tended to lose ground on a mixture of rights issue fears, broker sell recommendations and official statistics disclosing that UK construction orders fell 9 per cent in the last quarter of 1992. Yamaichi, the Japanese stockbroker, warned that 'there is strong evidence to expect another wave of rights issues from the sector, similar to that experienced in 1991 when 16 building sector companies raised a total of Pounds 1.2bn'. Mr Scott Fulton, Yamaichi's building analyst, pointed out that recovery hopes have seen the building materials and construction sectors outperform the FT-A All-Share index by 21.6 per cent and 33.2 per cent respectively since 'Black Wednesday'. Yamaichi pinpointed 'rights risks' on five companies due to announce results in the next two months; Amec, Mowlem, Persimmon, Taylor Woodrow and Wimpey. The building team at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken said 'we believe there are at least Pounds 1bn of fund raising in the pipeline.' Blue Circle Industries (BCI), a good market recently on renewed takeover speculation, fell 7 to 225p, after 220p, with Kleinwort Benson said to have reaffirmed its bearish stance. Several brokers have forecast a cut in BCI's 1993 payment. Fears that the OFT may launch an investigation into the activities of photocopier companies hurt several companies in the sector. Southern Business Group, tumbled 34 to 79p, while Gestetner fell 11 to 131p. A weighty tome on the UK property market from NatWest Securities found some room for optimism that the sector had begun clawing its way back. Analyst Mr Marc Gilbard added that there had been a significant shift in the market's perception of valuing property stocks with net asset value being replaced by dividend yield. NatWest is particularly keen on Land Securities off 2 at 482p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992/93 NEW HIGHS (126).

			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: TEAMMATES PIERCED BARKLEY'S DEFENSE  </P> <P> Charles Barkley, Mike Gminski and Rick Mahorn of the Philadelphia 76ers vowed  that if the club won 10 consecutive games, they would get their left ears  pierced.  </P> <P> The 76ers won 12 in a row before losing last week. Gminski and Mahorn kept  their vows and began wearing diamond-studded earrings; Barkley, the instigator  of the pact, held off.  </P> <P> "I said when I was ready to do it, I'd do it," Barkley said. "We made a pact,  and I'm going to stick to it. It's a permanent fixture."  </P> <P> Barkley finally kept his word Wednesday.  </P> <P> "I think once he saw Rick and I had done it, he finally succumbed to peer-group  pressure," Gminski said. "He was, like, back there making the snowballs and we  were throwing them, and so he had to finally step up to the plate."  </P> <P> Trivia time: On Feb. 17, 1954, who retired after 26 years as unbeaten world  champion in court tennis?  </P> <P> Thrill is gone: Mike Eruzione, whose goal lifted the U.S. team to a 4-3 upset  victory over the Soviet Union in the 1980 Winter Olympics, on the political  upheaval in the Eastern Bloc: "I'll be interested to see if the Eastern  European hockey players maintain their attitude. Before, their only escape was  to be a great athlete. Now their systems will be more like ours. I wonder if  they'll lose that edge. For one thing, the rivalry isn't going to be the same.  The Soviets aren't the bad guys any more."  </P> <P> Add hockey: Bob McCammon, coach of the Vancouver Canucks, on 200-pound-plus  Soviet left wing Vladimir Krutov: "His weight's down to its best level, but I  swear he's going to miss a flight one of these days chasing a hot dog."  </P> <P> Malpractice: Joe Fields, center for the New York Jets, on playing for Joe  Walton, hired Friday as offensive coordinator of the Pittsburgh Steelers: "He  inherited a healthy patient, a team that came within one game of the Super  Bowl. All we needed was a little exploratory surgery to get better, but Joe cut  everything up and killed the patient."  </P> <P> Last things first: John Thompson, Georgetown basketball coach, on  substitutions: "I have never felt it was a special honor to start. We are a  team of finishers, not a team of starters. We give a lot more credence to who  is in there at the end, not who is in there at the beginning."  </P> <P> Take it up the middle: Jud Heathcote, Michigan State basketball coach, on  George Perles being appointed to the dual role of Spartan football coach and  athletic director: "I just know he'll come down here and advise me to run more  than pass."  </P> <P> Saying a mouthful: Lance Blanks of the University of Texas basketball team,  denying he spit at a Texas Tech player: "(The other player) just took out his  mouthpiece to say something and slobbered all over himself."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Pierre Etchebaster.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Former NBA star Rick Barry, who has four basketball-playing sons:  "If my kids were horses, they'd be worth a million dollars because of their  breeding."

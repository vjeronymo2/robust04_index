			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD moved back towards a seven-year low on the London bullion market yesterday. Despite news of President Bush's decision to launch a military strike against Iraq, sentiment remains bearish. Comex gold futures were lower at midday, with New York traders pointing out that the yellow metal was continuing to lose its appeal as a safe haven during times of international turmoil. 'The market is much more scared of central bank selling and currency fluctuations than anything going on in the Middle East,' said one. COPPER prices ended a nervous LME session higher, with the market largely consolidating after Tuesday's massive declines, while ALUMINIUM also finished steadier. Dealers said the copper market seemed to pause amid confusion over its likely direction. Dips towards the Dollars 2,200 a tonne level for three-months delivery elicited buying support. In Chicago WHEAT futures were sustaining early gains in late trading, under the influence of the USDA's crop reports. Compiled from Reuters</p>

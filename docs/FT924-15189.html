			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Air France free to buy stake in Sabena THE European Commission yesterday cleared Air France, the French state airline, to take a 37.6 per cent stake in Sabena, its Belgian counterpart, provided that rival carriers are allowed to compete on certain monopoly or near-monopoly routes. The decision ends almost a year of delays for the companies, which announced they were ready to do a deal last September and signed an accord in April. It also lets the two airlines forge a cross-border partnership to strengthen their position in the European and world markets. Air France said the compromise was 'a balanced agreement'. The EC's merger control task force agreed terms for approval of the deal within a month - but that followed many weeks of tough negotiation about the legal basis for examining the deal and the anti-trust pledges made by the airlines and their governments. The pledges include: One of the two companies will have to withdraw from the Brussels-Nice and Brussels-Lyons routes to allow at least one rival airline into the market Rival EC carriers will be allowed to compete with the planned Air France-Sabena Brussels-to-Paris shuttle service Certain take-off and landing slots will be kept available for rival airlines at Brussels airport Air France and Sabena will have to abandon certain flights to Africa, if a competing airline will take on the routes. The Commission said it was 'very likely' that rival airlines would take up the available slots and routes. The EC has been worried by growing consolidation in the European airline industry, which risks undermining the Commission's promotion of competition through 'open skies'. Last year the Commission told Air France to sell its 35 per cent stake in the French regional carrier TAT after it took over UTA, the French long-haul carrier, and Air Inter, the French domestic airline. British Airways agreed last month to buy a 49 per cent stake in TAT to challenge Air France on its home ground. The loss-making Sabena said the Air France deal would help put it back on a firm financial footing. Air France and its Belgian financial partners have injected BFr6bn (Pounds 115m) of fresh capital in exchange for the stake.</p>

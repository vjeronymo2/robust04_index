			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: How to pay off a home loan HOW should you repay a mortgage? The answer pushed by the financial services industry over the last few years is that you should not repay it directly, but put money towards an investment as collateral. Over 25 years, you pay just the interest on the loan and repay the capital only at the end of that time. According to Adams RPI, 63.1 per cent of mortgages taken out last year were backed by an endowment, while 33.7 per cent were capital repayment. In 1988, the imbalance was even greater: 75.9 per cent against 21.3 per cent. The argument against capital repayment mortgages is that very little of the capital is repaid in the early years. Given that homeowners move house every six years on average, they may find that they have made little progress towards paying off the debt. With an endowment policy or other savings mechanism, you are always making progress towards that repayment date. Furthermore, to the extent that mortgage interest relief survives, it is more tax efficient to pay interest than to repay capital. However, this argument only makes sense if the savings scheme is maintained for the full 25 years. Sadly, this seems not to be the case. Most mortgage endowments are not maintained until maturity, meaning that penal surrender values are imposed on the borrower. If you need to reduce payments for any reason, repayment mortgages offer a simple method - you can just stop repaying capital for a while. With interest-only mortgages, it should be easy to stop contributing money to the savings vehicle. But you cannot stop paying premiums into an endowment without suffering a severe penalty. This inflexibility tips the balance decisively against endowments - not only are you taking a risk by not paying off the loan, you are also tying yourself to that course, come what may. Another option is the personal pension mortgage, where only interest is paid on the home loan and premiums are paid into a pension plan. The capital is repaid out of the cash-free sum you are granted on retirement. Personal pensions are the most tax-efficient investment vehicle for backing a mortgage, as all contributions are invested gross into an untaxed fund. But they are also the least flexible - you could find yourself spending most of your retirement cash on finally completing your house purchase, rather than investing it to provide greater freedom in retirement. More flexible collective investment vehicles, such as unit and investment trusts, allow you to stop payments without penalty. Top-rate taxpayers, in particular, can buy them very tax-efficiently through Peps (personal equity plans). But Pep mortgages accounted for only 0.1 per cent of last year's total. The safest option is capital repayment, particularly for those buying a home for life. Those who expect to move frequently and are prepared to take some care over their investments should get better value from an interest-only mortgage, linked to a Pep or investment trust savings scheme. As life assurance can be obtained separately at fairly low cost, there is little to be said in favour of the endowment mortgage.</p>

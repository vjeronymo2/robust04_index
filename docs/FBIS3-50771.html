Alarcon said this donation expresses the French people's  constant friendship and solidarity for the Cuban people.  [Alarcon] "In this solidarity we see an expression of the  friendship and support we are receiving from the French people  and workers. You have come to a country that is currently  facing very complex and difficult times. I hope you have had an  opportunity to see, first hand, something of what we are  experiencing."    The ANPP president also talked about the efforts made by the  Cuban people during 1993, the most difficult year since the  triumph of the Revolution, and the steps being taken to overcome  the crisis.    [Alarcon] "We are currently studying measures to be adopted  to improve our internal finances. These measures will also help  us confront a changing international situation, one that is  quite different from the situation that prevailed throughout the  past 30 years."    Alarcon also said that we are facing a situation similar to  the one confronted by practically all the countries of the Third  World and that a solution, based on our possibilities and goals,  must be sought.    [Alarcon] "This is why we have said that we are attempting  to  find solutions through socialism, and for socialism." [end  recording]    Alarcon met with the France - Cuba Solidarity Airlift at the  Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples.</p>

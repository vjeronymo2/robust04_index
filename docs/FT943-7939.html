			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Cost cuts and higher sales drive VW back to profit Volkswagen, Germany's biggest motor vehicle group, returned to profit in the second quarter, attributing the improvement to restructuring and higher sales. It made a DM133m (Dollars 84.7m) net profit in the quarter after a DM342m deficit in the first three months. As a result, the first-half loss was reduced to DM209m compared with DM1.6bn in the first six months of 1993, when the results were held back by huge rationalisation expenses. Forecasting a slow revival in demand and more benefits to come from cost-cutting, VW said yesterday it expected to break even for the full year. In 1993 as a whole, VW lost DM1.9bn. Analysts said the results were better than expected, and showed clear signs that savings on labour and material costs were now coming through. Mr Stephen Reitman at UBS in London said gross margins of 9.8 per cent in the first half were VW's best for three years. While production rose 3.9 per cent to 1.56m vehicles, operating expenses which include materials and labour costs increased only 2.7 per cent, he added. On performance so far, he expected a modest group profit for the full year, noting that official group forecasts had become much more cautious since last year's predicted advances failed to materialise. According to yesterday's report, the number of vehicles shipped to dealers rose 8.5 per cent to 1.6m in the first half, and deliveries to customers increased 7.8 per cent to 1.73m. Customer sales for the group in Germany fell 3.9 per cent, slightly reducing market share to 29 per cent. However, this was offset by a 7.5 per cent rise elsewhere in western Europe. This resulted in a 2 per cent overall increase in the region and a decline in market share from 16.9 to 16.5 per cent. According to latest industry estimates, western European new car registrations rose 6.6 per cent in the first seven months of the year. Group turnover for the first half was up 6.4 per cent at DM40.8bn while sales for Volkswagen AG, the German parent, slipped 4 per cent to DM21bn. German production fell 1 per cent to 698,000 units, but output from foreign factories jumped 8.2 per cent to 862,000. This surge included a 19 per cent rise at Seat, the recently rescued Spanish subsidiary which was blamed for most of last year's huge losses. Customer sales of Seat marque vehicles increased 23 per cent in the review period. Sales in China, the group's key developing market, rose 14 per cent to 73,500, while south America and South Africa together recorded a 32 per cent advance to 272,000.</p>

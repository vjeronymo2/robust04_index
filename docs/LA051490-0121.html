			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: THAT'S SOME WINDOW IVANA DRESSED UP FOR $1  </P> <P> REMEMBER THE saga of Donald and Ivana Trump and the Plaza? This is a story  wherein he pays her a dollar a year to rehabilitate, renovate and oversee the  hotel and then claims that she is just window dressing in his life and doesn't  really do any work.  </P> <P> Oh, please! Ivana took over the Plaza 18 months ago -- Aug. 21, 1988, to be  exact -- and now Traveler magazine for June has named it "One of the Best  Hotels in the World." (They only give this acknowledgment to three hotels in  all of the U.S. -- the Plaza, the Mansion at Turtle Creek in Dallas and the  Bel-Air in L.A.)  </P> <P> Ivana's Plaza has also been named by Pinnacle magazine as "the best hotel in  the U.S. for corporate meetings and conventions." Last year, Prestige mag named  the Plaza "the most improved hotel" in the country.  </P> <P> For only a dollar a year and a lot of tourists, I'd say that Donald is a hard  man to please.  </P> <P> REX SMITH is filling in for ailing David Carroll of Broadway's hit "Grand  Hotel." Carroll, nominated for a Tony, hopes to be up and about in time for the  award ceremonies on June 3. Rex Smith, once a teen heartthrob, is fast becoming  a stage veteran, with "The Pirates of Penzance," "The Human Comedy" and a  national tour of "Anything Goes" under his belt.  </P> <P> NORA DUNN and Sinead O'Connor are indeed women of principle. However, by  standing up for their convictions (that they did not want to appear on  "Saturday Night Live" with the sewer-mouthed Andrew Dice Clay) they gave the  object of their objections millions of dollars worth of free publicity.  </P> <P> People who had never heard, or were only vaguely aware of ADC, tuned in by the  thousands to find out what the fuss was all about.  </P></p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Survey of Kansai (5): Progress without vision - A look at the impact of the new airport 'On a clear day you should be able to see Awaji Island across the water,' the driver says, as he steers his taxi down the eye-catching, double-layered bridge that spans the stretch of sea between the mainland and Kansai International Airport (KIA). 'Unfortunately, there's usually a mist over the water, and it's hardly ever possible to see the island,' he adds apologetically. Kansai's striking new international airport may have many things in its favour, but clarity of vision is not one of its strengths, whether in the surrounding atmosphere or in its ambitious plans to become Japan's preferred hub for international travel. Seven years after construction work started, the airport, built on reclaimed land about 4 kilometres off the shore of Osaka, opens 18 months late this Sunday with less than half the expected number of flights, a sinking foundation and uncertainty surrounding expansion plans that are crucial if the airport is to become the gateway to the world that it hopes to be. KIA's stumbling start throws into relief the lofty ambitions that inspired its private and public owners to embark on the costly and daunting task of building the world's first offshore airport. The development that has been publicised as Japan's first 24-hour airport was conceived as the much-needed public project to transform its host city, Osaka, from an urban sprawl on the eastern edge of Asia to a shining metropolis. The opening of Kansai's doors to greater international traffic, it was believed, would place the region firmly on the map of every globe-trotting policymaker and businessman, and do wonders to the regional economy. It may still happen. But even before its opening, the image of Kansai has been hurt, rather than helped, by the airport and its myriad woes which have overshadowed the positive aspects of the airport, such as the striking terminal building designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano, or the convenience it offers by servicing both domestic and international flights. To many people, KIA is known as the sinking airport. The first ever to be built on a man-made island, it ran up costs far exceeding initial estimates, largely because the land on which it is built sank more than was expected and had to be repeatedly fortified. When experts gave opinions as to how much the island would sink, the airport authorities, with characteristic Kansai optimism, took the lower end of their estimates. 'While construction work was going on, it emerged that the worst scenario was in fact the most accurate,' explains Mr Zenjiro Ogawa, managing director and vice-president of Kansai International Airport Company (KIAC), the airport's operators. The island will sink about one more metre, but this is in line with expectations, he says reassuringly. The result of the initial miscalculation, however, is that costs have surged from Y1,000bn (Dollars 10m) to Y1,500bn, leaving the airport saddled with over Y1,000bn in debt. Interest payments alone amount to Y100m a day, and the airport is expected to suffer a loss of Y55bn in its first year. 'We have to explore whether we will have to redraw our long-term plan or whether there is a way to avoid doing so,' concedes Mr Ogawa. KIAC had planned to make a profit in five years, and to complete loan repayments and start paying dividends in 23 years. But now the company expects to have to delay repayment of loans. In order to minimise the damage, KIAC was initially forced to set landing-fees at a rate surpassing those at Narita, Tokyo's international airport which until this month enjoyed the notoriety of being the world's most expensive one. The move backfired, however, and KIAC found itself unable to attract as many flights as it had been hoped, because increasingly cost-conscious airlines balked at having to pay Y995,000 each time they landed. Airport officials were locked in negotiations until the last minute with the International Air Transport Association (Iata), which found KIAC's fees unacceptable. 'We are a private company, and we must collect fees that cover our costs, otherwise we cannot exist,' Mr Ogawa protests. KIA's landing fees are only 10 per cent higher than those at Narita, an amount that airlines can easily recoup by signing up a few extra customers, he says. In the end, just weeks before the airport was scheduled to open, the KIAC agreed to lower its fees to match those charged at Narita. But the move hardly bodes well for KIA's efforts to earn as much as it can in fees towards the construction of two more runways. Without that increased capacity, KIA will not be able to realise its true potential as an Asian hub. Having got over one hurdle, in setting initial landing-fees, the airport operators now face another, even more contentious battle over how much of the estimated expansion cost of about Y1,000m is to be shouldered by the national and local governments, the local business community and the airport itself. Nevertheless, KIAC and the airport's loyal supporters in Kansai remain optimistic about its long-term prospects. Mr Takaharu Akitake, general manager of the Kansai economy research department, at Daiwa Research Institute, is one who believes strongly that the international airport will help revitalise the regional economy. Osaka international airport, which had served the region's international needs, is already up to capacity and has no room for expansion. The opening of KIA will encourage new companies to locate in the Kansai region, and make it easier to hold international conferences here, Mr Akitake points out. 'Osaka then offers an alternative to Tokyo.' The expected increase in cargo traffic will also help the regional economy. As much as 85 per cent of air cargo in Japan is concentrated at Narita, the world's largest handler of air cargo. Since a large proportion of this is delivered to the Kansai area, KIA, which has the capacity to handle 1.4m tonnes of cargo a year, is expected to take much of the burden off Narita. The new airport is also expected to stimulate more business with Asia. KIA offers direct flights to Asian countries not represented at Narita, including Nepal, Vietnam and Mongolia. Assuming that KIA signs up 397 international flights and 441 domestic flights a week, the research institute expects the extra economic activity generated by the airport to add 1.56 per cent to the gross regional product. There is a shortage of airport facilities in Japan, Mr Ogawa points out. 'Narita is full, so the fact is that Japan needs another international airport.' Compared with Narita, which is far from Tokyo's domestic airport, KIA, which serves both international and domestic flights, offers the convenience of easy transit to and from principal cities throughout Japan and the world.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Irish Premier Reynolds appeals to loyalists for early ceasefire Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday appealed to loyalist paramilitaries to declare an early ceasefire. 'While some people claim to be preoccupied by the issue of the permanence or otherwise of the IRA ceasefire, they tend to overlook the fact that there is not any ceasefire as yet from the loyalist side,' he said after receiving an honorary doctorate at St Joseph's University, Philadelphia. 'While abhorring the violence that I always believe was futile from the beginning, I nevertheless want to acknowledge the courage of Gerry Adams and the leadership of Sinn Fein,' he added.</p>

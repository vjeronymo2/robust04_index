			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SILENT ACTIVISTS' MARCH DISRUPTS MAHONY MASS;  </P> <P> AIDS: THIS WAS THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF PROTESTS AGAINST THE CHURCH'S STAND ON  CONDOMS.  </P> <P> A group of 10 AIDS activists marched silently to the altar in the midst of  Archbishop Roger M. Mahony's sermon during the Midnight Christmas Mass at St.  Vibiana's Cathedral early Monday but then left the cathedral without further  disruption.  </P> <P> About 800 people were attending the religious service, the highlight of the  celebration of Christmas for many Roman Catholics, when the activists, some  wearing black T-shirts with a pink triangle and the slogan "Silence equals  death," paraded up the center aisle.  </P> <P> The action at the downtown Los Angeles cathedral was the latest in a series of  demonstrations against the church's condemnation of the use of condoms for safe  sex.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Los Angeles Archdiocese said church security officers were  present during the protest, but freely allowed about 20 people who had  participated in a larger demonstration outside to enter for the Mass. About 10  protesters rose during the sermon, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> Earlier, Mahony commented on the demonstration outside the cathedral by about  50 AIDS activists and abortion rights advocates, declaring: "This isn't the  first time the church has faced turmoil. We have been thrown to the lions in  the early days and persecuted throughout history. This is just our turn."  </P> <P> On Dec. 3, four Roman Catholic churches in the Los Angeles area were spattered  with red paint, and posters of Mahony with the word "murderer" printed in large  letters were left at them. A group calling itself Greater Religious  Responsibility claimed responsibility for the acts, which were denounced later  by regional leaders of 11 religious denominations.  </P> <P> Mahony said then that neither he nor the archdiocese "will be intimidated by  threats or attacks against proclaiming the truth as God has taught." He said  that chastity, rather than the use of condoms, is the only "morally correct and  medically secure way" to prevent the spread of AIDS.  </P> <P> The AIDS group involved in the midnight Mass demonstrations was identified by  leaders as ACT-UP LA, the Aids Coalition to Unleash Power. Helene Schpak of Los  Angeles, a representative of the group, said: "Mahony's statements are  murderous. The doctrine that he's preaching leaves no choice. We're here to  tell people that they do have a choice. Safe sex (with condoms) saves lives."  </P> <P> Asked if whether their protest might be considered sacrilegious, Schpak  responded: "We're here to celebrate life also, and we believe any time is  appropriate to protest a policy of death."  </P></p>

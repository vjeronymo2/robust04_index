			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Iraq arms disclosures 'hit public trust' The disclosure in the Matrix Churchill case of information which the government tried unsuccessfully to suppress has undermined public faith in the standards of public service, former foreign office minister Mr Tristan Garel-Jones told the Scott inquiry yesterday. Mr Garel-Jones said that he himself had never had 'the slightest doubt' about the propriety of signing a public immunity certificate seeking to restrict information. But much of his evidence underlined the extent to which ministers concerned have felt under increasing political pressure over the arms-for-Iraq affair. Mr Garel-Jones, a Tory MP who served as deputy chief whip under Mrs Thatcher, said that because of 'misleading media coverage' of the arms-for-Iraq affair, he had to explain to constituents that ministers were not involved in 'skulduggery'. He said: 'Quite a substantial number of my constituents have written to me saying how could you possibly involve yourself in gagging . . . I believe that the suggestion (that the government was secretly arming Iraq) to be wholly unfounded and to have been fed by the release of these papers.' During the Matrix Churchill trial the judge ruled that government documents for which PII certificates had been signed by several ministers, including Mr Garel-Jones, should be disclosed to the defence in the interests of justice. Copies of the documents were subsequently passed to the media without the judge's approval. Mr Garel-Jones said no advice to ministers should be made public unless an 'independent judicial authority' ruled the interests of justice to be overriding or if parliament itself decided so. He also issued a personal defence of the role in the Iraq affair of Mr William Waldegrave, his predecessor as foreign office minister. Mr Waldegrave told the Scott inquiry in October that he approved the export of Matrix Churchill machine tools in spite of intelligence reports linking the company to a munitions contract. He was also one of the ministers who agreed to a relaxation in guidelines on defence exports to Iraq without telling parliament. Mr Garel-Jones said he had asked himself, with the evidence of hindsight, whether he would have done differently had he been in Mr Waldegrave's place. 'I think I would have been pleased to have done so well,' he told the inquiry. The inquiry was adjourned until Monday when Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, will give evidence.</p>

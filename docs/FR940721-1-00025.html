The 1993 attainment inventory was based on the comprehensive inventories of VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from area, stationary, and mobile sources for 1990. Consistent with emission inventory guidance, the 1990 base year emission inventory represents 1990 average summer day actual emissions for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. Since the projected 1993 emissions are lower than the actual 1990 emissions (providing a more stringent attainment inventory) and 1993 is the attainment year, it is appropriate to utilize projected 1993 emissions for the attainment year inventory. Furthermore, the 1990 base year emission inventory was prepared in accordance with USEPA guidance. USEPA's TSDs prepared for the 1990 base year emission inventory (Emission Inventory TSD) SIP revision and the redesignation request (Redesignation/Maintenance Plan TSD) contain more in-depth details regarding the emission inventories for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1990 base year emission inventory also served as the basis for calculations to demonstrate maintenance by projecting emissions forward to the years 1993, 1996, 2000, and 2005. Projections are based on growth factors extracted from the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments Regional Development Forecast (RDF). Supplemental information used in the development of emission projections include source-specific data for electric utilities, automobile manufacturing, aircraft, and gasoline marketing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Growth factors are derived from employment forecasts by two-digit Source Industrial Code by county. In addition, product output data was used to develop growth factors for motor vehicle manufacturing, and utilities. The area source growth factors used from RDF were based on population or housing data. Furthermore, all growth factors that were less than 1.0 were set equal to 1.0 for 1990 and beyond to offset any effects of negative growth possibly due to economic downturns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In developing the mobile source emission estimates, the MOBILE5a model was used. The significant input parameters for the MOBILE5a model are analyzed in detail in the Redesignation/Maintenance Plan TSD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The stationary source emission estimates (point and area) were developed using the geocoded emissions modeling and projections system (GEMAP). This emission projection model and supporting documentation were reviewed by Region 5 and the Emission Inventory Branch of the OAQPS during the developmental stages of the redesignation request and appear to be acceptable since GEMAP employs methodologies equivalent to the applicable USEPA guidance on emission projections (June 21, 1993 letter to John Schroeder and August 3, 1993 Record of Conversation with OAQPS, RADIAN and Region 5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The Third Meeting of the Presidium of the Second Session of  the Eighth NPC today adopted a bill on changing the name of the  committee submitted by the NPC Environmental Protection  Committee, and a draft decision on the bill submitted by the  secretariat of the session.    Both the bill and the draft decision will be submitted to  NPC  delegations for deliberation.    In the bill, the environmental protection committee said  that, since its establishment, many government departments and  people have regarded it as being engaged primarily in  environmental protection, thus paying little attention to the  committee's work aimed at protecting natural resources.    The bill says China now faces serious problems in terms of  natural resources, including shortages of water resources,  insufficient farmland resources, vegetation damage, soil  erosion, desertification and a decrease in the number of  wildlife.    The bill describes the damage and waste of resources as a  major factor causing environmental pollution.    That is why it is necessary to combine legislation and  supervision in the field of resources protection with those in  the field of pollution control to make sure that the  Environmental Protection Committee will be able to better  perform its duties and functions, the bill says.</p>

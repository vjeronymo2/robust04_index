			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Rome fears new influx of Albanian refugees THE Italian government yesterday was on the alert for a fresh wave of refugees seeking to enter the country by boat following an abortive attempt by a group of 108 Albanians who reached the southern port of Brindisi on Wednesday. This group was forcibly repatriated on a special Alitalia aircraft chartered by the Interior Ministry yesterday. It was the largest single exodus from Albania since last August when some 26,000 sought to enter Italy on an ageing freighter. This latest batch of asylum seekers had apparently commandeered a naval craft in the Albanian port of Sarseno and forced it to sea with some of its crew. Those seeking to escape Albania included members of the military as well as women and children. The vessel was spotted by Italian naval patrols before it reached Italian waters. However, procedures established by the Italian navy and air force to turn back vessels failed because the naval craft repeatedly refused to obey instructions and the Italians were reluctant to use force at sea.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- Guy Dupre,  secretary general of the International Liaison Committee for  Reunification and Peace in Korea (Cilreco), delivered a report  at an enlarged meeting of the Executive Committee of Cilreco  which was held in Paris on February 6.    The reporter outlined immediate tasks to strengthen  international solidarity movement for supporting the cause of  Korea's reunification and peace under the acute situation  prevailing in the Korean peninsula.    Analysing the situation of the Korean peninsula, he stressed  the need to be cautious of the Western media reports  categorically dismissing the proposals and initiatives of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea and shunning the reality  and, at the same time, to analyse the developments from an  objective stand and correctly see through the essential stand of  the parties involved in the Korean issue.    Noting that the tension on the Korean peninsula remains  acute, though a joint statement was adopted between the DPRK and  the U.S. in June 1993 at official talks between the two sides,  he said: "This is because the United States went back on its  promise to the DPRK for the solution of the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula."    He recalled that the DPRK, on January 31, 1994, solemnly  declared that if the U.S. reversed its promise to the DPRK, the  DPRK would no longer be bound by its promise to the U.S., that  if the United States refused to have any more talks with the  DPRK, the DPRK would seek no further talks and that if the U.S.  would choose any other way, the DPRK will choose a corresponding  countermeasure. "If broad masses are to be roused in a campaign  to force the United States to strictly observe the principle  agreed upon in its joint statement with the DPRK under the  critical present situation, it is important to bring home the  developments on the Korean peninsula to the public," the  reporter said.    He branded "suspected nuclear development of the North" as a  variant of the fiction of "threat from the North" invented by  the United States to justify its moves to stifle the DPRK.    He said "threat from the North" over which the United States  and the South Korean authorities have hitherto raised terrific  outcries is a sheer fabrication without any ground.    He pointed out that the United States and its followers made  the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations  adopt high-handed "resolutions" in a bid to inveigle the  international community into the U.S. "policy of strength"  against socialist Korea.    He charged that the South Korean authorities have run a  gamut  of plots to bar the solution of the nuclear issue through the  medium of direct negotiations between the DPRK and the U.S. and  Japan has burst into the limelight in raising a hue and cry over  the fictitious "suspected nuclear development by the North".    The reporter quoted President Kim Il-song as saying in his  New Year address that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula  must be settled through DPRK-U.S. talks under all circumstances  and pressure and threat will have no effect on the Korean people  and such method may invite a catastrophe, far from leading to a  solution of the problem.    "We express full sympathy for the principled stand,"  declared  the reporter.    He demanded that the Korean Armistice Agreement be replaced  by a peace agreement between the DPRK and the U.S. in compliance  with the requirements of the resolution (3390 b) of the 30th  U.N. General Assembly and, accordingly, the U.S. Forces be  completely withdrawn from South Korea.    He said the 10-point programme of the great unity of the  whole nation shows a way of an early realisation of Korea's  reunification.    He further said:    "The 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole  nation for the reunification of the country put forward by  President Kim Il-song last year indicates detailed ways for  founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo [DCRK], an  independent, peaceful and neutral unified state. We will make  every effort to arouse louder voices supporting the proposal for  founding the DCRK and the 10-point programme of the great unity  of the whole nation."    The reporter stressed the need to expand and strengthen the  international solidarity movement for Korea's reunification and  peace and proposed measures for this.    He said:    "Primary efforts should be directed to the following two  points to bring about a decisive turn in creating an atmosphere  of detente and reconciliation for hastening the process of  Korea's reunification this year:    "What is important above all is to build up broad world  opinion urging the United States to abandon its hostile policy  to stifle the DPRK and abide by the principles of the joint  statement agreed upon between the DPRK and the United States.    "What is important next is to put the question of  reunification through confederacy on the agenda of inter-Korean  talks and promote reunification-oriented dialogue. Of  importance in this regard is to arouse broad world opinion  supporting the proposal for founding the DCRK, the most  realistic and fair way in the solution to the Korean issue.    "With a view to building up world opinion in favor of the  settlement of the Korean issue, we propose declaring 1994 `a  year of international solidarity supporting Korea's  reunification through confederacy.'"    The reporter expressed the hope that the members of the  leading body of Cilreco and leading officials of the regional  and national committees of support to Korea's reunification and  organizations for friendship and solidarity with the Korean  people will actively turn out, with a high sense of  responsibility, in the work to expand and strengthen  international solidarity movement in keeping with the demands of  the obtaining situation.</p>

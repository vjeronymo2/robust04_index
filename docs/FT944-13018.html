			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Trading buoyant says Rank The Rank Organisation said yesterday there had been a healthy rise in UK and US leisure spending, resulting in strong increases in the group's turnover and operating profit. However, the shares fell 10 1/2 p to 399p. Analysts said there had been an expectation that Rank's trading update would be even more positive. Mr Peter Hilliar, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said he had increased his forecast of Rank's pre-tax profit before exceptional items from Pounds 338m to Pounds 354m. Pre-tax profits in the year to October 31 1993 were Pounds 277m. The group also said it was changing its year end in 1995 from October 31 to December 31. The directors said the change would bring the group into line with most other FT-SE 100 companies. Rank said that turnover in continuing operations rose 10 per cent in the period to end-September, with operating profit up 15 per cent. The film and television businesses were performing particularly well. The contribution from Rank Xerox was up by more than a third at the end of July before restructuring costs. Rank's Pounds 62m share of restructuring costs was charged against first half profit and Rank said the benefits had begun to be realised in the second half. Volumes from the video duplication business were up by almost 50 per cent, while film laboratory volumes were up 12 per cent on last year. Odeon cinema admissions rose 4 per cent. The holiday business showed a small increase, with sales up 3 per cent on last year. Bingo customers' spending was up 6 per cent, but admissions had fallen by a similar amount. The performance of casinos had improved, however, with attendances up 3 per cent and spending per head up 7 per cent. Profit at amusement centres was down. Turnover at the Hard Rock cafes grew 7 per cent in the second half. Spending per head at UK nightclubs was up 5 per cent and margins rose 3 percentage points. Resorts in the US, however, had a difficult year.</p>

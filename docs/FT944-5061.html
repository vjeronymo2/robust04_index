			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Orange County taxpayers face up to bad bet: Bond market gamble that could cost Dollars 2bn The wealthy and very conservative taxpayers of Orange County, California could soon find themselves picking up the bill for what amounts to one of the biggest-ever mistaken bets on the direction of interest rates. Late last week, investment officers in this prosperous area to the south of Los Angeles estimated that they were sitting on a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 910m) paper loss from their dealings in the bond markets this year. They tried to play down the scale of the disaster: this was only 7 per cent of the Dollars 20bn of investments the county controlled, they said. In reality, things are much worse. The Orange County fund actually was worth between Dollars 7.5bn and Dollars 8bn and used what amounts to a form of borrowing to leverage up the value of investments under its control. The Dollars 1.5bn of losses (some on Wall Street say it is closer to Dollars 2bn) have cut the value of the fund to some Dollars 6bn-Dollars 6.5bn, a loss of a fifth or more. Until Orange County actually sells the securities in its investment portfolio, these losses will not be realised. In the meantime, the case has already turned into a political circus, and is fast pitting politicians against Wall Street in the latest big test case for the derivative markets. Ironically, for an area dominated by Republicanism, it took a Democrat to bring about this debacle. Mr Robert Citron, who resigned yesterday as the county's treasurer, was an elected official, in common with his counterparts in other counties in California (but unlike much of the rest of the US.) Mr Citron's - and Orange County's - problems stemmed from a mistaken bet on interest rates at a time when the US bond markets have suffered their biggest tumble in memory. After posting above-average investment returns for some time - the treasurer's fund is generally estimated to have made around twice the return of most other bond funds in recent years - this marks an abrupt reversal of fortune. According to an executive at one Wall Street firm which deals heavily with the county, the losses should be seen in the context both of the fund's previous good performance and 'the biggest rout in the bond market's history'. But none of that will come as much consolation to local taxpayers. Mr Citron's strategy fell into two parts. First, to leverage his investments, he in effect borrowed about Dollars 12bn by using the securities repurchase market. This involves selling securities and at the same time agreeing to buy them back in the future. The cash was then used to buy more securities, which in turn were sold in the repurchase (or 'repo') market, and so on, until the fund's exposure reached Dollars 20bn. If the securities rose in value, the investment return was multiplied: but if they fell - which turned out to be the case - the losses were also leveraged. The second part of the strategy was to use investment instruments which also accentuated the fund's exposure to the bond markets. Mr Citron is believed to have controlled between Dollars 7bn and Dollars 8bn of inverse floating rates notes (instruments which pay a higher investment return, the lower interest rates fall). These have the same effect as using the 'repo' market, leveraging the profits (or losses) from changing interest rates. For Orange County taxpayers, the big question now is whether the county will be forced to liquidate some or all of its investments, and so turn the paper losses into real ones, or whether it is able to restructure the fund either to defer losses or to avoid having to take any losses at all. Much will depend on the amount of cash at its disposal. The county invests funds on behalf of about 170 different public bodies - from cities to school districts and water authorities. It holds their surplus cash as well as tax revenue which it has collected and which it pays out to meet the operational needs of the different entities. One local agency - the Irvine Ranch Water District, with Dollars 300m in the fund - is agitating hard to get its cash back, and is likely to be followed by others. According to Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, about 40 per cent of the money in the fund can be recalled by the agencies concerned, while the rest must be invested in the fund under state law. A second call on the fund's cash comes from the operating needs of the agencies concerned. The 37 school districts, which account for about 13 per cent of the value of the fund, need to pay teachers' salaries and other bills, and cannot wait for the county to work out a long-term plan for his fund. The cash liquidity in the fund is already estimated to have fallen to Dollars 350m, from more than Dollars 1bn in September. If the county cannot keep his investors at bay, it will have to start selling securities and taking investment losses.</p>

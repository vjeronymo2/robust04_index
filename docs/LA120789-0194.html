			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SADDLEBACK VALLEY INCORPORATION SUPPORTED BY STUDY, GROUP SAYS  </P> <P> Leaders of a fledgling movement to incorporate a wide area of Saddleback Valley  say a preliminary study suggests that the proposed city would be financially  secure.  </P> <P> Helen Wilson, president of the Community Coalition for Incorporation, said that  a study released Tuesday by an Oceanside financial consultant shows that a city  consisting of El Toro, Lake Forest and Portola Hills would have a surplus of  more than $5 million in the first year if revenue and spending remained at  current levels.  </P> <P> "That's really very encouraging," Wilson said Wednesday. "It proves that we  would be healthy if we were a city."  </P> <P> The group has already announced it will launch a petition drive in January to  put cityhood on the ballot in November, 1990. This will be the group's second  incorporation attempt.  </P> <P> The petition drive and a financial feasibility study, paid for by the  coalition, are needed by cityhood proponents as part of their incorporation  application to the Orange County Local Agency Formation Commission.  </P> <P> Since the beginning of 1988, South County's Mission Viejo, Dana Point and  Laguna Niguel have opted for cityhood. Some residents of Laguna Hills are also  considering such a move.  </P> <P> The preliminary study on El Toro adds up all revenue accrued in the area in  fiscal year 1988-89 and compares it to expenditures by the county.  </P> <P> The one-year study will be followed early next year by a full financial  feasibility study, which will project the financial condition of the proposed  21-square-mile city for two years, said Fred Christiansen, who is conducting  the study.  </P> <P> Christiansen, who also conducted the financial feasibility study for Laguna  Niguel, said that the preliminary study was done to give pro-cityhood leaders  an indication of whether to "go or not to go ahead."  </P> <P> "These figures say, 'Go,' " Christiansen said. "Now they will move ahead."  </P> <P> Wilson said coalition members last met on Monday and are recruiting volunteers  to circulate petitions.  </P> <P> "We really don't have much time," said Wilson, who was one of the leaders of  last year's failed attempt to form a city called Saddleback Valley.  </P> <P> Unlike voters in the three newest cities, a majority of residents of El Toro,  Lake Forest, Aegean Hills, Portola Hills and Laguna Hills have rejected bids  for cityhood in the recent past.  </P> <P> The incorporation attempt for Saddleback Valley, about a year ago, was defeated  largely because of opposition from Laguna Hills voters, many of whom were  planning to start an incorporation effort of their own. But the Laguna Hills  incorporation effort last spring was defeated too, mostly because of opposition  from Leisure World.  </P> <P> However, Wilson said that she and other community leaders are renewing their  pro-cityhood campaign because of an informal survey that suggested interest in  forming a city that does not include Laguna Hills.  </P> <P> Of the 202 people surveyed in interviews at local shopping centers, 50% favored  incorporation, 20% opposed it and 30% were undecided, Wilson said.  </P> <P> The new city would include the proposed Foothills Ranch Planned Community,  which would include 4,000 homes, an industrial complex and a commercial center  between Portola Hills and El Toro.  </P> <P> The group must gather the signatures of 25% of the 28,000 registered voters who  live within the proposed city boundaries.  </P> <P> The biggest opposition to the incorporation effort may come from residents of  Portola Hills, an isolated neighborhood that often affiliates itself more with  rural Trabuco Canyon than it does with El Toro.  </P> <P> Members of the Portola Hills Homeowners Assn. said they were against the effort  at an Oct. 23 meeting with Wilson and other pro-city leaders.  </P> <P> The level of opposition, Wilson conceded, could match that of Laguna Hills  residents during the Saddleback Valley campaign.  </P> <P> "We had a lot of people come (to the meeting) who were dead set against  (incorporation)," Wilson said.  </P></p>

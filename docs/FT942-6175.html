			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Bogus NVQ claims raise alarm: The questions posed about the government's vocational qualifications system A shiver has gone through the training industry after fresh allegations that employees of a large provider of training made a further false claim for funding on a government training programme. The affair raises questions about whether it is possible for the new national vocational qualifications system, on which the government is pinning its hopes for on-the-job training, to be monitored properly. NVQs are based on measuring an individual's competence on day-to-day tasks at work. Full external assessment would be very expensive, so the system relies on internal assessors giving accurate returns. While the qualifications are verified by outside awarding bodies the verifiers generally only see the paper records of achievements. There is no formal requirement upon them to see whether the individual can actually perform a task such as driving a tractor for a horticulture NVQ. It can be tempting for unscrupulous assessors to exaggerate success by asserting that a 'competency' has been achieved, as providers are effectively paid by results. 'The system relies on the integrity and professionalism of the assessor,' said Mrs Alison Wolf, reader in education at the Institute of Education. The events which have shaken the training industry centre on JHP Training, a business and administration training provider, which is already under investigation by the Department of Employment's internal audit service after the disclosure last month that former employees obtained cash from Cumbria Training and Enterprise Council for the attainment of NVQs based on bogus claims. The company admitted the original fraud, but said it responded openly and promptly when it discovered that two or three former members of staff had falsified documents. A Commons motion tabled last week by Labour MPs Mr John Hutton and Mr Dale Campbell-Savours named 'yet another victim' of the company in Barrow-in-Furness which, it said, had claimed money for training he had not attended. JHP has 'categorically' denied irregularity over this incident. Mr Hugh Pitman, chairman and chief executive, said: 'The young man concerned was being assessed for a qualification in the workplace while in a job. The NVQ system was not properly explained to him. He thought that participating in the scheme involved off-the-job training.' JHP trains 10,000 people a year in 65 locations. 'To make sure everybody obeys company policy is very difficult,' said Mr Pitman. 'We monitor our work, as do Tecs and the Department of Employment. But there is still a possibility of things going wrong.' Several training providers say they are now ensuring that their internal systems are secure. 'If you lose your good name in a system that relies on integrity you are in trouble,' said Mrs Anne Weinstock, chief executive of the Rathbone Society, a charity which trains 4,000 young people a year. 'There is no doubt that there is scope for sharp practice,' said Mr Ian Christie of the Policy Studies Institute. 'But, it is very difficult to quantify whether it is happening or not.' Where the NVQs involve government-funded training it is the employer-led Tecs in England and Wales which are responsible for arranging and paying for the training. Increasingly the government is paying Tecs for 'outputs': getting work or qualifications for an unemployed individual rather than just paying him or her to be on a course. Training providers which contract with Tecs risk financial loss if outputs are not achieved. Tecs are still refining quality-control systems. But they argue that their new systems are a significant refinement on those of the employment department when it ran publicly funded training programmes. Indeed, the department's accounts were qualified three times by the National Audit Office. Tecs say that in the past a training provider would be paid when it informed the department's local office that it had trained a certain number of people. Now those Tecs which have invested fully in the new systems can track a named individual through his or her complete training and monitor progress. The department says there is no evidence of widespread abuse of the system - current abuses being investigated grossed up to about Pounds 15,000. It rates most Tecs as of 'medium or low' risk in their quality control systems for training. But the department, still scrutinising the JHP case, is reviewing whether the NVQ system and safeguards are adequate. A number of organisations, including the National Council for Vocational Qualifications, which developed NVQs, say new checks may have to be introduced, including substantial sampling of students by the external verifiers. 'It takes time to build up consistent standards,' said the NCVQ. Cumbria Tec, which made the payments to JHP, had for example three times more people involved in financial appraisals than it inherited from the employment department four years ago.</p>

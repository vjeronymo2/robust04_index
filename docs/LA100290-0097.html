The rocket's payload was  a Global Positioning System Navstar satellite, the ninth in a planned network  of such spacecraft that ultimately will allow military forces to determine  their location and altitude to within 53 feet anywhere in the world. The flight  plan called for the satellite to be ejected into a preliminary elliptical  orbit.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the November 24, 1986,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (51 FR 42209), OSM announced the decision to defer action on the proposed revision to the time and distance performance standards for rough backfilling and grading. At the time of Wyoming's submission (May 1, 1986), the remand of the counterpart Federal regulation, 30 CFR 816.101, was under appeal by the Secretary to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The District Court for the District of Columbia had remanded the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.100 and 816.101, holding that OSM's decision to remove 30 CFR 816.101, containing the time and distance performance standards for rough backfilling and grading, left State regulatory authorities with inadequate guidance concerning how to enforce the contemporaneous reclamation requirement of section 515(b)(16) of SMCRA.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In Re: Permanent Surface Mining Litigation, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  21 ERC 1724, 1745&hyph;6 (D.D.C. 1984). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 29, 1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the District Court decision to remand the Federal time and distance performance standards for rough backfilling and grading in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Wildlife Federation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hodel <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 839 F.2d 694 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Pursuant to the Court of Appeals' decision, on December 17, 1991, OSM promulgated new regulations, at 30 CFR 816.101, that provided national time and distance performance standards for rough backfilling and grading for surface mining operations. Those regulations were subsequently challenged in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Coal Association and American Mining Congress <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. Department of the Interior, et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Civ. No. 92&hyph;0408&hyph;CRR (1992). This case was dismissed without prejudice by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia as the result of a joint stipulation of the parties that included OSM's agreement to suspend the regulation at 30 CFR 816.101. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated November 30, 1993, Wyoming submitted a request to OSM to reopen the review of the deferred amendment. The request included Wyoming's rationale for not including time and distance standards in its program. The request also included information concerning how compliance with the proposed contemporaneous reclamation requirement would be determined (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;25&hyph;1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Wyoming amendment would remove specific time and distance standards for backfilling and grading in favor of a general requirement that backfilling and grading follow coal removal ``as contemporaneously as possible based upon the mining conditions.'' Additionally, Wyoming's proposed rule requires that each permit application include a backfilling and grading schedule with a ``supporting analysis.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The December 17, 1991, Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.101 concerning time and distance performance standards for rough backfilling and grading were suspended by OSM on July 31, 1992. Therefore, in absence of a specific Federal regulation providing specific time and distance performance standards for rough backfilling and grading, the Federal standards against which State time and distance performance standards for rough backfilling and grading must be judged are section 515(b)(16) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 816.100. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 515(b)(16) of SMCRA requires that surface coal mining and reclamation operations be conducted so as to insure that all reclamation efforts proceed as contemporaneously as practicable with the surface coal mining operations. The Federal regulation at 816.100 similarly provides that backfilling and grading shall occur ``as contemporaneously as practicable with mining operations *&blank;*&blank;*.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wyoming's proposed rule requires that ``Rough backfilling and grading shall follow coal removal as contemporaneously as possible based upon the mining conditions *&blank;*&blank;*.'' OSM interprets Wyoming's phrase ``as contemporaneously as possible based upon the mining conditions,'' to be equivalent to the Federal phrase, ``as contemporaneously as practicable with mining operations,'' in section 515(b)(16) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 816.100. OSM notes that the American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition (1982), on page 967, includes the word ``practicable'' in its list of words synonymous with the word ``possible.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM notes that Wyoming, in its letter of November 30, 1993, explained why the existing specific, program-wide time and distance standards for rough backfilling and grading have proven infeasible because of unique local mining conditions in Wyoming. Specifically, Wyoming asserted that the time standard of its regulations was not workable because mines with low tonnage proceed slowly and cannot reclaim quickly enough to meet the time limit (60 or 180 days, depending on the type of mining). Wyoming further explained that the pace of mining in Wyoming varies with the topography of the land being mined. When an operation passes through a ridge, explained Wyoming, a large amount of overburden is removed, enabling reclamation to be completed in a timely manner. Conversely, when the operation passes through a drainage, a small amount of overburden is removed, limiting how quickly the operator can reclaim. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

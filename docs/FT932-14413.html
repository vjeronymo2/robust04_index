			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Berisford bid for C&amp;J Clark detailed C&amp;J Clark, the UK shoe manufacturer riven by board dissent, is poised to inform shareholders of the details of a bid from Berisford International, the property and agribusiness company. The bid is believed to include a clause whereby Berisford would have the right to purchase the assets and brands of Clark if it wins more than 50 per cent of the company, but does not achieve outright control. Berisford is reported to have made an offer of about 205p per share, which values Clark at Pounds 158m, against the latest trading price of 90p. The board met on Friday to approve the final details of a circular which will recommend the bid price as fair and reasonable to Clark's 4,000 shareholders early this week. However, three of the 11-strong board are not recommending the offer, with one further abstention. The sale is being opposed by a group of shareholders and board members who claim to represent at least 30 per cent of the company. Berisford was optimistic of winning the support of Clark's shareholders. 'I have every confidence that this fair, reasonable and recommended offer will be accepted by Clark shareholders,' said Mr Alan Bowkett, Berisford's chief executive. He said that the problems of corporate governance which have plagued Clark for many years would continue if the Berisford bid failed. 'We are offering a solution to that problem,' he said. At an extraordinary general meeting on May 7, shareholders will be asked to vote on a sale of Clark's assets and brands to Berisford. If that is approved, Berisford would then make a full offer for the company comprised of cash, shares, or loan notes. If the offer does not win 90 per cent approval, Berisford is expected to revert to the option to purchase the assets and brands of the business at a price similar to the full offer. Mr Michael Markham, who was a board appointee at the extraordinary general meeting called by the rebels last autumn, said the bid was unacceptable. 'This is not in the spirit of the Companies Act. If this company was covered under takeover rules, they could not do this and I hope shareholders will fight every way they can to prevent it.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from the "Dalniy Vostok" program] </F>   [Text] The edict issued by Mikhail Nikolayev, president of  the Sakha Republic, Yakutia, establishes special rules for entry  into the republic. They concern citizens of foreign states and  CIS countries, as well as those republics of the Russian  Federation which have not signed the federal agreement. To  enter Yakutia from now on, it is necessary for them to have  special invitations approved by the local authorities. In a  number of instances, citizens in given categories could be  refused permission to enter the republic of Sakha, or be  expelled before the expiration of their stay. The grounds for  this specifically are actions which go against the interests of  state security or public order, established traditions and  standards of moral behavior, as well as breaches of customs,  currency, and other laws of the Russian Federation and Yakutia.</p>

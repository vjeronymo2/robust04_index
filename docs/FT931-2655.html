			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Arjo declines to Pounds 161m and cuts final  -Worsening trading conditions expected, perhaps continuing into 1994 ARJO WIGGINS Appleton, the paper group, yesterday announced a 30 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 231m to Pounds 161m in 1992 and warned of worse to come in its European markets. Mr Cob Stenham, chairman, said AWA expected 'a further worsening of trading conditions in 1993, which may well continue into 1994.' However, Mr Alain Soulas, chief executive, said AWA had fared better than many of its competitors in Europe. Mr Stenham said the company could not guarantee to maintain its 1992 dividend in 1993, although the decision on the final would be taken with a clearer view of 1994 prospects. This time the final has been reduced from 5.05p to 3.85p, a sharper cut than had been expected when the interim was lowered to 2.65p (3.3p). The group shocked shareholders in September when it announced the interim cut. Analysts yesterday were still suspicious about dividend policy. Some said it was driven by the interests of St Louis, the French group which holds a 39 per cent stake. Mr Stenham said the board had been unanimous on the payment. He said AWA now aimed to keep dividend cover between 2 and 2 1/2 times on average over a period of years. Earlier the policy was to keep cover within that range each year. The 1992 dividend was covered 1.8 times by earnings per share of 11.6p (18p). Earnings were depressed by a rise in the tax charge from 37 to 43.2 per cent. Mr Tony Isaac, finance director, warned that the rate would rise further this year, perhaps to 46 per cent. Group sales rose to Pounds 2.62bn (Pounds 2.49bn) but margins were squeezed by lower prices and operating profits fell from Pounds 247m to Pounds 193m. Increased losses at Soporcel in Portugal, lifted the deficit from associates to Pounds 3m (Pounds 1.6m). The interest charge rose from Pounds 13.7m to Pounds 28.9m. Mr Isaac said debt rose from Pounds 147m to Pounds 285m, with gearing up from 13.6 to 23.6 per cent. The group was two years into a three-year Pounds 500m programme of investment and acquisitions. Gearing would rise further in 1993, he warned, to about 35 per cent, but would fall in 1994. Operating profits from European paper making fell 48 per cent to Pounds 70.5m. Despite growth in demand for many grades, overcapacity led to lower prices. Appleton Papers, in North America, increased profits by 12 per cent to Pounds 117m. Paper merchanting profits fell 11 per cent to Pounds 15.5m, after redundancy costs of Pounds 2.6m. COMMENT AWA's shares rose 5p to 169p yesterday in relief, and are up 40p from the price they settled at on the day of the interim. AWA still has much fence mending to do with investors, especially any yield funds who have bought since September. There was some good news. Benefits from the merger two years ago are coming through and are expected to add about Pounds 22m to 1993 profits, with more to come. The burst of industry-wide capacity expansion inspired by the strong paper markets of the late 1980s is ending, even if it will take a couple of years before utilisation reaches a level which provides a decent return. Meanwhile a prospective p/e of over 17 looks on the high side when the yield support is unreliable.</p>

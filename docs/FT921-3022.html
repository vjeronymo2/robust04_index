			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): When a buy-out becomes a sell-out It is widely acknowledged that managers need professional advice when planning a buy-out, but less often realised that the vendor may also need specialist help. The directors of large, publicly quoted companies are no less prone to putting unrealistic values on businesses for sale than the owners of private companies. One listed company gave a buy-out team permission to raise finance, provided their offer was at least Pounds 9m. Three months later, when the buy-out team made an offer of just Pounds 5.2m, the vendor belatedly decided to appoint a corporate finance adviser. The adviser's research showed that Pounds 9m was not a realistic sum for either a buy-out or even a trade buyer. If the company had taken advice at the outset, it would have rejected the request to prepare a buy-out. The business was ultimately sold to a trade buyer for Pounds 6.3m. This is just one of the pitfalls which can trap the unwary vendor, not used to the rules of the management buy-out market, says Barrie Pearson, managing director of Livingston Fisher, a London-based acquisitions consultancy. Most buy-out teams are unable to match the price which can be offered by a trade buyer, which may often be able to make substantial savings by merging the newly-acquired business with an existing operation. There may, however, be particular circumstances, such as low profits, which make a buy-out the only realistic option. To find out which type of sale will achieve the best price, vendors must research a short-list of potential domestic and overseas buyers. If this reveals no interest, then the business can be offered to a buy-out team on an exclusive basis and within an agreed timetable. Trade buyers are often unwilling to make an offer if they know they are in competition with a buy-out team. Even if there is no buy-out offer, it may be worth offering the management team a bonus to co-operate with the sale of the business to another company. Management teams may not be above using 'dirty tricks' to win, Pearson warns. One vendor suspected that a management team leaked information to the trade press suggesting it had nearly completed negotiations when they were, in fact, at an early stage. The trade buyers all withdrew giving the managers a clear field. Vendors should also beware of acting solely on the basis of an oral offer from a potential buyer. One company suspended negotiations with possible trade buyers after the managers made an offer. But the company did not check which institution was to provide the finance and whether the offer had its backing. The institution's valuation was much lower than the buy-out team's offer and talks had to be restarted with the trade buyers. For a buy-out to succeed, the business involved must be self-contained. An electronics subsidiary which was up for sale paid a management charge for the use of the services of group sales offices, the staff of which were employed by the parent company. The financial backers of the buy-out objected at a late stage in the negotiations that the electronics company would not be independent if it still relied on its former parent company's sales force. Equally, if a company makes a large part of its sales to other group companies, it runs the risk of losing these markets once it is independent. This may deter financial backers from supporting a buy-out.</p>

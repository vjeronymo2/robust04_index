The main tasks of this session were to relay the guidelines  of the third plenary session of the Central Discipline  Inspection Commission and the standing committee meeting of the  provincial party committee, to sum up and review the  anticorruption work done in the previous stage, to study and  arrange the 1994 anticorruption tasks, and to study ways for  carrying out the anticorruption work in a sustained, profound,  and effective manner.    The session first relayed the guidelines of the third  plenary  session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and the  standing committee meeting of the provincial party committee.  On behalf of the standing committee of the provincial  discipline inspection commission, Li Qinglin, standing committee  member of the provincial party committee and secretary of the  provincial discipline inspection commission, delivered the  report work.    In his report, Li Qinglin basically reviewed the province's  anticorruption work done in 1993. He said: After the party  Central Committee arranged the short-term anticorruption  struggle last August, the party committees, governments, and  discipline inspection and supervisory organs at various levels  across the province adopted a resolute attitude toward the  struggle against corruption, actively went into action, and made  achievements in fulfilling the three tasks for opposing  corruption. Some of the achievements were comparatively  noticeable. The main indicators were as follows: Through  self-investigations, the leading cadres corrected some existing  problems. More than 24,000 cadres at or above the county and  section level or 98.4 percent of the total cadres conducted  self-investigation and self-correction in comparison with 13  prohibitions. As a result, more than 7,000 problems in 10  aspects were investigated, and more than 2,200 problems were  corrected. A number of unlawful and undisciplined cases were  investigated and handled. Last year, the discipline inspection  and supervisory organs put 6,438 cases on file and investigated  and concluded 6,343 cases or 98.5 percent. Of this, 13 cadres  at the prefectural and department level and 305 county and  section level were involved in these cases. Noticeable  achievements were made in straightening out and correcting  unhealthy trends. The province canceled more than 15,000  capital collection items and 40 abnormal touring parties that  planned to go abroad, thus reducing more than 5 million yuan of  expenses. Simultaneously, we also made better achievements in  straightening out and correcting activities that party and  government organs engaged in business and ran enterprises and  the unhealthy trends within regions and trades.    In regard to the 1994 anticorruption struggle tasks, Li  Qinglin pointed out: In the first half of this year, we should  grasp three tasks. First, by the end of May, the leading bodies  at or above the county and section level should hold democratic  activities with the main content of administrative honesty and  self-discipline and make self-investigation and self-correction  in comparison with the five new rules; and in June, they should  report on and assess their democratic activities. Second, we  should continue to solve the problems of wantonly collecting  charges, going out of the country and the border to make trips  with public funds, and party and government organs running  enterprises and basically eliminate these problems by the end of  June. Third, we should thoroughly investigate and know the real  situation of leading cadres' sedan cars and private houses and  party and government organs and their working personnel using  enterprises' capital and being behind in repaying the money to  enterprises. We should work out plans and relevant policies to  eliminate the problems. In the latter half of the year, we  should also grasp three tasks. We should make up the missed  lessons for the leading bodies' democratic activities and assess  the administrative honesty of key leading bodies. We should  clear up leading cadres' sedan cars and private houses and the  problems that leading cadres use enterprises' money and are  behind in repaying money to enterprises and strive to make  achievements by the end of this year. The key departments  should set up, on a trial basis, the administrative honesty  system. This year, we should attend to investigating and  handling unlawful and undisciplined cases.    Li Qinglin said: The 1994 anticorruption tasks are extremely  arduous. We must further implement the responsibility system,  strengthen the leadership over the struggle against corruption,  expand the dynamics of the anticorruption work, exert efforts to  deeply and effectively wage the struggle, strive to thoroughly  eliminate corruption, pay attention to eliminating both root  causes and symptoms of corruption, strengthen the media  propaganda on the anticorruption work, and ensure a sustained,  deep, and effective progress of the anticorruption struggle.</p>

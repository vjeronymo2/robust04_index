			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / London's economy set for slow growth London's economy is expected to grow 3 per cent in 1994 and 2.8 per cent in 1995, slower than the UK average, according to the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The chamber says the recession hit the London economy particularly hard because of its exposure to the service sector but also because of a further erosion of its manufacturing base. London now has an unemployment rate higher than all other regions bar the north of England and Northern Ireland. The chamber says the housing market is a weak link, with London having the worst negative equity position in the country.</p>

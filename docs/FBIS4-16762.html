			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report in the "Weekend" column: "Party </F> Activists Have Had a Busy Weekend"]    [Excerpt] The past weekend has been rich in party events.  On 16 April, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord's [PRES]  Federal Council Presidium held its session which considered the  results scored by PRES regional organizations in local elections  (out of 122 candidates to local power bodies, 27 representatives  of the Shakhray party have been elected). Furthermore, the PRES  leadership discussed preparations for a "Russia-wide subbotnik  [day of voluntarily donated work] of civil reconciliation" as  well as a number of questions related to PRES' future activity.    On the same day the People's Party Free Russia's [PPFR]  Council met for a session. PPFR honorary chairman Aleksandr  Rutskoy and State Duma deputy Vasiliy Lipitskiy took part in its  work. The session participants shared their impressions from  their organization's activity in the recent period, making a  number of decisions aimed at invigorating the performance of  party structures, and also discussed changes and amendments in  the PPFR's program and rules. The "Rutskoy party" is expected  to acquire a "social-democratic" character, but the final  decision about the PPFR's ideological makeup will be made at a  party congress scheduled for the end of May. It is not ruled  out that a number of regional organizations of the "Rutskoy  party" will also take part in the congress of a new movement,  Accord for Russia [Soglasiye Radi Rossii], which is also to open  in May. Meanwhile, PPFR leader Vasiliy Lipitskiy deemed it  essential to express his negative attitude to the pending  signing of the Memorandum on Civil Peace, noting that real civil  accord can be based only on a radical change of course by the  ruling elite and the abandonment of "reforms for reforms' sake."  Pointing to the high likelihood of a major social explosion in  the very near future, Mr. Lipitskiy stated that "in such a  situation, public association leaders cannot sign with these  authorities an agreement that envisions preservation of the  status quo without running the risk of parting with their social  base."

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Militant French fisherman to stage demonstration in Brussels A GROUP of militant French fishermen left Brittany yesterday evening to travel by coach to Brussels where they plan today to stage a 'peaceful' demonstration outside the meeting of the EC management committee responsible for fisheries, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. French fishermen have for the past fortnight staged furious protests against the recent increase in imports of cheap fish into France, culminating on Tuesday in a violent attack on the fish market at Rungis, outside Paris, followed by a three-hour battle with police. The mood of the Breton ports was slightly calmer yesterday following the French government's assurances that the EC would agree to impose minimum prices on imported fish. However a group of trawlers blocked off a stretch of water in Les Landes usually used for military experiments in a gesture of solidarity with the Breton fishermen. Back in Brittany an action group of fishermen's wives plans to demonstrate this afternoon outside the town hall of Quimper, one of France's largest fishing ports.</p>

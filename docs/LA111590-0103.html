			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACBELL TO PUT PHONE BILLS ON PC DISKETTES  </P> <P> Corporate telephone customers, some who struggle with monthly phone bills that  typically run 600 to 1,200 pages, may get some relief next month from Pacific  Bell.  </P> <P> The phone company plans to start offering a billing system that will allow  companies to receive listings of their monthly charges on personal computer  diskettes. The bills, which come complete with special software, can simply be  inserted into personal computers, which then sort, group and analyze the  charges according to the customer's needs.  </P> <P> The target audience for the service, which will work with IBM personal  computers and compatible models, are large companies making 300,000 or more  toll calls per month and attorney's offices, ad agencies and other professional  firms that apportion telephone charges on a case or project basis.  </P> <P> "I have been asking for this for four years," said Paul Chapman, manager of  telecommunications at Trans World Airlines' Western regional headquarters at  Los Angeles International Airport.  </P> <P> Chapman said that the airlines' 1,500-worker complex at LAX is served by more  than 300 telephone lines and that the phone bill that he has been sorting and  analyzing by hand for years runs about 600 pages per month. "Now, I can do this  all on my PC spreadsheet program and be done with it in a fraction of the  time," he said.  </P> <P> Pacific Bell's computerized bill, which will cost $15 per month plus a $100  one-time charge, is the latest in a handful of similar products that phone  companies across the nation have recently begun to offer their business  customers, many of whom are reeling from the costs and chaos generated by the  deluge of new telecommunications services, including computer networks and fax  machines.  </P> <P> "As telecommunications, computer networks and the like become more important to  businesses, executives increasingly need to understand how these services are  being used in their businesses -- by whom, for how long and between what  locations," said Stephen Sazagari, a telecommunications analyst at Dataquest, a  San Jose market research firm. The information, he said, can help businesses  select not only the proper phone services to install but the most cost  effective.  </P> <P> Phone companies say their new computerized bills satisfy this "need to know"  and give them a competitive advantage serving large business customers,  traditionally the most valued by utilities because of their volume usage and  lower per-capita maintenance requirements.  </P> <P> A Pacific Bell spokesman admitted the company's primary motivation in offering  the new service -- after studying its potential for nearly four years -- is its  concern that its monopoly market will be opened up to competitors in coming  years, competitors who could lure away valued corporate business.  </P> <P> "We have customers who swear they would leave us is we ever pulled Fonview,"  said Robin Lloyd, the manager of U.S. Sprint's computerized billing system.  </P> <P> However, some analysts remain largely unconvinced that the bill-on-a-diskette  represents much of an improvement over paper bills, especially when compared to  what businesses could have.  </P> <P> The real breakthrough service that big businesses need, said Douglas Gold,  director of communications research at International Data Corp. in Framingham,  Mass., is on-line, instantaneous monitoring of telephone usage.  </P> <P> Allowing businesses to tap into phone companies' computers to retrieve daily,  or even hourly, phone usage summaries, he argues, could provide vast quantities  of information so quickly that businesses could adjust their strategies and  marketing programs.  </P> <P> "These boutique billing options they have now are fine, but we're going to have  to wait for a few more years for the more valuable billing services, such as  instantaneous, minute-by-minute accounting of network usage," Gold says.  </P></p>

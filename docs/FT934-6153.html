			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Taipei eases foreign investment curbs Taiwan yesterday announced a package of reforms easing curbs on foreign investment in its financial markets to accompany the island's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Reuter reports from Taipei. All curbs on remittances of capital gains and principal out of Taiwan by foreign investors in the island's securities markets would be removed, the finance ministry said. Foreign investors would have nine months after initial approval to bring funds into Taiwan, up from six months at present. The 10 per cent ceiling on combined foreign investment in any individual stock, and a 5 per cent ceiling on investment by a single foreign institution, would both be raised. An official said the first ceiling would be raised to 20-30 per cent, and the second to 10-15 per cent. The ministry planned to abolish all curbs on foreign investment in securities houses, insurance firms and investment companies. The reforms 'will open our markets, helping us to join Gatt and speeding our development into a regional financial centre,' the ministry added. All relevant government agencies had agreed to the reforms, which still needed the approval of the cabinet and in some cases parliament. No schedule was set. Foreign fund managers welcomed the reforms. Curbs on fund remittances, such as a rule that capital gains can only be remitted out once a year, have helped deter inflows of foreign equity investment funds, totalling Dollars 1.86bn (Pounds 1.24bn) since 1991.</p>

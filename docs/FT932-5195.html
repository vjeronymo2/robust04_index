			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Rio summit treaty wins support THE international treaty to combat global warming, agreed a year ago at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, could come into force as early as mid-1994, United Nations officials said yesterday. The treaty, signed by 162 nations, has already secured 21 ratifications out of the 50 required to bring it into effect. They include the US, Japan and China, among the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are warming the earth's atmosphere. Climate model forecasts suggest the earth's average surface temperature will increase by between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees centigrade over the next 100 years, which could cause disruption to farming, desertification, a higher risk of floods and storms, and a rise in the sea level from melting icecaps. The treaty aims to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions by developed countries at 1990 levels by the year 2000, which would slow but not prevent further temperature rises. Treaty commitments will be reviewed as new evidence comes in. Mr Michael Zammit Cutajar, executive secretary of the treaty's interim secretariat in Geneva, said yesterday that donor countries had indicated a willingness to put up an additional SDR2bn-SDR3bn (Dollars 2.9bn-Dollars 4.3bn) for 1994-96 to help developing nations implement the convention.</p>

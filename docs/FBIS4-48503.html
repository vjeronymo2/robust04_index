			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Nampula by correspondent Eduardo Constantino] </F>   [Text] Like at the port city of Nacala yesterday, the  residents of the city of Nampula today asked President Joaquim  Chissano to contest the general elections scheduled for 27-28  October 1994. The request was made at a mass rally held at the  Mozambique Railroad-North Square this morning. The rally was  the highlight of the Mozambican head of state's visit to the  province. Addressing more than 15,000 people, President  Chissano said he will comply with the people's wishes and take  part in the upcoming elections.    Chissano said long before he visited Gaza, Sofala, and Tete  Provinces, people from various political parties mobilized the  residents to neither welcome him nor to attend his rallies.  Chissano said the same thing happened in Nampula -- namely, in  Malema and Lalaua -- where scores of people were seen in those  districts a few days before his arrival. Those people stirred  the residents, telling them, quote, Chissano will no longer come  here because he is afraid. He is afraid because he knows we are  here, unquote. Despite those appeals, there were large numbers  of people wherever the Mozambican head of state went. They sang  and danced, something that surprised the head of state because  he knew the living conditions under which they live.    Joaquim Chissano said a number of parties had said about a  year ago that they had already won the elections in Nampula,  Sofala, and Manica, and that Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation  Front] and Chissano would only receive a few votes in southern  Mozambique. In the north, they claimed, it is their country.  Chissano added: Frelimo and I have been welcomed in those  provinces, but we have not yet said we have won the elections.  It is the people who will decide who the winner is. We are  going to work to win the elections, but meanwhile we will not  claim victory like they do. The Mozambican head of state said it  is the people who should claim victory because they are the ones  to decide who will rule the country in the future.    Like in other places where he chaired mass rallies, in the  city of Nampula the president of the Republic once again  stressed that the task of all of us right now is to uphold peace  and national reconciliation, and to work hard in line with the  principle of unity among all Mozambicans from north to south.    Right now the Mozambican head of state is scheduled to be in  Nacaroa, Erati District, on his way to Namapa. This will mark  the end of his visit to the province. Joaquim Chissano left the  city of Nampula for Namapa at about 1500. During his trip he  met the residents of Nacavala and Namialo in Meconta District.  He is scheduled to meet the residents of Alua in Namapa  District. He is scheduled to spend the night in Namapa.  Tomorrow morning he will visit the local rural hospital, which  has just been renovated. Also tomorrow morning, he will chair a  mass rally in the capital of Namapa District. Tomorrow  afternoon the head of state is scheduled to cross the Lurio  River thus beginning his visit to Cabo Delgado Province.</p>

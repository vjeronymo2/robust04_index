			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Appointments: Verey rises at SG Warburg Rival cultures live on inside SG Warburg, the UK's top home-grown investment bank. It may be six years since the bank was created, pieced together out of some of the City's leading houses; but former partners of Rowe &amp; Pitman, a stockbroker now subsumed in the group, still cleave jealously to their old identity. Against that background, the emergence of Nicholas Verey - a 49-year-old who joined Rowe &amp; Pitman at the age of 18 - as a managing director of investment banking at Warburg almost looks like the anointment of an old-style senior partner in the stockbroking world. He will be deputy chairman of SG Warburg Securities. Verey, who has been chairman of Warburg in the US only since June 1990, will return in the autumn to take over from Peter Hardy, another Rowe &amp; Pitman man. Hardy has managed 38 years with the firm, though he has still not reached his 54th birthday. Warburg said that he had always intended to retire in his mid-50s, playing down any suggestion of internal dissension. Verey will become one of three managing directors of the group from June this year. ***** Sir John Banham is appointed a non-executive director of NATIONAL POWER with effect from July 1 when he ceases to be director general of the CBI and becomes chairman-elect of the Local Government Commission. He is a former controller of the Audit Commission and a member of the Policy Studies Institute.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A session of the Council of Representatives of the  Hungarian Democratic Union in Romania [HDUR] is continuing in  Miercurea Ciuc. Laszlo Tokes, honorary president of the  Council, has sent a letter to the representatives. Our special  correspondent Peter Marvanyi reports.    [Marvanyi] Only 30 days remain from the six-month period  that  the Council of Europe gave Romania to fulfill the conditions  laid down when Romania was admitted as a Council member. To  this day, Romania has not fulfilled one single obligation it  undertook, not even those which directly affect the Hungarian  minority in Romania, their minority, and human rights. Bishop  Laszlo Tokes, HDUR honorary president -- who is not present here  in Miercurea Ciuc -- has warned the Council of Representatives  about all this in a letter. The parliament, or more precisely  one of its committees, is drafting a resolution linked to this.    By the way, yesterday, after reading out Bishop Tokes's  letter, Csaba Takacs, executive chairman of the Council of  Representatives, said the HDUR is constantly collecting  documents relating to the Council of Europe's conditions and  registering the events, or more precisely the actions which the  Romanian Government has mostly failed to carry out. The HDUR  will submit the material to international forums.</p>

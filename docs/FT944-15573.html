			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Policy on asylum seekers rapped The Home Office practice of detaining asylum seekers for long periods without giving reasons is severely criticised in two reports from humanitarian organisations published today. In one report, based on a study tracking the fortunes of 50 detained asylum seekers over 14 months, Amnesty International's British section says procedures violate international human rights laws and standards. The other report, from the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, a UK-based charity, finds that people who seek asylum after surviving torture in their own countries are being detained in Britain for periods ranging from two to 17 months. About 600 asylum seekers in the UK, out of 50,000 under consideration, are detained pending a decision on their claims. Amnesty believes that 'in most cases detention is neither necessary nor for reasons recognised as legitimate under international standards'. It cites four specific international agreements to which the UK is a party. These agreements say that anyone deprived of their liberty is entitled to challenge the lawfulness of their detention before a court, that detainees must be given 'prompt and full communication' of the reasons for detention, and that 'refugees and asylum seekers shall, whenever possible, not be accommodated with persons detained as common criminals'. Amnesty finds all these provisions routinely violated under the British system. On average, Amnesty says, the asylum seekers in its study - none of whom was charged with any criminal offence - were detained almost three times as long as remand prisoners charged with serious offences. Twenty-two of the 50 were eventually released, either on bail or on 'temporary admission', while their cases were still unresolved. None of these later absconded or failed to comply with the con-ditions of their release. The report also condemns the lack of any requirement that detentions should be justified to a court or similar review body. The Medical Foundation report is based on 47 cases of detained asylum seekers visited by doctors from the Foundation since January 1993. In 45 of these, the foundation was able to document evidence of torture, but detention continued none the less. The report stresses that detention, besides adding significantly to the distress of torture survivors, 'makes it more difficult to make decisions about a person's credibility', because of the trauma it produces.</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Management: A risky exercise at the BBC - John Birt's dilemma Leaders who try to achieve radical change in their organisations almost always face vilification at the outset. They are denounced with especial venom if most of their employees can see no external crisis, and so no great need for change. They are cursed to the rooftops if they try to enforce it by dictating new ways of working, rather than by first creating a broad and deep consensus on what needs to be done. This phenomenon has plagued a string of tough-guy business leaders who have taken their organisations by the scruff of the neck over the past decade and tried to haul them screaming into the world of late 20th century management. Consider, above all, Jack Welch of US General Electric. Since the late 1980s he has been recognised for what he is - one of the most effective transformational leaders of our age. Starting brutally in 1981, he yanked GE out of its illustrious, but over-confident past and turned it into one of the few large US corporations which has a decent global market share in many of its businesses. Six years ago much of his organisation still spat blood at him. 'Mad Jack' and 'management by fear' were just two of the politer epithets about his style which echoed around GE - and outside it. But he then mended matters by showing he had learned the need to accompany 'hard' change (or follow it) with 'softer' measures to change the corporate culture. These included several continuous education initiatives, and also a highly participative 'workout' programme of removing needless rules and work procedures. GE is now home to some very far-reaching employee 'empowerment' successes. Other companies have learned from its experience, accelerating their change processes - and defusing early opposition - by introducing 'hard' and 'soft' initiatives in parallel. If Welch has listened to US Public Service Broadcasting (PBS) over the past week, or perused the British press - which he does often - he will feel some sympathy for an equally high-profile UK chief executive who has now landed himself in a similar position, attracting complaints of 'Stalinism'. But Welch's sympathy will be limited, because his counterpart is a less effective leader and his problems are partly self-made. The man in question is John Birt, who seven months ago took over as director-general of Britain's nearest equivalent to PBS, the British Broadcasting Corporation. For the benefit of readers who are not fixated by the regular spate of storms at the BBC, a summary of Birt's situation is required. He is trying to achieve something far harder than the loosening-up exercise which Welch performed on an over-controlled GE: Birt has to create a tightly managed enterprise out of a loose, public-sector collection of fiefdoms which have thrived in creative terms for decades - but with manifest financial waste - beneath an ineffective, committee-ridden bureaucracy. Behind this attempted revolution lies Birt's twofold mission: to ensure that a traditionally hostile government is so struck by the BBC's sudden surge in cost-effectiveness that it renews its charter in 1996, together with its prime source of financing, a licence fee levied on every TV user; and to shore up the BBC's market share against an ever-rising flood of rival TV and radio stations. Birt's prime method of change has been to force through the creation of an (over-fragmented) internal market through a procedure called 'producer choice'. This is an unfortunate term for what is, in effect, a cost control mechanism. If Birt were to ask Welch for advice on his predicament, he would receive some tough-talking - not about what he is trying to achieve, but about how. For Birt has made a series of mistakes which are fundamental to the (mis)management of change. Some spring from his uncommunicative and uninspiring public persona - an utter contrast with Welch and other successful 'change masters'. Other errors flow from the advice he has been given by some of the accountancy-based management consultancies on which he has relied to an excessive extent. Most fundamentally, he is failing to apply properly modern US and European experience of how to lead transformational change. In the UK, all sorts of private and public sector organisations, from BP and ICI to hospitals schools and even a few local authorities, are achieving uncomfortable change by setting a top-down direction, and then stimulating the enthusiasm, participation and initiative of their staff. Birt did help spark a year-long consultation exercise before he took over, but it has failed to create much consensus. Nowhere was this more evident last week than in a newspaper article by one of his top advisers, David Hatch, which reeked with language about 'we' and 'them' (as in 'we will tell them. . .' and 'their lack of uncertainty about our objectives' - my italics). It is hard to imagine a less effective way of preparing the ground for the sort of 'ownership' or 'buy-in' which any programme of change must create if it is to succeed. That is done not by diktat and cursory 'sheep dip' re-training for staff, but - as at BP - by co-opting change agents among existing employees at all levels, and inspiring rather than ordering them to enthuse their own colleagues in turn. For this to work, open debate must be encouraged; it can be discreetly 'facilitated' and kept within bounds. If all this has proved necessary to accomplish change in multinational machine bureaucracies, it is even more vital in a creative 'know-how' organisation such as the BBC. Birt's apparent failure to recognise this so far - or to apply it effectively - has contributed heavily to the very poor state of staff morale which was all too evident in the employee attitudes survey published on Friday. Birt and his advisers have also shown poor judgment on two other counts: his special personal salary arrangements, and those of other top staff; and last week's seeming shift of the BBC's business strategy away from Birt's initial up-market focus - a shift he then denied. Some employees will always resist change. But for most to 'buy-in' to it, they need faith in their leader as an individual and in his strategic vision. Welch built both in spades. Birt's lack of them could yet be his undoing.</p>

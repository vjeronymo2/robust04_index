			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRAWING INTEREST;  </P> <P> BRADLEY INQUIRIES THRUST LOW-PROFILE CITY TREASURER INTO THE SPOTLIGHT  </P> <P> Los Angeles Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg settled into a witness chair in the  City Council chambers last month for what was to be a historic hearing into the  city's investigation of Mayor Tom Bradley for possible conflicts of interest.  </P> <P> As Rittenberg made himself comfortable next to City Atty. James K. Hahn, City  Council President John Ferraro leaned to an aide.  </P> <P> "Who's that guy next to Hahn?" Ferraro whispered.  </P> <P> It may have been the last day that any member of the City Council would have  trouble recognizing Rittenberg.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Figure in Bradley Queries  </P> <P> The city treasurer has emerged as a central figure in the investigations into  the mayor's relationship with Far East National Bank, which paid Bradley to act  as its adviser at the same time it was receiving city deposits.  </P> <P> And Rittenberg's office, which has responsibility for all $2 billion of the  city's idle cash, has become the focus of concern for the City Council.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Councilwoman Gloria Molina asked the council to order a  management audit of Rittenberg's policies. While her effort lost on a vote,  Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said his Finance and Revenue Committee will report  to the council as early as July on the treasurer's investment policies.  </P> <P> One of the actions prompting the ongoing Bradley probe was a telephone call  made by the mayor to Rittenberg in March, in which Bradley inquired about city  deposits at Far East. After the call, Rittenberg had his aides deposit $2  million in city funds at the bank. The treasurer said later that Bradley had  not pressured him to deposit the money.  </P> <P> In another instance that has drawn the council's attention, Rittenberg's staff  allowed $1.2 million to sit in an account at Far East National Bank, earning no  interest, for several months. Rittenberg took the blame for the error.  </P> <P> But city officials who have dealt with the 21-year veteran of the city  treasurer's office say that such mistakes are not characteristic of his career.  According to them, Rittenberg is a strong manager adept at computer  technologies and the rapidly changing financial markets with which his office  must deal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reputation as Activist  </P> <P> And, in an otherwise staid and colorless office, he has earned a reputation as  an activist.  </P> <P> Rittenberg's low profile among the council members was credited to his  performance over the years.  </P> <P> "I think the treasurer's office has been a relatively invisible office," said  Yaroslavsky, who as chairman of the Finance and Revenue Committee knows  Rittenberg better than most on the council.  </P> <P> "Invisible primarily because it has not gotten the city in any trouble. Around  here, when you know somebody's name, it's not because they did an outstanding  job. It's because they screwed up."  </P> <P> Rittenberg, 57, was appointed treasurer by Bradley and quickly confirmed by the  council in 1987. He had joined the office in 1968 as an accountant after an  eclectic academic career that included majors in chemical engineering,  mathematics and business administration. He eventually earned a degree in  accounting from UCLA, served in the military and graduated from the San  Fernando College of Law.  </P> <P> He steadily rose in the treasurer's office to become chief deputy in 1981, and  when then-Treasurer Robert Odell became ill in 1986, Rittenberg was named  acting treasurer. Odell died in 1987.  </P> <P> In selecting a successor for the $83,415-a-year job, Bradley picked the No. 1  finalist from a list of 12 drawn up by the city's Personnel Department.  </P> <P> While Rittenberg was still acting treasurer, he and Yaroslavsky traveled to New  York together on city business.  </P> <P> "He was a doer," Yaroslavsky said. "He wanted to be more of an activist than  Odell had been. . . . Rittenberg was more aggressive, more impatient, more  wanting to get things done more quickly."  </P> <P> It may have been a penchant for activism that has landed Rittenberg in hot  water.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Minority-Owned Banks  </P> <P> At the heart of the City Council's concern is a policy developed independently  by Rittenberg that allows millions of dollars of city funds to be invested in  minority-owned banks at rates that may not be the highest available. Rittenberg  says the policy, which has been supported by the mayor's office, is an  extension of the city's existing programs to encourage minority business.  </P> <P> Explaining himself in a May interview, Rittenberg said: "The city and myself as  city treasurer have a responsibility and commitment to assist those banks that  contribute to the community. By placing deposits with (minority) banks, I have  an expectation that this money will increase the amount for new loans in the  community. It has been my position to become extremely pro-active in this  pursuit. . . . I have a social conscience, and I feel this must be done."  </P> <P> Since that interview, Rittenberg has refused to speak with the press and his  staff has been instructed not to give any interviews.  </P> <P> Under the city's somewhat unusual structure, the treasurer receives funds from  taxpayers and other sources and deposits or invests the monies. Only the city  controller can disburse funds. When the controller needs money to pay the  city's bills, he asks the treasurer to release some of the funds.  </P> <P> Just three city workers, sitting at gray metal desks in the bowels of City  Hall, handle the task of placing the city's $2-billion cash flow. More than $1  billion comes and goes in the course of a month, and hundreds of deposits are  received each day. Rittenberg, while not personally investing all of the city's  funds, oversees all the department's work.  </P> <P> Treasurers for other cities have said Rittenberg's minority-investment policies  are unusual, and they may not comply with the City Charter, which calls on the  treasurer to seek the highest rates possible. In recent annual audits, the city  controller's office has identified what it considered "weakness" in internal  controls -- many of which have since been strengthened -- but otherwise gave  the treasurer's office a clean bill of health.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Return on Investments  </P> <P> Rittenberg typically places in the top half to one-third of California's big  city treasurers in his return on investment, according to some studies. And  that has meant good money for the city.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, for example, when city officials prepared the annual budget,  their revenue projections were several million dollars higher than those made  by independent economists. The city's figures were higher, it turned out,  because Rittenberg had timed the markets correctly and had placed most of the  city's funds in long-term, high-yielding accounts just as interest rates peaked  earlier this year.  </P> <P> According to city workers, Rittenberg is considered shy, serious and an  approachable administrator. But the criticism and publicity of recent months  have taken a toll, according to Yaroslavsky.  </P> <P> "I think he's going through hell now," Yaroslavsky said. "When you come to work  for the city of Los Angeles as treasurer . . . you never expected to be reading  about yourself on the front page of the newspaper."  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky, while publicly saying he is "very concerned" about Rittenberg's  policies, said he has counseled the treasurer to "relax a little bit and focus  on the future. What has happened has happened. . . . The sun will rise  tomorrow, and he will still be the treasurer."  </P> <P> Perhaps taking that advice, Rittenberg wrote a letter to key City Council  members late last month.  </P> <P> "The highly publicized events of the past two months have resulted in  considerable misconception and distortion of the city treasurer's operations,"  he wrote. "As department head, I am responsible for the errors made by my staff  and, similarly, I am also responsible for the achievements made by my staff.  During my three years as acting treasurer and treasurer, this office has  generated nearly $30 million of additional revenue. . . .  </P> <P> "I am proud of the city treasury's accomplishments."  </P></p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Greenpeace wins right to fight Thorp tests GREENPEACE, the environmental pressure group, yesterday won permission to bring a High Court challenge against the government's decision to allow radioactive testing of the Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield. But the court also ruled yesterday that British Nuclear Fuels can begin testing the Pounds 2.8bn plant's systems with uranium ahead of the two-day review, which is set to begin on September 14. However, Greenpeace said last night that it had secured an Appeal Court hearing tomorrow for its application to overturn the decision to allow testing. Greenpeace said that this could still prevent the plant becoming contaminated with radioactivity as 'BNF told us after the hearing that radioactive material will not be introduced into the plant for six days'. Both sides claimed victory yesterday after the court hearing in the latest round of the increasingly complex deliberations about whether the plant should be allowed to start reprocessing used nuclear fuel. BNF said: 'We welcome the news that Greenpeace have failed in their attempt to halt uranium (testing).' Ms Bridget Woodman, Greenpeace's nuclear campaigner, said: 'We are very happy to have won our application to seek judicial review.' Last week ministers told BNF that it could begin testing the plant with radioactive material to save time if a licence is eventually granted. The proposed tests will check radioactivity-measuring equipment and the part of the plant that separates reusable fuel from the waste. In refusing to block the testing ahead of September 14, the judge said that he had been 'very considerably influenced' by BNF's estimates of its financial loss and by Greenpeace's likely inability to compensate BNF for that loss if BNF argued successfully that the delay was unjustified. Mr George Newman QC had argued for BNF that if a 'stay' on testing had been granted it could have cost the company up to Pounds 2m a week and put 700 jobs at risk. But the judge also said that Greenpeace had 'an arguable case' for a judicial review of the decision to allow testing. Greenpeace is arguing that by allowing testing to go ahead the government is prejudicing the decision on the plant's licence. BNF needs the same licence to generate nuclear waste and emit radioactive discharges to carry out tests as it would for full operation of the plant, Greenpeace claims. If Greenpeace is successful on September 14, it will simply halt testing, not the granting of a full licence. The government's decision on the future of the plant is not due until after the current public consultation, which is due to end on October 4. But ministers have already said that they are 'minded' to grant authorisation.</p>

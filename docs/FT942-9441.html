			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Marketing power of electronic cash cards Sir, You report ('EU curbs urged on cash card issuers', May 11) that the European Monetary Institute recommends legislation to give banks a monopoly in the issuance of electronic cards used as a substitute for cash. At first sight this seems appropriate. These are pre-paid cards so the issuers, like banks, will hold deposits from the general public. This suggests they should be supervised in the same way as banks. But it is essential that new entrants be encouraged, to create competition and speed up innovation. However, much bigger issues are at stake. Electronic cash cards will, within a few years, offer issuers immense power over information about spending patterns of different types of consumer. This information will be highly valuable in marketing and in product development. Who will own it? The cards may also in future allow currently unheard-of opportunities to boost profits by discriminating among different groups of consumers, for example by offering discounts for customer loyalty, or lower prices to people on low-incomes. Who will control access to the necessary data? Even more intriguing, as electronic transactions become almost universal, the technical question of international compatibility of cash cards will become an issue of sovereignty. If the pound remains outside the single currency, will the British government allow residents, as well as visitors, to use cards loaded with Ecus in stores throughout the UK? Will French residents be able to use cards loaded with US dollars everywhere in Paris? If yes, smaller currencies, at least if they have any hint of instability, will rapidly disappear almost completely. This is currency competition, as envisaged by the UK's Treasury in its response to the Delors report, something that was impractical in the old days of notes and coins. Governments will be tempted to prevent this by keeping their retail systems incompatible with others, a type of electronic protectionism. The EMI's apparently innocuous recommendation has far-reaching commercial and political implications. It should be be subject of the widest possible debate.

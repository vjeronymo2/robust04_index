			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Orthodox Christmas offers little cheer A HANDFUL of Serbs gathered yesterday in a Sarajevo church, within range of the heavy guns of their brethren, for a chilly and somber commemoration of Orthodox Christmas that matched the mood of the besieged capital. Orthodox Christmas is normally a joyous occasion, but there was little to celebrate yesterday. Several miles west of St Michael the Archangel church, venue of the Christmas Mass, 108 elderly citizens huddled in the only heated room of their nursing home. The building, in the Serb-held suburb of Nedzarici, is under continuous small-arms fire. More than 40 residents have died since October, most of them victims of the war or the bone-numbing cold of a Balkan winter. The home's social worker, Ms Lydia Groznic, said on Tuesday that 10 had died in the past 36 hours. Their bodies were wrapped in blankets and stored in an empty room. No autopsies were done, but with inside temperatures at -14 degrees Celsius cold appeared the culprit. Reporters dodged sniper fire yesterday to enter the home. They saw 50 people huddled near wood-burning stoves; one old woman was in a coma while others appeared to be suffering from frostbite. Attempts to talk to the home's supervisor were cut short by armed Serbs who chased the reporters out of the building. Relief officials have forecast that thousands will die this winter of cold and hunger in Sarajevo and more isolated areas of war-wracked Bosnia. Temperatures have been as low as -17 degrees Celsius in many Sarajevo homes in recent weeks, and the city has been without electricity since its main power lines were downed in heavy fighting nearly a month ago. The power cut-off has also stopped pumps that supply water for the city's 380,000 residents. Many houses are without window glass or walls. UN officials also say a pipeline carrying Russian-supplied natural gas is being cut off somewhere in Serb-controlled territory. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees announced on Tuesday that it was doubling food shipments to Sarajevo to 400 tons a day, but it was unclear whether the agency could make good on the promise.</p>

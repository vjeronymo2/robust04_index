			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report After attempting to consolidate above Dollars 380 an ounce the London GOLD price moved lower in line with a weaker tone in New York. At the close it was quoted at Dollars 379.20 an ounce, down Dollars 3.05 on the day. 'We got trade selling with a vacuum on the downside,' said one New York dealer. 'We've been unable to get above the unchanged level, much less above yesterday's high of Dollars 387.20 (for the December futures position).' ZINC'S recent decline was temporarily halted and after setting a fresh six-year low of Dollars 878 a tonne, the London Metal Exchange three months price rallied on trade support to end the kerb session at Dollars 890 a tonne, up Dollars 6. At the London Commodity Exchange COCOA prices, supported by an initially firmer New York market and weaker sterling, closed up to Pounds 3 higher in active months but in routine total turnover of 4,814 lots. But traders did not rule out the possibility of a further slide. COFFEE prices dropped back from morning highs in what dealers said was a slight correction to an exaggerated upward move on Monday.

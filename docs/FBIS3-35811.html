			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Russia's Choice [RC] Party in a statement to  INTERFAX on Monday, said it was in favor of "a viable and  effective government capable of embracing far-reaching reforms  and ensuring order and stability in the society."    RC denies media speculation that its criticism of the  government's social and economic measures is caused by its  abhorrence of the idea of a strong government in Russia.    The statement says RC is in favor of reducing the army of  government bureaucrats and their privilege of distributing  resources and issue licences and quotas which is the breeding  ground of iniquities, corruption and bribes. The party spells  out support for "a small and thrifty state, but for a highly  professional government."    The statement says that is the reason why the RC is opposed  to the idea of numerous benefits and privileges to members of  the State Duma and the construction of a new parliament building.</p>

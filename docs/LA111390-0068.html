			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A LEG UP, NOT A HANDOUT;  </P> <P> INDEPENDENT HOLLYWOOD COMPANY HIRES THE HOMELESS FOR 'JEREMIAH POLLOCK'  </P> <P> A white Lincoln Continental with two well-dressed couples inside slows down to  a near-crawl, four faces all but pressed against the windows, as it cruises  eastward on 9th Street in the early morning hours. Though they aren't about to  stop and ask questions, this being one of the most crime-ridden neighborhoods  in downtown Los Angeles, the couples can't help but stare at the klieg  light-illuminated commotion on the sidewalk.  </P> <P> A group of about 35 shabbily dressed men, most of them black, seems to be  clamoring for someone's attention in front of a motion picture camera mounted  on a crane. The Continental driver and passengers no doubt are wondering if the  camera subjects are homeless people causing some sort of scene or merely  actors.  </P> <P> The answer: both.  </P> <P> Skid Row denizens have been recruited not only as extras but as supporting  actors and even crew members on the set of "Jeremiah Pollock: The Life of an  American Saint," an independently produced drama shooting on location downtown  and in Glendale.  </P> <P> Hiring street people is, in the selfish sense, an attempt at gleaning utmost  authenticity by using the real homeless McCoys, and, on a more altruistic  level, an attempt to put something back into the community while taking  dramatic license from it.  </P> <P> The steps taken have been unusual for a Hollywood production: Three homeless  people have been hired as paid interns, each of whom will, at the end of  production, be provided with first and last months' rent and security deposit  money in order to hold down an apartment while looking for the next job. A  small percentage of the film's pre-profit receipts as well as net gross have  been earmarked for homeless charities. And then there are those -- some down on  their luck, some mentally ill -- who've been picked to be in the movie.  </P> <P> As written and directed by Eames Demetrios, an award-winning documentarian  making his first dramatic film, "Jeremiah Pollock" is a heavily stylized,  tragicomic fable about a wealthy computer wizard who takes drastic measures to  help the homeless and, in the process, tries in vain to absolve his own guilt.  In the scene being shot, the Pollock character has just given the penniless  locals an access code that will allow them to withdraw unauthorized cash from  bank automatic teller machines, and chaos is about to ensue.  </P> <P> No chaos on the set, though. The film crew and the Skid Row folk have been  getting along on this six-week shoot with minimal problems, though each group  feels out of its element at certain points in the production. This morning,  working in a "bad" area on a 7-p.m.-to-7-a.m. shooting schedule, it's the  crew's turn to get a little nervous.  </P> <P> "I was quaking in my boots earlier, but it's OK," said a female production  assistant. "This is supposed to be the worst night of the month down here,  because welfare checks just came out." And more money means more crack, at  least on this end of the Row, where missions are few and pipes are plentiful.  </P> <P> The smokers are huddling safely away in the dark around the corner, though. And  the more sober locals gathered to be immortalized in the mob scene seem pleased  to have been made a part of the film's making and not left as onlookers. That  inclusion is never a given, even when other movie crews come to the  neighborhood to use East Skid Row's mean streets as a colorful set.  </P> <P> Mike Neely, the director of the Homeless Outreach Project located on this same  block, has a beef with Hollywood invading his constituents' turf.  </P> <P> There was a big Hollywood production company that "shot a movie about the  homeless down here this summer, and guess what they did?" asks Neely. "They  brought in homeless people from central casting! Like we need more homeless  people down here. They brought cardboard boxes down. Hey, we've got tons of  cardboard boxes already. People here said, 'They got people made up to act  homeless, and I'm already homeless!' Out of a $20-million budget, this  community got (nothing). That burns me up. If that's not exploiting the  community, what is?  </P> <P> "That's insensitivity, but this is sensitivity," adds Neely, who has been a  bridge between the community and the "Jeremiah Pollock" filmmakers. Vegetarian  meals for the crew and Skid Row extras alike are being served up in the  Outreach Project's headquarters this morning. "It demonstrates how a production  company can work with a disadvantaged community and both of them can derive  some benefit.  </P> <P> "We haven't imported anybody -- they're all from right down here, all races,  all creeds represented. I've been really pleased at the way it worked out, that  our community had an opportunity to demonstrate we can do something. As you can  see, this is not an unruly group of people. Just regular people. Nobody came up  and threatened to hit you on the head."  </P> <P> Still, it's not a setting that lacks the potential for problems, and everyone  is keeping their eyes open as the late-night hours fly by.  </P> <P> "I went down to the doughnut shop to get cigarettes and there were 17 guys  standing outside smoking crack," says Mary Ann Dolcemascolo, the unit still  photographer. "And that was before sundown. Imagine what it's gonna be like at  3 in the morning. I used to hang around down here and shoot four or five years  ago, but things have gotten worse. Too much drugs. There used to be more  families." (The dark storefront of Para Los Ninos, a support center for  homeless parents and children, is a few doors down.)  </P> <P> The last time Dolcemascolo worked in this neighborhood was when the gang-themed  movie "Colors" shot some scenes nearby. Representatives of that production had  walked through the area well in advance and solicited the cooperation of the  locals, "but there's always people who aren't around and don't hear and then  want to create a problem . . . They were stoning the van."  </P> <P> "So many people that come down here to shoot, they take away," says Southern  Comfort, a member of the Homeless Writers Coalition who uses the liquor moniker  as his stage name. "They have actors that walk out of wardrobe all smudged up.  In my way of thinking, they could at least hire two or three (homeless) guys to  walk in back, and that would be a way of putting something back.  </P> <P> "This is a low-budget movie, and they're not making lots of money, but they're  doing something," he says. "And it's taking guys away from doing something that  could be detrimental to them or land them in jail. There's a lot of creativity  down here. If you don't have somewhere to exert that, it can turn into a  negative thing. It's good to be around other artists and not around other  non-productive things."  </P> <P> The clash of cultures wasn't always a smooth blending on the set. One of the  three homeless production interns, Rick (he preferred not to give his last  name), told of one early misunderstanding.  </P> <P> "They have stereotypes about us, and we have 'em about them. Just by the nature  of many of us being black while many of them are white, and that many of us  either live or have lived on Skid Row, when certain funny, strange things  happen, automatically you tend to think it's some kind of prejudice or  discrimination.  </P> <P> "There were incidents. They brought some people out that were living right on  the sidewalk and used them as movie extras. And there's a standard procedure in  Hollywood, I guess, that the crew members eat first, and the extras really are  almost like second-class citizens. When we were treated this way, we  automatically thought it was because we were from Skid Row and they were better  than us.  </P> <P> "I was getting mad about some of these things. It wasn't intended, but we  didn't know that that's how Hollywood works, that that's their procedure, that  these people eat first and we don't. We thought it was some kind of slight to  us, and it was just a misunderstanding.  </P> <P> "But I think, on their part, they should have possibly more looked into this  ahead of time. Like, say, if you were making a movie about gang members, and  you had gang members as extras, and you made them do different things that the  other people didn't do -- they may get mad and blow up the set, see."  </P> <P> "That's Walt Disney's nephew!" whispers one of the extras to another, pointing  across 9th Street toward Tim Disney, the film's executive producer. The excited  extra was off by only a little: Disney is the son of Roy Disney Jr., who was  the son of Walt's brother Roy.  </P> <P> There's no mistaking "Jeremiah Pollock" for a Touchstone release, however, in  either theme or budget. Disney did work for Walt Disney Pictures a few years  back, in the animation department -- he co-wrote the hit "Oliver and Company"  -- but has moved on to smaller and better things.  </P> <P> The projected budget for "Jeremiah Pollock" is about $350,000, which, Disney  admits, is about as inexpensively as you can make a full-length feature using  35-millimeter film stock. (The picture is being shot in black and white.) He  hopes to give it a good send-off at one of the prestigious film festivals next  year, to be followed by a run in selected theaters along the lines of, he says,  previous indie hits like "Stranger Than Paradise" and "Drugstore Cowboy."  </P> <P> Writer-director Eames Demetrios also hails from interesting stock, as the son  of San Francisco sculptor Aristides Demetrios and grandson of designer Charles  Eames. After several critically hailed documentaries, including ones focusing  on the legacies of his father and grandfather, he approached Tim Disney -- an  old Harvard classmate -- with the idea for a film that would center around  homelessness from a different perspective.  </P> <P> "I think it's going to surprise people," says Disney, "because it's a more  abstract treatment of the issue than they're expecting. It's not a feel-good  movie where homeless guy makes good. And it's not a documentary, which is I  guess the only thing that's been made about the subject except for some TV  films."  </P> <P> Straightforward it's not. In addition to providing the street people with  access to unlimited, unauthorized cash from bank machines, the title character  also decides to go on a secret hunger strike until homelessness is ended --  that is, until his death. The film's stylization comes in with this  semi-hallucinating character's awareness of Los Angeles as a literal urban  wilderness. It'll be on the surreal side, especially for any viewers led by the  title to expect a Mitch Snyder-style saint instead of the movie's somewhat  cracked hero.  </P> <P> "I think it's going to be a stretch for some audiences," says Disney, "but  that's what's gonna save it from being overly didactic. It's a hard subject to  talk about without being heavy-handed. I think the abstract elements embellish  or illustrate things without having to put it into words all the time."  </P> <P> And though the hero manages to provide the homeless with cash, most of them  then use it to buy drugs, with the exception of Jeremiah's chief antagonist,  Gregor, who buys a vacant lot and starts a farm. The message is that the  homeless must eventually be "ready to help themselves," equipped with the tools  of self-reliance.  </P> <P> "The point is not to say that people are bad because they're taking drugs,"  Demetrios explains. "What we're saying is that these problems are so complex  and deep-seated that you can't solve it just by handing somebody money, if you  don't offer any (psychological) reconstruction of their lives. The way we  usually solve big problems in our society is either by throwing money at them  or by symbolic action, neither of which is adequate. Something better is  required."  </P> <P> But isn't hiring a few homeless people for this production also a token act,  not quite as grand as the title character's movie martyrdom, but ultimately  just as symbolic?  </P> <P> "The way this industry works is, people say 'I'm looking for a production  assistant,' and we're trying to bring people into that network. That would be  the real victory. We'll see if that happens. That was our plan, not just to  offer a quick fix but to get people into a situation where they could get a  work history, because it's very hard to get a work history if you don't have an  address. And then give people a leg to stand on after the film, the leg being  the first and last months' rent so they'll have a base from which to look for  employment."  </P> <P> And what if, instead, the money is used in real life the same way as in the  script?  </P> <P> "When we went and shot downtown, and paid the extras money, I'm sure a lot of  them used that money to buy drugs," says Disney. "But that's not a  responsibility that we can take on. We can't decide for them how they spend  their money. Some of those people probably also bought food for their babies."  </P> <P> Florence Hawkins, an artist from the Skid Row area who was hired to paint some  of the surreal set backdrops, believes she'll go on to other film jobs through  this introduction to the business.  </P> <P> "When they hired me, it was like a dream come true, because it gives me an  opportunity not only to get a nice resume going but to go to other companies  when this project is over," she says. "They intend to give me a letter of  recommendation. At least I hope so."  </P> <P> Disney admits that, in the midst of encouragement, he's tried not to raise the  interns' hopes too high about their prospects for continued employment in the  film business.  </P> <P> "We tried to be optimistic but to stress that it's a competitive business,"  Disney says. "That's a serious problem we tried to deal with carefully. But  we're a film company, so there's only so much we can do. We're not a career  counseling organization. I wish our organization could exist long enough to  follow up -- because follow-up is something that's lacking in most homeless  programs.  </P> <P> "Still, I think if all small businesses took on a small program like ours, it  would make a world of difference. But nobody seems willing to help. Certainly,  the taxpayers don't."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, if central casting needs any more credible street people the next  time Hollywood comes calling, there'll be a "Jeremiah Pollock" alumni cast list  available. A few may be harder than others to reach -- some of the actors list  street-corner pay phones or shelter or flophouse lobby phones as their home  numbers on the call-up sheet -- but the savings in superfluous makeup and  wardrobe personnel for that special stubble look might be worth the extra  trouble. Cardboard boxes available on request.  </P></p>

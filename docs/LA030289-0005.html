			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BUILDER MAIN DONOR TO GROUP BACKING LAKE MIRAMAR PROJECT  </P> <P> A Scripps Ranch community group spent more than $457,000 -- $400,000 of the  total contributed by BCE Development -- to oppose a rival group's bid to block  development of the hills north of Lake Miramar, according to campaign finance  reports made public Tuesday.  </P> <P> The reports show that the Committee to Protect Your Community, which supports  BCE's city-approved plans to build 3,360 homes on 1,200 acres north of the  lake, raised virtually all of the money from BCE and other development firms.  </P> <P> The organization spent the funds gathering more than 52,000 signatures in  support of the project and opposing a rival group's effort to gather enough  signatures to force a citywide referendum.  </P> <P> The total is about four times the amount that Bob Dingeman, chairman of the  Committee to Protect Your Community, told reporters that his group had raised  during the January campaign.  </P> <P> Most of the money was spent to hire a professional petition-gathering firm, to  mount a citywide telephone campaign and to pay for public relations work and  direct-mail literature.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the rival organization, the Save Miramar Lake Committee, gathered  about 45,000 signatures, nearly 20,000 more than needed to force a citywide  referendum. The group, which has not yet filed a disclosure form, spent about  $20,600, said its co-chairman, J. Gary Underwood.  </P> <P> The Save Miramar Lake Committee is opposed only to the 658 homes planned for  the slopes north of Lake Miramar.  </P> <P> BCE has filed a lawsuit in Superior Court claiming that the petitions are  invalid. A hearing on a temporary injunction in the matter is scheduled for  Tuesday.  </P></p>

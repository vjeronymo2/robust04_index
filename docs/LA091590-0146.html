			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 6 WORKS TO HIGHLIGHT S.D. GLOBE SEASON  </P> <P> The West Coast premiere of a new play by A.R. Gurney and a California premiere  by two-time Pulitzer Prize winner August Wilson will highlight San Diego's Old  Globe Theatre's 1991 winter season of six new works, theater officials  announced this week.  </P> <P> The presentation of Wilson's "Two Trains Running" will mark the playwright's  third West Coast premiere in four years at the Old Globe. Gurney's "The Snow  Ball" will be his third world premiere here in three years.  </P> <P> The other world premieres will be Lillian Garrett's "The White Rose" and Larry  Ketron's "Sun Bearing Down," which have already been presented in staged  readings here earlier this year as part of the Old Globe's Play Discovery  Series.  </P> <P> The Globe is co-producing Wilson's "Two Trains Running" with the Yale Repertory  Theatre, where the play debuted earlier this year.  </P> <P> Like Wilson's two earlier Pulitzer Prize-winning plays, "Fences" and "The Piano  Lesson," "Two Trains Running" looks at another decade of African-American life  in the 20th Century; it takes place in a Pittsburgh diner in 1968 after the  assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  </P> <P> Tony-award winning director Lloyd Richards, who directed all of Wilson's  previous works in this series, will direct the play, which will run from March  14 to April 21.  </P> <P> The Old Globe will co-produce "The Snow Ball" with the Hartford Stage Company  in Hartford, Conn. "The Snow Ball," running here May 9 though June 16, is a  15-character play adapted from Gurney's novel of the same name. It focuses on  the author's familiar world of genteel but disenfranchised American WASPs.  </P> <P> The season at the Globe's two indoor theaters will begin with two world  premieres, "The White Rose" on the Old Globe main stage Jan. 17 to Feb. 24, and  "Sun Bearing Down" at the Cassius Carter Centre Stage Jan. 12 to Feb. 24.  </P> <P> "The White Rose," directed by Old Globe executive director Craig Noel, will run  Jan. 17 through Feb. 24. It is based on the true story of a band of German  students who were martyred fighting against Hitler.  </P> <P> "Sun Bearing Down," a story about life in a seafood restaurant along the South  Carolina coast, will be followed by the San Diego premiere of "Other People's  Money," Jerry Sterner's Off-Broadway comedy hit about a sleazy corporate raider  who tries to take over a New England town, running March 9 to April 21.  </P> <P> The Cassius Carter season will conclude with "La Fiaca," May 9 though June 16,  a black comedy from the Old Globe's Teatro Meta project.  </P></p>

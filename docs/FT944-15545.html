			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / People: Hook nets leading role Ivory &amp; Sime, the quoted Edinburgh-based fund management group, is getting a new managing director. Allan Munro, who has held the job since 1991, is stepping down and being replaced by Colin Hook, 52, who joins from Caledonia Investments, the holding company controlled by the Cayzer family which took a 29.9 per cent stake in I&amp;S in July. David Newbigging, chairman, said Munro had told him earlier this year he wished to step down to concentrate on his speciality, managing fixed interest portfolios. Munro was a member of the management committee which took over the running of I&amp;S in 1990 after the previous managing director David Ross and four senior fund managers abruptly left. Hook was founding managing director and shareholder of J Rothschild Charterhouse Management and Global Asset Management (Asia), two Asian fund management businesses in Hong Kong. His appointment is cautiously welcomed in Edinburgh investment management circles. 'Probably the first md I&amp;S have ever had from outside the company. He could be a new broom,' one observer said yesterday.</p>

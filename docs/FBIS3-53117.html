He called on the youth to confront those  people who advocate terrorism, whose hearts have been destroyed  by hatred, and who are working to spread corruption and crime in  Egypt in the name of religion, which is innocent of such crimes.  He said such people have harmed Islam. Nevertheless, the doors  of the state are still open for all those who have been  misguided to return to their senses once again and join the  Egyptian youth who are fighting for the future.    This was stated at the large student conference held at Qina  University yesterday on the occasion of the opening of the  university's cultural season. The conference was attended by  Yahya al-Bahansawi, the governor of Qina, and some governorate  figures. The minister added that the Governorate of Qina has  destroyed its image due to a small alien minority which does not  belong to it. Historically, Qina has always been known as a  country of science, writers, and intellectuals.    Major General al-Bahansawi, the governor of Qina, announced  that the state, despite its difficult economic circumstances and  the sufferings it is going through due to the many development  projects it is undertaking, has, nevertheless, provided a great  deal of support and potential for Upper Egypt to decrease the  suffering of its youth and help them lead their lives in a human  fashion. Qina is second among the governorates as regards the  allocation of employment projects for youths. The governor  added that 2,392 popular mosques in Qina have been included  under the ministry. These mosques have also been provided with  imams who are qualified Islamically, intellectually, and  spiritually. In addition, 2.5 million Egyptian pounds have been  allocated to maintain, repair, and renovate the rest of the  mosques in the governorate. Also, 2.25 million pounds were  allocated to establish the mosques of al- Hujayrat and  al-Humaydat -- the two towns of terrorism -- and to refurbish  and renovate the famous archaeological mosque in the  governorate, the mosque of 'Abd-al-Rahim al-Qina'i. The  minister of awqaf also approved the allocation of 750,000 pounds  to build a mosque at Qina University. The founding stone of  this mosque was laid yesterday and it will be called the mosque  of Martyr Major General 'Abd-al-Hamid Ghubarah, the assistant  Qina security chief who was martyred by terrorists.</p>

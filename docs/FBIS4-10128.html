			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Outlining the course he will set for  Chilean-Bolivian relations, Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa  said: "We must explore a whole world of possibilities in our  relations with Bolivia." Our relations with Bolivia have time  and again been marred by sporadic reactions by Bolivian military  officials, who have demanded, through unusual appeals, an outlet  to the sea for their country.    This is what happened on 22 March when the Bolivian Army  commander, General Reynaldo Caceres, called for a change in the  "thoughtless, obstinate attitude of the Chilean ruling class"  regarding the Bolivian landlocked situation, a position out of  keeping with history."    Figueroa was asked on 23 March about the approach he will  take regarding relations with Bolivia in light of the various  aspects posed by this issue. On the one hand, there have been  friendly gestures such as the cordial talks held by Figueroa  with Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar, as well as the  visit paid to Chile to attend the presidential inauguration by  Mrs. Ximena Iturralde de Sanchez de Lozada, the wife of the  Bolivian president, who conveyed a message to the Chilean  people. On the other hand, these gestures have been overshadowed  by remarks such as that by Gen. Caceres.    First, Figueroa said he will not comment on "remarks by  third  parties," alluding to Caceres. Second, he outlined his position  regarding "the course" he will take in our relations with  Bolivia.    Figueroa said: "It is Chile's desire to have the best  possible relations with Bolivia, in order to seek ways for  understanding in the areas of politics, economics, culture, and  tourism and for investment and infrastructure development in  border areas. There is a whole world of possibilities that must  be explored to develop these relations."    Figueroa outlined his position in a meeting he held with  Aranibar in Brasilia on 22 March. The two foreign ministers  took advantage of a meeting of Rio Group foreign ministers to  hold bilateral talks in Brasilia. At the end of the meeting,  Figueroa talked about searching for "creative formulas" to  develop Chilean-Bolivian ties. On 23 March he emphasized the  need for these formulas.    "These formulas could be applied within the whole spectrum  of  cooperation and to the work that two countries like Chile and  Bolivia -- which truly seek to maintain good relations -- could  undertake."

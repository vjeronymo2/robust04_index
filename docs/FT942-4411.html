			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / World Trade News: US secretary of commerce defends aggressive export policy Mr Ronald Brown, the US secretary of commerce, yesterday defended the aggressive export promotion stance of the US administration and promised to continue vigorous lobbying for US companies seeking international contracts, writes Quentin Peel in Dusseldorf. He said the recent US success in winning two multi-billion-dollar aerospace and telecommunications contracts in Saudi Arabia was proof that the policy was effective. Mr Brown yesterday re-opened the US consulate general in Dusseldorf and said this was part of a push to raise US exposure in Germany, and support exports, particularly of medium-sized US companies. Earlier, he had talks with Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the German minister for posts and telecommunications, and urged rapid liberalisation of the German telecoms market to give US suppliers greater access.</p>

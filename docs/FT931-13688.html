			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / People: Invesco lets in Tose Philip Tose, chairman of Hong Kong-based Peregrine Investments, has finally won a seat on the board of Invesco MIM, the UK fund managers in which he has built a 24.7 per cent stake, but the new non-executive director joins at a time of considerable upheaval within the group. Charles Brady took over as chief executive last August, with a brief to institute a more conservative investment and management style in the wake of the Maxwell and Drayton Consolidated fiascos. But since then, Nicholas Johnson, who was in charge of all the non-American business, has quit, and there is understood to be a good deal of unhappiness on the Far Eastern team. Brady has made a great success of his Atlanta, Georgia-based operation, but has yet to convince the rest of the group that he can manage to turn around the UK and sustain and develop the Far Eastern operations. While Tose might have expected his stake to warrant two seats on the board, he has had to agree to just one, and to the two-year standstill agreement that he will not increase his shareholding or have any real say in the management - even if he is technically being consulted on Far Eastern matters. Peregrine, which has blossomed since Tose and another former Vickers man, Francis Leung, struck out on their own at the beginning of 1989, currently has shareholders funds of around Pounds 255m. A shrewd man of few words, Tose is renowned for the high-level connections he has cultivated in both Hong Kong and mainland China. Most significantly he is close to Li Ka-shing, one of the colony's richest men, for whom he acted when he was at Vickers da Costa and who was a big backer of Peregrine from the start. Tose, 47, whose father was a senior partner at Vickers da Costa in London, first went out to Hong Kong for Vickers in 1972. He was soon running the Hong Kong operation, in which position he stayed until four years after Citicorp acquired the broker.</p>

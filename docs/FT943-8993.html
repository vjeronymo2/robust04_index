			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / How to Spend It: In the Indian swing If you feel that this summer you did not get it quite right in your garden, you might like to start planning now for next year's British heatwave. My own tastes in garden furniture run to the plain and indubitably English. But there is a place for exotica and furniture does not come more exotic than Jeremy Lowe's Gujerati swing-seats. Lowe originally came upon the seats when he was travelling in Rajasthan a few years ago and realised that these traditional indigenous designs were completely different from anything on the market in the UK. He decided to investigate the possibilities of importing them and, after experimenting with a few prototypes, has arranged for a small group of pieces to be made by local craftsmen in a small village in Gujerat. Not the least of the pleasures of the pieces is the fact that they involve using long-established hand-crafting skills and that a whole previously depressed village has a worthwhile project to work on. There is a Maharaja and a Maharana's swing bed, an armchair, two-seater and three-seater benches, tables and a deckchair. Made from Burmese teak there are also canopies, bolsters, upholstered mattresses, loose cushions and cushions covered in Indian cottons. For those who are optimistic about more languid days next summer, now may be the time to dream about lazy days in a Maharaja-style swing-bed. Jeremy Lowe's company is called Benchmark. In his Oxfordshire workshops there are prototypes which can be seen and ordered from but the earliest deliveries will be in three months. The Maharana's swing bed is the most expensive of all the items, costing Pounds 1,795, while the Maharaja's for some reason is just Pounds 1,650. A swing chair is Pounds 1,595, an armchair Pounds 245, and a carved deckchair Pounds 95. A canopy with frame and poles is Pounds 300, bolsters Pounds 55, loose cushions Pounds 25 and armchair and seat cushions Pounds 45. Benchmark has an illustrated leaflet which it will send to those who are interested. Write to Denman &amp; Lowe, The Studio, The Old School, Wheatley, Oxford OX33 1UB.

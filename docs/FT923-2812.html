			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: No 'would boost Germany' A French No to the Maastricht treaty will strengthen Germany's and the Bundesbank's roles in Europe, Mr Anbal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese prime minister, said in an interview with the Oporto-based Jornal de Noticias published yesterday, writes Patrick Blum in Lisbon. 'Some say that the Maastricht treaty favours German power. I think the exact opposite. From the point of view of monetary policy, a No to Maastricht would leave all room for manoeuvre to Germany and its central bank. Without Maastricht, Germany will command much more power in Europe,' Mr Cavaco Silva said. . A French rejection of Maastricht would be 'dramatic for the whole of Europe and it will naturally have negative consequences for Portugal'.</p>

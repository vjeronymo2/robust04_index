			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: Canadian and UK gas groups plan expansion British Gas and Nova Corporation of Alberta, the Canadian petrochemicals and pipeline group, plan to expand their international gas services and processing interests through their joint majority stake in Natural Gas Clearinghouse (NGC), one of the biggest independent US gas marketers. Nova this week agreed to buy a 36.5 per cent stake in NGC for CDollars 170m (USDollars 126m). British Gas has a similar interest in the Houston-based company. The remaining 27 per cent is owned by NGC management. NGC is best known as a marketer of gas, which it buys from producers both on the spot market and under long-term contract. However, it has become increasingly active in gathering gas from wellheads and transporting it to its own processing plants. It also provides services such as risk management and pipeline bookings for distributors. Gathering and processing operations contribute one-third of NGC's income, but that is expected to rise to about 50 per cent next year. Pre-tax earnings were USDollars 46m in 1992. The business has grown by about 20 per cent a year over the past seven years. Mr Charles Watson, NGC's chief executive, said the company hopes to acquire a large slice of the USDollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn of gas marketing and services assets which it expects to become available during the next three to five years. In addition to the US, NGC is seeking opportunities in Europe, Canada and Latin America. It is discussing a partnership with British Gas in the UK, and plans a similar joint venture with Nova in Canada. Mr Terry Poole, a Nova senior vice-president, cited Argentina as another possible area of co-operation between the three companies. British Gas has an interest in a gas distribution system in Buenos Aires, while Nova has an equity stake in a pipeline.</p>

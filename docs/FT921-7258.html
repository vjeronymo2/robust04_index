			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Brazil opens debt talks with Paris Club BRAZIL begins formal negotiations today with the Paris Club group of official creditors, confident of rapid approval for the restructuring of its Dollars 22bn (Pounds 12.5bn) debt. Following last month's ratification by the International Monetary Fund of a Dollars 2.1bn loan, Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the economy minister, and senior central bank officials have been touring European financial centres and Japan to lobby for support in the Paris Club. They believe they could have an umbrella deal in place by Wednesday. 'We have a very reasonable proposal on the table and expect to be able to turn that page this week,' said Mr Arminio Fraga, international director of the central bank, in an interview with the Financial Times. 'We believe more than Dollars 1bn in new credits could be forthcoming, largely from the Eximbank of Japan.' Diplomats doubt that the matter will be resolved in two days but admit that negotiations are taking place in a far more optimistic atmosphere than last year when Brazil demanded forgiveness of part of the debt. This time, Brazil is requesting a rescheduling of Dollars 14bn in debt and arrears over the next 18 years. This encompasses debt which has already been rescheduled: a matter that some countries are unhappy about. A second rescheduling is against Paris Club tradition, but Mr Fraga says it is necessary in Brazil's case because 'current obligations mean an excessive concentration of payments over the next two years'. Brazil is expected to offer an immediate payment of Dollars 1bn on its arrears. Brazil has not been paying interest to the Paris Club since its moratorium of 1989, although it started paying 30 per cent of due interest on its commercial debt a year ago. Paris Club members want equivalent treatment for these arrears as that received by private banks in a deal last year. They will point out that Brazil's reserves are now at their highest level since the debt crisis, increasing its capacity to pay. In the last five months, reserves have risen from critical levels of Dollars 7bn to more than Dollars 11bn and creditor banks are pressing Brazil to increase the percentage of interest paid to compensate for the reduction in LIBOR. Providing the Paris Club negotiations go smoothly Mr Moreira will fly to Europe to sign the bilateral agreements and then go straight to the US to resume talks with the commercial banks. The main sticking point with private creditors remains the guarantees Brazil is offering on new bonds but the gap has been reduced to just over Dollars 1bn.</p>

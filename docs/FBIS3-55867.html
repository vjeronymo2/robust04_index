It includes seventeen kinds of goods, including petroleum  and  its derivatives, natural gas condensate, polyethylene,  sulphanol, caustic soda, snake venom, tobacco, cotton fibre,  caviar, hand-made rugs, precious, ferrous, and non-ferrous  metals, and also articles made of them. The export of electric  power is also banned.    This decree, the document stresses, was adopted to ensure  more effective use of the republic's export potential at a time  when the Azeri market economy is being established, when the  system of mutual settlements in foreign trade and measures to  protect the domestic market are being toughened. It allows,  until the adoption of corresponding legislative acts, regulating  commercial relations with foreign countries, including CIS  nations, to sell goods and render services outside Azerbaijan  only if they are paid for in advance or if a letter of credit is  made out. At the same time, the decree prohibits advance  payments for goods purchased in foreign countries and services  rendered by firms abroad. It is permitted to use letters of  credit for this purpose. Restrictions have also been imposed on  barter transactions.</p>

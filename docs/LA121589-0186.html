			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> ROSEANNE CALLS OFF WEDDING; BOYFRIEND IS IN DRUG CLINIC  </P> <P> Roseanne Barr, television's sharp-tongued comedy mom of the 1980s, called off  her January wedding, explaining in a terse statement today that her boyfriend  was in a drug rehabilitation clinic.  </P> <P> "My Jan. 20 marriage to Tom Arnold is off," Barr said. "Tom has entered an  alcohol and drug rehabilitation clinic."  </P> <P> The statement was the only comment from the star of "Roseanne," her publicist,  Lisa Kasteler, said. The name and location of the rehabilitation clinic were  confidential, and the type of addiction wasn't disclosed.  </P> <P> The temperamental Barr, 36, recently protested the firing of Arnold as a  consultant to the show and she has stated publicly that she intends to leave  television soon.  </P> <P> Her TV departure will come even if her first motion picture outing, "She-Devil"  with Meryl Streep, is a box office flop. It placed fourth in this week's box  office derby with a disappointing $3.5-million take.  </P> <P> The couple went to great lengths in recent months to express their devotion  during appearances together on TV shows. During taping of "A Current Affair" in  August, Arnold dropped his pants and exposed a backside tattoo reading,  "Rosey."  </P></p>

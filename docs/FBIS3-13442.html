			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, member of the </F> Israeli Knesset and head of the Israeli Arab delegation, by  unidentified Syrian Arab Television correspondent in Damascus on  10 March--recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] Syrian Arab Television is pleased to  host 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, who has led a delegation of Arabs  of Palestine to offer condolences to their kinsfolk in Syria.  Syrian Arab Television welcomes you to your homeland Syria.    [Darawshah] Thank you. I also thank all our kinsfolk in  Syria, this sisterly country. We are proud of this country, of  its president, of its steadfastness, and of its continuous  struggle.    [Reporter] Let us begin with the following issue: Syria and  the Syrian stand, vis-a-vis the Palestine question and the  Palestinians themselves, have a special place among our kinsfolk  in Palestine. How do you explain this feeling which prompted  you to come to Syria to offer condolences to your people here?    [Darawshah] As part of the Arab nation and the Palestinian  people, we are linked with our Arab nation through strong ties  of Arabism, blood, and sincere friendship, as well as through  the desire to achieve a just and comprehensive peace. We are  closely following all developments related to the peace issue  within the framework of the Arab-Israeli talks, as well as the  distinguished Syrian stand and the true peace adopted by  President al-Asad and the Syrian Government and largely  supported by the Syrians. We are following these matters with  satisfaction and with support. At the same time, we feel that  this stand represents Arab dignity and pride. There is a desire  to achieve a just and comprehensive peace, but without  relinquishing any Arab rights. Therefore, when we heard about  the loss of martyr Basil al-Asad we, the sons of this nation,  were stricken by the event and felt it to be the tragedy of all  of us. We felt that we were dutybound to come to offer  condolences to the president, to his family, to the Syrian  Government, and to the fraternal Syrian people.    I am very grateful and greatly appreciate the fact that His  Excellency President al-Asad agreed to allow the delegation to  come to Syria to offer condolences. We were pleased with this  because we, the Palestinians inside Israel, have suffered from  the long siege not only by the Israeli Government but also by  the Arab world which has not treated us fairly. We had been  prevented from entering the Arab world. This is a good  beginning and a positive step which we truly praise. We also  thank President Hafiz al-Asad for this.    [Reporter] You have spoken in your answer about peace and  the  desire to achieve just and comprehensive peace. You are  up-to-date on the stands of Israel vis-a-vis the peace process.  Does peace have a chance? What are the obstacles to peace? Is  Israel serious in its efforts?    [Darawshah] I would like to say that the stand of this  Israeli Government is better than the stand of the Shamir  government. However, although the Rabin government has created  better circumstances at the negotiating table, it has not made  the required concessions to give a momentum to the peace process.    The abstruse obstacle lies in the fact that the Israeli  Government has thus far not declared openly that it is ready to  withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and to recognize the  Palestinian people's right to self- determination, one they  deserve just like any other people under the sun. Therefore, we  call for the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace and  for Israeli withdrawal from all ccupied Arab territories, from  the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, southern Lebanon, the occupied  Syrian Golan Heights, and the occupied Jordanian territories.  Only then could a true atmosphere be created to push the peace  process forward and to achieve full peace. This is what we are  trying to make the Israeli Government understand. We say this  from Damascus, and we also say the same thing in the Knesset in  Jerusalem. We say it in Washington, in Paris, in Cairo, and  everywhere. This is because the cause of right and justice is  indivisible.    [Reporter] Mr. Darawshah, you know that the peace process,  from the very beginning, was based on the resolutions of  international legitimacy and the land for peace principle;  namely, full Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab  territories in return for full peace. Can either of the two  parts of this equation be implemented without the other?    [Darawshah] There will be no peace under occupation. The  continuation of occupation means the continuation of war,  massacres, suppression, and repression. Furthermore, peace  cannot be achieved with the continuation of settlements. What  does settlement mean? It is a form of colonialism that occupies  land, deprives people of their rights, and establishes  settlements of the colonialist settlers who occupy the Arab  land. Based on this, we say that there is an essential  contradiction between peace and occupation, and between peace  and settlements. The Israeli Government should announce its  readiness to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories,  dismantle settlements, and return all settlers to Israel within  the 1967 border. There should be no negotiations, wrangling,  and stubbornness over gaining land or over keeping settlements  in the occupied Arab territories.    [Reporter] I wanted to ask you about settlements, and about  this Israeli policy, whose results we are seeing now, and the  best proof of this is the recent Ibrahimi Mosque massacre? Can  settlements and peace, which Israel claims it wants, go together?    [Darawshah] We have always said, and I repeat that  settlements constitute an unsurmountable obstacle to peace.  Peace will never be achieved with the continuation of  settlements, especially since we are talking about an extremist  group of settlers most of whom came from the United States or  Russia. Those who came from the United States are really  extremists. Most of them are affiliated with fascist rightist  forces such as the racist Kakh movement, the Kahane movement,  and the security on roads movement which carry out daily hostile  acts against the sons of our Palestinian people in terms of  killing, massacres, terrorism, demolishing houses, and  indiscriminate firing. Regrettably, the Israeli Army forces and  other security forces protect them, but they do not protect the  Palestinians. They also supply them with arms and with all that  they need. Even if they carry out barbaric and brutal acts  against the Palestinians, they do not stand trial and they will  not be arrested. We believe that the continuation of  settlements conflicts with peace. The Israeli Government should  openly announce that it is ready to evacuate the settlements.    [Reporter] Let us talk about the Israeli political  structure with which you are in contact. What is your  assessment of the stands of the government or the opposition  regarding the peace process?    [Darawshah] So far the government coalition is narrow. It  consists of 56 members of the Knesset -- the Labor and Meretz  Parties. It is supported by the Arab parties -- the Arab  Democratic Party and the Democratic Front for Peace and  Equality. Together they form the so-called buffer [al-mani'ah]  bloc which consists of 61 members of the Knesset. Yitzhaq Rabin  is attempting to expand his government. It seems that he has  succeeded in this and he is expected to announce at the Knesset  on Monday the return of SHAS, the religious Eastern Jewish  party, to the government coalition. This party has six members.  Thus, the coalition government will consist of 62 members. If  the government continues to receive the support of the Arab  parties the government will win a big majority, 67 members of  the Knesset. This majority would enable the government to  continue the peace process and to make concessions that will  respond to the true Arab demands; that is, the demands of the  Palestinian people and the regional states -- Lebanon, Syria,  and Jordan. Therefore, the government will have more  parliamentary support than today. However, despite this ...    [Reporter, interrupting] Excuse me Mr. Darawshah, Rabin's  attempts to expand the coalition by including Tzomet and others  have specific objectives and repercussions. In addition to  making decisions, which you called concessions, but we do not,  the expansion of the coalition will have specific repercussions,  because these groups have objectives and demands. How will  Rabin's objective match the objectives of these groups?    [Darawshah] Before I came to Syria, when I was asked about  including Tzomet or Mafdal, I said that this is a maneuver by  Yitzhaq Rabin to return the Shas to the government and to weaken  the effect of the left-wing movement Meretz and the Arab parties  within the buffer block. He wants to enjoy more support within  the Knesset. He does not want the Arab members of the Knesset  to have a larger effect. At the same time, he wants to go to  Washington with a broader government and coalition. I also  believe that if he wants to take certain steps against the  settlers -- something which he is required to do -- he needs  more support from the Knesset. He does not want others to say  that he is taking these steps or embarking on these peaceful  operations with a government that depends on Arab votes in the  Knesset. He wants to say -- and he said it publicly -- that he  seeks to embark on steps through a government coalition,  depending on Jewish votes. We say this is a racist approach.  He cannot end our existence in this method. At the same time,  we support expanding the coalition if Shas joins the coalition.  If Rabin agrees to let Tzomet or Mafdal, two extremist parties  hostile to the Arabs inside and to the whole Arab nation, join  the coalition, we will withdraw our support for the government  and present a no-confidence motion in an attempt to topple the  government. We have always been part of the buffer block to  prevent the right-wing parties from reaching the government, not  for supporting the right wing inside the government. I think  that the peace process will continue despite the existing  difficulties.    But Yitzhaq Rabin is required first to state that he is  prepared to accept the formula which President Hafiz al-Asad  stated yesterday during his meeting with us. He stated --  frankly, publicly, and in a courageous and dignified manner --  that we support the complete peace in return for complete  withdrawal and the land-for-peace formula. This clarity, this  clear strategic view of peace, dictates that the Israeli  Government should take a stand.    [Reporter] Mr. Darawshah, your statements are very precise  on Israel's attempts to avoid Syria's position, especially what  happened in Geneva. Before Geneva, Israel tried to circumvent  what would happen in Geneva because it sensed Syria's courageous  and clear position. Can you explain the future strategies in  the light of what happened in Geneva and Syria's stands?    [Darawshah] In his meeting with President Clinton in Geneva,  President al-Asad in fact represented the Arab nation. He  represented its aspirations and the position that reflects the  will of this nation and its aspirations to secure a better  future and achieve a just and comprehensive peace, as well as  Arab dignity. Therefore, we were all happy to see the president  speaking in Geneva and meeting with the president of the most  powerful country in the world, the United States, and  representing with dignity and pride this nation, this  deep-rooted nation, the Arab nation, of which we are proud to be  part.    I believe he was clear and forthright when he stated the  Arab  nation's stand on peace and the peace position of the Syrian  people and government. But, Israel attempted to conceal this  position and avoid making a positive stand that corresponds to  that position. Therefore, they tried to undervalue the  president's statements. The Israeli foreign minister's reaction  today to President Hafiz al-Asad's statements yesterday on the  peace strategy and the complete withdrawal in return for  complete peace was lukewarm because he does not want to show the  Israeli people the crystal-clear fact that Syria wants peace, a  just and comprehensive peace, a peace of the brave, a peace that  was publicly stated by President Hafiz al-Asad in Geneva and  yesterday during his meeting with the delegation that came to  offer condolences to him.    [Reporter] Mr. Darawshah, let us return to the Zionist  political structure and Zionist thought. Zionism, as you well  know, is standing at a crossroads. This does not mean  abandoning Zionism. Old Zionism is known, but what is new in the  Zionist thought and direction?    [Darawshah] There is a split today inside Zionism and inside  the Israeli political structure, and even inside the world's  Jewish and Zionist movements. There is a rational trend that  says we must achieve peace with the Arab world and we must end  occupation. Some people affiliated with this trend -- a strong  segment indeed -- support the Palestinian people's right to  self-determination and the establishment of an independent  Palestinian state alongside the state of Israel in the West bank  and Gaza Strip. They also oppose settlement activities. The  demonstrations staged by tens of thousands of people last  Saturday was a joint demonstration by the Arab and Jewish  peace-advocating forces, and we participated in it. That  demonstration raised clear slogans: No to the horrendous  massacres by settlers against the Palestinian people and no to  the policy of suppression and repression. It also demanded the  evacuation of settlements and the recognition of the just and  comprehensive peace that would end occupation and guarantee the  establishment of the independent Palestinian state. On the  other hand, there is a significant trend in the Israeli  opposition today. This represents the right-wing Israeli  parties, led by the Likud. It also includes the Mafdal, Tzomet,  and the extremist fascist party, Moledet, which advocates the  transfer and the expulsion of Arabs.    These parties still raise the slogan of the integral land  of Israel, from the sea to the river, and some of them say from  the river to the river [from the Nile to the Euphrates]. These  people do not want peace, and they only talk about peace for  peace. This is a big camp within the Israeli political  spectrum, but it is now in the opposition. Yitzhaq Rabin  oscillates between the two wings: the left wing which calls for  a just and comprehensive peace, and the extremist rightist wing  which wants to keep all the occupied Arab territories, and does  not want to concede an inch of land, as they say. What they  want is the integral land of Israel. The Israeli Government's  stand is linked with the pressures exerted by each camp. Rabin  is for the coalition and for the left, but he himself has  rightist trends. It is known that he is a hawk within the Labor  Party, while the dove's wing is now led by Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres and his deputy Yosi Beilin, and some other  ministers like Yosi Sarid, 'Uzi Bar'am, and others.    [Reporter] Mr. Darawshah, I, as an Arab citizen, along with  the Arab citizen who is watching us now, cannot imagine that  there are hawks and doves, or that there is any difference  between Yosi Sarid, Yosi Beilin, Rabin, Shamir, Kahane, or even  Begin. This is because we cannot distinguish between these  people, especially since the Arab citizen is persecuted by all  of them. Some citizens believe that a solution is impossible in  light of Israel's policy of trying cancel out the other party  [Palestinian people]. What is your comment?    [Darawshah] Despite all the criticism of Israeli policy,  which I also criticize, I can understand Arab sentiments and  feelings concerning everything that is related to the Israeli  position. As an Arab, I also feel this inside me. However, I  do not generalize. In politics, we must put facts down and work  with the surgeon's scalpel. We must cut things and analyze them  with our own Arab scalpel. We must examine things very  carefully. There is a panoramic view, which I do not dismiss,  but, in order to establish this general approach for the Arab  nation, we must be aware of the details. Concerning the  details, there is a difference between an Israeli Jew who  believes in peace, wants peace, and demonstrates for peace, and  calls for evacuating the settlements and the occupied Arab  territories, and works for this, and an Israeli Jew who adheres  to occupation, who does not offer anything in return for a peace  agreement, and believes in the integral land of Israel. These  differences do exist.    [Reporter] It could be the difference between one who  murders  brutally and another who murders with dexterity. Any way, let  us hear from you Mr. Darawshah about our people in the occupied  territories who suffer from discrimination. What do they say,  how are they doing?    [Darawshah] The sons of our Palestinian people inside  Israel,  who number approximately 800,000 Palestinians, live mainly in  the Galilee, the Triangle, and Negev, or in the mixed cities  such as 'Akko, Haifa, Yafo, Lod, and al-Ramlah. We are the  owners of the homeland, of the land. We did not leave our  homeland, and we do not want to achieve the objective of the  extremist Jews and settlers, that is transfer or expel Arabs.    Therefore, our slogan has been, and will continue to be:  We will remain here, for as long as olives and thyme remain.  We stick to our land, our homeland, with roots deep in our  national soil. We also want to improve our quality and increase  our number to be able to stand up against the major challenges  facing us. We have suffered from racial discrimination and the  military occupation policy and a military rule that was imposed  on us until 1966. After the military rule ended, we began to  struggle for civil and national rights. We were not recognized  and most of our land was confiscated. We suffer from a flagrant  policy of racial discrimination in all fields of life. I do not  say this only here in Damascus. We say it also from every  rostrum; that the racial discrimination policy is directed  against any non-Jewish person inside Israel and we resist this  racial policy.    Despite all this, we continue our struggle to gain further  rights. At the same time, we do not relinquish our right to a  dignified, free life and the right of our Palestinian people to  gain their independence, freedom, and get rid of occupation.    [Reporter] You have mentioned the land and said you are the  owners of the land. Mr. Darawshah, the anniversary of Land Day,  30 March, is approaching. What has happened to the Yisra'el  Koenig Document, and much is it being implemented? And, what do  you have to say about land and Land Day?    [Darawshah] So far, it has not been officially announced  that the Koenig Document has been annulled. Even recently, it  was announced that there are plans to build 26 new Jewish  settlements in Galilee. The current Israeli Government says it  stopped the confiscation of land. However, we fear another type  of land confiscation, the confiscation of land for the  so-called public interest; large highways, for example, the  300-meter wide inter-Israel highway which passes mostly in Arab  land. This, therefore, is a new type of confiscation. At the  same time, over 50 percent of the Arab lands that are owned by  Palestinian Arab citizens have been confiscated since the  establishment of Israel under feeble excuses, under various  excuses and justifications -- security, settlements, or the  so-called public interest. Therefore, we call for the return of  this land because most of it has not been utilized yet. The  land must be returned to its rightful owners.    In our struggle to stick to our land, or what remained of  the  land because most of the land has very unfortunately been  confiscated, we want to stick to our homeland. Any attempt to  detach us from our land means an attempt to detach us from our  homeland. Therefore, we stick to the land in order to survive.  So, sticking to our land is a principal part of our  steadfastness inside our homeland. The Land Day anniversary --  this immortal day-- comes to remind us that the land is still  threatened and that land means honor. Therefore, we want to  defend the land and the honor and the dignity of this nation.    [Reporter] Mr. Darawshah: During this visit, you visited  al-Qunaytirah and met with President Hafiz al-Asad. Can you  tell us what you have heard and seen. Let us start with your  visit to al-Qunaytirah. What did al-Qunaytirah tell you?    [Darawshah] The destroyed, and at the same time, liberated,  al-Qunaytirah, left a major, and, equally, a painful, impression  on me. So did the destroyed houses, in which more than 50,000  Syrian Arabs citizens, who were forced to flee their homes,  lived. This was a horrendous crime which is unacceptable to  anyone.    I condemned this hideous crime and said: Peace and  good-neighborly relations cannot be established in this way.  Such an act will not produce positive results because it is a  terrorist, aggressive, barbaric act against the Syrian people  and the Arab nation. Israeli media organs asked me: How can  you criticize the Israeli policy on this issue in al-Qunaytirah?  Why do you not say this in Jerusalem? I told them that I said  this in Jerusalem and criticized the demolition of Arab  villages. I am criticizing the demolition of al-Qunaytirah  because this is a barbaric act which is not accepted at all.    I believe that the policy which prompted the Israeli  Government to demolish al-Qunaytirah is an aggressive policy. I  hope this will not be repeated in the future. This does not  only mean occupying land; it also means obliterating Arab  features.    [Reporter] As takes place in Palestine.    [Darawshah] As took place and is taking place in Palestine.  Many Arab villages were demolished. In Galilee, in the village  of (?Itsal) in Marj Ibn 'Amir, where I live, many houses are  demolished. Many other Arab villages in the area remind us of  the terrible tragedy. When I came and visited al-Qunaytirah,  which was destroyed, I cried and was pained because this  reminded me also of our Palestinian villages which were  destroyed.    [Reporter] About your meeting with the president.    [Darawshah] The meeting gave us a feeling of the pride of  affiliation with this nation, the genuine Arab nation of which  we are proud. Despite all circumstances, we did not kneel down,  we did not bow, and we were not humiliated. We adhered to our  Palestinian and Arab identity and to our lofty pan-Arabism. Our  meeting with the president reminded us of Arab loftiness,  dignity, and free will. We were in front of a great man who has  a strategic view and enlightened thinking. He is gentle and  modest. In fact, all members of the delegation felt these  positive characteristics during the meeting with President  al-Asad. He increased our pride of our affiliation and our love  for al-Asad's Syria and President al-Asad. We came to offer our  condolences to his excellency and to our Syrian people. After  offering our condolences we emerged from the meeting full of the  feelings of faithful brotherly relations and genuine  pan-Arabism, loftiness, and dignity represented by President  al-Asad.    On this occasion, I would like to greet President Hafiz  al-Asad, may God preserve him, the heroic fraternal Syrian  people, our Palestinian people living in Syria in solidarity  with the Syrian people. The Palestinians living in al-Yarmuk  Camp and in other places told us they feel that Syria is their  homeland and that they are given their rights like the Syrian  citizens. Therefore, the delegation came on behalf of the  Palestinian masses to offer condolences on the death of Basil  al-Asad, martyr of the Arab nation. We heard and read a great  deal about Basil's views, nationalism, and struggle. Again, we  greatly appreciate President al-Asad, the Syrian Government, and  the fraternal Syrian people. We are proud that we and the  Syrian people are affiliated with this Arab nation. We wish  Syria, this country of brave, and al-Asad, every progress.    [Reporter] Mr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah. You are welcome  again in Syrian Arab Television and in your country Syria.  Thank you.    [Darawshah] Thank you.</p>

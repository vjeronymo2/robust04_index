			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Further Legal Action Against the </F> Steel Subsidies Following the Council of Ministers on Steel  Issues"]    [Text] Before the end of this week, the Steel Trade  Association, together with German and Netherlands companies,  intends to take legal action at the European Court of Justice in  Luxembourg against the subsidies for the state-owned Italian  steel group ILVA.    The German Steel Federation yesterday announced that the  action brought against the EU Commission proposes that the  decision to authorize 100 billion Luxembourg francs worth of  subsidies for ILVA be reversed.    It was reported that the joint action with Preussag Steel  AG,  Thyssen Steel AG and the Netherlands steel company Hoogovens  B.V. would be submitted this Friday. The Council of Ministers  approved the subsidies in December at the Commission's proposal.  The European Independent Steel Producers' Association EISA has  already brought an action against it, and British Steel and the  Danish Det Danske Stalvalsevaerk announced such a step.  <H5>  Dark Veil </H5>   The Steel Federation and companies argued in their action  that the massive subsidy was causing severe damage to the  private steel companies in all the EU states. The subsidies  were unlawful, because they were not consistent with the Steel  Subsidies Code. According to the plaintiffs, there was no room  for an exemption. The Commission had not asked favored  companies for a sufficient commitment in return in the form of a  production capacity reduction.    The Steel Trade Association welcomed the fact that the  Council of Ministers on steel issues has not given any general  authorization for subsidies on Wednesday in Luxembourg. The  German Steel Federation declared that "a close examination of  the individual cases is required before further subsidies are  authorized." Until now, they had been cloaked in a thick veil.</p>

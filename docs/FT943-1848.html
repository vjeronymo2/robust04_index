			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Cable TV service for City launched Videotron, the largest cable television operator in London, yesterday launched what it described as the first public business multimedia service in the UK. The new television service will combine data, sound and pictures in as many as 48 channels devoted to the business market and delivered to the personal computers of subscribers in Westminster and the City. The Westminster cable franchise is held by British Telecommunications but the Department of Trade and Industry earlier this year awarded Videotron a licence to offer competing telephony services to business and residential customers in the area. The Canadian-owned cable group is now laying a Pounds 38m high-capacity fibre-optic network in Westminster and the City. Videotron will compete for estimated average annual telecommunication revenues within the City of Pounds 67.5m per sq km. Unlike other telephone companies Videotron is also to offer television services to the business market - although under its licence it cannot offer general entertainment. Early next year Reuters, the information and media group, will provide a business news service for Videotron. There will probably be a two-hour business programme and a similar programme towards the end of the business day, plus a non-stop stream of prices and other data.</p>

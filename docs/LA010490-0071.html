			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEART OF THE PROBLEM;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: 'I WAS REALLY SCARED,' SAID GLENDALE COLLEGE'S GARY FOWLER  WHEN THE DOCTOR THOUGHT HE FOUND AN IRREGULAR HEART BEAT.  </P> <P> The physical proceeded just like so many others the athlete had faced.  </P> <P> Gary Fowler of Glendale College sailed through the weigh-in, height  measurement, eye-and-ear check and other staples of the examination, a  preseason ritual for all participants in high school and intercollegiate  sports.  </P> <P> But when the doctor pressed his stethoscope to Fowler's chest and back, things  became a little more complex.  </P> <P> Fowler's heartbeat sounded irregular, the doctor said, and he suggested that  Fowler's personal physician perform further tests before the athlete resumed  basketball practice.  </P> <P> The diagnosis and weeklong battery of examinations that followed made the  19-year-old Fowler's heart race.  </P> <P> "I was scared," Fowler recalled. "I didn't do any physical activity. I wasn't  participating in anything.  </P> <P> "I don't think I even jumped too fast to turn the channel on the TV."  </P> <P> When the tests -- including a strenuous bout on a treadmill -- were completed,  Fowler was declared fit to play. And since returning to the Vaquero lineup, the  6-foot-5 sophomore hasn't missed a beat.  </P> <P> Fowler is averaging 15 points and eight rebounds for a veteran Glendale team  that is 12-6 and opening play in the Western State Conference this week.  </P> <P> Fowler, a co-captain and returning All-Western State Conference forward from  Muir High in Pasadena, is the Vaqueros' best defensive player.  </P> <P> "Without him," said Brian Beauchemin, the Glendale coach, "we're missing a  physical presence."  </P> <P> Then again, Fowler is probably the Vaqueros' only physical presence. At 6-6,  Justin Lord is the team's tallest starter. Fowler, however, patrols the area  around the basket for the Vaqueros and usually draws the opposition's best  front-court player, regardless of the size mismatch.  </P> <P> During Glendale's championship performance in its own tournament three weeks  ago, Fowler was selected to the all-tournament team mostly for the way he  handled 6-6 forward Terry Nelson of Harbor in the semifinals and 6-10 center  Eric Pauley and 6-9 forward Andre Lamoureaux of Cypress in the championship  game.  </P> <P> "There have been games where Gary is absolutely beat up," Beauchemin said. "But  his expression never changes.  </P> <P> "Other guys get excited by errant elbows and the kinds of things that happen  under the basket where you're playing against guys who play like offensive  lineman."  </P> <P> Fowler contends that there is no reason to lose control. His philosophy is  simple: Why get mad when you know you're going to get even?  </P> <P> "If someone does something really dirty, I'll always get him back during the  course of the game," Fowler said. "I tell him. I'll whisper in his ear. Simple  as that.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to punch them or anything. But just let them know to watch for  it because it's coming."  </P> <P> Fowler came to Glendale last season after playing only one season of varsity  basketball at Muir, where he averaged 16 points a game his senior year.  </P> <P> He enrolled at Glendale and got an immediate break when several of the  Vaqueros' returning players left the team to get jobs or enlist in the  military.  </P> <P> Like fellow freshmen Bruce Heicke, David Swanson, Vigen Serop and Lord, Fowler  took full advantage of the opportunity.  </P> <P> He averaged 14.1 points and a team-high 7.7 rebounds a game for a Glendale team  that finished 20-12 overall and 10-5 in the WSC. The Vaqueros advanced to the  state playoffs, defeating Golden West in the first round before falling to El  Camino.  </P> <P> Fowler credits Beauchemin for helping him make a successful jump to the junior  college level.  </P> <P> "Most athletes are intimidated to talk to their coaches, but you can't be with  Brian," Fowler said. "He's easy to talk to. You can go into his office and just  have a rap session."  </P> <P> If there was a rap against Fowler coming into this season, it was that his  outside shot needed work. Despite averaging in double figures, it was not  uncommon to see Fowler clank a frozen rope off the rim from beyond 10 feet.  </P> <P> "In high school, I shot a lot from the outside, but when I got here I kind of  lost my confidence from that range," Fowler said. "Everything was 'inside,  inside.'  </P> <P> "I worked on it over the summer and now I'm just starting to feel comfortable  again."  </P> <P> That's bad news for WSC opponents who will try to keep Fowler and his teammates  from a shot at the conference championship -- something the Vaqueros have not  won since 1985.  </P></p>

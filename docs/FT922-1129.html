			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Court in HK clears seven of corruption THE Hong Kong stock exchange corruption trial ended dramatically yesterday when the seven men charged were found not guilty after nearly two days of deliberation by the jury. The High Court trial, which sprang from investigations into the conduct of Mr Ronald Li, the former head of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, casts doubt over similar charges to which Mr Li last year pleaded guilty. It is unclear whether the verdict will affect the four-year prison sentence he received in October 1990 for soliciting preferential allocations of shares in companies due to be listed on the exchange. In the trial just ended, six defendants were charged with accepting or soliciting preferential allocations of shares. The decision follows an Appeal Court ruling removing the offence of unlawful possession from the colony's law.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Devro surges Sausage casing manufacturer Devro International came to the market at 170p and immediately went to a hefty premium on strong institutional business. One salesman said: 'It's been nothing but buyers for most of the day. There are still a lot of unsatisfied investors out there.' With the initial placing over three times oversubscribed, the pent up demand pushed the trading range to the 195-200p level, although profit-taking took the shine off the rise towards the end of the session. The shares closed at 193p, a first-day premium of 23, with a hefty 30m traded. However, food manufacturing analysts were optimistic that Devro would retain its present levels, possibly with some upside to come. Mr Tim Potter at Smith New Court said: 'Most investors have bought into Devro on a long-term basis. This is a quality stock with good prospects.' While the recovery at Ratners continued, with losses dropping sharply in its results yesterday, stores specialists continued to be gloomy over the prospects for investors. However, there was still plenty of small speculative investors betting on a limited recovery for the jewellery group to ensure the shares closed 3 1/2 up at 35 1/2 p with a hefty 19m traded. While Ratners, which also announced it was changing its name, was insisting privately yesterday that it would break even this year, few analysts were confident enough to change their profit forecasts and most stayed around the Pounds 10m deficit level. A Japanese press report that Tokyo was poised to slash whisky duties sent Guinness shares sharply forward. However, although government sources were said to have partly confirmed the story, the cuts are likely to have negligible bearing on Guinness' revenues. The realisation took the wind out of the shares advance and they closed 6 ahead at 471p, after 475p. The market was disappointed with the Pounds 86m Allied Lyons received for the sale of its Chateau Latour wine subsidiary, a figure of Pounds 100m having long been mooted. Allied shares slipped 3 to 537p. Forte continued its strong recovery, adding 5 to 227p, amid talk of a presentation at SG Warburg, the merchant bank. Ladbroke gained 5 1/2 to 185p. After buying a near-15 per cent stake in LWT on Tuesday, Granada opened weakly, dropping 10 at the outset. However, favourable press and broker comment helped the shares to recover during the day and the they closed a penny firmer at 418p. Calm returned to the television stocks after the previous day's flurry of buying. LWT convertible preference shares held on to their 466p level after the company announced that Mercury Asset Management was one of the previous day's sellers to Granada. The sector's star performer was Scottish Television which enjoyed a rise of 21 to 545p. A solid set of results from GEC left the market largely unmoved, although prompted a round of modest upgrades. The shares edged forward a penny to 339 1/2 p. Tuesday's announcement of the discount for individual subscribers to BT3 together with the start of the institutional round of presentations ensured British Telecom stayed in positive territory. The shares rose 5 1/2 to 428 1/2 p. British Steel continued to be weakened by concerns about overcapacity in European steel. The shares gave up 2 1/2 to 94 1/2 p, in trade of 6m with NatWest Securities reported to have been among the day's main seller of the stock. Further hopes of an increased offer for bid target Securiguard saw the shares harden 2 to 315p. Its predator Rentokil edged a penny forward to 204p. Rumours of a downgrade in Boots left the shares 4 adrift at 442p. Results from Eastern Electric sent the shares forward, although they later faded to close unchanged at 472p. A stock overhang was said to have hindered Scottish Hydro, off 5 at 336p. Healthcare group Amersham International climbed 10 to 798p, with Credit Lyonnais Laing issuing a strong buy recommendation on what it sees as improved margins. Starmin, the quarry products group, fell a penny to 2 3/4 p after the company's annual report was deferred and the chief executive Mr Osman Abdullah quit. A negative stance by SG Warburg on Coats Viyella sent the price down 4 to 243p. Analyst Mr Laurence Rubin: 'We thought Coats had probably run a bit too far although there is nothing fundamentally wrong.' The broker advised a switch into Courtaulds, which closed a penny lighter at 538p. Yield considerations strengthened some property companies with a buy programme also boosting share prices. Slough Estates moved ahead 10 to 215p and Land Securities rose 7 to 597p. Ascot Holdings returned to trading after suspension finishing the day at 6 1/2 p after its pre-suspension level of 16 1/2 p.</p>

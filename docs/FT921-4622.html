			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Tokyo tries to halt further fall in yen THE JAPANESE government, having begun the year fearing that a strong yen would spiral ever higher, was yesterday contemplating new ways of bolstering a surprisingly weak yen that is showing signs of becoming even weaker. Officials at the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan gathered to discuss the currency's weakness and indicated that the central bank may buy the German mark this week in an indirect attempt to strengthen the yen by undermining the US dollar. Tokyo has been bewildered by the course of the currency in recent weeks and is worried that the yen's weakness, which benefits Japan's export industries, will fuel an already surging trade surplus and create more problems in US relations. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan, under political pressure to stimulate the domestic economy by cutting official interest rates, is having to balance the timing of the cut with concerns that it could further weaken the yen. The government has also been confused by US tolerance of the dollar's strength. US officials had called for yen appreciation in the period before and immediately after President George Bush's controversial visit to Japan in January, when an apparently fragile dollar traded at Y122. At the time, Japanese executives publicly discussed whether their companies would be able to cope with Y110 to the dollar, but, instead, the yen headed quickly in the opposite direction. Late last week, it was just below Y132 and there was talk on the Tokyo foreign exchange market that the Y140 level would soon be tested. Dealers are convinced that the Bush administration has changed its policy priorities and is happy to see the dollar strengthen in tandem with signs of US economic recovery. Mr Tomio Kudo, director of foreign exchange at Meitan Tradition, said that the yen's turnaround is a result of the breakdown of currency co-ordination among the Group of Seven industrialised countries. 'There appeared to be international agreement on the need for a strong yen, but there was no evidence that the US was supporting the Japanese currency,' Mr Kudo said. 'When intervention didn't come, traders who had positions against the dollar had to make corrections, and this movement strengthened the dollar.' Other traders said that the slowing of the Japanese economy and the surfacing of new political scandals had prompted a international reassessment of the yen's worth. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, blamed 'speculators' for the yen's weakness, saying that the present exchange rates 'do not reflect economic fundamentals.' He said: 'A strong dollar will not help the US increase exports.'</p>

			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Sharp drop in growth for Mexican GDP MEXICO's gross domestic product grew by just 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, the smallest such increase since President Carlos Salinas took office in December 1988. The growth was much slower than expected, and well below the first quarter increase of 2.4 per cent. The poor performance makes it almost certain that economic growth for the year will fall significantly short of the government's target of 2.7 per cent. 'The situation is much more acute than we expected,' says Mr Rogelio Ramirez de la O, head of the economic consultancy Ecanal. 'This could lead to a whole reassesment of economic policy, with an increase in government spending likely.' The government's budget surplus, high real interest rates of around 8 per cent, and continued real appreciation of the exchange rate helped to squeeze domestic demand and industry in the second quarter. The austere economic policy has been attacked by many in the private and labour sector, and some members of Mexico's governing party are nervous that it might hurt their chances in next year's presidential election. For the first half, overall growth was 1.3 per cent. The industrial sector gained 1.2 per cent, thanks mainly to a 5.2 per cent increase in construction. Manufacturing grew by just 0.3 per cent. The agricultural sector shrank by 1.5 per cent, and services climbed by 1.9 per cent. The low growth helped improve trade balance in the first half of the year to Dollars 6.9bn, 5.9 per cent less than the first half last year. Exports climbed to Dollars 24.8bn, 11.9 per cent more than the first half last year, while imports reached Dollars 31.7bn, an increase of 7.4 per cent. The deficit in June was Dollars 1.185bn, 17 per cent less than in the same month last year. While it came at a cost of low economic growth, the steady reduction in the trade deficit has eased pressure on the Mexican peso, which is well within its permitted band of flotation against the US dollar.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 27 (YONHAP) -- Sri Lankan Prime Minister  Ranil Wickremesinghe urged North Korea Friday to fulfill its  obligations as a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty (NPT) to eliminate nuclear weapons from the world.    "We would like to see the world free of nuclear weapons,  firstly through nuclear weapons control, secondly through  gradual reduction and finally through elimination of nuclear  weapons from the world. North Korea should fulfill its  obligations as a member of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,"  said the Sri Lankan premier on the last day of his four-day  visit to Seoul.    Wickremesinghe, however, would not elaborate on whether  Colombo would join the United Nations Security Council in  imposing sanctions on Pyongyang, simply saying that "discussion  is going on about the matter at the United Nations and we would  go along with the UN decisions as a UN member state."    Speaking to reporters at a news conference in the hotel  Lotte  shortly before his departure, Sri Lanka's prime minister  disclosed no details of his talks with South Korean officials on  the two countries' separate bids for a non-permanent UNSC seat  allocated to Asia for 1996-97.    "In regard to the application, I discussed the matter with  South Korean officials but it's a matter to be solved later,"  said Wickremesinghe, adding it could be settled by the end of  1995.    On the opening of a direct air route linking Seoul and  Colombo, Wickremesinghe said that "I'd like to see it happen  next year." However, he passed the matter on to the private  sector, saying the two countries' airlines should reach  commercial agreements.    Inviting Korean tourists and businessmen to Sri Lanka,  Wickremesinghe stressed the political situation in his country  is stable, although one terrorist group affects the Northeast.    "Political parties are discussing how to settle the  outstanding issues in the Northeastern region. All issues  except one have been settled between the North and East regions  and the east has restored order and a civilian government," said  the prime minister, who voiced hope that the Northern region  would come under Colombo's control by the end of next year.    The premier was hopeful that more Sri Lankans can work in  South Korea under a Seoul Government plan to import labor,  noting that he had discussed the issue with Seoul officials. He  said 1,000 Sri Lankans work here at present.    During his meetings with South Korean officials,  Wickremesinghe said he expressed his country's willingness to  offer top treatment to South Korean businessmen in Sri Lanka.    Sri Lankan businessmen from the nation's six largest  business  groups, who accompanied Wickremesinghe to Seoul, also had  comprehensive talks with their South Korean counterparts on  promoting further business opportunities, Wickremesinghe said.    The 46-year-old premier, concurrently minister of  industries,  science and technology, leads a friendship association of  parliamentarians between the two countries. This was the third  visit to Seoul by Wickremesinghe, who came here in 1984 as  education minister and in 1989 as minister of industries,  science, and technology.</p>

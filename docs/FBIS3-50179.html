			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio debate by Polish Finance Minister Marek Borowski, </F> former Finance Minister Jerzy Osiatynski, economist Professor  Grzegorz Kolodko, and university student Piotr Poleski,  moderated by Jerzy Baczynski on the "Only on One" program in  Warsaw--live]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Baczynski, addressing  Borowski] Mr. Minister, the prime minister--that is your  boss--said that servicing the domestic debt has become a serious  burden on the state. How serious is it?    [Borowski] Well, one can illustrate this through several  examples. Let us take the 1994 expenditures devoted to the  health service, which amount to a total of about 84 trillion  zlotys [Z], whereas servicing our domestic debt amounts to Z82  trillion. The Defense Ministry's entire budget, about which  there is currently a huge ongoing fight and debate, amounts to  Z47 trillion. The Internal Affairs Ministry's entire  budget--that is to say, for public security--amounts to more  than Z20 trillion, and the budget of the Education Ministry is  Z67 trillion. Or let us look at this from a different  perspective: If it was not for the domestic debt incurred  toward domestic banks and other institutions, we would have no  budget deficit in 1994 at all. [passage omitted]    [Baczynski, addressing viewers] We are waiting for your  responses to the following question, and let me remind you what  it is: In a situation where the state lacks money to devote to  important expenditures like the health service, education, or  retirement pensions, should the state borrow money or not?  Should it incur debts or should it not? We are waiting for  your responses, and right now I can see that the result is, I  think, four to one to No, so most of you so far think that the  state budget should not incur a debt. We will see whether you  will change your minds as the program continues.    Let me remind you that the biggest part of our debt is made  up of debts incurred toward foreign creditors, which right now,  Mr. Prime Minister [addressing Borowski], I think amounts to  $47.5 billion, as far as I can recall....    [Borowski] The figure keeps changing everyday because the  foreign-currency rates keep changing, but it is something like  that.    [Baczynski] Please, tell us--how much will we have to spend  this year to service this foreign debt?    [Borowski] Our assumptions are that it will have to be about  Z30 trillion, which, taking the average dollar exchange rate for  1994, is about $1.3 billion.    [Baczynski] But this is based on the assumption that we will  manage to get the debt reduction talked about during the  background report?    [Borowski] Yes, it is based on that assumption. [passage  omitted]    [Baczynski] So the situation looks like quite a paradox  indeed: We are making efforts to have our debts--incurred in  commercial banks--reduced, but if we manage to obtain the  reduction, we will have to repay more than we have been paying  up to now since up to now we have been servicing the debt only  to some extent. But we are doing this--it is my  understanding--among other things in order to obtain new  credits. Which brings me to my next question to the minister  and deputy prime minister: It is bad enough that we have this  enormous burden of old debts, but we also keep incurring new  ones. We heard data during the background report concerning the  amount of money lent to us by the IMF, the World Bank, and the  EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]. After  having had some experience with the state's finances already, do  you think that we were justified in incurring those new credits?  Are we using them the right way?    [Borowski] To kind of continue the tradition that Professor  Osiatynski has initiated, I will also begin with something other  than what the question was about. Namely, the professor talked  here about the great success of "Solidarity" governments  concerning the form of foreign-debt reduction. I share this  view and that was indeed an achievement, but, in all fairness,  we should add something that was not an achievement of  "Solidarity" governments--namely, that these governments failed  to sufficiently develop a proexport economy in Poland. What was  supposed to be a lesser burden as a result of export development  after a few years, after the reduction, when both the debt  repayments and interest-rate repayments were supposed to begin  increasing--unfortunately, that is getting ever less realistic  currently, or it is being made very difficult since we are  facing a major foreign-trade deficit and that is also a major  problem that our economy is facing. [passage omitted] But I  would like to answer Mr. Baczynski's question now.    [Baczynski] Thank you.    [Borowski] Well, regarding the credits you asked about,  if we are to conduct a restructuring--I apologize to Mr.  Student here for using the word--of the economy, and if we are  to modernize industry, build highways, or modernize the  telecommunications network, Poland of course does not have its  own internal capital to accomplish all that. So Poland has to  borrow money, but these are the types of loans that will pay  back in the future, on the condition of course that they were  made the right way....    [Baczynski] And were they in fact?    [Borowski, hesitating] I think we do not know everything  regarding this issue right now since there are different  messages coming in. I want to say that a World Bank mission  will come to Poland in the near future to conduct evaluations  along with us on how these credits are being used. There are  some already known cases, which were also questioned by the  Supreme Chamber of Control, of not very good use of these  credits, but I would not like to make general statements in this  regard. I think there are quite a few loans that are being  implemented the right way. [passage omitted]    [Baczynski, addressing Kolodko] You just said, Professor: Is  there anybody to borrow money from? I think we should return to  the question asked by Mr. Poleski here--namely, who does the  state borrow money from?    [Borowski] Exactly. Perhaps we should explain this since it  is a fundamental issue. Well, in a situation of a budget  deficit, which means revenue from taxes and other sources are  lower than the budget expenditures, one must find a way of  getting money from some source. People in Poland often talk in  terms of: Well, the deficit is just something you can live  with, there is always a way to finance it, we can always write  it down and then spend the money somehow. But the problem is  the budget must have a way of finding the money that is the  deficit, so where will it find it? Well, the government can of  course sell its securities among other things, such as  television commercials, and perhaps our student colleague here  has even purchased one already, and, if not, I recommend it  highly since it really pays back.... [passage omitted]    So like I said, government securities are one way but there  is not much to be gained this way, and the other possibility  that was used extensively was simply through bank loans. Banks  have money they collect from citizens.... [passage omitted]    I would like to present an interesting interpretation of the  domestic debt issue here. Let us look at it this way: Banks  have collected money from citizens, then they lent the money to  the state Treasury, that is the budget. The budget then spent  the money....    [Baczynski, interrupting] For socially justifiable reasons?    [Borowski] Undoubtedly they were socially justifiable  reasons, and this way the citizens also used the money because,  after all, employees of the health service, the education  system, the Army, and so forth--all of them are citizens. So  one can put it this way, at the expense of some simplification:  Some citizens lent money to some other citizens. Perhaps in  some cases they were even the same people since after all, the  savings were collected by everyone. All this money was  processed through the banks and through the budget itself and so  what am I getting at? Well, what I am getting at is that if  there are some people out there today who perhaps say: Why  don't we just not repay that? After all, these are state-owned  banks and a state-owned budget so what is the fuss all about?  Well, what I am saying to that is that would simply mean that  somebody will not get his money if the debt is not repaid. So  not repaying the debt is out of the question here. What is  possible with foreign debt for instance, in terms of some form  of negotiation of debt remission, delays in repayments and so  forth since at the other end you have enormous banks with  enormous potentials--well, that is not possible with regard to  domestic debt.

			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AVON PLANNING TO SELL GIORGIO AND PARFUMS STERN  </P> <P> Avon Products on Friday put up for sale Giorgio Beverly Hills and Parfums  Stern, the booming prestige fragrance subsidiaries that it bought with much  fanfare in 1987.  </P> <P> Proceeds would be used to reduce Avon's $1-billion debt, much of which was  incurred after an ill-fated diversification four years ago into health-care  businesses, spokesman John Cox said.  </P> <P> Diana K. Temple, an analyst with Salomon Bros. in New York, speculated that  Avon could get $400 million for the two units, which have four of the top 10  selling fragrances in the United States: Giorgio Beverly Hills, Red from  Giorgio Beverly Hills, Oscar de la Renta and Uninhibited by Cher. Other brands  include Perry Ellis, Valentino and Deneuve.  </P> <P> Cox emphasized that Avon has not formally decided to sell the units but rather  has hired the investment banking firm of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. to evaluate  offers.  </P> <P> He declined to comment on speculation that Michael Gould, 46, president and  chief executive of the units, might attempt a buyout. Gould, based in Giorgio  Beverly Hills' Santa Monica headquarters, could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

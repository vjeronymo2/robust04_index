			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> ROCKWELL, EATON UNIT CANCEL DEAL OVER EQUIPMENT GLITCHES  </P> <P> An agreement for Rockwell International Corp. to buy the Eaton Corp. subsidiary  that makes electronic defensive gear for Rockwell's B-1B bomber has been  canceled because of development problems with the equipment, the companies  announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> Rockwell also disclosed that it has been hired by Eaton to help work out the  bugs in the so-called electronic countermeasures system, which is designed to  help protect the high-tech supersonic bomber that Rockwell makes for the Air  Force.  </P> <P> El Segundo-based Rockwell announced last month that it had reached an agreement  in principle to buy AIL Systems Inc. of Deer Park, N.Y., a subsidiary of Eaton  Corp.  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Reconsider  </P> <P> The deal was canceled, the companies said in a joint announcement, because of  uncertainty about AIL's contract to produce the ALQ-161 electronic  countermeasures system for the Air Force. No price was ever disclosed, but some  industry analysts put AIL's value at $350 million to $400 million.  </P> <P> If bugs in the program are ironed out and the contract stabilized, Rockwell  would reconsider the purchase, said Rockwell spokesman William Mellon.  </P> <P> Rockwell, prime contractor on the B-1B, delivered the last of the $280-million  planes to the Air Force in April. The Air Force has said that the bomber is  fully operational, but critics in Congress say its ability to perform in battle  would be hampered by flaws in the countermeasures system designed to befuddle  enemy radar and other electronic gear.  </P> <P> AIL built the electronics gear under a $3.5-billion contract and has offered to  remedy its flaws for $520 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 4,400 Employees  </P> <P> Wednesday's announcement was the first public indication that Rockwell would  take part in making the fixes. Spokesman Mellon wouldn't reveal Rockwell's  exact role in the operation.  </P> <P> Cleveland-based Eaton, a maker of automotive and electronics products, has had  AIL up for sale for about a year.  </P> <P> AIL, with 4,400 employees, has headquarters in the Long Island city of Deer  Park and factories at Hauppage and Melville, N.Y., and in Westlake Village.  </P></p>

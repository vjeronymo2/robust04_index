			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Environmental case against Nafta rejected IN A victory for President Bill Clinton, a federal appeals court yesterday overturned a ruling that US officials must prepare an environmental assessment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The unanimous 3-0 decision reversed a lower court's ruling, which had threatened to delay, if not scuttle, the proposed free trade pact between the US, Canada and Mexico. The earlier ruling would also have set a precedent which could have affected other US trade agreements, including the Uruguay Round. Environmental impact statements (EIS) take months to prepare, and sometimes years to argue when they are challenged in court. On June 30, the US trade community was thrown into an uproar when three environmental and public interest groups - Public Citizen, the Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth - successfully argued for US officials to prepare an assessment of Nafta's impact on the environment. District Court Judge Charles Richey ruled that the three groups had 'demonstrated that there is a reasonable risk that Nafta may cause environmental injury'. The administration swiftly appealed, arguing that while agency proposals might be subject to the EIS rule, the president is not. It is the president who submits trade agreements, and his ambassador who negotiates them. The appeals judges agreed and said the plaintiffs could not even sue until executive action was final, that Nafta has yet to be sent to Congress, and the side agreement on environment 'may well change the dimensions of the conflict over potential environmental damage'. Although yesterday's ruling is likely to be appealed again to the Supreme Court, the court is not required to hear the case, and, if it does, is not expected to reverse it. While the White House yesterday was claiming victory, the three groups which brought the suit could claim gains in the court of public opinion. In early summer, most Americans were just beginning to learn about the trade pact. The publicity given the court action brought the environmental link into the news. Nafta has become the most controversial trade agreement in memory, as opponents fan the fears of job losses and environmental damage. The administration is finally pushing hard for the pact, but it will be an uphill battle. Free-traders in Congress worry that the unpopularity of Nafta bodes ill for the more important Uruguay Round. They worry that, if the pact is defeated, loss of US credibility will hamper the already arduous negotiations in Geneva and strengthen the forces of populism and protectionism in Congress.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: EC urges Miyazawa to stimulate growth THE European Community yesterday pressed Japan to open its public procurement more to European products and suggested that Japan should cut income tax to help boost its economy. At an EC-Japanese summit on the eve of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations' economic summit in Tokyo, the community delegation said it was 'disappointed' at the efforts made so far by Japan to stimulate economic growth. It described Japan's Dollars 150bn annual current account surplus as a 'macro-economic problem for Japan and the world'. Mr Henning Christophersen, the EC's commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said Japan's two economic packages agreed last August and in April would not be sufficient to raise Japan's growth rate to its potential of 3 to 3.5 per cent a year. He also criticised Japanese growth measures as being mainly designed to increase demand for domestically produced goods and services. They would not promote growth elsewhere in the world, he said. The EC delegation called on Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, to urge measures to cut Japan's current account surplus as a share of gross domestic product from the 3.7 per cent recorded in the second half of last year. Mr Christophersen said he feared that Japan's surplus could grow further next year to 4 per cent of GDP. But the talks, while frank, appeared not to have been acrimonious. Mr Miyazawa admitted that Japan's current account surplus was embarrassing and said Japan wanted to increase domestic demand. However, Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, said the Japanese leader gave no specific promise to take action. Mr Miyazawa asked the EC delegation if it had any ideas that could help, at which point the EC suggested that Japan cut income taxes. On one issue, the EC and Japan were united. Sir Leon said the community had made clear that it did not support the US idea of 'managed trade' to curb Japan's surpluses. However, he told a news conference that the community would seek a 'fair opportunity' to supply goods to Japanese public bodies. He complained that the US had gained four times more than the EC from Japanese efforts to open up public procurement to foreign suppliers last year. In the months ahead Japan Airlines (JAL) would be seeking engines for its new Boeing 777 aircraft and Japan's self defence forces would be looking for new executive jets. The EC expected that its companies would be considered as suppliers. However, senior Japanese officials said Japan's public sector was more willing to buy foreign products than either the US or the EC. They said that more than 14 per cent of Japanese public procurement went to foreign suppliers in 1991. In 1990, according to the latest available figures, EC public bodies bought less than 2 per cent of their needs from foreign suppliers, while in the US foreign suppliers met 11.9 per cent of public sector needs, the officials said. The officials also said that Japan's bilateral trade surplus with the EC was declining. It fell 7.6 per cent in the first five months of this year, compared with the same period a year ago, they said.</p>

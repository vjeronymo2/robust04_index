			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Tax rate swaps Wouldn't it be nice if companies could protect their earnings from sharp increases in corporation taxes? That is the promise held out by Morgan Grenfell, which has taken the first tentative step to creating a tax rate swap market in the UK. It believes that, given the prospect that Labour could win the next election, many companies will want to guard against the danger of higher taxes. Its tax swap product - modelled on interest rate swaps - could allow companies to fix their tax rates. For the whole concept to work, of course, it is necessary to find counterparties willing to bear the risk of tax rates rising. Morgan Grenfell has managed to unearth one such counterparty - an international bank which actually suffers when corporation tax is cut because of the nature of various equipment leases it holds. But the size of the deal is only Pounds 15m and the number of parties in such a peculiar tax position is likely to be limited. If tax rate swaps are to be anything more than a niche product, the market will have to embrace a wider range of counterparties. One idea is that the scheme might appeal to companies with heavy investment programmes. Though they too would suffer from higher tax rates, the blow could be softened if Labour were simultaneously to improve capital allowances. Given a sufficient inducement, they might be prepared to cushion other companies' tax risks.</p>

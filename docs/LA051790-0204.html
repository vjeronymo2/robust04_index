			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NO SURPRISES DUE IN SPILL REPORT;  </P> <P> INVESTIGATION: COAST GUARD CAPTAIN SAYS THE LARGER QUESTION OF HOW TO TRANSPORT  OIL, TO AVOID REPEATS OF THE HUNTINGTON BEACH ACCIDENT, MUST BE ADDRESSED BY  THE STATE.  </P> <P> No major revelations will come in the U.S. Coast Guard's soon-to-be-issued  report on the Feb. 7 Huntington Beach oil spill, but state policy on oil  delivery procedures is still to be determined, Capt. James C. Card said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Card, who coordinated the Coast Guard-directed cleanup efforts at Huntington  Beach, spoke at a daylong oil spill seminar at the Marina International Hotel  here.  </P> <P> "Our investigation of this accident is complete, but it has not been released  yet," Card said. "It's a fairly thick report. Basically what happened is that  there wasn't enough water (beneath the ship) as the ship came in."  </P> <P> The 800-foot oil tanker American Trader apparently ran over its own anchor on  Feb. 7 as it was preparing to offload at a marine mooring about a mile and a  half off Huntington Beach. At the time, the cause of the accident was  attributed to the ship's being in shallow water, and Card said that is verified  in the written report.  </P> <P> Card said no big surprises will come in the report, which is about the overall  federal investigation of the accident. He said the report is likely to be made  public sometime next week.  </P> <P> The Coast Guard has issued an order requiring annual depth-checking surveys of  the ocean floor around the Huntington Beach offshore mooring, he said. But he  said overall questions about oil delivery still remain to be addressed at the  state level.  </P> <P> "The larger question . . . is how the state wants to treat (ocean delivery of)  oil," Card said. "As long as you use more than 2 million barrels of oil a day,  and you import 1 million of that, you're going to need to bring it in in some  way. This may or may not be the most efficient way, but it's the Coast Guard's  job to make sure it's done as safely as possible."  </P> <P> The State Lands Commission has jurisdiction over most of the offshore  oil-delivery moorings in California, including the one 1.3 miles off Huntington  Beach. So far the commission has issued no report or recommendations on the  offshore moorings following the Feb. 7 oil spill. The Huntington Beach City  Council on April 19 wrote the state commission, urging it to deny ships further  use of the offshore mooring in that city.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays, who was among the speakers at the oil  spill seminar, said in an interview that the city still is waiting for the  State Lands Commission to respond.  </P> <P> "Basically the ball is in their court," Mays said.  </P> <P> The mayor added, "I guess they (the State Lands Commission) are still  collecting information and evaluating our request. We want to get rid of that  mooring. . . . There's no reason for it to be there. It faces the open ocean,  and it can be vulnerable to high seas. Even if you have a six-foot clearance  (between ocean floor and ship bottom), if you have six- to eight-foot ocean  swells, you're going to have a ship bouncing up and down.  </P> <P> Mays said the safest thing to do is move the offshore moorings to a port, such  as Long Beach.  </P> <P> The oil spill seminar was sponsored by the California Marine Parks and Harbors  Assn., an Irvine-based private organization consisting primarily of small-craft  boat owners.  </P> <P> Mays told the group that Huntington Beach was better able than most cities to  handle a crisis like the oil spill because the city, since 1983, has had a  disaster-preparedness plan. The city devised its plan following the heavy rains  and floods there in 1983.  </P></p>

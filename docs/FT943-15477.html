			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Two-tier system for rand 'likely to go' South Africa's cumbersome two-tier exchange rate system was 'fundamentally wrong' and its abolition only a matter of time, Mr Chris Liebenberg, the country's finance minister-designate, said yesterday. However, any decision to abolish the two-tier system had to be 'taken against a background of sound, sustainable government', Mr Liebenberg said, and would depend on the country's reserves and on international confidence. He acknowledged that his appointment this week as replacement to Mr Derek Keys could have been better handled but said he had received a personal reassurance from President Nelson Mandela that the government had a commitment to fiscal discipline. Mr Liebenberg, 60, was appointed on Tuesday, hours after Mr Keys shocked financial markets with his unexpected announcement that he planned to step down this year for personal reasons. In an interview, Mr Liebenberg, formerly head of banking group Nedcor, said he fully supported the reconstruction and development programme, the centrepiece of government economic policy. The programme's success was 'absolutely essential' but this could be achieved within current spending limits. 'Implied in that (the RDP's success) is very strict fiscal discipline that brings with it very strict monetary discipline,' he said. Mr Liebenberg, who said he had no formal political affiliation, accepted that Tuesday's news, which had been preceded by rumours of Mr Keys' resignation, had done damage as government bond rates rose half a point, and the currency weakened. 'There is no doubt there is a Keys factor but that a correction in the market was going to take place was inevitable,' he said. But Mr Liebenberg acknowledged that 'with hindsight, had everything been perfect, it could have been better handled.' On the question of the abolition of exchange controls, Mr Liebenberg said he was no supporter of the current system. 'I believe that South Africa's two-tier exchange rate is fundamentally, inherently wrong. It cannot last. This principle is accepted. It is now a matter of timing.' Three issues would affect the decision to abolish the financial rand: the level of reserves, the overhang of speculative financial rands in the banking system, and international confidence.</p>

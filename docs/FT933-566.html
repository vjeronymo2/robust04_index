			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (1): Towards a treaty of life for the Global Commons / Review of an elegant commentary on the modern world's environmental dilemmas THE GNAT IS OLDER THAN MAN: GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE HUMAN AGENDA by Christopher D Stone Princeton University Press Pounds 14.99 234 pages ENVIRONMENTAL commentary lurches unsteadily between unrelieved doomsdaying and wide-eyed evangelism. Christopher Stone draws you into a much more subtle and invigorating world, with a layer-cake of problems to which answers - if there be any - are rarely straightforward. Since that is how we humans fashion our agendas as we go about our daily businesses, there is a lot to be said for it. 'Some cultures regard the earth and life upon it as relatively insignificant in comparison with eternal Paradise; others regard all of Nature (of which homo sapiens are just another ingredient) as sacred; still others are relatively homocentric. Some nations value whales in the oceans; others, on their plates.' So how should we today provide for tomorrow? 'Many of today's controversial actions, such as the storage of nuclear wastes and the elimination of wilderness areas, involve a shifting of risks on to the unborn. We cannot be sure what the remote effects of our actions will be, particularly in the light of the technology that will be available to our distant progeny. Will they really care that the oceans are whaleless?' For Stone, the best way to negotiate these thickets of criss-crossing interests is to look for common ground in what are still common areas - in the seas and in the upper atmosphere, where claims of national sovereignty fray and fade. Even here, in these Global Commons, the problems are not easily gripped. 'The scale of waste that travels the state-to-commons pathway is gargantuan. Together, the nations of the world pump over 7 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere annually, together with 255 million tons of nitrous oxides and sulphur dioxide, and 770,000 tons of CFCs. Similarly, 85 to 90 per cent of ocean pollution originates on land - sewage sludge, industrial wastes, and, every year, a swelling flotilla of non-biodegradable trash - plastic bottles, soft-drink containers and the like.' Moreover, the seas are proving more resistant to remedial action than the upper atmosphere. As Stone notes ruefully: 'The real stumbling block is simply practical economics. The fact that so much waste is involved - and growing - and so many hardpressed industries and nations are implicated, means that until public protest reaches a shriller pitch, little will change.' Stone gives economic prescriptions their due, but stresses that there are no easy 'polluter pays' shortcuts. Consider the Dutch tulip. Chloride salts, largely from German up-river fertiliser production, come downstream at 1,200 tons an hour, to the evident ill-health of the tulip. But, hold on. 'A German might ask, do the Dutch have more right to raise tulips than the Germans have to raise grain? Are the Dutch to be awarded the upper hand morally simply because they are saddled with the lower bank geographically?' Agreed, the way the river flows, the potash happens to be in the ordinary sense 'the cause' of the trouble. On the other hand, if the downstream Dutch would only grow some crop less sensitive to salt than tulips, the harm would be less. Why isn't the Dutch decision to grow tulips equally 'the cause'? Or should it turn on priorities: Was Germany salting the river before Holland was planting bulbs? Stone is Crocker Professor of Law at the University of Southern California. His earlier book, Should Trees Have Standing? Towards Legal Rights For Natural Objects, is rightly regarded as an environmental classic. Here he points to the inevitability of negotiation as the only way forward, and then more negotiation. He asserts that a treaty mechanism, where attainable, is preferable to the law-suit. The lawyers run up big bills, and can take forever and a day; treaties are less threatening and can sometimes put you ahead of the game, even if only on a partial basis. 'A treaty is clearly the easier to conclude, the fewer the number of nations whose cooperation is required to make it effective. Several early conventions regarding outer space, the moon, and celestial bodies were hammered out successfully because negotiations began when their effects were still distant in space and time, before potential vetoing constituencies had an opportunity to form.' Stone's special attention to the oceans leads him to suggest a system of 'Guardians' drawn from existing international agencies or relevant NGOs, who would be threaded through the legal framework to speak up for particular parts of the common environment when threatened. He argues cogently for a Global Commons Trust Fund, some dedicated monies to underwrite internationally significant efforts. 'No single nation can afford to keep on full-time alert a staff trained and equipped to contain oil spills with oil-eating bacteria, etc. No single nation anticipates enough incidents to warrant the expense. But a force with global responsibilities, financed out of the fund, might well be justified.' Throughout, Stone emphasises that sound achievement is best built on modest ambitions. But as the book unfolds he is inevitably drawn back to the wider picture, and to the narrowness of current legal theory - ie not much since John Rawls's Theory of Justice, and indeed not much in that. 'The entire subject of international justice, which I believe will be the great philosophical issue of the 1990s, Rawls touched upon in 1971 only indirectly in less than three pages - too obscurely to raise to his indexer's attention.' A pointer here, perhaps, to Stone's next book. Stone is writing here for laymen - among whom most businessmen should properly be counted - and legislators as well as lawyers. Worrying away at the intricacies of our environmental predicament, he sharpens interest in a topic that is always prone to compassion fatigue. In Stone's hands, worrying about the planet, or reading about worrying about it, is much more fun than you had perhaps anticipated. For that reason, as well as the prudent self-interest of any alert citizen-cum-businessman, the Gnat deserves a long life. The title? From the Talmud, in dedicatory tribute to the author's father, IF Stone, and to 'the literary tradition from which he came.' Here's how the passage ends: 'Man's late appearance on earth is to convey an admonition of humility. Let him beware of being proud, lest he invite the retort than the gnat is older than he.'</p>

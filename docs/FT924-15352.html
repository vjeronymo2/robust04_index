			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Row erupts over Lawson book THE TORY PARTY was haunted by the spirit of crisis past as well as crisis present this weekend as a fresh row erupted between former cabinet ministers over discussions seven years ago about whether sterling should join the exchange rate mechanism. The dispute centres on Lord Lawson's book about his time as chancellor, and in particular his recollection that Lord Tebbit, now a leading Euro-sceptic, expressed support for the UK's entry into the ERM in November 1985 while he was party chairman. Lord Tebbit fiercely denies the charge. Describing a meeting convened by Mrs Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher, Lord Lawson writes that Lord Tebbit said 'that he would be in favour if I thought it would be helpful economically; and added that he felt it would be easy to carry the party'. In response to that version of the meeting in the Telegraph's serialisation of Lord Lawson's memoirs, Lord Tebbit insisted that the claim was wrong, explaining: 'Loyal as I was to the prime minister, I was naturally reluctant to put the boot in against a chancellor who argued for a policy change within his departmental responsibilities.' He said that if Mrs Thatcher had been isolated on the question of the UK's membership of the ERM in 1985, she would not have been able to withstand for five years, as she did, the pressure for sterling to join. The former chancellor's picture of an ashen-faced Mr John Major wondering if he was equal to the job when he first became Treasury chief secretary in 1987 is also likely to cause irritation in the party. 'For a time after the 1987 general election, I was concerned that I might have made the wrong choice of chief secretary after all - a view I suspect was shared by John Major himself,' Lord Lawson writes. 'He found the job far more difficult than anything he had done before and had to work very hard to try to master it. He would come and see me at Number 11 (Downing Street), ashen-faced, to unburden himself of his worries.'</p>

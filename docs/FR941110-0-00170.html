			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter wondered how availability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary managers would affect the use of this remedy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In cases of immediate jeopardy, if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary manager cannot be located within 10 days of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> last day of the survey, HCFA or the State is required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceed with action to terminate the facility's program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in order to protect the health or safety of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the residents. To safeguard residents when this takes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> place, we will allow a State monitor to be imposed who will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notify HCFA or the State if residents are being subjected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial risks and need to be transferred from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility. If a temporary manager cannot be located for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situation which does not immediately jeopardize the health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or safety of the residents, HCFA or the State has the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility to impose another type of remedy which it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes will best motivate the facility to achieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial compliance. However, if temporary management is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the most logical alternative remedy, and a temporary manager  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot be located, HCFA or the State has the authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminate the provider agreement. We do not believe that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the imposition of temporary management in lieu of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination is a provider right. Rather, it is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodation to the provider if, in the judgment of HCFA or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State, it will lead to substantial compliance and there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are competent temporary managers available in the given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographic area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters requested that States be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to appoint a trustee or a receiver in lieu of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary manager if they have State laws that provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these enforcement actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many States have developed laws in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with State licensure authority that provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanctions similar to temporary management. The States use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these sanctions, such as receivership and trusteeship, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforce compliance with State licensure requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1919(h)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act also gives the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the authority to use these measures when enforcing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with Federal Medicaid participation requirements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the State can demonstrate to HCFA's satisfaction through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a State plan amendment that trusteeship or receivership is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as effective in deterring noncompliance and correcting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies as the remedy of temporary management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, if HCFA approves the State plan amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing trusteeship or receivership as a remedy, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trustee or receiver may be used by a State as an acceptable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative to a temporary manager when the State takes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement action. The State may use the alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy both when a temporary manager is required in cases of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate jeopardy, and when one is selected as the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate enforcement response in non-jeopardy cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asked that we state the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions under which temporary management will be imposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other than the provisions in the law  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring temporary management in situations that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately jeopardize the health or safety of residents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific criteria for imposing temporary management in other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types of situations would be impossible to develop. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision of HCFA or the State to impose a temporary manager  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be based on the deficiencies found at the time of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey coupled with other factors that exist at the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at that particular point in time. For example, a facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> might identify a deficiency before the State survey agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does and attempt to correct it. Although we could not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dismiss the facility's failure to prevent the deficiency,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neither would we ignore the administrative competence that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility demonstrated by identifying and attempting to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address the deficiency on its own initiative. We would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider both factors when selecting the appropriate remedy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 488.417&blank;Denial of Payment for All New Admissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon our review of comments and evaluation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underlying statute, we noted that we did not make it clear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the proposed rule that the authority of the Secretary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deny payment to a facility is limited to Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities. In the case of Medicaid facilities, the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may deny payment to the facility and HCFA may deny payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the State for all Medicaid residents in the facility. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related issue is the question of who must be satisfied that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a facility has achieved and will remain in substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance after the facility has been cited for repeated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instances of substandard quality of care so that payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may resume. Section 1819(h)(2)(E) says that it is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary for Medicare, and section 1919(h)(2)(D) says that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is the State for Medicaid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter said that this remedy should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed only in cases posing a hazard to the residents or in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases when their rights are compromised.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We consider this remedy to be appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for both the cases in which we have designated it may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used and the cases in which we designate it must be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that it will be one of our most effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies because it will strongly motivate facilities to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> come into and remain in compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

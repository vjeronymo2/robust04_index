			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Thorp uranium testing faces court challenge THE POLLUTION inspectorate will today ask local councils and government agencies for their response to proposals for uranium tests by British Nuclear Fuels at its Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield. Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, said last night that if the inspectorate allows the tests to go ahead without full public consultation it will challenge the move in the courts on grounds that it prejudges the outcome of the public consultation on Thorp's future, due to start within weeks. The consultation, expected to be completed by the end of the year, will determine whether the government gives the Pounds 2.8bn plant a licence to start full operation. BNF has asked the inspectorate to let it run radioactive material through Thorp's pipes to detect any technical problems at the plant, which has taken nearly 10 years to build. It says that by commissioning the plant now, it would save two months' delay in beginning full operation. Greenpeace said that the tests would produce radioactive waste as the uranium would contaminate pipework in the building. It said that the government had not justified the creation of that radioactive waste.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 5: Chevron Research and Technology Company, by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> letter dated October 4, 1994, requested a copy of the NPDES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Best Management Practice (BMP) Guidance Document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response: EPA sent the NPDES BMP Guidance document to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chevron on October 13, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 6: Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius (ML&amp;B), Counselors at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Law, by letter dated October 15, 1994, made two comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning the permit. ML&amp;B mentioned that all references  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Florida Administrative Code Chapter 17&hyph;770, 17&hyph;302, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any other ``17-'' should be changed to Chapter ``62&hyph;770, or 62-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 302, and mentioned that Chapter ``62-'' is where the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> law is found. ML&amp;B also mentioned that the Fact Sheet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should contain some discussion of discharge to ``surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waters'', the triggering event. ML&amp;B also mentioned that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permittee should know where to go in order look up the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of ``surface waters'' or discharges to surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waters. Mentioned that these issues and basic guidance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thereon may ensure that all facilities obligated under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general permit actually apply for coverage and discussion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this significant jurisdictional issue in the Fact Sheet or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit itself seems appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response: EPA refers the commentor to the Clean Water Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (CWA) which requires that point source discharges of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollutants to waters of the United States be covered by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPDES permits. The definition of ``point source'' and ``waters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the U.S.'' can be found at 40 CFR Section 122.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, all references that refer to Florida  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrative Code Chapter ``17'' will be changed to Florida  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrative Code Chapter ``62.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 7: Mobil Oil Corporation (MOC), by letter dated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 17, 1994, supported the reissuance of the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit, since it is more efficient and cost effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach to permitting routine activity than the individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitting process. MOC raised several concerns on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> draft NPDES general permit concerning the new requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the whole effluent toxicity (WET) tests. MOC stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the need for WET testing has not been established. It was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that the Fact Sheet cited that the chemical criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was significantly more stringent than Florida's water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality standards and MOC stated that meeting the chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria, coupled with the required treatment processes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be more than adequate to protect aquatic life.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response: In response to MOC comment, EPA notes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical specific discharge limitations mentioned do provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate protection to meet Florida's chemical specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water quality standards. However, since previous toxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring tests did indicate that a number of effluents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were toxic, which is also a violation of Florida  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrative Code (FAC) Section 17&hyph;4.244(3)(a), WET limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were incorporated into the permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 8: MOC stated that if WET testing is required, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure outlined in Part V should be modified. MOC stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that if the compliance limit for WET testing is an LC50  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> &gt; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 100%, the requirement for a full concentration test is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warranted and only a screening test (control and 100% final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effluent only) should be run to demonstrate compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response: Regarding Mobil's comment on the use of multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dilutions, per the EPA acute WET protocol manual (EPA/600/4-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 90/027F) cited in the September 19,1994  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice, such dilutions are recommended to assess NPDES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance for all WET tests (pg. 47&hyph;48). They provide more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information about the dose-response of the test, increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statistical power of the test, and decrease the inherent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variability found in conducting a single test concentration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

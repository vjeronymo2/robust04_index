			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Allied Leisure calling for further Pounds 16m ALLIED LEISURE, the ten pin bowling and night club operator, yesterday launched a Pounds 16.13m net rights issue, its second such call in less than a year and one which will double the capital. Its one-for-one issue of 17.5m shares is pitched at 97p, an 11 per cent discount to yesterday's opening price. The shares slipped 5p to close at 104p after the announcement. Mr Duncan Moss, finance director, said although the issue was following quite swiftly on last year's Pounds 4m call, Allied would now be able to go on expanding without recourse to shareholders for more cash. The company is forecasting a final dividend of not less than 3.25p; that would make 4.75p for the year ending July 16 1991, a 22 per cent increase over the previous 3.9p. There is no profit estimate. Yesterday, the company warned that 'trading and economic conditions caused concern during January and February', but March had shown a significant improvement. Results for the full year would be 'satisfactory' following the advance of 73 per cent to Pounds 1.63m at halfway. Allied also revealed it was applying to transfer from the USM to the official list on May 9. Mr Moss said it was intended to start three new developments in the next financial year, which would cost in aggregate nearly Pounds 13m. These were a MegaBowl ten pin bowling centre in Preston, a night club in Basingstoke and a bowling, night club and theme bar development in Dundee. During the current year Allied had spent about Pounds 15.4m on new leisure developments. Sale of its 20 Wimpy restaurants in January last year helped to fund that. Following the rights issue net borrowings will fall to about Pounds 6.7m, or 22 per cent of shareholders' funds. Mr Moss said the policy was that that gearing should not rise above 55 per cent from now on. Directors, who currently speak for 30 per cent of the capital, will not be taking up their rights.</p>

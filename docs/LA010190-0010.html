			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: TEACH YOUNGSTERS TO PROFIT FROM SETBACKS  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: How can I help build my children's self-esteem and make them  able to succeed in a tough world? I don't want them to be insensitive, but I  don't want them to wilt every time something difficult comes along. My wife and  I aren't wealthy, so they're going to have to make it on their own. -- T.S.  </P> <P> DEAR T.S.: The fact that you're aware that youngsters need to be able to cope  with frustration and disappointment is already a plus. Children need to learn  how to cope with defeat and parents need to explain that we all learn from our  failures. If a child doesn't know this, he may limit himself by trying only  those tasks he knows he can do well.  </P> <P> When things go wrong, when your youngster gets a disappointing grade or when he  fails on a test, help him not to be overcome by these setbacks. Remind him that  they are temporary and that he can learn from his past errors and do better  next time.  </P> <P> Michael Scheier, a psychologist at Carnegie-Mellon University, found that  optimists handle stress better than pessimists. Optimists tend to respond to  disappointments by formulating a plan of action and asking other people for  help and advice while pessimists are likely to react to the same difficulties  by trying to forget the whole thing or by assuming there's nothing they can do  to change things.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I'm engaged to a wonderful woman but I'm troubled by what  happens to her when she drinks. First of all, she doesn't seem to know when to  stop, and when I mention this the next day, she gets defensive, assuring me  that she can stop whenever she wants. I know that after we've been celebrating  at a party, she doesn't remember things that have happened the night before.  This is important because she frequently behaves badly. How can I handle this  and should I insist that she go on the wagon? -- F.T.  </P> <P> DEAR F.T.: I doubt that you'd accomplish much if you simply "insisted" that she  go on the wagon. She's showing symptoms of alcoholism, such as personality  changes when she drinks, denial about her drinking patterns and blackouts or  memory lapses. While some non-alcoholics do occasionally experience these same  symptoms, it's unusual and is a strong indication that there are serious  drinking problems.  </P> <P> There are ways to spot future alcoholics, such as the need to find constant  excuses for a drink, and the pattern of having every occasion -- sad or happy  -- begin and end with a drink. Another clue that you seem to be getting is the  inability of your friend to stop drinking or to refuse alcohol once she's  started.  </P> <P> Try to get her to some meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous. If she refuses, I'd  postpone plans for marriage until she reconsiders.  </P></p>

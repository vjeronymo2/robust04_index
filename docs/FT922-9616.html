			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Business Law: Tangled skein of tax adjustments The differing legal systems and currency fluctuations of nations create burdens on cross-border investment and commerce. These discrepancies often cause the greatest inefficiencies when they involve the taxation of international business transactions. Most developed countries have long recognised the seriousness of tax inefficiencies and have adopted a network of bilateral tax treaties, based on models developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which are intended to reduce the potential for double taxation of income from cross-border transactions. The US has been a leader in this effort but, over the past several years, has pursued a course that, if not properly contained, has the potential fundamentally to undermine these arrangements. The US Internal Revenue Service has become increasingly concerned that many foreign-owned US companies are systematically under-allocating the portion of their worldwide income that should properly be attributable to sales and other activities in the US. The source of this IRS concern is data gathered in the late 1980s which tend to establish that foreign-controlled US corporations earn a substantially lower rate of return in the US than do US-controlled companies. IRS data indicate that while US-controlled corporations had a ratio of taxable income to assets ranging from 1.6 per cent to 1.9 per cent during the period 1983-87, the ratio for foreign-owned US corporations ranged from minus 0.2 per cent to plus 0.8 per cent. There are plausible explanations for statistical discrepancies: the fact that many foreign-owned US companies were acquired within the past decade and thus have relatively high book asset values; that foreign investors may be willing to accept a lower return to gain market share in the US; and so on. But US Treasury and academic economists have not been able to establish to their satisfaction a statistical basis for any alternative explanations to the under-allocation of worldwide income to the US. Responding in part to this data, the IRS has assigned a large part of its audit and legal staff to foreign-owned US company cases. These auditors are often aggressive, and suspicious of the audited taxpayer. This has resulted in cases that are beginning to overload IRS administrative appeals channels and the US Tax Court. The IRS readily admits that dealing with these cases through litigation is inefficient and prefers to resolve them through government-to-government negotiations under the so-called 'competent authority' provisions of various bilateral US tax treaties. The average competent authority case requires two to four years to be resolved. Because resolution requires the voluntary agreement of both governments and the taxpayer, success is unlikely unless the foreign government is willing to refund a portion of any tax payments made to it by the parent multinational as an offset to the US adjustment. The US and Japan, for example, agreed in the late 1980s to competent authority settlements resulting in Japanese refund payments for Toyota, Nissan and Honda that have been reported to total hundreds of millions of dollars for each company. Since that experience, Japan's National Tax Administration has been reluctant to accommodate further US adjustments. It is thus difficult to see how voluntary competent authority proceedings are likely to resolve the flood of IRS-initiated adjustments. It may not be long before other governments decide to follow the IRS example and initiate their own adjustments against US-based multinationals. The revenue stakes are potentially enormous. The techniques developed by the IRS to analyse the activities of foreign-based multinationals can readily be applied by foreign governments to US-based companies. Given that US tax rates are generally lower than those of other leading industrial countries, it is possible that any corporate under-allocation of income to non-resident jurisdiction applies outside as well as inside the US. The problem results in part from the internationally agreed tax rules for related party cross-border transactions, which were largely developed in the 1960s. These rules establish the standard of 'arm's length' dealings between related parties. The quest is to determine what unrelated parties dealing with each other at arm's length would have charged for the relevant goods, services or use of intangibles. Finding persuasive evidence of what such unrelated parties would have charged in similar circumstances is often impossible. Many industries, such as cars, electronics and pharmaceuticals, are dominated by integrated companies where there are few transactions between unrelated parties at the same level of trade. Moreover, multinational related parties enter into specific arrangements that unrelated parties are often unwilling or unable to obtain - such as exclusive supply and purchase arrangements or long-term licences of existing and future technology. Finally, the efficiencies and long-term perspective of many integrated multinational corporations often make their expectations of returns in specific markets at any given time much different from those of an independent company doing business only in a few geographic markets. For these reasons, no third-party transaction prices or formula for determining prices can be identified as correct for any particular multinational. Instead, a broad range of prices is likely to command nearly equal merit, even though the price chosen within that range has a substantial impact on the allocation of income between taxing jurisdictions. In this setting, IRS auditors can identify a set of reasonably correct prices that create a substantial allocation of income to the US during the years under audit. Similarly, in a wide variety of cases, other governments can no doubt identify adjustments that create a substantial income re-allocation to their country. Thus new solutions to income allocation disputes are required. One possible approach has recently been implemented on a trial basis by the IRS. It is a procedure for advance pricing agreements (called APAs) among the IRS, relevant foreign governments and a specific multinational taxpayer. Each agreement would apply for three or more years subject to further renewal. It can cover the pricing of specific transactions involving goods, services or intangibles or can establish a more global allocation of income generally between two or more related entities. The IRS has discussed this procedure with various foreign governments and has found a willingness to entertain negotiations for specific agreements from Australia, Canada, Germany and the UK, among others. The first agreement has recently been completed, involving a US-based manufacturer and its sales affiliate resident in Australia. This APA procedure holds out much hope as a prototype for avoiding the spread of inter-company pricing controversies. It is customised to each taxpayer's circumstances, permitting the creation of specific formulas for pricing and income allocation that meet realistic expectation of the revenue authorities of each country. Because any agreement is achieved in advance of the years in question, the APA procedure resolves a problem with the current system: the fact that governments are reluctant to part with revenues that have already been collected. Moreover, if the procedure is applied to a large enough group of taxpayers, a series of informal guidelines may evolve that can be applied on a broader industry or other basis. Over time, elements of agreed standards might be developed to apply even to taxpayers not choosing to participate in an APA procedure. Any solution to current problems will only work if foreign governments perceive that their interests are served as well. If that perception is developed through negotiation, a source of potentially serious tax barriers to cross-border commerce can be eliminated.

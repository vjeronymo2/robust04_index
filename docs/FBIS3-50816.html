The official held a joint news conference  with Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley within the framework of  his official visit to the country, which ended on 6 January and  during which he reviewed the present status of Chilean-Canadian  economic and trade relations.    Regarding the importance for smaller economies to associate  themselves with the United States, Minister (MacLaren) said his  party, the Liberal Party, had been in the opposition until last  year and was a critical opponent of an agreement with the United  States because it was involved in unfair practices and  maintained subsidies. This situation was partly solved thanks to  NAFTA and GATT, the minister said.    Foxley and (MacLaren) outlined the growing Canadian  investment in Chile, which reached $4 billion, stressing that it  will continue to grow this year through the association contract  between Codelco [Copper Corporation] Chile and a consortium that  includes the Canadian firm (Luck Minerals) to exploit the Laura  field.    The minister on 6 January participated in a meeting with  government authorities and Eduardo Aninat and Carlos Figueroa,  [finance and foreign ministers-designate, respectively] two of  President-elect Eduardo Frei's cabinet members.</p>

			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Lloyd's calls egm vote on new funding LLOYD'S OF LONDON is to ask Names at an extraordinary general meeting to approve plans to introduce new corporate investors to the insurance market. The meeting, to be held on October 20, is designed to head off any action by dissident loss-making Names that could delay the entry of new 'incorporated Names'. Mr David Rowland, chairman, said in a letter to Names - the individuals whose assets support the market - that Lloyd's wanted to 'clear the way for new capital with certainty before the end of October'. The Lloyd's council - the market's governing body - will consider on September 8 a rulebook outlining the terms on which corporate capital can participate in the market. Publication is expected soon afterwards. The plans to attract corporate investors, announced in April, have caused considerable controversy at the market. Last week dissident Names failed in an attempt to force Lloyd's to press new investors to bail out loss-making Names. Several investment schemes to bring corporate capital have been developed by UK and US banks but cannot go ahead until rules are approved. Mr Rowland also said that Lloyd's had decided on the rules it would follow if it needed to raise funds in the future through a special levy on members. A vote by members would be required to approve the levy. Lloyd's said the voting rights 'should be proportionate to the members' proportionate capacity' - which would place more voting power in the hands of corporate investors. The Association of Lloyd's Members applauded the decision to make an early decision on voting systems, and said it recognised the severe time pressures in admitting new capital. It called for ways to be found for any objections to the new terms for corporate capital participation to be publicised before the meeting, as members would be voting without debate on the subject.</p>

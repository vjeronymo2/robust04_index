			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Blame Squarely Placed"] </F>   [Text] UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report to  the Security Council, made public yesterday after a long wait,  was welcomed by the Cyprus Government which, realistically,  could not have wished for anything more. Butrus-Ghali  unequivocally laid the blame for the deadlock in the latest  round of negotiations on the Turkish Cypriot side which, he  said, did not have the political will to reach an agreement on  the implementation of the confidence-building measures.    He went even further, submitting five options to the  Security  Council on how to proceed after the latest failure. One is to  withdraw UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus] from the island, which  would, in effect, be a reward for Rauf Denktas intransigence, as  it is the Greek Cypriot side that wants the peacekeeping force  to remain in Cyprus. He also suggested the possibility of using  "coercive" measures against the side which did not cooperate.  Another option would be to allow time for reflection by the  Security Council and the guarantor powers, not ruling out the  calling of an international conference. The two remaining  options are more familiar: a return to the set of ideas and the  map, or another attempt to implement the measures, even though  he admitted that the last option would fail.    President Glavkos Kliridhis got exactly what he had been  demanding in the report--the side responsible for the deadlock  was blamed and the secretary-general suggested alternative  courses of action. Now, whether the Security Council would  adopt the suggestion for "coercive" measures is far from  certain. What is certain, and in no way subject to  interpretation, is Butrus-Ghali's assertion that the Turkish  Cypriot side is lacking the political will for any agreement to  be reached. He also exposed Denktas's favorite argument in  rejecting UN proposals, about the Turkish Cypriots' security  concerns--he did not see how this security could in any way be  threatened by the implementation of the measures. In addition  to this, he was emphatic (including documents to prove his  point) in denying Denktas's claim that there had been changes to  the original UN package.    But things must be kept in perspective. Kliridhis, unlike  his predecessor, is not the type of politician to present the  report as some major triumph, even though he deserves credit for  his skillful handling. He ignored the criticism from all  directions, calculating that Denktas's lack of political will  would be exposed if he played his cards right, which he did. No  one can say of course that a Cyprus settlement, as envisaged by  the Greek Cypriots, is any closer now; nor can anyone forecast  what line the Security Council would take when it discusses the  report.    However the report could prove quite useful to the  government  next January when the European Commission will take a decision  on Cyprus' application for membership of the European Union.</p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> VIET WRITER SHOT IN FRESNO TOLD OF DEATH THREATS THREE YEARS AGO  </P> <P> Doan Van Toai, the internationally known Vietnamese writer shot as he walked  through his Fresno neighborhood Saturday, said in an interview three years ago  that his life had been threatened by anti-Communist extremists.  </P> <P> Toai, who remained in serious condition Sunday at Valley Medical Center in  Fresno, recently wrote an article sympathetic to the current Vietnam government  and has long been a controversial figure because of his actions during the  Vietnam War and his writing since.  </P> <P> Toai's views and anti-war actions in South Vietnam had put him at odds with  many in Southern California's Vietnamese refugee community. Vietnamese-language  newspapers wrote editorials against him, while outspoken leaders warned him  that his views were unwelcome.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Several Attacks  </P> <P> The shooting of Toai is the latest of several attacks in California in recent  years against Vietnamese refugees who advocate that the United States establish  diplomatic relations with Vietnam.  </P> <P> Through his books and a magazine, Toai in recent years has advocated restoring  ties with Vietnam in order to deliver humanitarian aid to the people. In a 1986  interview with The Times, he said that an article he wrote exposing alleged  fraud by an anti-Communist group provoked death threats.  </P> <P> "I wrote an article in the Los Angeles Times saying these people who want to  fight the Communist government are collecting money for that cause but are  actually using the money for themselves," Toai said then. "The group that I  wrote about in 1982 was overwhelmingly supported by the refugee community in  Los Angeles."  </P> <P> "The group threatened to kill my whole family after the story ran," Toai said.  </P> <P> As he walked through his Fresno neighborhood at 9 a.m. Saturday, witnesses told  police, a "dirty" brown Pontiac station wagon carrying two Asian men drove by,  with several shots being fired at Toai. The 42-year-old author was hit three  times and later underwent surgery.  </P> <P> Fresno Sheriff's Department investigators divulged no new information Sunday  about the attack, a possible motive or suspects. But Sheriff's Sgt. Oliver Moon  said Saturday that the victim had not been strong enough to be interviewed.  </P> <P> Nhat Tien, a Santa Ana writer and poet, said Toai recently published a  Washington magazine, Institute for Democracy in Vietnam, which served as a  vehicle for expressing his political views on Vietnam.  </P> <P> In the magazine's summer 1989 issue, Toai argued in an article that the United  States should establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam, said Tien, who had a  copy of Toai's magazine.  </P> <P> "He (Toai) believes that if there is a relationship with the United States, the  condition of the poor Vietnamese people would change for the better. He  believed that if economic conditions improved, the political climate would  change, much like China," Tien said.  </P> <P> "He wrote many, many articles saying that," he added.  </P> <P> On Sunday, Fresno Sheriff's Sgt. Rick Cobbs said there has been no recent  political firestorms "that I know of" in Fresno's Vietnamese community.  </P> <P> In both Fresno, one of the largest Vietnamese resettlement communities in the  country, and in Orange County's Little Saigon, Toai was far from popular among  refugees, several community leaders said Sunday.  </P> <P> In Fresno, a member of the Vietnamese Assn. of Central Valley said Sunday that  many people in the refugee community were suspicious of Toai and didn't trust  him.  </P> <P> Toai, the member said, would make statements that led people to believe he  really supported the Communists. "He said, 'The Communists do some good things  for the people of Vietnam.' If they do good things, then why are we here? We  escaped to come here; no way we can support the Communists."  </P> <P> A prominent member of Fresno's Vietnamese community, who asked not to be  identified, added: "The Vietnamese community is really talking about this,  they're not surprised he was shot."  </P> <P> Chuyen V. Nguyen, a former South Vietnamese Air Force pilot who now lives in  Orange County, recalled that Toai was a member of South Vietnam's educated  class who led anti-war protests in Saigon.  </P> <P> "He did a lot of damage to the democracy of Vietnam back home," Nguyen said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Served in Prison  </P> <P> "Even after Toai escaped from some so-called prison in 1977 or 1978, he  traveled to China with a North Vietnamese official who then opposed the regime  in North Vietnam. We in the Vietnamese refugee community believe he has close  ties to Vietnam," Nguyen said.  </P> <P> "The Vietnamese people here in the U.S. view him as another member of the  Communist Party. Despite his imprisonment, he was more well-known for leading  the protests because he had organized a whole bunch of students, some of them  imitating American students at the time who advocated a 'resist the draft'  movement," Nguyen said.  </P> <P> "These were educated members of the nation, who didn't want to go out and join  the military but protested instead. That is why a lot of suspicion surrounds  Toai," he said.  </P> <P> Asked if Toai had been targeted by the right, Nguyen said the shooting might be  the result of his former activities, which is crucial right now because, he  said, the Vietnamese government is trying to to reconstruct the country and  help sway opinion.  </P> <P> Toai has co-authored two books, "The Vietnamese Gulag," and "Portrait of the  Enemy" with writer David Chanoff.  </P> <P> In 1986, a former Saigon housing official, Tran Khanh Van, was shot in Orange  County's Little Saigon after he was quoted as saying he supported normalizing  relations with Vietnam. His assailant pleaded guilty and was convicted. And on  April 30, 1988, novelist Long Vu, a well-known Vietnamese author, suffered  partial paralysis after a severe beating in the same Westminster refugee  community.  </P> <P> Times Staff Writer Tracy Wilkinson contributed to this report.  </P></p>

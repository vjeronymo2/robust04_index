			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ORDER AIDING HANDICAPPED ON BUSES UPSET  </P> <P> A court order requiring transit authorities nationwide to equip all new buses  with wheelchair lifts was overturned by the full U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of  Appeals on Monday.  </P> <P> The court said the U.S. District Court and a three-judge panel of the 3rd  Circuit overstepped the boundaries of the lawsuit filed against the U.S.  Transportation Department in 1988 by Americans Disabled for Accessible Public  Transit and several other groups.  </P> <P> A federal regulation already requires agencies to make new buses accessible to  the handicapped, and the groups filing the lawsuit never argued that anyone was  violating the provision, Circuit Judge Edward R. Becker wrote.  </P> <P> The issue has become a rallying point for activists for the handicapped, with  groups calling on the Bush Administration to let the original 3rd Circuit  ruling stand. The opinion Monday addressed the Administration's appeal.  </P> <P> The court upheld the federal provision targeted by the activists in their  lawsuit, giving local agencies the right to decide how to serve the handicapped  -- through accessible buses, para-transit services, or a combination.  </P> <P> ADAPT had argued that the provision conflicted with the regulation on  accessible buses, but the court disagreed.  </P> <P> The rule strikes "a balance between preserving local discretion, avoiding the  imposition of unduly burdensome costs and ensuring adequate transportation  services" for the disabled, Becker wrote.  </P></p>

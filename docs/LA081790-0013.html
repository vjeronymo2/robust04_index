			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND OF MILD TEMPERATURES  </P> <P> An unusual low-pressure trough moving in from the Pacific Northwest will cast a  long shadow over the West Coast this weekend, bringing with it Junelike skies,  according to the National Weather Service.  </P> <P> The low-pressure trough more typical of June is keeping night and morning skies  shrouded in clouds, but afternoons will turn sunny, said forecaster Dan Atkins.  </P> <P> "It looks like a pleasant weekend," Atkins said. The humidity from Hurricane  Diana is gone and temperatures are mild, just about normal for this time of  year.  </P> <P> The high Thursday was 78 at Lindbergh Field, with a low of 69, which compares  favorably with the norm of 78 and 67 for this time of year. The record high for  this date was 88 in 1983; the record low was 59 in 1881.  </P> <P> Temperatures at the beaches today and through the weekend will range from 72 to  77, Atkins said, with a water temperature of 70 degrees. Sea breezes are  expected to blow at 10 to 16 m.p.h., and the surf will crest at 2 to 4 feet.  </P> <P> Coastal highs will range from 77 to 82 with lows of 66 to 77, Atkins said. The  mercury in the inland valleys is expected to rise into the mid 80s to low 90s.  </P></p>

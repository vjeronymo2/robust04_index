			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL PLAYERS ARE HELPING THEIR OWN  </P> <P> Ballplayers aren't any different now from how they were a generation or a  century ago, so they shouldn't be blamed. They still think history began the  day before yesterday and life goes on forever -- happily ever after.  </P> <P> They don't know about the players who came before them and made the game the  pot of gold it is today.  </P> <P> For that matter, neither do the owners, who made fortunes on the backs of  players and didn't have to give back freedom or money.  </P> <P> George Steinbrenner makes the other owners look bad. Whatever Steinbrenner's  motivation, the New York Yankees' owner is the first of the owners to respond  to the work of the Baseball Alumni Team, the group that puts on the Old Timers  Series for Equitable.  </P> <P> The Yankees play the Kansas City Royals July 13 and Steinbrenner has pledged to  take expenses off the gate and give the balance to the fund that helps needy  baseball people. Consider that he might have at least 40,000 in Yankee Stadium  for the first game after the All-Star break, and it's a substantial gesture.  </P> <P> The Alumni Team stages a game in each of the 26 ballparks. They average 33,000  per game. The owners donate only the playing field. Equitable gives the Alumni  $10,000 for each game and $1,000 to each player.  </P> <P> In 1989 the term "needy" in reference to an athlete looks like a contradiction  in terms. The last thing they should need is public charity, as long as owners  and players are reaping rich rewards. But players haven't always made the kind  of salaries they enjoy now.  </P> <P> And not even the black players acknowledge the contribution of the Negro  Leagues. "I read about Babe Ruth and Walter Johnson when I was growing up," Bob  Gibson said. He didn't read about Willie Wells, and neither did I because  Willie Wells played in the Negro Leagues and the national print didn't give it  much coverage.  </P> <P> Willie Wells died a few months ago, and his widow is broke, says Joe Garagiola,  the new president of the Baseball Alumni Team. If you need a spokesman for a  cause, Garagiola is the spokesman you want. If you want examples, Garagiola  will give examples and protect anonymity and dignity at the same time.  </P> <P> The organization paid rent for Denny McLain's family while he was in prison and  helped hold the family together. Somebody from the group read a Tampa, Fla.,  newspaper headline about a raffle to buy an artificial leg for a former  big-league outfielder, who turned out to be Sandy Amoros. He's the fellow who  made the catch that saved the 1955 World Series for the Brooklyn Dodgers.  </P> <P> A former teammate of Garagiola suffered a stroke and his wife wrote that the  sheriff was at the door and she had no place to turn. She owed $263 in payments  on their trailer and $233 in rent to the trailer park, $1,100 to Sears, $600 to  Penney's, $700 to Belk's and $323 in taxes. The Alumni Team now pays the  mortgage and rent.  </P> <P> By the standards of today's ballplayer, the figures are a pittance. The  commissioner's office pays expenses for the Alumni board of directors. The  owners contribute nothing. The players association acknowledges something, but  it finds complications blocking participation when it ought to find a way to  help.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't say they were obligated," Gibson said. "I'd like them to feel they  want to contribute something."  </P> <P> When the baseball pension was established in 1946, it was to be funded by the  radio fees for the World Series. And so it went for four years. The 1950  Phillies insisted on keeping the television revenue for themselves. Marty  Narion, then the union head, had to make an impassioned plea to get their  contribution.  </P> <P> The difference between then and now is that almost all of the old-time players  had to go to work after baseball. Today, the pension pays $90,000 a year at age  62 for the top category. There are about 400 living players from before the  pension and even some of today's players who need help.  </P> <P> There are a number of younger, recent players who need help as well. One is 28  years old. "Mental problems; difficulty adjusting," said Ralph Branca, the  outgoing president of the Baseball Alumni Team.  </P> <P> Many players find life a trial after competition and celebrity. They thought it  would go on forever.  </P> <P> "Too bad other walks of life don't have the services we can give our own,"  Gibson said. He is one of the most active of the contributors and was as tough  a player as there ever was. He wouldn't talk to a man from an opposing team in  an All-Star Game.  </P> <P> He is very much like Bill White, the president-elect of the National League,  who thinks too many hitters complain about being thrown at when all the pitcher  has done is come inside. White and Gibson were roommates on the good St. Louis  teams of the mid-1960s. White was skilled at pulling the outside pitch; Gibson  tried to preserve the outside corner of the plate for his own by pitching  inside to players who crowded the plate.  </P> <P> Gibson is delighted for White's election -- personally, for a good friend --  and for the fact of it. "It gives kids who might look at this an idea that  things can be different, that 'it might happen for me,' " Gibson said. "After  he does a good job, it's going to prove to a lot of Archie Bunkers life is not  quite what they thought."  </P></p>

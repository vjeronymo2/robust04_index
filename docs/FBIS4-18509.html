			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Werner A. Perger: "A Cool Fighter Who Is Putting </F> an End to the Foolishness"]    [Text]Rudolf Scharping embodies Social Democracy's will to  win. He has lined up the Social Democratic Party [SPD] behind  him, and he intends to lead it to power.    More than ever in this government's tenure, a change of  power  is in the air, and this quiet preliminary hint of spring has a  name: Rudolf Scharping. Strangely unobtrusively, somehow as if  it were an incidental matter, the 46-year-old man from the  Westerwald has established himself in the public consciousness.  Gradually, he is imparting concrete features to the post-Kohl  era.    The boss. Even though he is not yet very  well-known, thanks to his omnipresence, he is an old  acquaintance. There is something self-evident about his claim to  power. That is, perhaps, the most important prerequisite for the  change that Scharping wants to bring about.    Almost single-handedly, he has led the party to its current  position, within reach of power. With persuasion, a great  investment of time, and toughness. He has compelled many a  consensus. The fact that Scharping becomes massive where he  senses resistance was something critics within the party  encountered first-hand in his Rhineland-Palatinate land  association. Anyone this stubborn man at the helm himself  perceives to be stubborn is in for a rough ride. One of his  colleagues says: "Rudolf has a long memory for such things."    Scharping himself considers patience and fortitude to be his  virtues in this way. The process matters, not the result. The  result decides, not the moment. He says: "Whoever wants  everything in the result comes acropper in the process."    Rudolf Scharping cites an example: some at the party  convention in Wiesbaden would have criticized him for not  honoring the importance of women. Now, however, the party--as a  result of his leadership--is appointing two women to the Supreme  Court, the result of a lengthy process of which the unworthy  hanger-on party surrounding the candidacy of Herta  Daeubler-Gmelin was a part. She herself put an end to the wicked  game by her refusal. "Results count, not the event," says  Sharping. Have you got that?    Scharping and his party. He has travelled a long road to  align the SPD behind his will to power and to unite it to his  strategy of power. In the processes, differences were planed  away that it would have been preferable to retain. Distinctions  from other parties grow pale. The SPD is pushing its way to  power through the middle. Heiner Geissler speaks of a "Christian  Democratization of the SPD." He says that is dangerous for the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU]. There hardly are any  distinctions between the major parties any longer, say, almost  in unison, members of the left-wing Frankfurt circle and  commentators of the FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, by no means  left-wing, alike. Scharping himself claims to be quite close to  the foreign and security policies of Kohl and Kinkel. His  message is: have no fear. A change at the top will bring no  change in foreign policy. By taking flight forward, he also  considers the issue of internal security to be disarmed.  Liberals and members of the left wing might well grit their  teeth and moan: "Internal security is a real issue; that must be  taken seriously by a left-wing party, otherwise `deepest  sympathies.'"    On the road to power today, the watchword is: "Discord  confuses the voters. Unity calms them." In the SPD, which is  notorious for its discord, Scharping has prevailed in large  measure, politically as well as personally, with commensurate  expenditures of time and energy. "No path too long, no time too  precious," he says of this part of his leadership work.    Since the members elected him chairman in a preliminary  election, he has been on his way within the party. There is  hardly a regional party convention in which he does not  participate. But, he also takes prudent care of the neglected  egos of the Social Democratic grandees: he honors milestone  birthdays in the establishment, if possible, by his presence,  especially the 50th, which is an ever-increasing occurrence  among the "grandchildren," a group among which he, the youngest  in this age group, has not really been counted for a long time.    He has just learned the extent to which the new feeling of  commonality and closed ranks has come to rest upon him. Sent to  his sickbed for a week with a gastro-intestinal virus, the old  Social Democratic miseries threaten to break out once more,  namely the quarrel about traditions and changing them, the  quarrel of the just cause, and the personal pecking order. By  telephone, radio, television, and in the press, Scharping  followed the SPD fight for long-term care insurance, the  somewhat premature notification from the "barracks" that the  chance of reaching agreement with the coalition, with Dressler's  "not with me you don't" blustering, and Verheugen's cool "that  is just a single opinion" could be seen.    That was more than the chairman could take. Still a bit  wobbly on his legs (and nine pounds lighter), on the week-end he  hurried, as a surprise guest to the Congress of the Task Force  for Employee-Related Questions (AfA) in Koblenz and vented his  spleen: "We cannot continue to dance at the same monkeys' ball  that brought us down to the cellar." In the end, he got a  standing ovation, though he may, in the final analysis, have to  climb over Dressler's objections. Anyone who wants to lead  simply cannot allow himself to be ill.    The Party. Scharping is a do-it-yourselfer, a  student of the files, someone who always did his homework, in  that point, not unlike his predecessor's predecessor,  Hans-Jochen Vogel. But Scharping is also a team player; he can  delegate--so much so, that his colleagues often moan.    Politically, he works particularly closely with Guenter  Verheugen, the national managing director. A relationship of  trust has grown between the two that is--if the insiders are not  exaggerating--a rarity in this business. Strategically, their  mechanisms tick in much the same way. Their instructions to the  party are unadornedly tough: Closed ranks, no little games, no  more political hanky-panky (for example, discussions of a  red-green coalition). Clinton's campaign, and it's internal  guiding motto, It's the economy, stupid! serves  pretty much as the model. Anyone who has other concerns is  rocking the boat. Anyone who speaks of visions should--to  paraphrase the Austrian head freely--seek the advice of a  physician. Verheugen recommends reduction to the essentials,  "the Social Democratization of the SPD" one might say, even if  that is not terribly exciting.    A decade and a half ago, when Scharping was just working his  way up through the ranks of the Mainz SPD Landtag  caucus, Verheugen, 49 years old, and a bit of a hack, had just  organized a successful campaign for the Free Democratic Party  [FDP] alongside SPD Chancellor Schmidt against the Christian  Social Union [CSU] candidate Strauss. He knows his business, and  its tricks, even the dirty ones. Now, even Verheugen senses, for  the first time since reunification, when he switched to the SPD,  that a change in power is in the wind. Perhaps that is why he  reacted so sharply to Dressler. His first error, from  Scharping's viewpoint, but with public censure, that, too, is  cleared away. And Verheugen is too "cool" to let the canker  gnaw. It is all in a day's work. Besides: "As party chairman,  Scharping has the greatest authority since Willy Brandt." Bow  down and be done with it.    The "barracks" have been beefed up. An old pro, Joachim  Boudre-Groeger, former head of the National Managing Director  Bahr's office, a schooled diplomat, is back on loan to party  central, having served about 15 years in the foreign service--as  Ambassador to Vietnam, among other things.    There he is Verheugen's deputy, and at the same time  "technical campaign leader:" organizer of everything that would  serve to bring about a change of power.    Reinforcements were also brought in from Hamburg: Claus Noe,  as state counselor to Hamburg's Senator for the Economy, who  left office after the SPD quasi coalition was formed, a man of  long experience in Bonn. For lack of space, Oskar Lafontaine  left the new man his desk in the "barracks;" Noe will, above  all, act as an adjunct to his work, as an aide in formulating  things, possibly as an advisor as well. But who knows? Perhaps,  after the campaign work he has done, in the fall of the super  election year, in addition to Noe's expertise, perhaps his  experience in the failed Hamburg coalition negotiations with the  Greens will be in demand as well.    Finally, there is Monday's cloverleaf. Scharping's inner  campaign leadership. Of course, Verheugen will be a part of it,  then, from Duesseldorf, there is the head of the state chancery  and potential Rau successor, Wolfgang Clement; from  Saarbruecken, Lafontaine's presumed successor, Reinhard Klimmt,  chairman of the SPD Landtag caucus and Lafontaine  confidant; and, from Mainz, the head of Scharping's state  chancery, one-time and last office director of Willy Brandt's up  to the time of his resignation as party chairman. On the  outside, the significance of this crew is put too high. It is  not making any political decisions. It is just planning the  day-to-day routine of the super election year.    The axis. Perhaps everything would take a  different turn if Scharping had not patched things up with  "Oskar." At the present time, in the SPD, nothing can be done  against Lafontaine, the deputy party chairman. It is a preferred  position; it makes the failed chancellor candidate of 1990 a  critical entity within his party. A strong partner, or a  dangerous opponent. Scharping had to make a decision.    Lafontaine would, most preferably, have become candidate for  the chancellorship when Engholm so relatively unexpectedly  dropped out. Somehow or other, he felt the expectation last  year, and promptly caused it to grow to a palpable illusion that  a newly elected party chairman, Scharping, would offer him,  "Oskar," this peak position, perhaps after a brief hesitation,  or possibly just pro forma. No matter, he would have grabbed it.  The 1990 defeat hurt him more than the memory of the attack that  same year. He would, only too gladly, have settled his political  accounts with Kohl, and with some in his own party, with an  election victory.    But Scharping's offer was not forthcoming. The new chairman,  who does not play second fiddle to Lafontaine by any means when  it comes to desire for power, indicated interests of his own.  Lafontaine was not even offended. But then, Scharping's charm  offensive began, and he courted none so much as the seething  lion from adjacent Saarbruecken, attentions that were intended  to yield results. A political partnership seems to be placed on  new footings, an alliance with one common goal: a change at the  helm.    In terms of content, the axis has already withstood a few  stress trials, particularly where the new economic  belt-tightening and realism of thrift of the Scharping SPD is  being debated. Holding the line, saving, shifting things around,  rebuilding, nothing is permitted to cost more than before, every  reform must be cost-neutral. That is the message both preach.  They make a plea for lowering overhead, clearly turn down every  increase in taxes and disbursements ("The limits of what can be  tolerated have been reached"); they demand tax-incentives for  investors (in keeping with the stability and growth law), warn  grim tariff fighters in their own party to be flexible and  realistic ("...not to be more radical in their rhetoric than the  trade unions themselves.") That is not easy in a party in which  Rudolf Dressler is not an outsider. The debate is bitter, little  as Scharping likes it, much as Lafontaine grips his head  afterward (as if he wanted, like another supereconomist before  him, to despair in his own party: "alas, how much ignorance is  there in this world...").    Thanks to his somewhat strong-arm manner, the man from  Saarbruecken now serves the left-wingers of the party as a sort  of bogeyman. They criticize him especially as a lackey of the  neoconservatives, in the face of whose policies of  consolidation, which are not social in nature, Scharping is,  when measured against Lafontaine, cut from different cloth  altogether. That is what was said at the final meeting of the  Frankfurt circle three weeks ago, but he does not want to let it  stand. The axis remains. A few days later, before the SPD party  council, Scharping insisted that the governmental quotient--that  portion of all state expenditures of the GNP not be expanded,  not even under an SPD regime. He made it clear that the idea was  not just something that the wicked Oskar had dreamt up: "All  those who think they could cozy up to Oskar in these matters had  better realize they would have to cozy up to me in the same way."    The chancellor candidate and his economist, a strong union.  They embody the SPD's will to power and they stand for the  possibility that this year, after many rounds of voting, with  risks for the government and the opposition alike that cannot  yet be assessed, for the first time in Germany's postwar  history, the opposition may come to power by being voted in. The  hopes of many, of getting rid of the "fatso" and his "carbonara  round" after 12 years, and perhaps, even of getting rid of the  liberals, who have been playing a role in Bonn now for a quarter  of a century, much too long, rest particularly with Rudolf  Scharping. That would be, where everything else has changed,  certainly a considerable step, by what then? Does Scharping,  does Lafontaine, stand for new things? Do they promise anything  more than a continuation of the old by new means? These are  questions that the new, no longer so very young generation of  the SPD must first answer.    In an interview, Scharping says he has little time to woo  trust. It is as if he were asking for an advance. He senses the  impatience among those who still see the sense of politics, he  can imagine the expectations. The meetings that are filled to  overflowing create hope. "Stop talking about being annoyed," he  tells the party. It would be possible to convince oneself to do  that. "I, myself, sense annoyance at being annoyed," he mocks.  And he thinks he can sense that there is something stirring  throughout the country. A change in mood. A mood to change the  powers that be.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Heloisa Magalhaes] </F>   [Text] In order to facilitate the installation of fiber  optics cables in downtown Rio de Janeiro, Embratel [Brazilian  Telecommunications Company] will use the ducts of the  underground electric power network of the Light Company. There  are 21.88 km of links making up the national fiber optics  network, which Embratel is installing to interconnect the main  Brazilian capitals.    This kind of installation will prevent not only the problems  caused by work in very busy areas like downtown Rio de Janeiro,  but will also reduce the cost of installing the fiber optics  links, Embratel has reported. The cables will supplement the  distribution work that the Rio de Janeiro Telephone Company  (Telerj) is doing with the national network.    According to Embratel President Renato Archer, Eletrosul  [Southern Electric Power Plants] electric power towers are being  used for the Florianopolis-Curitiba-Porto Alegre connection.  The interconnection with Curitiba and Sao Paulo follows the  railway network. The work toward awarding the contracts for the  work in these two cities is in its final stage. The connection  between Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo is ready. It has operated  since August 1993, following the Via Dutra highway. Through  this connection it will be possible to gradually increase the  capacity for simultaneous phone calls between the two cities to  123,000, whereas today that capacity lies at 39,000.    Archer added that a "fiber optics triangle" joining Rio de  Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Belo Horizonte is about to be completed.  "This triangle is larger than the entire Spanish fiber optics  network," he said. He expects that by the end of the year the  contracts for all the connections to the northeastern region  will already have been awarded, taking cables from Rio de  Janeiro to Fortaleza. In the area between Salvador and  Fortaleza the electric power network will be used for the  cables, thanks to an agreement with CHESF [Sao Francisco  Hydroelectric Company].    According to Embratel reports, the use of electric power  company ducts permits a substantial reduction of the cost of  installing the national network, which provides for investments  of up to $1.5 billion until 1996. The network reaches Europe  through the Columbus underwater cable, which is being installed.  Connection with the United States will be done through the  Americas II system, while Mercosur [Common Market of the South]  countries will be connected with Brazil and with the northern  hemisphere through the Unisur cable.</p>

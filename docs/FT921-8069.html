			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Making Westminster user-friendly - Parliamentary procedure ONE SITTING a week in the morning, some Fridays off, and the prospect of earlier ends to some parliamentary days are among proposals in a cross-party report which aims to take some of the politics out of parliamentary procedure. The plans from the all-party committee of MPs chaired by Mr Michael Jopling, a former Tory chief whip, hold out the prospect of more rationality and common sense in Westminster arrangements. They do not, however, go as far towards normal office hours as some campaigners will have hoped. Automatic timetabling of legislation is proposed, and the plea for short speeches - including those from ministers and their shadows - will be renewed. More parliamentary days will close with a vote at 10pm rather than the current later sittings. Backbench bills would still be taken on Fridays and backbenchers would retain the ability to raise subjects for legislation in afternoon 'prime time' just after questions, even though such measures have little chance of becoming law. The plans, agreed yesterday and to be published on Friday in time for a debate before parliament dissolves for the general election, are likely to figure in more than one party manifesto as a way of making Westminster more user-friendly. Certainly there was a great deal of cross-party common ground in the committee. Some who can remember the minuscule and indeed negative majorities of the Labour governments of the 1970s wonder, however, how far the attempt to adapt parliamentary procedures would survive a hung parliament or a government with a single-figure majority. One senior business manager commented that if the election result is as tight as predicted, then automatic timetabling of legislation would not be acceptable because it would cut the traditional rights of the Opposition too far. Sir Peter Emery, Tory chairman of the all-party procedure committee, dismissed the Westminster lore that delay is a strong opposition card. It was, he said, a 'false belief that late-night sittings and filibusters actually force the government to do anything'. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that MPs have no stomach for extensive sittings - but that is in the context of a government with a majority not far short of 100. The possibility of ministers losing a vote if it were delayed might stiffen the nerves. But perhaps the real reason why those who currently back the reforms may have second thoughts after an election lies in Sir Peter's comment that he saw every reason why they 'should prove likely to be adopted by any new government'. With both the main parties expressing confidence of victory, they may change their tune when addressing the plans from the point of view of a new opposition.</p>

A complaint filed in Reno federal court  named George Green, 42, and his wife Kathleen, 35, of Newcastle, and Milford M.  Johnson Jr., 37, of Auburn. An Internal Revenue Service agent said the arrests  grew out of information gained in a drug investigation dubbed "Deep Snow,"  which led to the arrest of former South Lake Tahoe Mayor Terry Trupp and more  than 20 others.  </P></p>

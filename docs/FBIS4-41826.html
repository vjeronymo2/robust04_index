			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Georgian head of state Eduard Shevardnadze </F> by correspondent Nato Oniani on 27 June; place not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Oniani] Mr. Shevardnadze, we should probably start  today's interview, as we have done for some time recently, once  again by discussing events in Abkhazia and the peace process  that began there last week following the Russian Federation  Council's approval. The arrival of peacekeeping forces in west  Georgian rayons was shown on television yesterday.    Be that as it may, Zhirinovskiy has appeared in Abkhazia.  [sentence as heard] Gudauta is visited frequently by the  military and diplomats, who can rarely be seen in Tbilisi. Does  it all mean that the settlement of the Abkhaz problem is a  result of relations between Russian and Abkhaz leaders? Has the  Georgian leadership found itself left out?    [Shevardnadze] Thank you and good morning.    The peace process in Abkhazia has started, as planned, with  a  preparatory stage, the clearing of mines, concentration of  peacekeeping forces, the setting up of checkpoints, road  repairs, and so on. It can be said that the start has been  normal so far. The population of Samegrelo and Zugdidi, as well  as the people who remained in Gali, have welcomed the  peacekeeping forces. However, it must be said that the main  difficulties will start when large numbers of refugees enter  Abkhazia, which is the task for the next few days.    In this connection, good organization is necessary on this  Georgian side of the Inguri river. What I mean is that groups  of refugees should be formed and the schedule for their return  to Abkhazia be determined. There is a lot of organizational  work to be done. A permanent government commission, information  center, construction and repair authorities will operate in  Zugdidi. Many of them are already there. The prime minister,  defense minister, their deputies, and almost all of the Council  of Ministers of Abkhazia will work there. Mr. Jaba Ioseliani  [chief Georgian negotiator with Abkhazia] is planning to go  there tomorrow or on Wednesday. He has contacts with the  military, which is very important. In a word, things are moving  forward.    As regards the arrival of various political leaders, this is  less worrying.    [Oniani, interrupting] For example, Russian Deputy Defense  Minister Georgiy Kondratyev's visit cannot be less worrying, can  it?    [Shevardnadze] Do you mean General Kondratyev?    [Oniani] Yes.    [Shevardnadze] Let us first speak about political leaders.  This is less worrying. It is probably inevitable that leaders  holding various ranks and views will arrive there. However,  friends of both ours and the Abkhaz will come as well, which is  more important. Their active involvement and assistance,  including Russian parliament deputies' involvement and  assistance, should certainly be taken positively. As Vladimir  Shumeyko [chairman of the Federation Council] and others have  told me, there are such plans.    As for Gen. Kondratyev, I must say that we are having  businesslike contacts with him. Ioseliani and Sandro Kavsadze  [Georgian negotiator with Abkhazia] have met him more than once.  There is no need for him to visit Tbilisi now. If it becomes  necessary, such a visit will be possible.    Talking about visits, I would like to recall the visit to  Tbilisi earlier this month by Russian Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev and a series of extremely productive talks that were  held. As far as this and other issues are concerned, I think  that we will soon witness an increase in Russian diplomatic  activity.    In general, it must be said that both Russia and Georgia  have  without any doubt assumed historic responsibility. We should  hope, we should be certain that all sides will rise to the  occasion, to this historic occasion and honor their  responsibility, not only to our peoples but also to the world.    As regards Tskhinvali, as you know, the Tskhinvali process  began in Dagomys and has produced some positive results. Now it  is time to get actively involved in the settlement of this  conflict. The experience of Abkhazia and that of other peace  processes will naturally be taken into consideration. I believe  that the settlement of the Georgian-Ossetian conflict is not a  matter to be solved in the remote future but is something to be  dealt with soon. The start has not been bad. It has shown that  both the Georgians and Ossetians are thirsty for peace. We are  moving in this direction, and we are moving with resolve.    [Oniani] A section of the parliamentary opposition has  become, so to say, especially active recently and is getting  anxious over the issues of authority. Why do you think a  parliamentary crisis has exacerbated at this stage? Why has it  speeded up so intensely at this stage?    [Shevardnadze] The stepping up of activities by any  opposition can be explained if viewed against the background of  various trends. As for the aggression by a part of the  opposition, which is not a considerable part of the opposition  anyway -- I can explain it by the fact that tendencies for  stability in the country have been established and they [the  opposition] are worried about it.    [Oniani] Batono [polite form of address in Georgian]  Eduard, a meeting of foreign ministers of the member states of  the Economic Cooperation of the Black Sea Basin Countries will  start in Tbilisi in a few days. A year or two ago we could not  have imagined holding an international meeting in Tbilisi. The  reason why I am saying this is that there are signs that the  criminal situation in the country is being stabilized. Last  week, the Interior Ministry, together with the town's police  department, carried out an operation -- this time in Tbilisi --  and the activity of the Interior Ministry is noticeable against  the background of inactivity and endless promises by some  establishments.    [Shevardnadze] The meeting of foreign ministers of the Black  Sea Countries' Alliance -- this is what I call it, is  undoubtedly of paramount importance. I think that the  activities [of the Black Sea basin countries] all the way  through from the last meeting in Istanbul to Tbilisi will be  summed up. Time has been long enough. There is a lot to be  discussed and all the more to be done. I am sure that  representatives of key member-states will arrive and work  actively at the conference and participate in partnership. In  itself, holding such a conference in Tbilisi can be possible  only under the circumstances of stability, a certain stability.  The fact that we are holding this conference will speed up the  reinforcement of order and will step up the fight against  reinforcing order. In this connection, words of gratitude must  be spoken for the police, of course, in connection with the  operation that has recently been carried out in Tbilisi. As we  have touched upon the issue of the police, we are going to  discuss this issue on 8 July when we will sum up the work done  for the last six months and we will discuss all structures.  Interesting suggestions will probably be voiced to the effect  of reinforcing these good tendencies and setting new goals; but  large-scale operations must be carried out in rayons, towns, and  residential districts so that every family feels secure and safe  and feels that they are protected by the state. I think that we  are gradually getting there.    [Oniani] Because of the current economic crisis in Georgia,  our population looks with hope at every visit abroad and at  every meeting with representatives of financial circles. After  your visit to the United States, no one was surprised by the  recent visit to the United States by National Bank President  Nodar Javakhishvili and Deputy Prime Minister Teimuraz Basilia.  You had a meeting with them yesterday. Is there anything in  prospect that will alleviate our population's difficult  conditions?    [Shevardnadze] Our cooperation with the World Bank and the  IMF entered an active phase during my visit to Washington.  There had been visits and meetings before but they had mainly  been concerned with formalizing our membership of these  organizations. We had productive talks with leaders of these  two extremely important international economic and financial  organizations. Both the World Bank and the IMF were represented  at the talks by all their leaders. As a result of these talks,  several delegations have visited Georgia and prepared  recommendations for further progress in our relations and for  arriving at specific decisions [as heard].    In my opinion, the recent visit by Basilia and Javakhishvili  was undoubtedly productive. They are unanimous in Washington in  stressing the importance of a stable political and criminal  situation, which has recently taken shape in Georgia. If we  continue our efforts to ensure stability, then we can hope to  receive significant assistance roughly in the fall, or a little  earlier. This assistance will serve as a certain factor and  guarantee for financial stability in the country.    [Oniani] An important event happened last week. Russia  joined the Partnership for Peace initiative. Fortunately, no  one is surprised today by the fact that the country that  constituted the core of the Warsaw Pact and was an  irreconcilable ideological enemy of the United States, the  entire capitalist world, and especially NATO, has joined this  initiative. After events of recent years this no longer seems  absurd. What is your assessment of this decision by Russia,  especially taking into account the preparatory period that  preceded this decision.    [Shevardnadze] I had an opportunity during our previous  interviews to welcome statements in this regard by the Russian  President Mr. Yeltsin and Defense Minister Grachev's assessment  of his visit to Brussels. Now something that was meant to  happen has happened, and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has  signed a document making Russia part of this initiative. I  again welcome Russia's joining this initiative. I believe that  it was another step toward a new life and order in the  post-communist world.    [Oniani] Thank you very much. You have been listening to  Eduard Shevardnadze, the chairman of the Georgian Parliament and  head of state.</p>

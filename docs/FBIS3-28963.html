The figure compares  with 12 percent growth in January 1993 and, considering the good  start, this year's aim of 16 percent export growth is likely to  be attained with ease.    Samsung Electronics Co. led the pack with exports worth 630  million U.S. dollars, up 57.5 percent. Exports of home  electronic appliances rose 39.1 percent to 320 million dollars  and shipments of electronic parts such as D-RAM chips jumped  82.3 percent to 310 million dollars. This compares with  Samsung's export target of 560 million dollars, as Japan's  economic woes helped its rivals compete, a Samsung official said.    Goldstar Co. exported goods worth 250 million dollars, up 40  percent, with exports to China surging 133 percent. Six million  washing machines were exported, up 100 percent, and 47 million  color television sets were sent overseas, up 62 percent.    "The export strategy of selling mainly high-value-added  products and securing new markets in the Middle East and Africa  made a great contribution to the export increase," a Goldstar  official said.    Daewoo Electronics Co. registered exports totaling 125  million dollars, up 42 percent, chalking up gains of 83 percent  and 58 percent in the Middle East and China, respectively.</p>

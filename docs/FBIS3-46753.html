He added that the government has always supported moves  involving members of the public in an effort to improve the  quality of education. The minister made the remarks to  reporters in Jakarta yesterday in response to the ABRI's plan to  hold discussions with students from several universities.    Earlier, Major General Muzani Syukur, commander of the  Siliwangi Regional Military Command, said ABRI would hold  persuasive discussions with university students in his  jurisdiction. The discussions are aimed at preventing protest  rallies from taking place this year. The move to hold  discussions with the students is part of a package stressing the  importance of upholding the law and making the students have a  better understanding of national unity.</p>

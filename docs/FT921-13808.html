			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Stolpe admits Stasi links MR Manfred Stolpe, the Social Democrat prime minister of the German state of Brandenburg, has admitted to more than 30 years of regular and extensive contacts with the Stasi, the former East German state security service - but denied ever being an informer. His explanation was published this weekend in the weekly magazine Der Spiegel, at a time when the opening of all the Stasi files from 40 years of Communist rule is leading to almost daily revelations of co-operation by prominent east German citizens. His action brought both instant but isolated condemnation, including one call for his resignation, and widespread support from all parts of the political spectrum in the former East Germany. Mr Stolpe, the most senior lay official in the Evangelical Church in his own province since 1982, co-founder of the reformed Social Democrats in the east, and probably the outstanding political figure to emerge in eastern public life since unification, defended his admission as an attempt to explain how life worked in the Communist state, not to protect himself against possible criticism. He already admitted more than a year ago to regular contacts with the Stasi, dealing above all with aspects of church-state relations. The latest publication, an extended excerpt from a book to be published in March, spells out much more detail. In his article he suggests that the collapse of the Soviet empire, and the rapid reintegration of East Germany into the west, have left only the most 'consistent anti-Communists, those who opted to wait and see, and those who went into hibernation' as the only victors of the process. Yet the aim of his own contacts with the authorities, and of other honourable people like him, was 'to outwit the Communist state through its own instruments of power'. Mr Stolpe's confession brought defences from fellow churchmen such as Pastor Rainer Eppelmann, now a leading member of the rival Christian Democrats, and senior figures in the SPD. Mr Eppelmann said Mr Stolpe's confession rang true: 'There is no logical motive for (him to have been) an informer.' However the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) in Bavaria, the sister party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats, called for his resignation. Mr Stolpe's article coincided with a call from President Richard von Weizsacker, the respected German head of state, for caution to be exercised in the use of the Stasi files. 'We must learn to use them carefully and cautiously,' he told the Berliner Morgenpost newspaper. 'We are talking about the fate of human beings.'</p>

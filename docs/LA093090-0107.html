			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITIONS M AND D  </P> <P> Unfortunately, San Diego may never get a chance to adopt the concurrency  measures referred to by John Koenig ("A Lesson Worth Heeding In San Diego,"  Sept. 9) if a phony growth-management proposition facing the voters this  November passes.  </P> <P> Proposition M and its county equivalent, Proposition D, are thinly disguised  attempts by the building industry to prevent the City Council and Board of  Supervisors from establishing concurrency.  </P> <P> Among the key services these measures exempt from being provided concurrent  with need are schools, police, jails, courts, libraries, recreation centers,  parks, water and solid-waste disposal. This is particularly threatening because  both propositions require a two-thirds council or supervisorial majority to  mend their inadequacies.  </P> <P> These propositions make a mockery of local government's efforts to insure a  sensible growth plan for San Diego. The final indignity is that many of the  developers who are M and D's key sponsors are not even based in San Diego.  </P> <P> S.D. KISTLER  </P> <P> Mira Mesa  </P></p>

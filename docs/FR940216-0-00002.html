Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In a notice published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of August 11, 1992 (57 FR 35833), FDA announced that a color additive petition (CAP 6C0203) had been filed by CTFA, 1101 17th St. NW., suite 300, Washington, DC 20036, proposing that the color additive regulations for FD&amp;C Red No. 40 be amended to provide for the safe use of FD&amp;C Red No. 40 and its lakes for coloring drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye. The petition was filed under section 721 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 379e). CTFA later amended the petition to limit the lakes requested for eye area use to the FD&amp;C Aluminum Lake prepared in accordance with &sect;82.51 (21 CFR 82.51). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 70.3(s) (21 CFR 70.3(s)) defines the term ``area of the eye'' as ``the area enclosed within the circumference of the supra-orbital ridge and the infra-orbital ridge, including the eyebrow, the skin below the eyebrow, the eyelids and the eyelashes, and conjunctival sac of the eye, the eyeball, and the soft areolar tissue that lies within the perimeter of the infra-orbital ridge.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``lake'' is defined in &sect;70.3(l) as ``a straight color extended on a substratum by adsorption, coprecipitation, or chemical combination that does not include any combination of ingredients made by simple mixing process.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 70.5(a) (21 CFR 70.5(a)) states that ``No listing or certification of a color additive shall be considered to authorize the use of any such color additive in any article intended for use in the area of the eye unless such listing or certification of such color additive specifically provides for such use.'' The petitioner has requested that FD&amp;C Red No. 40 and FD&amp;C Red No. 40 Aluminum Lake be listed for use in the area of the eye. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 82 (21 CFR part 82) lists the certifiable provisionally listed colors and specifications, and includes a description of and specifications for the lakes that are permitted for use in foods (&sect;82.51) and in drugs and cosmetics (&sect;82.1051). Sections 82.51 and 82.1051 list the acceptable lakes that can be combined with the straight colors listed therein. The petitioner has requested that this order be limited to the Aluminum Lake of FD&amp;C Red No. 40, prepared in accordance with &sect;82.51. Section 82.51 also limits to alumina the substrata that can be used for FD&amp;C lakes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Safety <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its evaluation of the safety of the proposed use of the subject color additive, FDA has considered the safety data submitted to support current listings for the use of FD&amp;C Red No. 40 in foods, drugs, and cosmetics. FDA has also evaluated ocular toxicity studies submitted to support eye area use of the color additive and its aluminum lake. The agency has determined that the petitioned use is safe because no adverse effects were found in these studies at levels relevant to the petitioned use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Conclusions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on data contained in the petition and other relevant information, FDA concludes that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the use of FD&amp;C Red No. 40 and FD&amp;C Red No. 40 Aluminum Lake as color additives in the area of the eye, and that the additives are safe for their intended use. The agency also concludes on the basis of available data that the color additive will perform its intended effect and thus is suitable for the petitioned uses. The agency, therefore, is amending the color additive regulations in &sect;&sect;74.1340(b) and 74.2340(b) (21 CFR 74.1340(b) and 74.2340(b)) to provide for the use of FD&amp;C Red No. 40 and FD&amp;C Red No. 40 Aluminum Lake in drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This document provides for the permanent listing of the aluminum lake of FD&amp;C Red No. 40 for use in the area of the eye. Other uses of the lakes of FD&amp;C Red No. 40 are already permanently listed under &sect;&sect;74.1340 and 74.2340. The agency notes that &sect;&sect;74.1340(a)(3) and 74.2340(a)(2) refer to &sect;&sect;82.51 and 82.1051 for the manufacturing process and specifications for the lakes of FD&amp;C Red No. 40. While the agency recognizes that this referral is to a section that is designated as provisional, FDA considers this referral to be appropriate because that section defines current good manufacturing practice and provides appropriate specifications to ensure the quality and purity of lakes made with the color additive. The agency has under consideration an action to permanently list all lakes that have been provisionally listed under parts 81 and 82. When that action is completed, FDA intends to amend this referral as appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Inspection of Documents <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with &sect;71.15 (21 CFR 71.15), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decision to list the petitioned uses are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (address above) by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in &sect;71.15, the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making the documents available for inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Environmental Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Objections <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before March 18, 1994, file with the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered, and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FDA will publish notice of the objections that the agency has received or lack thereof in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 74 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Color additives, Cosmetics, Drugs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, 21 CFR part 74 is amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 74_LISTING OF COLOR ADDITIVES SUBJECT TO CERTIFICATION <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Trade visit targets the Far East MR RICHARD Needham, the trade minister, is to lead a delegation of 25 business executives on a five-day export promotion mission to the Far East at the end of the month, Ivor Owen writes. This was announced by Mr Edward Leigh, junior trade and industry minister, in the Commons yesterday when pledging full government backing for the efforts of British companies to maximise their share of the world's fastest-growing market. He said South Korea was among the 17 countries to which ministers would lead trade missions in the next 12 months. Mr Leigh said British exports to China had doubled in the first two months of this year, and Mr Needham, who had been there three times in the last year, was planning an early return visit. Mr Leigh said Britain's share of world trade had stabilised in volume terms after three decades of decline.</p>

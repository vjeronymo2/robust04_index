			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Markets: Dow surges to a record - but why? - Wall Street THIS WAS a difficult week for stock market analysts and reporters. It included a lot of external 'noise'; an important OPEC decision; a change in bank reserve requirements by the Federal Reserve; the New Hampshire presidential primaries; and the latest update on the economy from the chairman of the Fed. Normally, this would be a good thing. The more happening, the easier it is for analysts and reporters to explain away events in the stock market. This week, however, investors behaved in a most contrarian fashion. On Tuesday, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced a smaller than expected cut in production, which led to an immediate decline in oil prices, and the Fed eased credit conditions by reducing the amount banks have to hold in reserve. Yet, share prices fell sharply, to their lowest since January. On Wednesday, news of President Bush's dreadful performance in New Hampshire did not, as had been expected, provoke a big sell-off in the market. Conversely, buying interest on Wall Street was not sparked to any extent by either an upbeat economic forecast from Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, and more good inflation figures. Then, on Thursday, the one day when nothing remotely interesting happened, the Dow Jones average jumped 50 points to a record, powered by a surge in demand for a whole range of stocks from investors showing sudden enthusiasm. So difficult was it to pinpoint a reason for this surge that analysts and reporters reverted to emergency measures. 'Why did the market rise so sharply?' people asked. 'Simple, really,' came the experts' chorus. 'More buyers than sellers.' It is never that simple, of course, but it was as close as anyone could get to an honest answer. The market's recent performance suggests investors remain positive, if not exactly ecstatic, about the outlook for the economy and for equities. The initial rush into stocks from lower-yielding money market funds, bank certificates of deposit and Treasury securities has slowed. The chance of further interest rate cuts also has diminished, mainly because recent economic figures - in the form of improved car, home and retail sales, and strong money supply growth - suggest the country could be entering the first stage of an economic rebound. Another reason for rate cuts receding is because the Fed appears convinced that monetary policy is now sufficiently accommodating to allow room for a recovery. Although Tuesday's reduction in bank reserve requirements has been interpreted by some observers as a final tweak on the monetary strings, the action probably had more to do with the Fed's concern about the state of banks' balance sheets. What is more, there is no guarantee that the banks will pass-on the lower cost of credit to customers. Nor is there any guarantee that customers will want to borrow any more from banks. The interest-rate play, therefore, looks as though it has been taken out of the equities game. This means that the outlook for corporate earnings must brighten if investors' faith in the market is to be rewarded. The evidence so far is mostly positive. Although the earnings of major companies in the final quarter of 1991 were down 34 per cent on a year earlier, they were marginally better than expected. As for future earnings, Zacks Investment Research, which compiles analysts' estimates, says they are forecasting that first-quarter 1992 earnings will be 6.5 per cent higher than a year ago. Over the longer term, if you subscribe to the theory that the recovery is now under way, earnings should improve in every quarter as the year progresses. This happy scenario could, however, be disrupted if one dangerously unpredictable external force comes into play: politics. The market got its first real taste of election-year politics in New Hampshire, and did not like what it saw. The fact that a far-right television commentator and former Reagan speech-writer ran the president so close (Pat Buchanan won more than 40 per cent of the Republican vote on Tuesday) shocked the markets. George Bush, seemingly impregnable a few months ago, now looks beatable. This frightens financial markets for two reasons. Buchanan's appeal to the conservative wing of the Republican party could force Bush into an aggressive tax-cutting package that, if passed by Congress, would bust the Budget agreement and push interest rates higher. Second, if the Democrats choose an electable candidate, and support for Bush continues to deteriorate, then the markets' biggest nightmare - a high-spending Democrat Congress and White House - could become reality.  --------------------------------- Monday          Closed Tuesday     3224.73  -  21.24 Wednesday   3230.32  +   5.59 Thursday    3280.64  +  50.32 Friday      3280.19  -   0.45  ---------------------------------</p>

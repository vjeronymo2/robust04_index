			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / This Week: Restoring the magic that is India - Colin Amery looks at an Anglo-Indian plan to renovate some of the country's best buildings / Architecture Sometimes government ministers have inspired ideas that can have cultural as well as political significance. On his recent trade mission to India, Richard Needham, the UK trade minister, launched a scheme to restore historic buildings there, his enthusiasm being fired by the number of high-quality Indian buildings. No one can doubt the historical significance of the country's Indo-British architectural heritage. The variety of architecture is astounding, and what is always apparent is the way that buildings of the British period drew so heavily upon Indian roots. Although there was an imperial element in the big government buildings, all of them were built by skilled Indian craftsmen and contractors. Indians have always been great builders, their work ranging from Hindu temples to the vast cities of the Moghul empire. The country's climate is curiously kind to buildings - and the scarcity of resources means important remains of many empires have not been built over. The 50th anniversary of the independence and partition of India is in 1997. It would be an appropriate year to celebrate the completion of some of the big projects of architectural restoration and refurbishment to be carried out by British and Indian companies, under the wing of the Indo-British Partnership. This collaboration should work both ways. There is enormous interest in Britain in the heritage of India, and several national museums and collections in Britain have great collections of Indian fine and decorative arts. There should be British firms working on the great buildings of India and Indian businesses in the UK helping to secure a rational future for the great Indian cultural collections in Britain. The Confederation of Indian Industry has already shown great interest in the idea of a cleaning, restoration and general face-lifting operation, and the co-operation of British firms could be both profitable and culturally significant. For example, Calcutta has a great architectural heritage, and there is a lot that can be done to enhance the buildings and give them a new lease of life. The best buildings of Calcutta are not necessarily the government ones. Look at the extraordinary richness of an apartment block like Esplanade Mansions  -a cross between Harrods and the cliff-like facades of a Hindu temple. Take, for example, commercial premises such as the Writers' Building, the Royal Insurance Building or Satchidananda Chambers - all of these are highly original structures. In turn, Bombay has some of the best 19th century buildings of any city in the world. The University buildings, in the Italian Gothic style, look much better in India than their Victorian equivalents in Britain, and the climate in Bombay is much more suited to cloisters and open arcades than the climate of Oxford or London. Commercial buildings and libraries, churches and hotels all continue to be cared for in Bombay, despite their imperial origins. What an opportunity to restore them and make the most of their unique architectural quality. Bangalore and New Delhi are equally obvious candidates for this initiative. Bangalore has still got a very fine set of military buildings, as well as public ones of great distinction. New Delhi may initially appear as an inappropriately grand city, but the plan by Sir Edwin Lutyens and the quality of his architecture put the city into the class of a world monument. Lutyens was highly gifted in his ability to absorb the finest aspects of Moghul, Hindu and Buddhist architecture into his designs when the new capital of the sub-continent moved from Calcutta to Delhi. He absorbed the architectural culture while his partner (and later rival) Sir Herbert Baker only applied it to western models. New Delhi needs the help and skills of firms in the Indo-British Partnership to secure its architectural future. The British period in India is seen as just another period of history - but it was undoubtedly a very important one architecturally.</p>

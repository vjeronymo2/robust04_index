			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Kuchma plans big reforms for Ukraine Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma yesterday outlined a radical economic reform programme in an inaugural policy address before parliament. Mr Kuchma, elected in July, confronted the communist-dominated chamber with plans to privatise land, overhaul agriculture and cut state subsidies as part of Ukraine's first real attempt at reform. The president also claimed wide powers to implement the steps even in the face of opposition from parliament. Mr Kuchma's speech, which had been postponed several times, is the first clear public indication that the Ukrainian president intends to support comprehensive market reforms. His address is a direct challenge to the conservative legislature and to western governments, which Kiev will now expect to deliver on promises of substantial aid. The broad strokes of Mr Kuchma's reform programme come from the preliminary deal agreed with the International Monetary Fund last week on a Dollars 360m loan, the country's first since independence. But Mr Kuchma, defying expectations of some western observers who doubted whether the former missile factory director would ever be fully converted to the cause of market reforms, went beyond that text. After outlining Ukraine's economic predicament, the president said the only way to ensure 'true independence' and prevent 'colonial status' was to stabilise the currency and inflation, overhaul the taxation system to lure businesses back from the growing shadow economy, and reform financial services. Although Mr Kuchma campaigned on a pro-Russian platform, he couched his economic programme in national terms. Mr Kuchma, still viewed suspiciously by some nationalist politicians who fear he seeks a reunion with Russia, warned parliamentarians that economic reforms are crucial if Ukraine is to survive as an independent state. 'Our banks are not strong enough to fight and compete with Russian banks,' he said in his now fluent Ukrainian. 'We must do a lot to ensure economic sovereignty.' Against strong parliamentary opposition, Mr Kuchma also endorsed land and property privatisation only days after Mr Alexander Moroz, the conservative parliamentary chairman, vowed to oppose these measures. The other bold step, awaited by World Bank negotiators keen on structural reform, was the call to overhaul agriculture, potentially Ukraine's most profitable industry but now heavily subsidised. 'The key to the realisation of real reform in Ukraine is agriculture,' Mr Kuchma said. Mr Kuchma also endorsed large-scale privatisation, currently stalled, and the decentralisation of the economic control currently exercised by central ministries. Both steps face strong opposition in parliament and among some ministries. Mr Kuchma warned that he would not permit parliament to hamper his economic plans. 'Political changes are needed, too,' he told MPs. 'Parliament cannot interfere in the affairs of the president (and) . . . does not have the power to act independently on economic reform.' With the constitution unclear on division of powers, Mr Kuchma claimed the power to appoint regional government heads, unilaterally establish the division of power between the president and the legislature and eventually replace the Brezhnev-era constitution. He also appealed to international financial institutions for further aid, such as the Dollars 4bn promised at Naples' G7 summit, to promote reform. He said 'we cannot solve energy problems on our own' and saw a need for external financing to cover the chronic balance of payments gap, now at Dollars 3bn. His speech was seen as a direct attack against the communist-dominated parliament which poses the greatest potential threat to reforms.</p>

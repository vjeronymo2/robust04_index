[passage omitted]    Concerning reports on a joint Moroccan-Bahraini initiative  to  achieve reconciliation between Jordan and Saudi Arabia, the  prime minister said that such an initiative constitutes a good  opportunity which Jordan welcomes, especially since it is in  harmony with the policy of reconciliation, particularly with the  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with which we have joint neighborly  relations and interests, and which plays an effective role in  the Gulf region. He added that the relations with Kuwait might  need a longer time.    About Jordan's relations with Iraq, the prime minister said:  The fraternal Iraqi people have suffered a great deal and are  still suffering. We should all, in the Arab homeland, seek to  alleviate their suffering.    He stressed that our relations with all the Arab states are  based on mutual respect and on noninterference in the others'  affairs. [passage omitted]</p>

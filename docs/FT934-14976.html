			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Family creditor could upset Brazilian debt negotiations: Stephen Fidler looks at the role of a private non-bank investor AN IMPASSE between the Brazilian government and its fourth largest private foreign creditor - the Dart family of the US - emerged this week after Brazil rejected the family's offer to participate in the country's commercial bank debt restructuring. The family holds around Dollars 1.4bn in face value of bank loans to Brazil, or about 4 per cent of the commercial bank debt covered by the restructuring. It describes the debt - bought at a discount in the secondary market over the last two years - as a long-term investment. The family owns Dart Container and made its fortune from the development of the polystyrene cup. The deadlock could, if not resolved, delay completion of the accord. It also raises questions about the growing proportion of developing country bank loans now in the hands of private non-bank investors. Restructuring agreements have for more than a decade been negotiated by leading creditor banks appointed by debtor governments sitting on a so-called advisory committee. Non-bank investors have never been asked to sit on a committee, although they now often hold more than half of the outstanding bank debt. In a statement this week, the Dart family complained that it 'was never consulted during the negotiations that resulted in the Brazil financing plan' despite its position as the fourth-largest holder of Brazilian debt. However, from the banks and the debtor governments' point of view, the emergence of private investors may further complicate the already agonising process of debt restructuring. For one thing, such private investors are not susceptible to the persuasion from bank supervisors which has been evident in past restructuring agreements. Brazil is the last of the big four Latin American debtors - after Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina - to be negotiating a debt reduction accord, but the deal could have an impact on future debt accords. Debt settlements for Peru and Ecuador, for example, have yet to be reached. The dispute has arisen over the restructuring of Dollars 35bn in debt. Terms were negotiated between the government and an advisory committee of 19 banks, but the completion of the accord is still awaiting, among other things, the final agreement of the hundreds of creditors that hold the debt. Creditors were offered the choice between six types of financial instrument aimed at reducing the country's debt burden. Brazil negotiated the right to request changes in the eventual allocations because some instruments implied a higher cost to the country than others. The Dart family said this week that when the restructuring plan was first announced in September 1992, they were encouraged by the Brazilian government to exchange their loans for bonds which did not carry collateral. US Treasury zero coupon bonds are to be pledged against some of the options to guarantee principal or some interest payments, and the government was worried about the cost of this collateral. The family opted for so-called 'C' Bonds, 20-year instruments which carry interest rates of 4 to 5 per cent for the first six years and 8 per cent for the rest of their lives. The difference between 8 per cent and the lower interest rates in the bonds' early years is rolled up into capital. The Darts calculate that by choosing this option, they would save Brazil more than Dollars 200m in up-front capital costs that would have been needed to buy the collateral. Nonetheless, they were asked to shift their choice by the government. According to their statement, the Darts refused, professing satisfaction with their original commitment. This week Brazil 'had seen fit to reject that commitment'. A spokeswoman emphasised that the shifting of options was voluntary. She said the family now regarded the 'chapter as closed' and would expect Brazil to service its existing credits. The response from the Brazilian side is as yet unclear.</p>

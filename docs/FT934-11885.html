			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Nafta talks over, says Salinas PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas has opposed renegotiating the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement with the new Canadian government, saying that 'from our part we have stated that the negotiation is concluded', writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. 'If you open one single line of the two thousand page text, you open everthing else up for renegotiation . . . It's a good agreement for Mexico. Its a good agreement for the US, and we do believe it's also a good agreement for Canada,' the Mexican president said in an interview with Sir David Frost. The new Canadian prime minister Jean Chretien said on Wednesday he may not implement Nafta without changes to protect Canada's energy reserves, and rules on dumping and unfair subsidies. It is not clear whether his demand would require a re-opening of the original treaty, or whether supplemental agreements to build on those that regulate labour and environment in the region would suffice.</p>

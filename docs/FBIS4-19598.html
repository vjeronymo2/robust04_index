			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Satellite interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F> Paul Amar from Villacoublay airbase -- live]    [Text] [Amar] You have just returned from Luxembourg and  you are speaking live from Villacoublay. Thank you for waiting  for this link-up to be arranged. You were bitter this morning.  You called on the international community to regain its self  control and to define a common position. President Mitterrand  asked Butrus Butrus-Ghali this evening to restart the  negotiations. How can we do this, Alain Juppe, according to you?    [Juppe] This is exactly what I did today at the Council of  Ministers of the Twelve. I would like to remind you that we  were able to define a common position as early as last week on  the basis of the French proposals.    First of all, I would like to say that the question of  Gorazde, the negotiations in Gorazde, were badly led. They were  badly led because we did not do what we had done in Sarajevo,  namely for all those concerned to hold a common position: the  United Nations, the European Union, the Americans, and the  Russians. We must draw lessons from this.    The first thing we, the Twelve, are hoping for, is that a  fait accompli is clearly rejected. It is out of the question  for us to resign ourselves to the situation created by the Serbs  in Gorazde. This is why we are calling on the Security Council  to demand an immediate cease-fire, the withdrawal of Serb troops  outside an exclusion zone, which remains to be created, and the  deployment of the UN Protection Force. You know that France has  agreed to take part in this deployment, together with the  British and others.    [Amar] Mr. Minister, you are being quite firm this evening.  Does this mean that NATO will intervene if the Bosnian Serbs do  not listen?    [Juppe] This means that each must now face one's  responsibilities. If this resolution is submitted to the  Security Council -- and this is our wish -- we will see if the  Americans and the Russians vote it through. From the moment  they vote it through, I believe that the message will be clear  to the Serbs.    The second proposal we have made...[pauses] what you said  earlier in the news bulletin on the evolution of the Russian  position -- I heard it here in Villacoublay while I was watching  -- is interesting. Everyone now realizes that the Serbs and all  the communities at war in Bosnia tend not to take anyone  seriously, and this may have been the useful part of the  negotiations that have been under way for a month and a half.  Therefore, it is necessary for the Americans, the Russians, and  the Europeans to define a common position, on the map and on the  development of events, once our basic demands have been met.  This is what we are calling for.    [Amar] In any case, this means that the Russians may not be  opposed to a firm decision on the part of the United Nations or  NATO, does it not?    [Juppe] This would be in total contradiction with what they  said yesterday, when Mr. Akashi presented his plan to the Serbs,  and with what I have just heard in your bulletin, namely the  words of Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Churkin.    [Amar] Would a possible UN intervention not be too late,  given the fact that the Serbs are in Gorazde? A UN spokesman  has just said that Gorazde has fallen. Is a UN intervention  possible technically?    [Juppe] I think that there should be no mistake about what  we  have called for. Gorazde is under Serb control; we should not  play with words on whether Gorazde has fallen or has not fallen.  Gorazde is under Serb control. Quite obviously, this deprives  us of the possibility to carry out air strikes on Gorazde. This  is why we have called for this resolution by the Security  Council through a joint initiative from the Americans, the  Russians, and the Europeans, so that the Serbs -- who are the  aggressors -- yield. Our aim is also to summon the three  belligerents to the negotiating table as soon as possible and to  impose a settlement plan on them.    The European Union tried to do this last year. It failed on  its own. For several weeks now, the Americans have started  bilateral diplomacy. We can now see its limitations. The same  goes for the Russians. Once we Europeans, Russians, and  Americans manage to define a common position, I am hoping that  pressure on all those war-thirsty people who, it must be said,  can be found on all sides -- the Serb side today -- could make  them aware of the fact that the international community is  determined. This is our last trump card.    We cannot yield to the temptation of military escalation  because we do not know what this may lead to. We cannot yield  to the temptation of desertion, which would be a fiasco for the  international community. Therefore, it is necessary to put the  diplomatic process back onto the rails, together with the two  diplomatic initiatives taken by the French and approved by the  Twelve today, and which remain to be approved by the Russians  and the Americans. This is what will be done over the next few  hours and over the next few days.    [Amar] You used the expression time limit. Do you know what  kind of time limit you intend to set?    [Juppe] The time limit must be very short, because the  situation on the ground can get out of hand any minute. It  seems to me that a meeting between us four -- the United States,  Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations -- can be  held within the next two days.    [Amar] One last question, Mr. Minister. You said earlier on  that the negotiations in Gorazde were badly led. You want to  learn from this. Does this mean that the United Nations is in  fact unable to stop this war?    [Juppe] You know, it is necessary to draw lessons from the  mistakes we have just made, but this does not mean that we  should expose such and such organization to condemnation. The  United Nations has its weaknesses, but it must be pointed out  that its means are not always appropriate. France has been  doing its duty for months on end. Once again, who is ready to  send troops to Gorazde? Great Britain and France. Let us give  the United Nations the necessary means. Let those who have been  lecturing so far agree to commit themselves on the ground at  last. It may then be possible to make more valuable criticisms  of the United Nations if it is not able to make the best of its  means. At the moment, it does not have such means, and it must  be given them.    [Amar] Thank you, Mr. Juppe, for speaking to us live from  Villacoublay. Good evening.    [Juppe] Good evening.</p>

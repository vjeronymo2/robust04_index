			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Court upholds Brussels veto on monopolies THE European Court of Justice yesterday reaffirmed support for the European Commission's powers to intervene directly to prevent monopolies from acting against the wider Community interest. In a case involving liberalisation of the telecommunications services market, the court rejected complaints by Belgium, France, Italy and Spain that the European Commission had abused its powers under Article 90 of the Treaty of Rome. This is the so-called 'nuclear option' which allows Brussels wide-ranging powers to override national opposition to the break-up of monopolies. The four countries brought the case in response to a Commission directive which freed the rapidly growing market in telephone services such as fax machines and data transfer. Telex services and mobile phones were not covered. They argued that Article 90 only gives the Commission the right to oversee existing rules under the Treaty of Rome, not to take a pro-active role to break monopolies. In effect, their aim was to ensure that the Commission could only intervene under the authority of the Council of Ministers, and to send a warning shot to Sir Leon Brittan, the UK Commissioner in charge of competition policy, should he press ahead too fast on liberalising the far bigger voice telecommunications market, an EC official said. Sir Leon welcomed the court's judgment. But EC officials said it was unlikely Sir Leon would press ahead with Article 90 in sensitive areas such as voice telecommunications or energy, given the level of anti-Brussels sentiment in national capitals. The court, however, rapped the Commission over the knuckles on technical grounds. It said the use of Article 90 could not be used to end long-term contracts or 'special rights' in telecommunications, the term covering use of the phone network by companies such as Reuters and Swift, the international bank transfer organisation. The court thus annulled the two clauses which referred to these in the June 1990 directive.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 4 Apr (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  today denied that his chat with Cuban chief of state Fidel  Castro was reconciliatory, and he indicated that he had called  Castro to recommend a nephew who had traveled to Havana because  of health problems.    The Argentine president indicated that when he called his  Cuban colleague, "Castro was about to make a toast with some  Menem wine" that he himself had sent Castro.    Menem also indicated that he had taken advantage of the  contact "to again thank him for the attention he gave a dear  friend, (Cesar) Chacho Jaroslavsky, and to recommend a nephew  who also had traveled to Cuba due to health reasons."    In remarks to Radio 990, Menem emphasized: "This was all we  chatted about," and he said: "Our disagreements within the  sphere of democracy and freedom will again be made known during  the Cartagena de Indias summit above and beyond these aspects."</p>

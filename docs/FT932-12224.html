			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Letter: Parties must plan for a general election in autumn of 1995 Sir, Joe Rogaly's perception of the political timetable ('Major reaches dry land', April 27) is very possible. Any government or opposition which is not working to an autumn 1995 timetable for a general election is not a serious contender for power. The average span between general elections is well under four years. Autumn 1995 is three and a half years from the last one. The special act of parliament which was rushed through after the last general election ensures that the new parliamentary boundaries will all be in place by December 1994. We cannot ignore the fact that the next EC intergovernmental conference is due in mid-1996. Given the close shave in 1992 the government will not want to wait until 1997. If this is a widespread assumption, then it would mean that on January 1 1996 everyone would know it was general election year. As such, the advantage to the incumbent of fixing the date is lost. It makes autumn 1995 as a planning date too seductive to ignore. There is a further impetus to this timetable. All the opposition parties will have to have policies locked in place by the policy-making conferences in autumn 1994 for an autumn 1995 election. As the Conservative party does not have policy-making conferences, this forces the opposing forces to declare their hands well in advance. Is it any wonder that Labour's Plant commission is recommending fixed-term parliaments? Jeff Rooker, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

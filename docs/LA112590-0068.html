			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> The Nov. 10 episode of "Twin Peaks" promised to reveal Laura's murderer.  </P> <P> The producers made us look like suckers. The police arrested Ben Horne, but we  don't really know if he committed the crime. Later we see Leland murder  Madeleine. We are supposed to believe he killed Laura too, but once again  there's not enough evidence that he really killed her. Ben or Leland? Just have  a cup of "damn good coffee," sit back and wait.  </P> <P> Tomy Jung, Cypress  </P></p>

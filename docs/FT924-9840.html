			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Rival to ask OFT to examine high street activities The confirmation that Midlands Electricity will pool its retailing operations with those of Eastern and Southern signifies a further step in the commercialisation of the once-nationalised sector, writes John Thornhill. But for rival electrical goods retailers it raises renewed questions about the nature of this newly liberalised competition. Dixons, the UK's biggest electrical retailing chain, yesterday said it intended to file a submission with the Office of Fair Trading alleging unfair retail competition from the regional electricity companies (Recs). Mr Mark Souhami, deputy chairman, said the Recs were subsidising their retail activities from profits generated by their electricity interests to the disadvantage of rival retailers and the detriment of electricity customers. 'It means consumers are possibly having to pay more for their electricity because these companies are choosing to subsidise unprofitable retailing activities. This goes to the heart of the regulatory environment,' he said. 'At the time of the privatisation we drew attention to what we thought would happen. But we have had to wait a bit before sticking our heads above the parapet again and shouting 'Yaboo]'' Mr Eamon Bradley, chief executive of the joint venture, yesterday rejected the charge although he accepted the retail businesses would lose money this year as a result of restructuring charges. 'Our retail businesses are stand-alone businesses and are not subsidised by the electricity companies. The merger will hold up to scrutiny from any source. We are delighted to see how worried the competition are,' he said. Originally, the Recs opened high street showrooms to offer customers facilities to pay their bills and provide information. Many of them also, as a sideline, sold electrical appliances to promote the wider use of electricity. Retail activities still represent less than 10 per cent of Recs turnover. But following their privatisation two years ago, many Recs developed a more serious interest in retailing seeing it as an attractive avenue for expansion in a related but unregulated market. Many Recs believed there were considerable advantages in merging their retailing, marketing and buying skills and began to acquire more stores as the loss-making Rumbelows chain announced it was making a phased withdrawal from the market. Several Recs have also expanded into more profitable out-of-town locations - even outside their own catchment areas. Mr Rodney Forrest, stores analyst at stockbrokers Credit Lyonnais Laing, says their commercialisation will be a slow process. Over the long term, he suggests, the Recs will form professional retailing businesses run on strict commercial lines. But this is only likely to lead to the closure of many of the unprofitable smaller outlets leading to a more rational market. 'I cannot believe that Dixons or Comet will suffer much over the next five years,' he said. Indeed, he suggested that they might benefit from the commercialisation process.</p>

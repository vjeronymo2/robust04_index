			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MURPHY HOMERS AS BRAVES STOP REDS, 3-1  </P> <P> For the past two seasons, Cincinnati Reds left-hander Tom Browning has started  more games than any other pitcher in the National League. He has also served up  more home run balls.  </P> <P> On Sunday at Cincinnati, Browning gave up a home run that ended the Reds'  nine-game winning streak to start the season. After Atlanta's Jeff Blauser and  Jim Presley singled to start the game, Dale Murphy hit a homer off Browning and  the Braves ended their seven-game losing streak, 3-1.  </P> <P> Tom Glavine and Mike Stanton combined on a seven-hitter against the Reds, who  entered the game with a team average of .337.  </P> <P> The Reds chased Glavine (1-2) in the eighth and had two runners on with two  out. Stanton walked the first batter he faced before challenging the hottest  hitter in baseball -- Barry Larkin.  </P> <P> But Stanton got Larkin to ground out for his second save. It was Larkin's first  hitless game.  </P> <P> "Holding them to one run, I thought Glavine and Stanton were excellent," Murphy  said. "Our pitchers did an excellent job of keeping their guys off of base."  </P> <P> Last season Browning had 37 starts and allowed 31 home runs.  </P> <P> Murphy was batting .206 when he hit the homer, his second of the season.  Murphy's first homer was also off Browning, who has yielded three in 23  innings.  </P> <P> It was the first time this season the Reds did not score first.  </P> <P> Glavine is 5-2 lifetime against the Reds. He was 14-8 for the Braves last  season.  </P> <P> "We knew we wouldn't win them all," Red third baseman Chris Sabo said. "Glavine  is tough. He always pitches well against us."  </P> <P> Manager Lou Piniella lost for the first time with Cincinnati. The Reds' winning  streak, which included four victories over Atlanta, was their longest since  1975, when they won the World Series.  </P> <P> San Francisco 3, San Diego 1 -- Steve Bedrosian has been pitching with a heavy  heart since it was learned that his youngest son, Cody, has leukemia, but he's  still getting hitters out.  </P> <P> Given inspiration in a note from his wife, Bedrosian picked up his second save  in two games at San Diego. He retired all six men he faced in the two games.  </P> <P> "My wife, Tammy, inspired me with a note she put in my bag before we left on  the trip," Bedrosian said. "Basically, she was reassuring us that we would beat  this thing."  </P> <P> Atlee Hammaker held the Padres to three hits until he walked the leadoff man in  the ninth.  </P> <P> Kevin Bass hit a two-run homer for the Giants.  </P> <P> New York 5, Montreal 0 -- Sid Fernandez had a 14-5 record last season and was  probably the Mets' best pitcher.  </P> <P> But there was real concern when the left-hander pitched poorly in his first two  starts this season.  </P> <P> All was forgotten after this performance at New York. Fernandez gave up only  two hits, both singles by Tim Raines, and romped to his first victory.  </P> <P> "In his other two starts," Manager Davey Johnson said, "he had no command of  his pitches. He was going to throw 115 pitches today, but he only needed 110."  </P> <P> Keith Miller gave Fernandez all the offense he needed with a two-run homer in  the third.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 3, Chicago 2 -- Left-hander Neal Heaton, who was struggling to stay  in the majors in July, is currently one of the hottest pitchers.  </P> <P> He started last season 1-7, but won his last five decisions.  </P> <P> He gave up five hits and two runs in six innings at Chicago to improve his  record to 3-0 and increase his two-season winning streak to eight games.  </P> <P> Bobby Bonilla doubled home two runs in a three-run rally in the fourth. Bonilla  leads the NL with 16 runs batted in.  </P> <P> The Pirates, who finished fifth last season, lead the East. The Cubs have lost  four in a row.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 5, St. Louis 3 -- Randy Ready hit a two-run home run and drove in  three runs as the Phillies swept the three-game series.  </P> <P> Ozzie Smith returned and had two hits and drove in a run, but couldn't stop the  Cardinals from losing their fourth consecutive game.  </P> <P> It was the first time since June 27-29, 1986, that the Phillies swept the  Cardinals at Busch Stadium. St. Louis has lost five consecutive home games. DAN  HAFNER  </P></p>

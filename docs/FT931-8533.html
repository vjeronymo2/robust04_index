			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Retail sales help offset US worries AFTER A few uncomfortable moments in early trading, when market support levels were tested, the UK stock market stood up well yesterday to the US reaction to President Clinton's revised tax plans. A largely unexpected increase of 1.6 per cent in domestic retail sales in January helped the investment mood, but the London market was mixed at the close with dealers keeping a wary eye on Wall Street, which was moving uncertainly at the opening of its new trading session. On the home front, stock market attention is now focused on today's UK unemployment figures. But at last night's close, London was also keenly awaiting President Clinton's State of the Union Address. At the end of the session, weakness in sterling was also restraining the UK equity market, although most strategists do not expect any further move in domestic interest rates until the Budget in March. However, the chances of a full-point rate cut then came under question as the pound gave further ground in the foreign exchange markets yesterday. Shares fell sharply at the opening in reaction to the 82-point loss in the Dow Industrial Average overnight. The FT-SE 100 Index dropped through 2,800 without waiting for the March index future to open, but the early reading of 2,794.2 on the index proved to be the day's low. The market quickly rallied, supported by a good level of interest by the institutions, which appeared to regard the Footsie 2,800 area as buying territory. Early losses were replaced by gains and the Footsie touched 2,820.8 before rises were trimmed ahead of the opening of the new Wall Street session. With nothing further to go for, the market closed off the top for a final reading on the FT-SE 100 of 2,814.0, a net 1.8 up on the day. The institutions were active, if very selective, and continued to buy stocks in the utilities sectors, which are traditionally seen as defensive in times of economic uncertainty. Stock Exchange data disclosed that retail, or customer, business in equities bounced to Pounds 1.23bn on Tuesday, a recovery from the brief reduction in retail activity at the beginning of the week. Seaq volume of 618.6m shares compared with 634.3m in the previous session, with non-Footsie business making up a healthy 61 per cent of yesterday's figure. Increased activity in the second line issues was confirmed by a gain of 7.9 to 3,017.4 yesterday in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index. The oil sector made a cautious response to the agreement hammered out by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, with initial enthusiasm checked following less favourable comments from Kuwait. Store shares responded firmly to the January retail figures, which showed the best performance for four years and were received eagerly as the latest pointer to the progress of the domestic economy. But the industrial conglomerates remained depressed beneath the new uncertainty over the US dollar, with pharmaceuticals still unsettled by fears of tighter federal control on US medical spending. The drugs sector was also overshadowed by prospects for today's trading statement from Glaxo, which has underperformed the stock market over the past four months.</p>

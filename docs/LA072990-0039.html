			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE FICTION;  </P> <P> WOLF AND IRON BY GORDON R. DICKSON (TOM DOHERTY ASSOCIATES/TOR: $18.95; 468  PP.)  </P> <P> Most science-fiction novels seem to begin with the end of the world. It is,  perhaps, no wonder. The dilemmas we must face, as citizens of the planet in  1990, are simply too complex to write good stories about. The easiest way to  cope (in fiction) is to wipe the slate clean.  </P> <P> For the writer who wishes to entertain us with the future, almost anything will  do -- a plague of mutant AIDS viruses, or war, or famine, or the sudden death  of the oceans, or perhaps a simple collapse. Then, once the decks have been  cleared, the story can begin.  </P> <P> Gordon R. Dickson -- a veteran writer from the 1950s, when the future was more  easily grasped -- takes the simplest option in "Wolf and Iron." To begin his  novel, he chooses collapse.  </P> <P> In America, the late 20th Century has, quite suddenly, ceased to be  sustainable. The cities have collapsed. Government has imploded. Gangs loot the  countryside. Jeebee Walter escapes the shambles of his university town to trek  westward through dangerous country in the direction of his older brother's  ranch in Montana.  </P> <P> En route, he liberates a wolf from captivity; slowly and delicately, the two  establish a working rapport. He comes across a traveling caravan, and learns  from its sagacious master some further lessons in coping with the new world;  and he falls in love with the old man's resilient daughter. They part. He  reaches Montana.  </P> <P> Injuries force him to set up camp short of his brother's territory. After the  ambush of her caravan, the girl (in the only pulpy moment of the book) manages  to reach him. They have a child. The wolf continues, more and more intimately,  to behave like a wolf. Jeebee and the girl decide to stay where they are. The  book ends.  </P> <P> It all sounds very much too simple, a Robinsonade that makes Crusoe's  experiences seem positively worldly, but "Wolf and Iron," a tale sustained on a  raft of emotion, shines in its clarity like a jewel. Perhaps it is because  Dickson wears his heart so openly on his sleeve.  </P> <P> It is obvious he loves the cleansed and emptied America of Jeebee's trek; he  loves Jeebee himself, his sinewy alertness of mind, his singular attentiveness  to the new world and how to make things work in it; and he loves the entirely  realistic wolf whose behavior he has so meticulously envisioned. "Wolf and  Iron" is what one might call a fascinated book.  </P> <P> After the labored pulpit-pounding of Dickson's Childe Cycle, it returns us to  the real thing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE QUIET POOLS by Michael P. Kube-McDowell (Ace Books: $17.95; 371 pp.)  </P> <P> "The Quiet Pools," Michael P. Kube-McDowell's first novel, is of genuinely  strong interest, but its underlying premise is devastating to the self-esteem  of the human race.  </P> <P> It is the 21st Century. Against fervent opposition, a private corporation is  building spaceships to carry select populations to the stars. Christopher  McCutcheon, who works for The Diaspora Project but who does not himself wish to  embark, slowly analyzes his bruised self, his failed marriage group, his  enigmatic father, and through a slightly over-complicated plot discovers  something of the truth behind things. Some humans (he learns) have a genetic  quirk that compels them into space, and those who remain behind are bound to  the planet by what they lack.  </P> <P> There is a glad tale-telling energy about the book -- just as there was about  James Tiptree Jr.'s best stories -- that carries one on, as though to joy; but  just as in Tiptree's "A Momentary Taste of Being," the message of "The Quiet  Pools" is ultimately determinist and bleak. We are walking spermatozoa,  Kube-McDowell suggests; and, as we depart this world, it is likely we will  leave our nest in ruins.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE DIVIDE by Robert Charles Wilson (Foundation/Doubleday: $19.95, cloth;  $8.95, paper)  </P> <P> Take a break with "The Divide," a neat and simple dual-personality drama by  Robert Charles Wilson that looks as though it is going to address some heavy  issues, but ends in a fit of glamorizing plot.  </P> <P> A man whose intelligence has been artificially enhanced creates a secondary  personality to cope with mundane matters. When he finds his own abilities  beginning to decay, he must attempt to come to terms with the sharer he has  created.  </P> <P> It is a familiar SF tale, which is no reason not to retell it, and Wilson is  deft and nifty and quick off the mark. But his problem is just that: He stays  nifty. In the process, he sloughs off any anguish inherent in the drama he has  begun to develop, and for a climax tricks his tale up in tiresome twists like a  fatally unambitious magician looking for a fast curtain.  </P> <P> Those final moments are too contorted and too dumb to expose in their entirety  -- but guess who gets his brains sorted out by a blow to the head? Right.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WALKER OF WORLDS by Tom De Haven (Foundation/Doubleday: $19.95, cloth; $8.95,  paper)  </P> <P> In "Walker of Worlds," the first book of a projected sequence, "Chronicles of  the King's Tramp," Tom De Haven almost fox-trots us into his grip for good by  the time we're halfway through. By the end of the book, after we have managed  to walk with the large cast into a world deeper than ours, it is as though we  had gone through the pain barrier in a dance marathon.  </P> <P> Most magic-realist science-fantasy novels -- like John Crowley's "Little, Big"  and Mark Helprin's "A Winter's Tale," both of which are invoked in the blurb --  show a reverent quiet at the point where our world meets its maker, and  characters may pass into their true selves. It is exactly at this point in  "Walker of Worlds" that all hell breaks loose.  </P> <P> Jack the Walker, and the eccentric human cast he has garnered, travel inwards  to the world of King Sad Agel, and stumble into an immense affray with  thousands of bats and mages and Epicenes and cronies. It is like a fantasy  role-playing game: Every turn of the page is a turn of the plot.  </P> <P> Before the chaos subsides briefly -- as a breather before Volume Two -- we lose  that sense of bated breath so central to Crowley and Helprin, the sense that  our own world, which bears the stamp of the real world within, may allow us to  partake of some great secret. So far -- though brilliantly at points -- De  Haven offers nothing but gossip.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CASTLEVIEW by Gene Wolfe (Tom Doherty Associates/Tor: $18.95; 279 pp)  </P> <P> "Castleview," the latest novel from the great Gene Wolfe, introduces at least  50 named characters, and some of them are shape-changers. As in almost any  Wolfe novel, some single key will unlock the flickering mosaic of story, though  it will not tell the meaning of what is to be found inside.  </P> <P> In this book, the key seems to be that there are too many characters to fit  into the roles available for them. The main story takes 24 hours. Will E.  Shields and family arrive in Castleview to live and work, but the town, long  haunted by visions of a moving castle, now suffers a series of supernatural  visitors from the world of King Arthur. They are looking for new avatars. It is  like a recruiting drive, or a game of musical chairs.  </P> <P> That great stage-manager of impostors -- Puss in Boots -- makes an appearance.  Farce ascends to a grave music. An Arthur is selected. A sacrifice is made.  Like all of Wolfe's work, "Castleview" is a game and an act of reverence -- a  fine dream of superb gallantry.  </P></p>

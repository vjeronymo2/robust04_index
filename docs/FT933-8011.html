			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Merseyside postal workers to vote on part-time plans FURTHER disruption is threatening Britain's postal services in spite of yesterday's settlement of the two-week dispute by Royal Mail staff in Cardiff. A strike ballot of 1,100 postal workers on Merseyside is being prepared in protest at a threat by local management to reduce full-time delivery jobs as part of a plan to cut costs by 5 per cent. The Union of Communication Workers fears the loss of a quarter of the full-time jobs at Merseyside's 32 postal delivery offices if the Royal Mail introduces part-time staff to make second deliveries. The ballot is the latest sign of unrest among staff as the Royal Mail presses ahead with its quality of service scheme designed to increase efficiency in the face of rising competition. In Cardiff, in an individual ballot organised by the UCW, the staff voted by 556 to 154 to end their industrial action. More than 1m letters were held up by the strike and the Royal Mail warned it may take a week to return the postal services to normal. The Royal Mail said last night it was 'premature' to discuss the plan for Merseyside, although consultations were going on with the UCW. However, Mr John Ireland, a local UCW official warned: 'If talks fail we will go for a strike ballot.' An internal Royal Mail management document obtained by the union reveals details of the Liverpool 'delivery plan' which are to be discussed in staff briefings this month for implementation in September. 'At the moment the union are trying to block proposals,' it complains and calls for 'verbal/face-to-face communication' with the staff. The document warns jobs can be safeguarded only by raising productivity in deliveries. It points out: 'It is an established fact that our competitors such as Securicor, UNT, DHL and other private operators have found ways round our legal monopoly.' 'This competition has grown by 50 per cent in the last two years and this in a time of recession,' says the document. 'It is estimated that we presently have 95 per cent of the letter delivery market but if competition continues to grow at the present rate this share will fall to 60 per cent in the next five years.' It adds: 'For these reasons we have been targeted to make productivity savings.' The paper goes on: 'In addition Liverpool has low levels of productivity when compared with other areas. Therefore changes must and will happen and staff owe it to themselves to at least listen to what is being proposed.' The Royal Mail plan aims to align working hours and the number of workers more closely to the workload on Merseyside. At present, it says, 85 per cent of the postal traffic is available for first delivery and this workload is handled by 60 per cent of the delivery hours. The remaining 15 per cent of the workload is taken out on a second delivery that uses 40 per cent of the working hours available. 'Clearly the areas for productivity gains are on second delivery,' the document says. It calls for early starts to ensure the maximum amount of mail is delivered on time on first delivery.</p>

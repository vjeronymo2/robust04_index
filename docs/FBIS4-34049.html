			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Tortures Being Modernized Along With </F> Democracy"]    [Text] In Bolivia there are 21 types of torture and three  phases of altered behavior. The same roster of torture personnel  serves dictators and democrats. Extraction of confessions is  aimed at incriminating journalists and politicians.    According to the Political Constitution of the State, the  democratic system protects the physical and psychic integrity of  persons. According to reports in the hands of the Chamber of  Deputies Committee on Human Rights, neither democracy nor the  various other types of government can prevent the existence of a  quasi-autonomous organization dedicated to the corporal and  moral annihilation of those who fall into their hands charged  with terrorism or subversion of public order.    But according to Deputy Ramiro Barrenechea, a member of the  Human Rights Committee, the aforementioned organization shows a  propensity for "modernizing" through more sophisticated methods,  with participation in them ranging from physicians who determine  the extent to which the detainee is likely to withstand the  tortures, to psychologists who separate the false information  from the truth after hours of uninterrupted interrogation on a  single point.    There may be more, but, in the investigation being conducted  by the committee, Barrenechea states that it has detected the  existence of 21 types of torture and three phases of altered  behavior of the persons, aimed at extracting handwritten  self-incriminating statements, or statements that involve other  persons in specified acts.    "The tortures identified by the committee include beatings,  electric prods, the `submarine,' `bell,' and `pig' treatments,  special blows to the genitals, and raping of men and women," he  said. He added that violence of the sexual type is the most  frequently used.  <H5>  Until Turned Into Limp Flesh </H5>   Based on data provided by testimonies, Barrenechea explained  that the techniques designed to extract confessions involve  three evaluation phases. The first, aimed at  uncommunicativeness, consists of unlimited physical violence and  threats of violence against members of the victim's family, and  it is conducted by Bolivian torturers.    In the second phase, the system of tortures is refined and  is  conducted with greater discernment and sophistication, because  it is done by foreign experts. In the third phase, the intensity  of the tortures is diminished, but techniques are applied that  are designed to break routines and create situations of mental  derangement.    One of the torturers assumes a paternal role, pretends  identification with the victim's problem, and persuades the  victim to sign anything. During the persuasion interval, other  methods are also used, such as preventing sleep for 17 days, or  keeping the victim seated and tied to a chair for five  consecutive days, without permitting movement even for tending  to physiological needs, all the while pressing the victim with  repeated questions.    "Those acting the role of psychologists take part in this  phase, asking the same question or others some 50 to 500 times  to detect associations and verify whether what is being said by  the victim, converted now into a lump of limp flesh, is the  truth or a lie," said Barrenechea, adding: "Pressure is also  applied scientifically, and we are trying to determine who are  the doctors responsible for prescribing the dosages of torture  and pressures the victim is able to take."    Barrenechea stated that after such treatment, the victim's  sole desire is to die and get it all over with rather than  continue living in constant dread, and that this state is used  to get the victim to sign a confession and incriminate other  persons.    "We have found a constant in all of these interrogations:  The  victim is handed a list of names of persons that includes those  of many journalists and politicians," he said, adding that the  victims sign what they are told to sign, and even incriminate  themselves, in order to end the tortures, despite the fact that  Bolivian law does not accept such documents as valid.    "The committee is now also investigating why the judges are  not accepting the evidence being presented by detainees  attesting to their having been compelled to incriminate  themselves and others by torture," he said.  <H5>  A Power That Vies With That of Government and State </H5>   Barrenechea stated that the personnel conducting the  tortures  are "professionals," and that they have not been removed since  the era of dictatorships, and even previous to that, because  they "include persons from the first MNR [Nationalist  Revolutionary Movement] period of rule. These are persons who  have worked with the MNR's system of political control, the  dictatorships of Banzer and Garcia Meza, the Patriotic Agreement  government, and the present government. They are apparently  irremovable persons with international specialization," he said.    The existence of that apparatus specializing in repression,  said Barrenechea, is constant, regardless of political regimes,  and has become a quasi-autonomous structure beyond the control  of even the executive branch of the government.    "This is why the committee is working to reconcile the state  with civil society, and to prevent the committing of these  utterly savage acts in the name of the law," he said.  <H5>  Terrorist Unions </H5>   The entire description mentioned above is drawn from the  testimony heard by the Committee on Human Rights from 36 persons  who were detained for acts of terrorism. They are members of  subversive groups such as Tupac Katari Guerrilla Army [EGTK],  "Zarate Willka," the Nestor Paz Zamora Command [CNPZ], and the  Army of National Liberation [ELN], who appeared before the  committee last week in compliance with a summons issued by the  Chamber of Deputies.    "This is part of an investigation of 50 persons charged with  acts of terrorism, 10 of whom are in Chonchocoro, 11 in San  Pedro, five in Posta, five in the Women's Correction Center, and  four in prison in Cochabamba. Ten other persons are fugitives at  large, one is a `missing person,' and four were released after  being detained."    Upon completing its evaluation, which will address elements  of what is stated in the above paragraphs, the committee will  issue a report, summon torturers, and police and judicial  officials who permitted the violation of human and  constitutional rights, and inspect the houses of detention.</p>

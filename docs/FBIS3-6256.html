			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It was learned on 14 March that North Korea will  hold the Seventh Session of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly  [SPA] early April and will likely make important decisions on  the nuclear problem and on its relations with the United States.    Concerning this, Hwang Chang-yop, secretary for  international  affairs of the Workers' Party who is in charge of North Korean  diplomatic affairs, visited Vietnam from 7 to 10 March, and  examined the background of Vietnam improving relations with the  United States after the Vietnam war and the procedure to resume  economic cooperation.    Holding talks with high-ranking officials from the  Vietnamese  Communist Party, Secretary Hwang discussed the issue of the  remains of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam. On 11 March, he visited  Laos and discussed the issue of importing Lao-produced rice.    Past North Korean SPA sessions debated buget and  reorganization issues and the adoption of important resolutions  as key agenda.    On 14 March, one of the National Unification Board officials  said: We paid close attention to the visit of Secretary Hwang,  who actually supervises North Korean diplomacy toward Vietnam  before the SPA session. Thus, there is a great possibility that  the forthcoming SPA will make important decisions on the nuclear  issue and on its relations with the United States.    This official, however, noted that the possibility that  steps  will be taken for Kim Chong-il's succession to power is slim.</p>

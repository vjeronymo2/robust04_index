			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Charges take toll as decade of growth ends - J Sainsbury J Sainsbury's downbeat trading statement in January, when it announced a fall in underlying sales and gross margins, and a property write-down of Pounds 365m, was one of the lowest points in a bleak year for UK food retailers. The impact of those factors will be apparent on Wednesday, when Sainsbury is expected to announce a fall in reported pre-tax profits for the year to March from Pounds 735m to Pounds 320m-Pounds 355m. That is after both the Pounds 365m non-recurring write-down on property, reflecting the fall in value of many of Sainsbury's sites since it bought them, and a Pounds 40m recurring depreciation charge - the result of the group's decision to depreciate buildings by 2 per cent a year and a revised depreciation policy on fixtures and equipment. Even adding back the charges, profits are at best expected to be only slightly better than last year - ending a decade of spectacular profits growth by the UK's largest grocery retailer. The key questions Sainsbury is likely to address on Wednesday include whether trading has improved since January - and whether gross margins have stabilised - and the future of its 'Essential for Essentials' campaign launched last October. That marked a move away from periodic promotions towards 'everyday low prices' on 300 own-label lines, accounting for about 10 per cent of turnover. Hailed initially by analysts as a clever strategic move, it has since been blamed for the group's recent poor performance. There have been rumours that the board was split over the campaign, which might be quietly jettisoned. Analysts are also keen to hear more about Sainsbury's plans for its Savacentre hypermarkets, Homebase DIY superstores and US supermarket chain Shaws, as well as planned trials of a city-centre format.</p>

The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I.

The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organizations's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend the Exchange's fee reduction plan. The plan, which was initially adopted on July 1, 1992 and subsequently amended in July 1993, provides that if Exchange volume levels exceed a pre-determined threshold at the end of any fiscal quarter, specified fees will be reduced the following quarter in accordance with the schedule. The proposed amendments are the product of the Exchange's annual budget review and are structured to accommodate the capital needs of the Exchange for the coming year. The amendments will take effect for the new fiscal year commencing July 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule change amends the current fee reduction thresholds and amounts. The minimum threshold for a fee reduction is raised from 525,000 to 550,000 year to date contract volume. The reduction in the market-maker fees has been lowered $.05 to $.10 for five of the eight thresholds. The member dues fee reduction of 25% to 100% is given at higher thresholds. The proposed rule change also replaces the trade match fee reduction schedule with a fee reduction schedule for floor brokerage fees. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  In all other respects, the fee reduction program remains unchanged. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The floor broker fee is reduced $.05 for 600,000 to 625,000 year to date contract volume, and is reduced $.10 for 650,000 to 700,000 year to date contract volume. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general, and Section 6(b)(4) in particular, by providing for the equitable allocation among CBOE members of reasonable dues, fees, and charges. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

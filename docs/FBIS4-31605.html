			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 10 (TANJUG) -- President of the  national assembly of the Bosnian Serb republic Momcilo Krajisnik  said on Friday that "there is no rift between the Serb republic  and Serbia, no-one shall cast a doubt on the harmony and  determination of the Serb people and the justified objective --  life in one state, will be realized."    Commenting the many speculations in the public about a  cooling in relations between Belgrade and Pale, Krajisnik said  "we perhaps have different views on many things, but this cannot  be described as cooling in any way." The speculations on a  cooling of relations were triggered by a statement on Tuesday by  Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic who said that Yugoslav citizens  cannot be hostages of any leader from the territory of the  Former Republic of Yugoslavia [as received], the Serb republic,  or the republic of Serb Krajina in former Croatia.    Pointing out that the two-year war of Moslems, Serbs and  Croats in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina "has to end," Lilic  said at the time when ceasefire negotiations between the warring  sides were underway in Geneva that the Yugoslav people "rightly  expect the peace talks to succeed and cannot agree to the option  that they are infinitely prolonged and undermined."    In a statement to the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA,  Krajisnik said that Lilic's statement "is not sufficiently  defined and precise, and has therefore created confusion, but it  cannot pertain to the Serb people in the Serb republic or in the  republic of Serb Krajina."    The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a federation of Serbia  and Montenegro, is under comprehensive and binding sanctions  which were imposed in May 1992 by the United Nations Security  Council because of its alleged involvement in the  Bosnia-Herzegovina war. [word indistinct] sanctions present a  big problem and we are all engaged in the utmost towards their  lifting, and different views should not be taken to mean a  rift," Krajisnik said, adding that he his experience with  Belgrade was positive. "In the contacts so far, Lilic has shown  a special devotion to the Serb national issue and we hope he  will elucidate on the stand he recently voiced," Krajisnik  concluded.    Special U.N. envoy for former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi and  representatives of Bosnian Serbs and the Moslem-Croat Federation  in Bosnia-Herzegovina signed an agreement on a one-month  ceassation of mostilities in Geneva on Wednesday. Akashi had  proposed a four-month ceasefire, and the Serb Republic was for a  lasting agreement, but it adopted the Japanese diplomat's  proposal. The Moslem-Croat delegation, however, agreed  four-weeks as the longest possible period for a ceasefire.</p>

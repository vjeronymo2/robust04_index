			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (21): Challenging future - Heavy industry is due for radical restructuring THESE are trying times for Polish heavy industry, often saddled with pollutive, obsolescent plant and still managed by communist-era administrators. They are under pressure from powerful workers councils to maintain employment and from a government desperate to privatise and to keep public sector wage increases below the rate of inflation. The past two years have seen a nearly 40 per cent drop in production and most of this is concentrated in the mining, steel-making and heavy engineering sectors which are all candidates for radical restructuring and privatisation where possible. Some sectors, such as power engineering, are already in the throes of re-organisation under foreign owners like ABB, and other sectors such as shipbuilding also have good prospects for privatisation. The problem areas are the coal mines and steel plants which, once emblematic industries of the old regime. Coal production has dropped from a peak of 190m tonnes in the 1980s to around 140m tonnes and many mines are threatened. Longer term, the emphasis will shift towards boosting domestic gas production and more efficient, less polluting coal-burning technologies. The steel industry, at present working at around 60 per cent of its 18m-tonne capacity, is also being painfully re-structured. Last month the government decided to create a new holding company which will rationalise production at the Huta Katowice and Huta Lenina plants near Krakow with the loss of several thousand jobs. A new Dollars 120m continuous casting steel line from Mannesman in Germany, at present still packed up in crates, will be installed at Katowice to improve productivity and lower costs as steel-making is concentrated on the largely Soviet-designed plant. In spite of the problems, mining of copper, sulphur, silver and coal as well as ship-building and heavy industry are still principal hard currency earners. Huta Katowice, for example, exported 70 per cent of its 3.7m-tonne production last year, much of it at a loss, apart from its finished products such as rails, beams and profiles. Until now, no large or medium-sized state enterprise has gone bankrupt and many are keeping going by involuntary inter-enterprise credits, built up through a chain of non-payment which has to be broken if inflation is to be reduced and the banking system kept afloat. But Poland needs to modernise its railway and road infrastructure, its power generating plants, and much of its industrial base. All this requires a substantial heavy industrial capacity. Restructuring to produce the sinews of its own industrial regeneration, and finding the investment capital to do so, is the real challenge ahead for Poland and the international financial institutions.</p>

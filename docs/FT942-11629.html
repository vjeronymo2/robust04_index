			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Japanese atrocity 'a hoax' says minister Japan's new justice minister, Mr Shigeto Nagano, yesterday confronted the minority government with a potential crisis by claiming that an infamous wartime atrocity never happened. Mr Nagano said the 1937 Nanking massacre, in which the Japanese army killed tens of thousands of Chinese civilians, was a 'fabrication'. His comments, in an interview with the Mainichi newspaper, could provoke calls for his resignation. China last night expressed shock and indignation, suggesting that the outburst could hamper Tokyo's efforts to improve relations with its neighbours. A foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing, quoted by the official Chinese news agency Xinhua, said Japanese military aggression had caused great suffering for the Chinese and the Nanking massacre had been one of the most serious episodes. Mr Nagano, 71, a member of the occupying forces in China and a former army chief of staff, said it was 'wrong to say the war was a war of aggression', and that reports of the Nanking massacre and other Japanese atrocities were 'hoaxes'. According to the official account to the 1948 Tokyo war crimes tribunal, 155,000 died in Nanking at the hands of invading Japanese forces. The controversy Mr Nagano's claims will arouse will further weaken the vulnerable government. Mr Nagano's outburst contradicts the line taken by Mr Koji Kakizawa, foreign minister, that the new government shares the former Hosokawa administration's apologetic stance on Japan's war record. However, Mr Nagano does reflect a continuing mood of hawkish unrepentance among a minority of Japanese politicians, such as Mr Shintaro Ishihara, a member of the right wing of the opposition Liberal Democratic party and a fierce critic of Mr Hosokawa's attempts to confront wartime guilt. Mr Ishihara has claimed the Chinese account of Nanking was untrue. The Social Democratic party, the second largest opposition party, will use Mr Nagano's statement to demonstrate its contention that the five-party coalition government is artificially dominated by the right wing. Mr Nagano, a member of the LDP until last year, belongs to Mr Hata's Japan Renewal party, which dominates coalition policy. This will add extra weight to opposition fears that the Hata administration wants to revise Japan's pacifist constitution to allow full military contributions to UN peacekeeping operations. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the JRP's deputy leader, is a keen advocate of this, on the grounds that Japan should assume greater responsibility if it wants to earn the right to greater international influence. However, the Socialists and several other centre-left parties oppose changing the constitution, for fear of rekindling nationalism.</p>

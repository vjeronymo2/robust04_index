			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Getting up from the canvas: A recovery in the market for contemporary art Christie's sale of contemporary art in New York on Tuesday evening was a tense affair. The market had been in free fall for almost three years. The value of even major works by well respected artists had virtually halved. Yet Christie's was offering an important composition by Andy Warhol, '210 Coca-Cola Bottles', a painting depicting seven rows of bottles stencilled on to a silkscreen, with a hefty estimate of up to Dollars 2.8m. Warhol's prices have fluctuated markedly since his death in 1987. And although its early date, 1962, made the work important, the general feeling was that Christie's, and the vendor, Martin Blinder, whose recession-hit company sells art in shopping malls, had over-reached themselves. In the event, bidding was brisk, with four potential buyers. The work was finally sold to the Zurich dealer Thomas Ammann for Dollars 2m, well below estimates but still a weighty price for Warhol, whose long-term reputation is far from established. Christie's gamble had paid off and the market for contemporary art, the most fickle sector of the arts trade, had given clear signs of recovery. 'I am more than fairly pleased,' said Christie's expert Diane Upright after the New York sale. Along with her rival Lucy Mitchell-Innes at Sotheby's she had succeeded during the week in re-establishing a solidly based market in contemporary art. Prices may be considerably reduced on 1990 levels but at least there were buyers, mainly American and European private collectors, for the select lots which had been allowed to appear at the rostrum. By concentrating on paintings that had not been on offer for many years, that were in good condition and carrying low reserves, Christie's managed to sell 82 per cent by value of its 67 lots for a total of Dollars 11.26m. Sotheby's received Dollars 12.3m from 56 lots, and sold 76 per cent of its works. Both salerooms were lucky as well as bold. They each had an important seller keen to dispose of desirable paintings at low prices. Sotheby's were marketing a series of works owned by Charles Saatchi, co-founder of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group, and the dominant force in the contemporary art market for over a decade. He is currently jettisoning important works by artists he helped to popularise in the early 1980s so as to acquire the art of a later generation as well as the occasional modern masterpiece. Saatchi can afford to accept low prices since he bought the works for very modest sums. His imprimatur ensured that 'Bob's World', an early 'plate' composition (in which broken plates are stuck to the canvas to create a greater physical impact) by the controversial Julian Schnabel, sold for Dollars 319,000. Other Saatchi paintings to sell included one of Cy Twombly's many 'Untitled' canvases, bought by Saatchi's dealer Larry Gagosian for Dollars 1.65m, and Dollars 627,000 for a pastiche of the Old Master Vermeer by the British artist Malcolm Morley. This was an auction record for Morley and underlined the growing internationalism in the market for contemporary art. Traditionally, Americans bought the abstract expressionism of the post-war New York artists; Germans the work of their painters like Baselitz, Kiefer, and Richter; and the French stuck with the Paris School. Now artists can cross borders much more easily. Significantly, this week's sales brought the first purchases from Taiwan, although the Japanese dealers, who entered this market at its 1989 peak, were conspicuously absent. Christie's sale centred on the works of Frederik Roos, the Swedish financier who established his collection during the 1980's and who bought widely from artists of various nationalities. Roos died last year, aged 40 and loaded with debt, and Christie's has the challenge of disposing of his collection. It has the advantage of negotiating with a deceased estate, which helped it force low estimates and reserves on the art. But even so, Christie's was amazed at its success in marketing 188 of the best Roos acquisitions. Virtually all were sold, for a total of Dollars 7.8m. Work by English sculptors patronised by Roos, such as Tony Cragg and Barry Flanagan, sold for auction record prices - Dollars 99,000 for a Cragg composition of three giant bronze canisters, and Dollars 93,500 for a Flanagan bronze of one hare balancing another on its nose. Internationalism is not completely established - Sotheby's failed to sell Saatchi's important nude portrait by Lucian Freud, 'Night Interior', probably because the estimate of Dollars 500,000 was excessive for an artist not well known in the US - but it is the best hope for the market's future. For contemporary art still faces problems. There was very little buying this week by dealers, who are sitting on enormous bank overdrafts in unvisited galleries with vaults full of over-priced pictures. And the main reason that the auctions were successful was that Sotheby's and Christie's had fixed reserves even lower than those at last November's auctions. The market is in convalescence and is still far from buoyant. It was noticeable that neither owners nor auction houses were willing to risk the great icons of modern art - works by Jasper Johns or Jackson Pollock, de Kooning or Lichtenstein, were not on offer this week. Diane Upright reckons that the top price that anyone is currently prepared to pay for a painting by a modern master is Dollars 10m. Three years ago a de Kooning, 'Interchange', sold for Dollars 20.678m to a Japanese buyer and a Jasper Johns, 'False Start', changed hands for Dollars 17m. As the international economy moves out of recession, dealers and collectors expect that the contemporary art market should continue to recover from its sickbed. In any event, it will not lose its ability to shock. The artist in keenest demand, whose prices have continued to rise during the recession, is Robert Gober. His speciality is making creations of urinals, beds, and, in particular, kitchen sinks. One of his beds, composed of enamel, wood, cotton and wool, soared above its estimate on Tuesday to make a record Dollars 180,000 - but also to create new doubts about the aesthetic value of contemporary art.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Microsoft may include as a term in any such License Agreement that the OEM may, at its sole discretion, at any time between 90 and 120 days prior to the expiration of the original License Agreement, renew such License Agreement for up to one additional year on the same terms and conditions as those applicable in the original license period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The License Agreement shall not impose a penalty or charge of any kind on an OEM for its election not to renew all or any portion of a License Agreement. In the event that an OEM does not exercise the option to renew a License Agreement as provided above, and a new License Agreement is entered between Microsoft and the OEM, the arm's length negotiation of different terms and conditions, specifically including a higher royalty rate(s), will not by itself constitute a penalty or other charge within the meaning of the foregoing sentence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Duration of any License Agreement with an OEM not domiciled in the United States or the European Economic Area that will not be effective prior to regulatory approval in the country of its domicile may be extended at the option of Microsoft or the OEM during the time required for any such regulatory approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> License Agreement provisions that do not bear on the licensing or distribution of the Covered Products may survive expiration or termination of the License Agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Microsoft shall not enter into any License Agreement that by its terms prohibits or restricts the OEM's licensing, sale or distribution of any non-Microsoft Operating System Software product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Microsoft shall not enter into any Per Processor License. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Except to the extent permitted by Section IV (G) below, Microsoft shall not enter into any License Agreement other than a Per Copy License. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) Microsoft shall not enter into any License Agreement in which the terms of that agreement are expressly or impliedly conditioned upon: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) the licensing of any other Covered Product, Operating System Software product or other product (provided, however, that this provision in and of itself shall not be construed to prohibit Microsoft from developing integrated products); or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) the OEM not licensing, purchasing, using or distributing any non-Microsoft product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (F) Microsoft shall not enter into any License Agreement containing a Minimum Commitment. However, nothing contained herein shall prohibit Microsoft and any OEM from developing non-binding estimates of projected sales of Microsoft's Covered Products for use in calculating royalty payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (G) Microsoft's revenue from a License Agreement for any Covered Product shall not be derived from other than Per Copy or Per System Licenses, as defined herein. In any Per System License: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Microsoft shall not explicitly or implicitly require as a condition of entering into any License Agreement, or for purposes of applying any volume discount, or otherwise, that any OEM include under its Per System License more than one of its Personal Computer Systems; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Microsoft shall not charge or collect royalties for any Covered Product on any Personal Computer System unless the Personal Computer System is designated by the OEM in the License Agreement or in a written amendment. Microsoft shall not require an OEM which creates a New System to notify Microsoft of the existence of such a New System, or to take any particular actions regarding marketing or advertising of that New System, other than creation of a unique model name or model number that the OEM shall use for internal and external identification purposes. The requirement of external identification may be satisfied by placement of the unique model name or model number on the machine and its container (if any), without more. The OEM and Microsoft may agree to amend the License Agreement to include any new model of Personal Computer System in a Per System License. Nothing in this clause shall be deemed to preclude Microsoft from seeking compensation from an OEM that makes or distributes copies of a Covered Product in breach of its License Agreement or in violation of copyright law; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The License Agreement shall not impose a penalty or charge on account of an OEM's choosing at any time to create a New System. Addition of a New System to the OEM's License Agreement so that Covered Products are licensed for distribution with such New System and royalties are payable with respect thereto shall not be deemed to constitute a penalty or other charge of any kind within the meaning of the foregoing sentence; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) All OEMs with existing Per System Licenses, or Per Processor Licenses treated by Microsoft under Section IV (J) as Per System Licenses, will be sent within 30 days following entry of this Final Judgment in a separately mailed notice printed in bold, boxed type which shall begin with the sentence ``You are operating under a Microsoft Per System License,'' and shall continue with the language contained in the first four quoted paragraphs below. All new or amended Per System Licenses executed after September 1, 1994 shall contain a provision that appears on the top half of the signature page in bold, boxed type shall begin with the sentence ``This is a Microsoft Per System License,'' and which shall continue with the language contained in the first four quoted paragraphs below. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ``As a Customer, you may create a `New System' at any time that does not require the payment of a royalty to Microsoft unless the Customer and Microsoft agree to add it to the Licensing Agreement.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Any New System created may be identical in every respect to a system as to which the Customer pays a Per System royalty to Microsoft provided that the New System has a unique model number or model name for internal and external identification purposes which distinguishes it from any system the Customer sells that is included in a Per System License. The requirement of external identification may be satisfied by placement of the unique model name or model number on the machine and its container (if any), without more.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

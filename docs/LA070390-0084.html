			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISALIGNMENT OF SHUTTLES' FUEL TANKS STUDIED  </P> <P> NASA engineers are focusing on a small misalignment of fuel tanks and  spacecraft on two space shuttles as they search for the cause of hydrogen leaks  that have grounded the shuttle fleet.  </P> <P> The problem is throwing the shuttle schedule into disarray and threatens to  postpone at least two missions this summer, officials said Monday.  </P> <P> Most of the 35 orbiter-tank combinations flown so far have had some  misalignments, but the two found in the shuttles with the leaks are the largest  to date, spaceflight director William B. Lenoir said.  </P> <P> Lenoir said the leak problem -- which shows up while the tank is being filled  with supercold liquid hydrogen a few hours before flight -- must be fixed  within a few weeks to keep NASA anywhere near its ambitious flight schedule.  </P> <P> NASA's science chief, Lennard Fisk, sought to put a brighter view on NASA's  other headache, the faulty mirror on the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope  that prevents the accurate focusing that scientists need.  </P> <P> NASA is consulting with experts in image processing -- using technology to  enhance pictures received from the telescope.  </P> <P> "There is growing optimism that we will be successful," Fisk said. "Six months  from now, a year from now, I expect you all to ooh and aah over the picture  that Hubble is going to produce."  </P></p>

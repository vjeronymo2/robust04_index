			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Sara Lee reports strong earnings SARA LEE, the large Chicago-based consumer products company, yesterday posted strong fourth-quarter earnings, reflecting improved margins in its packaged meat business and the contributions of the company's recent acquisitions. For the three months to June 27, net income rose 20.6 per cent to Dollars 170.2m from Dollars 141.1m a year earlier. Primary earnings per share were 19.3 per cent higher at 68 cents, compared with 57 cents in the same period of 1991. Sales advanced 11.8 per cent to Dollars 3.4bn. Full-year results were distorted by a large one-time gain on the sale of the company's European over-the-counter pharmaceutical business, which contributed 60 cents a share net of restructuring charges. Including one-time items, net income rose 42.2 per cent to Dollars 760.6m from Dollars 535m, while primary earnings per share were 43.3 per cent higher at Dollars 3.08 from Dollars 2.15. Stripping out extraordinary items, earnings per share increased 15.3 per cent in the year to Dollars 2.48. Sales rose 7 per cent to Dollars 13.2bn from Dollars 12.4bn. Operating income for packaged meats and bakery products rose 29.9 per cent to Dollars 87.4m in the quarter, in spite of a 6.2 per cent decline in sales to Dollars 1.2bn. The company attributed the improved profitability to operating efficiencies, lower raw material costs in packaged meats and an improved product mix in its bakery operations.</p>

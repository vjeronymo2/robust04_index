			<p>BFN     [Text] On the afternoon of 6 March, Cheng Weigao,  secretary of the provincial party committee, and Governor Ye  Liansong respectively gave important speeches at the end of the  provincial conference on building well-off rural areas.    Cheng Weigao said: In rural work, we have many tasks to  perform. We must persist in giving overall consideration to  building well-off rural areas. Most of Hebei's population is in  the rural areas. Only by making peasants well-off on schedule  can we have hopes and guarantee for making the people across the  province become well-off. Building well-off rural areas is a  complete system of targets and tasks. If we do a good job in  grasping the building of well-off rural areas, we will be able  to grasp the key point of the entire rural work and to fully  boost the enthusiasm of the masses of peasants.    Cheng Weigao said: The building of well-off rural areas is a  huge project. We must give prominence to the key points and  carry it out in an all-round manner. The key points are:  First, we should actively develop the high-yield, fine-quality,  and highly efficient farming; second, actively develop township  enterprises; and third, do a good job in family planning work.  Only by grasping these three tasks well can we have guarantee  for realizing the objective of making the rural areas well-off.  To accelerate the building of well-off rural areas across the  province, we must strive to make places with favorable  conditions to become well-off ahead of other places. This is an  issue stressed in Cheng Weigao's speech. He said: Things  usually develop unevenly. It is impossible to make all the  rural areas well-off simultaneously. We should help those  places with good conditions accelerate development so that they  can take the lead in making breakthroughs in this aspect and use  their experience to guide the work of the entire area in an  effort to attain the final goal of common prosperity.    Cheng Weigao stressed: To realize the goal of becoming  well-off, we must establish incentive mechanism among county,  township, and village cadres. County-level leading members must  not be arbitrarily transferred in principle so as to keep them  relatively stable. In the course of building well-off rural  areas, those who make outstanding achievements should be  awarded, those who basically fulfill the target should be  retained for continued use, and those who fail to fulfill the  target should be demoted. All localities may study and decide  the incentive and restraint mechanisms of the township and  village levels on their own. In short, through the  establishment of incentive mechanism at all levels, we may form  a strong motivation of making leading cadres work hard and  enabling them to realistically concentrate their energy on  making the rural areas well-off.    Ye Liansong also offered ideas at the conference on  regarding  the work of making the rural areas well-off as the overall task  of the rural work and on striving to create a new situation in  making the rural areas well-off. He called on all localities to  realize the objective of making the rural areas well-off as an  overall task in building an economically strong province and to  work out plans carefully. Ye Liansong said: Building well-off  rural areas is very important in the course of effecting a  sustained, rapid, and sound development in the national economy.  Party committees and governments at all levels must fully  understand this point. In making the rural areas well-off, we  should consider increasing the income of peasants as the  nucleus, accelerating the development of commodity economy in  the rural areas, and in doing specific work, improving thinking,  giving different guidance according to the merit of each case,  carrying out the work in an all-round manner, acting in line  with the outlines of the Hebei Provincial plan on building  well-off rural areas, and formulating development strategy in  line with local advantages. Places along Bohai Bay, railway  lines, and Beijing and Tianjin Municipalities should expand  opening up and the development strength in the rural areas and  actively develop suburban town economy and export-oriented  economy; flatlands should strengthen the development and use of  agricultural resources and actively develop high-yield,  fine-quality, and highly efficient farming; the mountainous  areas and upland areas have comparatively poor natural  conditions, therefore, they should place the emphasis on  forestry, fruit industry, animal husbandry, mining industry, and  processing industry.    Ye Liansong stressed at the end of his speech: To strengthen  leadership and to do a good job in building well-off rural  areas, we must first attend to planning; second, progress;  third, work evaluation; and fourth, consolidation of work  achievements. If we grasp these four aspects of work well, we  will have a guarantee for realizing the objective of becoming  well-off throughout the province by 2000.</p>

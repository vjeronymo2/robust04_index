			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALTERNATIVE-FUEL CARS PUSHED ON A BUMPY SENATE ROAD  </P> <P> Conceding that they face a tough fight, the two leading U.S. Senate backers of  legislation calling for smog-reducing alternative-fuel cars said Thursday that  an intensive lobbying drive is under way to gain its passage.  </P> <P> The controversial requirement, contained in a clean air amendment authored by  Sens. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) and Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.), is expected to be  taken up on the Senate floor next week when Congress returns from a week's  recess.  </P> <P> The battle is being closely watched by air pollution officials in California,  New York and other states with severe smog problems.  </P> <P> The amendment is opposed by the White House and Senate Majority Leader George  J. Mitchell (D-Me.), who previously announced they had reached a compromise on  a new federal clean air measure that does not include the alternative-fuel car  provision.  </P> <P> Originally contained in President Bush's clean air proposal submitted to  Congress last year, the provision was vigorously opposed by the oil and  automobile industries.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview from Colorado, Wirth said it will be difficult to  round up enough votes, in light of the opposition. He said opponents worry that  if the amendment is adopted, the compromise on the clean air measure will fall  apart.  </P> <P> "They obviously view this as a deal-buster," Wirth said.  </P> <P> Wilson, meeting with reporters at South Coast Air Quality Management District  headquarters in El Monte, agreed. "It is very tough," Wilson said.  </P> <P> Wirth said he counted 20 solid votes for the amendment and another seven  possible votes.  </P> <P> As Wirth was telephoning senators asking for their votes, Wilson was thanking  AQMD officials for rallying support among their counterparts in other states.  He urged them to continue.  </P> <P> California officials plan next September to require auto makers to build  alternative-fuel cars, even if Congress fails to act. But Wilson and others  noted Thursday that 20% to 25% of cars registered in California are purchased  out of state, where tailpipe emission standards are not as strict.  </P> <P> For that reason, they said tougher federal tailpipe standards -- also called  for in the Wirth-Wilson amendment -- are important to California's  anti-pollution efforts.  </P></p>

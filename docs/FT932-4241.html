			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Group 4 concerned about London contract FRESH COMPLICATIONS over the legal rights of public employees transferring to the private sector may arise when the government puts London's prison escort services out to tender soon. Group 4 - the private security company which is seeking the contract and has been shortlisted to manage Strangeways prison, Manchester - might withdraw from the bidding if it is forced to operate on public-sector rates. In April Group 4 started operating Britain's first privately managed prison escort service - in the east Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside  - using newly recruited staff. It is a leading contender for the Pounds 25m-a-year contract for escorting prisoners in the London area. But Group 4 managers have written to the government pointing out that unlike other police forces, the Metropolitan Police has its own dedicated team of officers working exclusively on prison escort duties. Mr Jim Harrower, Group 4 chief executive, said yesterday the company was concerned that this might mean the 1981 Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations (Tupe) might apply. These guarantee public-sector employees transferred to private companies maintenance of pay and conditions. 'If the London court escort service had to operate on police pay rates and conditions it would radically alter our attitude to the contract,' said Mr Harrower. 'We have expressed concern to the government.' Group 4 has received formal notification from the Prison Service Agency that it has been shortlisted from among seven bidders to manage the rebuilt Strangeways. It already manages Wolds remand prison, Humberside. 'But we do not want to just be involved in prison management,' said Mr Harrower. 'Even though most prisons will remain under public-sector management we want to become an alternative prison authority, providing a complete range of training, education and other services.' He said the company would bid to run the new Doncaster prison, which will follow Strangeways as the next candidate for market testing. The Doncaster contract has particular attractions for Group 4, as it is in the same region as Wolds and the company's current prison escort contract, opening the possibility of one private-sector company providing all penal services in an area.</p>

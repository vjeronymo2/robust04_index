			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Arts: Teresa Berganza in recital Back in the 1970s Victoria de los Angeles used to come to London and give recitals where she would only start to get her audience warmed up with the first of her encores and would then go on to sing for another half an hour or more. It seems this may be a Spanish tradition. It would be unfair to suggest that Teresa Berganza did not give her audience at Covent Garden on Tuesday anything to value in her programme, but she did leave it until late in the day. She is not an earthy Spanish mezzo, a sizzling and scorching singer like Conchita Supervia was years ago. Berganza sings with impeccable taste and craftsmanship, which allow for few risks to get the adrenalin going. This was an all-Rossini programme, just about an hour of music. Berganza has the distinction of being a leading post-war Rossinian and his music still suits her well. The voice has lost some of its focus in the middle, which is breathy, but it is in good shape at either end, bright at the top with a keen edge, unforced and resonant at the bottom. It almost seems a shame that the singer is not approaching her prime now, as she would be an ideal person to sing the Rossini operas alongside an orchestra of authentic instruments. The style, like the voice, is perfectly contained, precise, nothing out of place. The cantata Giovanna d'Arco needed more panache. But there were some good examples of bel canto songs and one truly outstanding piece of stylish and expressive singing in the heartfelt 'Addio di Rossini'. Then came the encores. Rossini in Spanish style, zarzuela, Spanish song, 'Cruda sorte' from L'italiana in Algeri, all well accompanied by Juan Antonio Alvarez Parejo and sung with enough elan to bring the evening to a rousing close. The array of flowers was one of the largest the Royal Opera's recital series can have seen. It is surely too soon for this to have been the 'Addio di Berganza'.</p>

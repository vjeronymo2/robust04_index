			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Russians take plunge and say Yes to Nato peace partnership Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, yesterday confirmed that Russia would join the US-inspired 'Partnership for Peace' programme designed to draw former Communist states into a closer relationship with Nato. Russia would no longer insist on special conditions for membership, he said. Under the programme, states are invited to sign an identical framework agreement, but they can then write their own menu for co-operation programmes with Nato. Russia said it would draw up its menu this month. Mr William Perry, US defence secretary in Moscow for talks with his opposite number General Pavel Grachev, said: 'This would be a major event for Nato  .Russia is a great power, a nuclear power. They will play a special role in the Partnership.' The Russian decision - if fulfilled - represents an important move by the Chernomyrdin government towards the west, in the face of strong criticism of the Partnership by several influential figures. Mr Andranik Migranyan, an adviser to President Yeltsin, this week said the Partnership was designed to 'isolate' Russia. The defence and foreign ministries believe Russia would be better in than out, partly because its former allies in central and eastern Europe are enthusiastically joining and Russia still wishes to exert some regional influence. Officials also believe that Russia will gain access to a wider arms markets within the Nato sphere of influence. But there remain strong areas of doubt among even those politicians who favour joining the Partnership. Mr Andrei Kokoshin, the deputy defence minister and the top civilian in the defence establishment, wrote in the New York Times yesterday that Russia would never be a 'younger brother'. Mr Perry insisted that the rules had fundamentally changed, and that agreements between Russia and the west were not a 'zero sum game' in which one side lost where the other won. He said he favoured increased contact with other states including Ukraine, but said 'this would not be as a buffer to Russia'. A vigorous lobby in the US, led by Dr Henry Kissinger and Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski, has begun criticising the Clinton administration's policy towards Russia as over-accommodating - especially in withholding Nato membership from the central European states which want it. The US administration has been forced to defend its position on Russia in the face of these attacks, stressing that the Partnership is a flexible one, which could open its doors to full membership for central European countries if Russia was felt to be a threat to their security. In a speech made before his trip, Mr Perry dwelt on the possible threat of a nationalist Russia - something US administration officials have not done until the last month or two. Mr Perry said yesterday that the Partnership 'gave no guarantee to anyone that they would become members of Nato' and that, even if states were to become members, it would not be 'in the near term'. However, the policy remains one of seeking to engage Russia in a range of co-operative activities in the defence field - with joint manoeuvres between Russian and US infantry units in Russia scheduled for this summer. Mr Perry said western-Russian co-operation on Bosnia had produced significant successes, both in stopping the shelling of Sarajevo and in opening Tuzla airport. However, he added: 'Now we are getting into a more complex process - we have a framework agreement between the Croats and the Moslems, but we must get Serb participation as well.' He said that Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian special envoy to Bosnia and Mr Charles Redman, his US counterpart, were working on getting a 'co-operative agreement' between all parties. A range of agreements were signed, including Dollars 30m of US aid for the safe destruction of chemical weapons; Dollars 20m seed capital for US-Russian joint ventures in the field of military conversion; and Dollars 20m to build homes for demobilised officers.</p>

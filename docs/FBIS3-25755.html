Ethiopian ambassador to Zimbabwe, Fantahum Michael, told AFP  Saturday [26 February] that he personally presented the request  to Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Nathan Shamuyarira on Wednesday.    He said Shamuyarira told him he would present the request to  the cabinet and a response could be expected at a later date.    The Zimbabwean authorities have not yet responded publicly  to  the request.    Mengistu fled to Zimbabwe just before a 1991 uprising in his  country and was granted political asylum by President Robert  Mugabe, a former ally, in May 1991.    Early this month, Mengistu breached one of his conditions of  asylum, and broke years of silence over his home country saying  Ethiopia was in a "disgusting" state and that he had plans to  rescue it.    Michael, however said the extradition request was not  sparked  off by Mengistu's recent outburst.    He said it was a coincidence as preparations had already  been  underway to ask for his extradition.    The request was finalised in Addis Ababa on February 15 and  brought to Harare this week by a team of European lawyers  helping the government of Meles Zenawi investigate Mengistu's  human rights violations together with some members of the office  of the special prosecutor of Ethiopia.    The request documents detail Mengistu's abuse of human  rights, which included the massacre of at least 100,000  Ethiopians.    Analysts say it is likely to take months before Zimbabwe  answers to the request as it will take legal experts from both  countries, as well as international agencies to meet and examine  the various points of international law under which the  extradition and trial should take place.    The DAILY GAZETTE newspaper said Saturday that the Ethiopian  Government was also seeking the extradition of Mengistu's aides,  24 of whom were in Kenya, 14 in the United States, six in Europe  and several others in other African nations.    Three of the wanted aides are reportedly holed up in the  Italian Embassy in Addis Ababa and many others are already in  Ethiopian Government custody.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, March 14 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton today named Admiral Jeremy Boorda, the commander of NATO  forces in southern Europe as the top officer of the U.S. Navy,  replacing Admiral Frank Kelso Jr., White House announced today.    The White House made the announcement from Detroit where  President Clinton is hosting a G-7 job summit.    Boorda, 55, is currently serving as commander in chief of  U.S. naval forces in Europe, and commander in chief of allied  forces in southern Europe, where he is responsible for  coordinating and planning NATO military actions over  Bosnia-Hercegovina and in the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas.    Boorda is a former listed man who is considered close to  General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of  Staff.    Boorda, a native of Chicago, Illinois state, joined the U.S.  Navy in 1956 when he was 18 after he dropped out of high school  because of problems at home. Within six years, he rose to the  rank of petty officer first class, serving primarily in naval  aviation.    In 1962, he was selected from officer candidate school under  the seaman to admiral program, which ended several years later.  His first sea tour as an officer was off Vietnam.    In 1966, he, as a lieutenant, got his first command, the USS  Parrot, a small coastal minesweeper with a crew of 43 and four  officers, and it remains his favorite command.    In 1971, after attending the U.S. Naval War College and  obtaining a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Rhode  Island, he assumed duties as an executive officer.    From 1975 to 1977, Boorda commanded the USS Parraut and was  next assigned as executive assistant to the principal deputy  assistant secretary of the navy for manpower and reserve affairs  in Washington, D.C.    In 1983-1984, he served as executive assistant to the chief  of naval personnel, deputy chief of naval operations for  manpower, personnel and training. In December, 1984, he assumed  his first flag officer assignment as executive assistant to the  chief of naval operations, remaining until July, 1986.    Kelso, 60, announced last month that he was retiring two  months ahead of schedule because he had become the "lightning  rod" for criticism of the Navy's handling over the past two  years of the Tailhook sexual harassment scandal.    Kelso is due to leave as chief of naval operations on April  30. As the top uniformed position in the navy, he is a member of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>

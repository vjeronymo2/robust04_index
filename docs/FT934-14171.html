			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (21): There is no quick financial 'fix' - Equipment supplies / There is overwhelming evidence that high quality telecom networks are essential for economic growth in developing countries IN a recent survey of business managers in central and eastern Europe carried out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 44 per cent of respondents said that poor quality telecommunications links were the main barrier to exports to the west, and 53 per cent cited it as the the biggest obstacle to exports to neigbouring countries. Telecommunications modernisation programmes were neglected by Communist governments and international links, in particular, were hopelessly inadequate when eastern Europe opened to the west in 1989 and 1990. OECD figures show a strong correlation between GDP per capita and telephone line penetration across central and eastern Europe. GDP per capital rises by between Dollars 600 and Dollars 1,000 for every five per cent increase in telephone line penetration. Improving trunk ad international telephone links was immediately a priority for the new democracies. But finding the money to pay for new telephone lines has been a big obstacle which telephone operators, equipment suppliers, financiers and teams of western consultants, are struggling even now to overcome. When telephone operators were state-owned organisations operating under ministerial control, financing for telecommunications development was provided directly from state budgets. 'In the past, finance was not a serious issue for telecommunications operators,' according to Tim Nulty, a senior World Bak economist. 'Politicians set the goals and, having done so, were obliged to provide the finance and the necessary inputs. Managers in the telecommunications operators had little responsibility. They merely translated the targets 'delivered from the top' into detailed programmes for installation and lists of required inputs. It was the government's responsibility to see that the necessary goods ad finance were available.' But the dismantling of central planning, and the enormous investments required to make up for the years of neglect, means that the telecommunications operators need to look elsewhere for finance. THE World Bank, the European Investment Bank, and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, EBRD, have taken the lead in securing finace for telecommunications projects in eastern Europe. They have raised money for international gateways, cellular telephone networks ad digital trunk backbone networks. All are essential for international business, but less rewarding process of upgrading ad extending the basic telephone network has not even started in a number of countries. 'The problem,' according to one western banker, 'is marketing projects as an attractive investment opportunity.' Mr Clell Harral, a deputy director for infrastructure, energy and environment at the EBRD, says there are a number of reasons why investors are cautious about project finance - schemes in which debt finance is secured solely on revenues from the investment itself. 'The country risk, the foreign exchange risk and the instability of the government regime with respect to regulatory policies, the greater uncertainties of demand forecasts, contractual counter-party credit risks and uncertainties regarding the enforceability of legal structures' are all significant risks that have to be dealt with, Mr Harral says. As a result, potential investors have shied away from project finance - 'there's been a lot of talk about project finance and not much action,' according to one leading banker. In eastern Europe, the EBRD is most optimistic about overcoming these obstacles in Hungary, Poland ad the Czech Republic where telephone operators' activities are being separated from the ministries and modest tariff reform programmes are under way. Build-operate-transfer (BOT) project finance, for example, 'is a serious option today' in these countries, adds Mr Harral. A different picture is emerging in south-east Asia where telephone operators are finding it relatively easy to finance infrastructure projects - 'all forms of investors are willing to invest in countries such as Thailand, Korea and Malaysia, according to a senior economist in one commercial bank. Equity investment, supplier finance and project finance are all available, which means that telephone operators can go for the best deal, he adds. One of the most imaginative financing packages was put together in Thailand where two international consortia are installing telephone lines in Bangkok and outlying rural areas in return for a share in line revenues. TelecomAsia, which is majority-owned by Charoen Pokphand Group, has a 25-year build-operate-transfer agreement with the Telephone Organisation of Thailand, to instal 2m phone lines in Bangkok. The project is being managed by US regional telephone company, Nynex. Japanese domestic telephone operate Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, meanwhile, has a stake in the majority Thai-owned Thai Telephone and Telecommunications, which has a 25-year BOT agreement to instal a million provincial telephone lines. The most ambitious modernisation programmes are in India and China. Ian MacLeod, a telecommunications equipment industry analyst at Natwest Sellier in Paris, says that China will buy 9m telephone lines in 1993. If China meets its target of increasing telephone line penetration from two per cent to 10 per cent by the year 2000, it will need to buy 13m lines a year for the rest of the decade, Mr MacLeod adds. CHINA is paying for telephone lines in hard currency out of its big trade surplus. But it will inevitably seek to open lines of finance in north America and western Europe, many analysts believe. Central control of telecom operations will have to be relaxed if China wants private investors to contribute to the modernisation programme, according to one western banker. 'If they try to do it in a monolithic way, they wouldn't have the money nad no one abroad will lend it to them,' he says. 'What they have to do - and what they are doing - is opening up avenues for smaller operators.' Similarly, India may have to reform the telecommunications sector to meet its target of installing two million lines a year until the year 2000. Importing telephone lines has been made easier by the willingness of leading suppliers to accept payment in the newly-convertible rupee. They are also in discussions about supplier finance, but this will only meet part of the total financing requirement. Developing countries understand the importance of telecoms to their economies. But financing modernisation programmes is a long, arduous task. There is no quick financial fix and developing countries will have to continue to rely heavily on internally-generated funds from high-margin businesses such as mobile communications and international services to finance basic infrastructure projects.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------         FINANCING TELECOMS INFRASTRUCTURE: FINANCING OPTIONS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The details here are from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, EBRD. They outline the financing options at four stages of infrastructure development. The primary source of finance must be internal cash generation. External finance can be mobilised as follows:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- STAGE ONE:   public telephone operator under ministry control:              EBRD: sovereign loans.              Private and bilateral sources: supplier and export credit.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- STAGE TWO:   separation of telecoms from other activities:              EBRD: Sovereign loans, lender of record.              Commercial sources of finance: syndicated loans; project              finance.              Private and bilateral sources: supplier and export credit.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- STAGE THREE: corporatisation:              EBRD: non-guaranteed loans, lender of record,              guarantees, project finance equity.              Commercial sources of finance: syndicated loans; project              finance.              Private and bilateral sources: supplier and export              credit; project finance; equity.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- STAGE FOUR:  privatisation:              EBRD: commercial loans, underwriting, guarantees, equity.              Commercial sources: commercial loans.              Private and bilateral sources: supplier and export credit;              project finance; equity.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> COUNCIL APPROVES FARMERS MARKET  </P> <P> Charitable organizations will be allowed to organize a farmers market to raise  funds, the Camarillo City Council decided Wednesday.  </P> <P> Camarillo Hospice and the Pleasant Valley Hospital Auxiliary have contacted  more than 75 farmers, said Jane Rozanski, executive director of Camarillo  Hospice.  </P> <P> Money raised at the market will be used for the care of terminally ill patients  and equipment for the hospital.  </P> <P> "We feel this is an idea whose time has come," Rozanski said. "Camarillo is an  agricultural center, and there is a very special feeling of community here. We  thought it would be great to get the community together on a Saturday morning  where people can buy fresh produce and meet with their neighbors."  </P> <P> Named the Camarillo Certified Farmers Market because produce will be certified  by the county's agricultural commissioner, the market is expected to be  operating by January in the parking lot of the Senior Nutrition Center on  Ventura Boulevard. Approval for the site must still be arranged with the  county. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER  </P></p>

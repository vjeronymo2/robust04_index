			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: US operation hits Feedback profits Feedback, the USM-quoted designer and maker of electronic, electrical and computer-based equipment, reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 340,600 to Pounds 267,900 for the six months to September 30. Turnover was lower at Pounds 4.47m (Pounds 4.53m), reflecting continued uncertainties in the domestic industrial market, Mr John Westcott, chairman, said. Feedback Instruments improved its performance while Feedback Data remained in profit, Mr Westcott said. However, the US operation continued to be affected by tight state budgets and incurred a loss in the period. An interim dividend of 0.5p is declared from earnings of 2.13p (2.41p) per share.</p>

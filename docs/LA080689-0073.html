			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PGA COURSE WILL PLAY ACCORDING TO THE WIND  </P> <P> Kemper Lakes, a 10-year-old public course where the 71st PGA championship will  be played this week, is a huge, demanding layout with water coming into play on  11 of the holes.  </P> <P> Emil Esposito, the home pro, figures anywhere from even par to 12-under could  win the 72-hole tournament over the 7,197-yard, par 36-36 -- 72 layout.  </P> <P> "It all depends on the wind," said Esposito. "If the wind blows during the  tournament, I'd be willing to put up par or 1-under and let them shoot at that.  If it isn't blowing, 10 or 12-under can win. That's how good those guys are.  </P> <P> "The course record will go down," said Esposito, "because somewhere along the  line somebody will shoot a 66 or 65."  </P> <P> Only a handful of pros have seen the course. The PGA Grand Slam, a charity  exhibition with four leading pros playing with four amateurs, has been held at  Kemper Lakes three times.  </P> <P> Greg Norman has participated in all three and set the course record with a 70  but that was broken in 1988 by Larry Nelson with a 69.  </P> <P> Norman was the central figure in a controversy over the 18th hole, a 433-yard  par-4 dogleg left with the tee shot carrying over water.  </P> <P> Norman tried a shortcut over the corner of the lake in 1988, hitting a drive of  some 300 yards downwind onto the green. Last April three 30-foot honey locust  trees were planted, theoretically blocking the shortcut.  </P> <P> That didn't stop Norman last Memorial Day. He tried it again, drove over the  trees and landed in a greenside bunker.  </P> <P> "I might try it in the tournament, it depends on the situation," said Norman.  "If you don't carry the water, you're looking at double bogey."  </P> <P> The rough will be four inches during the tournament and Exposito said "You have  to use a 7, 8 or 9-iron to get out. Only a strong guy like Norman can get out  of it with a 6-iron. You have options on this course and you'd better respect  it or it will jump at you with a double bogey real quick."  </P></p>

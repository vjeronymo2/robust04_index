			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PALM SPRINGS BANK EXPLOSION SCATTERS CASH IN DEPOSIT BOX  </P> <P> An explosion ripped open a Bank of America night deposit box Monday, littering  the bank parking lot with an unknown amount of money and causing $100,000  damage, authorities said.  </P> <P> "The night deposit door was blown about 500 feet away and there was money  scattered.  </P> <P> It was a pretty powerful explosion," said Fred Reagan, spokesman for the Los  Angeles FBI office.  </P> <P> Authorities had not determined whether the explosion was part of a robbery  attempt. No arrests had been made.  </P> <P> A minor fire followed the 4:47 a.m. explosion at the Bank of America branch on  East Palm Canyon Drive near Sunrise Boulevard in the Smoke Tree Shopping  Center, said Police Sgt. Gary Jeandron.  </P> <P> There were no injuries.  </P> <P> FBI bomb experts and the Riverside County Sheriff's Department bomb squad  examined the destruction Monday afternoon in an effort to determine the type of  explosives used and a possible motive, Police Lt. Lee Weigel said.  </P> <P> Bank of America officials said a bomb was placed in the night deposit box. The  explosion damaged the box and a portion of the bank wall, said Tom Chapman, a  bank spokesman in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "There was no loss of customer information and the safe deposit boxes weren't  damaged," he said.  </P> <P> The bank remained closed Monday, but customers will have access to safe deposit  boxes today, Chapman said.  </P> <P> The bank will reopen for all transactions within 10 days, he said. Meanwhile, a  mobile branch was to open today in the parking lot next to the bank.  </P></p>

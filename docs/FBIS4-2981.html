			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Friendly Cooperation, Smooth </F> Transition--Greeting the Seventh Anniversary of the Signing of  the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on Macao"]    [Text] Today is the day to commemorate the seventh  anniversary of the signing of the joint declaration on the Macao  issue between our government and the Portuguese Government.  This date of great significance coincides with the visit to  China by Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, who came  to China to sign the joint declaration seven years ago. We  warmly celebrate the seventh anniversary of the signing of the  joint declaration and wish the current visit of Prime Minister  Anibal Cavaco Silva full success.    The Macao question is one left behind by history. Our  country, following Comrade Deng Xiaoping's great concept of "one  country, two systems," began talks in Beijing in June 1986 with  the Portuguese Government on solving the Macao question. Based  on a friendly, frank, and pragmatic spirit, both sides reached  an agreement after a short period of nine months and, on 13  April 1987, officially signed the joint declaration on the Macao  issue. The joint declaration stipulates that the Macao region  is Chinese territory, that the Chinese Government will resume  sovereignty over Macao on 20 December 1999, that by then the  Macao Special Administrative Region of the PRC will be  established and will practice "one country, two systems," that  Macao's current social and economic systems and way of life will  remain unchanged and its laws will basically remain unchanged,  and that, during Macao's transition period, the Portuguese  Government will be responsible for administering Macao, and will  continue to promote Macao's economic development and maintain  its social stability, while the Chinese Government will  cooperate in this area. The Sino-Portuguese joint declaration  is a historic document of profound significance and has  established a model for solving problems between countries left  behind by history. The signing of the joint declaration enabled  bilateral relations between China and Portugal to enter a new  stage.    In March 1993, the First Session of the Eighth National  People's Congress examined and passed the Basic Law of the Macao  Special Administration Region of the PRC. The Basic Law is  Macao's fundamental law and has fixed in legal form the Chinese  Government's basic principles and policies toward Macao as  explained in the Sino- Portuguese joint declaration. It  provides concrete regulations for the main contents of Macao's  social, political, economic, cultural and other fundamental  systems and has been warmly welcomed and extensively supported  by the Macao compatriots.    Over the past seven years since the signing of the joint  declaration, the friendly and cooperative relations between  China and Portugal have developed smoothly. In recent years,  the mutual visits by the senior leaders of China and Portugal  have forcefully promoted the development of bilateral relations  as well as the friendly cooperation between China and Portugal  on the Macao question. Both the Chinese and Portuguese sides  have seriously implemented the joint declaration and have  carried out very fruitful cooperation. The Sino-Portuguese  Joint Liaison Group has held 19 plenary sessions and many expert  conferences. Both sides have made headway in a series of  problems faced by Macao during the transition period, such as  language, public service, law, and Macao's bid to join the  relevant international organizations; both sides also  successfully solved the problems of financing the construction  of the Macao International Airport and the domain of aviation  agreement. In recent years, the completion of large projects in  Macao one after another have injected new vigor into Macao's  economic development. Macao enjoys social stability and  economic development, and its residents live and work happily.  The sincerity and friendly cooperation between the Chinese and  Portuguese sides in implementing the joint declaration is the  guarantee for maintaining Macao's stability and development.  Seriously implementing the joint declaration and realizing  Macao's steady transition and smooth transfer of power in 1999  are in the common interest of both China and Portugal. Practice  has proven that cooperation is good for both the Chinese and  Portuguese sides and is good for Macao as well.    At present, Macao has approximately five years left in its  transition period, and both the Chinese and Portuguese sides are  facing some difficult tasks. As long as both sides set store  for the overall situation of Macao's stability and development  and consistently stick to close consultations and strengthen  friendly cooperation, they can surely solve various problems  arising from Macao's transition period and can create conducive  conditions for Macao's steady transition and smooth transfer of  power. We believe that, with friendly cooperation and common  efforts by both the Chinese and Portuguese sides, Macao's steady  transition and smooth transfer of power can surely be realized.</p>

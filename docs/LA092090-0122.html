			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> UNLV'S TARKANIAN TO VISIT ANTELOPE VALLEY  </P> <P> Jerry Tarkanian, Nevada Las Vegas basketball coach, will return to the Antelope  Valley today for a visit, more than three decades after he coached the 1958  Antelope Valley High basketball team to a 4-9 record.  </P> <P> It was his only season at the school and his only losing season as a coach, but  now he has plenty of reasons to return.  </P> <P> Antelope Valley College, the local junior college, has been nicknamed UNAV  because of its ties to Tarkanian and the UNLV basketball program.  </P> <P> Tarkanian will attend the college's basketball class/practice from 3 p.m. to 5  p.m. and likely will have a Shark's eye on 6-foot-5 sophomore swingman J. R.  Rider.  </P> <P> Newton Chelette, Antelope Valley's basketball coach, is a former Tarkanian  assistant, and Chelette sent his star player, former Taft High standout Dedan  Thomas, to UNLV this season.  </P> <P> Tarkanian's son George was hired last month as a political science teacher at  Antelope Valley College.

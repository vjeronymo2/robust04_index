			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Berlusconi allies hold up deal on Italian cabinet Six weeks after Italy's general elections, media magnate Mr Silvio Berlusconi is still facing problems completing a cabinet list that satisfies his own requirements and the individual demands of his allies in the Freedom Alliance. The battle over the various cabinet portfolios has revealed the wide differences between the demands of the Northern League which needs to retain a separate identity from Forza Italia and from the neo-fascists. It has also shown that Mr Berlusconi has found it far more difficult than he expected to produce a government team and a coherent programme since his landslide victory in the general elections of March 27-28. The main point of contention has been the post of interior minister - which the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi has claimed as the largest party in parliament. It appeared agreement had been reached last Thursday on an independent candidate for the portfolio which controls the administrative apparatus and the security services. This agreement fell apart at the weekend because the compromise candidate declined to accept the post. The job was offered, for the second time, to Mr Antonio Di Pietro, Italy's best known anti-corruption magistrate. However he politely refused the offer, complicating the choice of a successor. If the agreement on the interior portfolio between Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia and Mr Bossi and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance is to hold, the post will have to be given to an independent figure, probably a senior judge. However, the continuing problems over the Interior Ministry underline the difficult balance of interests within the Freedom Alliance. Mr Berlusconi had hoped to finalise the cabinet last week. He is under strong pressure to present his list of ministers at the latest by Tuesday so that parliament can rapidly confer a vote of confidence on Italy's 53rd post-war government and the programme of the right-wing government.</p>

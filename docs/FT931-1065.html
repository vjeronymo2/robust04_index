			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Fiat executives stay in prison A MILAN civil liberties tribunal yesterday rejected requests for the release of two top Fiat executives held in prison since February 22 on charges of alleged corruption. The tribunal accepted prosecution arguments that the two men, Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial officer, and Mr Antonio Mosconi, head of Toro, the Turin car group's insurance arm, were liable to influence the course of justice if released. The decision is a blow to Fiat since Mr Mattioli is one of the four top members of the group's management structure following a reorganisation last December. It is also underlines the determination of Milan magistrates to press charges against the two men for their alleged involvement in the payment of L1.8bn (Pounds 821,000) in kick-backs by Cogefar-Impresit, Fiat's construction subsidiary, during the building of Milan's metro. Both Mr Mattioli and Mr Mosconi have served on the Cogera-Impresit board. Mr Vittorio Chiusano, Fiat's lawyer, commented wryly after the decision: 'There was not much hope how the request would be received. He (Mr Mattioli) knew very well how the law was practised in Milan.' Last May Mr Enzo Papi, chief executive of Cogefar-Impresit, was arrested on similar charges and held for 55 days in prison until he confessed. Mr Papi's confession, along with that of a Christian Democrat politician, are now being used in allegations against Mr Mattioli and Mosconi. In other developments in Italy's corruption scandals yesterday, Mr Giuseppe Santoro, a senior diplomat formerly in charge of overseas aid at the foreign ministry, was arrested on charges of alleged extortion and abuse of office. His arrest is part of a wide-ranging investigation by Rome magistrates into the misuse of foreign aid, especially to Bangladesh, Somalia and Sudan that already involves Mr Gianni de Michelis, the former foreign secretary. Yesterday it was revealed that the latter's private secretary, Ms Barbar Coelin, was wanted for questioning. Also explosive developments are expected shortly in Naples where a series of confessions by local politicians has led to the naming of some of the city's most influential businessmen and political figures. This week police have carried out a series of unprecedented searches of the offices of all the main parties in Naples. The city's magistrates are understood to be following seven separate lines of investigation of which the most important are misuse of funds following the 1980 Irpinia earthquake, the construction of a metro system and development related to the 1990 World Cup football competition. Neapolitan politics have been based upon the biggest network of patronage in the country.</p>

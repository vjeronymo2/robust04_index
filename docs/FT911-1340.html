			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Letter: Putting a value on workers I was pleased to read Joe Rogaly's article 'Cardboard citizens' (April 30), coming as it did in the week after the IMF urged Britain to cut benefits for the jobless in order to curb wage increases. Within Britain there is a tendency to blame trade unions and their members for any decline in economic or industrial performance. High wage claims, inflexible workers and an over-generous benefit system are often quoted as undermining our ability to compete. A recent report by the Institute of Employment Rights argues that Britain will continue to decline while government and industry concentrate on policies designed simply to cut labour costs. Companies should concentrate on correcting their managerial and training failures while developing innovative marketing, design and technology policies. The government should reconsider its reforms of the tax and benefit systems and look to more egalitarian social insurance provisions. At the moment, the welfare state is failing to fulfil its original remit, particularly the elimination of the need to beg. Instead state benefits are being used as subsidies for inefficient firms dependent on low-wage workers to keep them afloat. Blaming the workers is all too easy. The government that honours, invests in and rewards workers for their efforts will be the government that begins to rebuild Britain.

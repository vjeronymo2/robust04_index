			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Ibstock warns of Pounds 27m loss IBSTOCK JOHNSEN, Britain's third largest brick manufacturer warned yesterday that it expects to report a Pounds 27m pre-tax loss for 1992 after taking into account plant closure costs and other provisions. The company, which plans to close up to four of its nine UK brick plants, intends to reduce its final dividend to 0.5p making a total of just 1p, compared with 6p. In 1991 Ibstock made pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.6m on sales of Pounds 285m. The group's share price yesterday fell 2p to 47p. Mr Ian Maclellan, group managing director, said provisions for the period should be about Pounds 28m. All but Pounds 4m of this would be needed to cover the cost of the reorganisation of its UK brick business. The group was intending to close smaller works to concentrate production at larger more economic plants. About 200 jobs are expected to be lost by the end of this year as UK brick production capacity is gradually lowered from about 300m to about 250m bricks a year. Mr Maclellan said that the closures had been caused by the shrinking of the UK brick market due to the construction recession. Ibstock, despite the closures, expected to maintain its UK market share at about 8 per cent behind the market leaders, Hanson, which owns London Brick and Butterley, and Redland. As well as closing smaller plants the group is increasing capacity at its Laybrook plant in Sussex and its Atlas works near Aldridge in the West Midlands. After taking into account write-downs the debt to equity ratio would be less than 20 per cent, said Mr Maclellan. More than a fifth of British brick plants have closed since 1988 while manufacturing capacity of the industry has fallen by almost a quarter according to the Brick Development Association. Even so, the industry's potential capacity to make 3.7bn bricks a year continues to outstrip sales which last year fell to just 2.9bn bricks compared with more than 4.7bn in 1988. The number of workers employed by the industry since then has fallen from 14,000 to less than 9,000. Stocks of unsold bricks in December totalled 1.5bn, enough to build 150,000 homes and equivalent to 30 weeks supply to the construction industry. Mr Maclellan warned that the industry could expect another year of pain as stocks gradually were reduced. He said this ought to lead to a better year in 1994 provided the recent revival in the UK housing market was sustained.</p>

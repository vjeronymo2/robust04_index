			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / People: Accountant takes over as UK's biggest publican at Bass Taverns Bass, Britain's largest brewer, has decided to turn its Australian-born finance director into Britain's biggest publican. Philip Bowman, 41, is to take over as chairman of Bass Taverns which is responsible for its 4,200 pubs and 120 Toby restaurants. Bass is using the forthcoming retirement of Charles Darby, chairman of Bass Taverns and Bass Leisure, and Jimmy Angles, chief executive of Bass Taverns, to rejuvenate its increasingly elderly top management team. Apart from Bowman, right, who will combine the job of chairman and chief executive of Bass Taverns, Iain Napier, 45, is adding the job of chief executive of Bass Leisure to his current role as Bass's head of personnel. Napier will also join the Bass executive committee. Bowman, who joined the group in 1985 as finance director of Bass Leisure, takes charge of Bass's biggest profit centre at a critical time in the group's fortunes. Napier started his working life with publishers William Collins. Before joining Bass in 1989 he had stints with Whitbread and Ford. Whilst profits from brewing are expected to grow slowly over the next few years, the growth potential from the pub retailing side is considerable if the group can reposition itself. City analysts speculate that if Bowman makes a success of his new job he would be an obvious candidate to take over as chief executive if Ian Prosser, 50, were to split the role of chairman and chief executive. Bowman is far and away the youngest member of the board and his promotion comes 18 months after the sudden departure of Peter Sherlock, one of the rising stars on the Bass board. Sherlock, 48, is now chief executibe of NFC. There was some surprise yesterday that Bass had announced Bowman's move without naming his successor as finance director. However, analysts noted that David Nash, Grand Metropolitan's finance director, had also moved into an operational role before his replacement had been found.</p>

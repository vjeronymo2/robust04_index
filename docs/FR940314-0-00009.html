			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule contains provisions for grant funds to be used for the following purposes:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The establishment and/or operation of a revolving loan fund by REA Borrowers; and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Pass-through grants in conjunction with loans for: (a) Project feasibility studies and technical assistance for community development, business start-ups, business planning, and market research, (b) business incubators established by non-profit organizations, (c) community development assistance by non-profit organizations, (d) projects operated on a profit or non-profit basis that enhance the overall quality of medical care of rural residents, and (e) projects by profit or non-profit organizations which encourage the use of advanced telecommunications for educational and medical services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several conditions for grant making have been established under this program in order to maximize the benefits of the grant program, conserve the limited funds available, and provide for the efficient administration of grant making by REA:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. With the exception of the establishment and/or operation of a revolving loan program, grants will be made only in conjunction with rural development loans. For grants to REA Borrowers to establish revolving loan funds, REA Borrowers will be required to commit their funds in an amount no less than 20 percent of the REA grant. For all other projects eligible for loan and grant funding, that portion of project cost eligible for REA funding may be funded up to 20 percent with grant funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. As with zero-interest loans, all REA projects funded with grants will require a minimum of 20 percent supplemental funding for project costs. Supplemental funds may come from the project owner in the form of equity funds, private sources, state and local government sources, other Federal Government sources, the borrower, or other sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. For grants made in conjunction with zero-interest loans, grant funding will be provided only in sufficient amount necessary for a feasible project. A project which generates sufficient revenue to show feasibility without grant funds is not eligible for a grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. In determining the eligible amount of a grant, REA will base the appropriate amount of grant funding on a typical year of operation, when the project has generally reached its target income earning potential.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Grant funding will be channeled, to the extent practicable, to non-profit entities which have a broad impact on rural economies. However, grant funding will be available for project feasibility studies and technical assistance irrespective of entity status. Also, grant funding will be provided irrespective of entity status for enhancement of medical care and advanced telecommunications for educational and medical services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to grant making provisions, several changes have been made to the loan provisions of the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program. These changes, addressed in detail in the proposed rule published on October 12, 1993, are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Paragraph (d) of &sect;1703.21 has been revised to require Borrowers to deposit zero-interest loan funds into their construction accounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Paragraph (b) of &sect;1703.28 has been revised to eliminate the $400,000 limitation on the size of zero-interest loans and grants and set the maximum amount not to exceed 3 percent of the projected amount of zero-interest loan and grant funds available each year. However, the REA Administrator will retain the authority to limit funding below the 3 percent level, and a decision in this regard will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for each fiscal year. For fiscal year 1994, the REA Administrator has determined the maximum amount of a loan and grant to be $400,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) To provide REA Borrowers additional flexibility to fund worthwhile community development projects, paragraph (e) of &sect;1703.46 has been eliminated to remove the prohibition against funding recreational facilities unless they convincingly demonstrate that they would be an integral part of a tourism industry in their area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Paragraph (b) of &sect;1703.61 has been amended to clarify that the grant portion of the zero-interest loan and grant will be disbursed to the borrower only upon completion of the project. This will ensure that grant funds are handled so as to minimize the time between disbursement and authorized use to comply with USDA's Federal Assistance Uniform Regulation, 7 CFR parts 3015 and 3016. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Paragraph (b) of &sect;1703.66 has been revised to require the recipients of pass-through loans and grants to furnish a record of receipts showing total project costs to verify that no greater than 80 percent of project costs have been funded with REA zero-interest loan and grant funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Paragraph (e) of &sect;1703.66 has been revised to allow REA field accountants to provide a rural economic development review of zero-interest loans and grant funds. This revision will, in many cases, save REA Borrowers thousands of dollars by eliminating costs of formal audits which were previously required in accordance with the provisions of 7 CFR part 1773, ``REA Policy on Audits of Electric and Telephone Borrowers.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Paragraph (g) of &sect;1703.66 has been revised to clarify that for pass-through zero-interest loans and grants, REA Borrowers must require project owners to provide sufficient financial, accounting and budget information, and other records deemed necessary to facilitate audits in accordance with 7 CFR part 3015 and 7 CFR part 3016, as appropriate for non-profit entities, and REA rural economic development loan reviews for projects in a for-profit status. Likewise, paragraph (g) has been revised to require REA Borrowers receiving grants for establishment of revolving loan funds to furnish information to allow audits in accordance with USDA departmental grant regulations. Copies of these grant regulations are available to REA Borrowers by request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> REA received 24 comments regarding the proposed rule which were taken into consideration in preparing the final rule. Comments were received from the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Visions Five Group. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--The Democracy Party (DEP) and People's  Democracy Party (HADEP) have condemned the killings of three  pro-Kurdish businessmen Savas Buldan, Haci Koray and Adnan  Yildirim. The three men were found near Melen river in the  Yigilca township of Bolu province. They had been shot in the  back of the head. Police sources said the three had also been  tortured and were without identification papers when found.    "This is not an isolated incident. It is just a link in the  chain which started with the death of Vedat Aydin and continued  with the killing of Muhsin Melik, the founder of the People's  Democracy Party," HADEP Chairman Murat Bozlak said Monday [6  June]. "The government is under an obligation to find the  murderers, especially since it was reported to officials that  the three men had gone missing," he added. "The state is under  suspicion until it finds those responsible."    Buldan and his two companions were allegedly taken into  custody by a group of policemen outside Istanbul's Cinar Hotel.  The persons who apprehended them reportedly showed their police  identification cards and then took the three men away in  unmarked cars, according to the personnel of the Cinar Hotel who  witnessed the incident.    DEP Acting Chairman Remzi Kartal, meanwhile, appealed to  President Suleyman Demirel "to find those who are responsible  for the killings."    "The government, the Parliament and the media are  insensitive. We do not have anywhere to turn," Kartal said.</p>

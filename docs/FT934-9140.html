			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Euro Disney shares fall further 15% SHARES IN Euro Disney plunged further yesterday, losing more than 15 per cent of their value on the London stock market as investors displayed increasing anxiety about the crisis at the theme-park operator. Yesterday's falls followed a similar decline on Wednesday when the company announced it had lost FFr5.3bn (Pounds 610m) in its first full year of operation. The losses, largely the result of exceptional charges, raised fears that the EuroDisneyland theme park in the eastern outskirts of Paris would be unable to survive without a refinancing deal with its shareholders and banks. The continued decline in the share price, which closed yesterday down 68p at 368p, will complicate plans for a rights issue, regarded as one of the most plausible options in a capital restructuring. 'At the current share price they would need something like a one-for-one issue to raise the necessary funds,' said Mrs Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, hotels and leisure analyst at Morgan Stanley. Moody's Investors Service, the credit information agency, said it had placed the long-term debt ratings of Walt Disney, the US entertainment group which owns 49 per cent of the European leisure company, under review for a possible downgrade. It said this was prompted by concern that the acceleration of losses at Euro Disney could result in deterioration of debt protection measurements for Walt Disney bondholders. Moody's currently rates Disney's senior unsecured notes at Aa3. Moody's said Walt Disney might inject significant extra funds into Euro Disney to preserve its image and trademark, which could result in an increase in the company's overall risk profile. Financial restructuring talks are under way between Euro Disney, its bankers, and Walt Disney. The talks may be a test of nerve as Euro Disney's bankers press Walt Disney to inject fresh capital into Euro Disney in return for subscribing to a share issue or renegotiating the terms of their loans. About 60 banks are owed some FFr21bn by Euro Disney. The biggest lenders are French, including the Caisse des Depots, the state investment institution, Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Indosuez. Also involved in arranging Euro Disney's syndicated loans are Citibank, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and LTCB of Japan. Three UK banks, National Westminster, Barclays and Midland, also participated in loans. Bankers are expected to press for a reduction in royalty and management fees paid to Walt Disney by Euro Disney, as well as a reduction in interest payments on the FFr4.8bn loan extended by the Caisse des Depots. The banks are likely to prefer an injection of new equity next spring - by which time the restructuring is due to be complete - rather than a debt for equity swap. Despite their concern that Walt Disney should play a significant part in the capital restructuring, the French banks will face political pressure to ensure that EuroDisneyland remains open. Walt Disney has agreed to provide funds for Euro Disney until next spring. It is reluctant to bail out its associate, but is concerned to avoid the damage to its image that would result from failure. Industry observers doubt that the theme park will close. 'The negotiations will go to the wire, but closure is not likely,' said Mrs Winnington-Ingram. The Paris market, where the shares are mainly traded, was closed yesterday. On the New York Stock Exchange, Walt Disney shares dipped Dollars 7/8 to close at Dollars 40 1/4.

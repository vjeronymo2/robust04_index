			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with former south Yemeni President 'Ali </F> Nasir Muhammad, in Damascus, by Shadiyah Riyad, in Cairo, "a  short time ago" -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Riyad] Mr. 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, former south  Yemeni president, on the fourth anniversary of the Yemeni union,  the Yemeni brothers are going through a bitter conflict and  fierce battles during which each side is trying to destroy the  other. Why did they unite and then fight each other and  separate?    [Muhammad] First, I wish to congratulate the fraternal  Egyptian people, our Yemeni people, and the people of our Arab  and Islamic nation on the blessed 'Id al-Adha. It pains me that  this celebration should come amid secession and domestic strife  in Yemen. It is true that the union is four years old. On this  glorious occasion we were supposed to offer achievements to the  Yemeni people, who made sacrifices for the sake of unity,  instead of giving them this separation and infighting. [passage  omitted]    Obviously, some mistakes were made during the union  experience. When the union was established power was shared by  two parties. Later during the transitional period, agreed upon  in 1990, power was shared by three parties in contradiction to  the united country's Constitution. Furthermore, no attention  was paid to the public's concerns, affairs, and aspirations.  The people pinned high hopes on the union, which was expected  to end a painful chapter, and to attain their great aims of  development and prosperity. No attention was paid to the  people's quality of life, security, stability, and economic  development. No efforts were made to enhance the unified  country's status. No attention was paid to the question of  security, stability, and national unity. No attention was paid  to the issue of regional security and stability.    Naturally, I cautioned against such negative attitudes and  errors from the start. I alerted Yemen's political leaders to  this fact and the serious consequences and dangers of the  negative attitudes and errors made during the transitional  period and afterward. These errors should have been avoided by  drawing up a strategic plan of what the unified state wished to  accomplish. I stressed more than once that the unified state  must have a strategic perspective of the country's future.    Late last year I warned of the danger of domestic strife and  separatism unless institutions and commands were unified. I  urged that an understanding be reached among the political  leaders and between the leaders of the General People's Congress  and the Yemeni Socialist Party. No attention was paid to this  and the leadership was divided between Sanaa and Aden. The two  sides subsequently engaged in media campaigns. This media  escalation--added to other conflicts, quarrels, and  assassinations--finally caused the situation to erupt. [passage  omitted]</p>

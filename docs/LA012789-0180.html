			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ROYALS' FARR WINS $400,000 RAISE  </P> <P> Right-hander Steve Farr, who saved 20 games for the Kansas City Royals last  season, has agreed to a one-year contract raising his pay almost $400,000.  </P> <P> The agreement on a $605,000 contract Thursday kept the matter from going to  arbitration and anointed Farr as the team's closer out of the bullpen.  </P> <P> He had struggled the last five weeks of the season, when he had a 4.91  earned-run average in his final 14 games. As a result, the Royals had been  shopping around for another bullpen ace.  </P> <P> But General Manager John Schuerholz now says he's satisfied that Farr can do  the job.  </P> <P> "We're saying that Steve Farr is our stopper," Schuerholz said. "He's our guy  to save games for us. If Steve can give us a year like he had last year, and  some guys come through, I think we'll get the job done."  </P> <P> Farr, 32, who was on the verge of being let go two years ago, became the closer  after the faltering veterans Dan Quisenberry and Gene Garber were released July  4.  </P></p>

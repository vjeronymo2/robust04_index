			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 20 February, a small increase in radioactivity  was recorded by the Ignalina nuclear power station permanent  control system in one of the unmanned hermetically sealed  compartments of the second reactor.    This has been reported to ELTA by Viktor Shevaldin, director  general of the Ignalina nuclear power station, today.    After additional investigation, a conclusion was made that  radioactivity could have increased because of the leak of gas,  which is used to pull the turbines, into this compartment.  Although the rate of the gas leak was much lower than that  permitted by the exploitation procedure, the administration of  the station, however, decided to shut down the second power unit  in order to be able to carry out a detailed inspection of the  compartment and to eliminate the cause of the leak.    The unit is to be under maintenance from 25 February until 6  March, Shevaldin said. The head of the power station also  informed that the increase of radioactivity in the unmanned  compartment of the second block did not have any influence  either on the power station or on the radioactive background of  the environment.</p>

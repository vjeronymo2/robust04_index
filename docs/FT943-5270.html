			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): Focus on margins in BTR interim figures - Other companies The industrial conglomerate will provide one of the most important indicators of the capital goods sector when it reports interim results on Thursday. Analysts are expecting a double-digit increase in pre-tax profits, excluding gains on disposals, to Pounds 660m-Pounds 670m and a 10 per cent rise in the dividend. Most attention will focus on the group's margins, following concern that manufacturers will find it difficult to pass on the rising cost of raw materials to their customers.</p>

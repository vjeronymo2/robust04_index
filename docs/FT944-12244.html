			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BP up 23% to Pounds 415m on higher volumes British Petroleum reported a 23 per cent increase in third quarter replacement cost profits to Pounds 415m, with continued cost-cutting being boosted by rising sales volumes, taking the figure for the nine months to September 30 to Pounds 1.06bn. Mr David Simon, chief executive, said it was the best quarterly performance since the first quarter of 1991, when crude oil prices were considerably higher than the current range of Dollars 16-Dollars 17 a barrel for the benchmark Brent Blend. The shares, however, closed 9p down at 426p. Third quarter earnings per share rose to 7.6p, compared with 6.1p in the second quarter and 6.2p a year ago. But the quarterly dividend of 2.5p remains unchanged. Mr Simon said the results, which were above most analysts' expectations, were 'pretty encouraging'. The dividend policy would be 're-considered at the end of the fourth quarter on the basis of the full-year performance'. Healthy net cash inflows from operating activities of Pounds 1.17bn for the quarter and disposal proceeds of Dollars 581m (Pounds 368m) enabled the company to cut its debt by Dollars 675m to Dollars 10.4bn at the end of the quarter, according to Mr Steve Ahearne, finance director. Debt has been cut by about Dollars 6bn since its peak in 1992. Gearing fell to 60 per cent, against 70 per cent at the half-way stage. The company is not aiming at a gearing target, according to Mr Simon, but it still wants to see debt below the Dollars 10bn level set in 1992. The sale of BP Nutrition earlier this year marked the end of the company's big disposal programme of non-energy assets. The sale of some minor assets should result in proceeds for the full year of about Dollars 1.25bn, Mr Ahearne said.</p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> GROUP'S POLL SHOWS OPPOSITION TO TAYLOR RANCH CAMPUS;  </P> <P> OPINION: A NON-SCIENTIFIC SURVEY BY FOES OF THE PROPOSED CAL STATE UNIVERSITY  SITE FINDS 48% OF VENTURA RESIDENTS FAVOR ANOTHER LOCATION.  </P> <P> As part of a campaign to block plans by Cal State University to build a new  campus just outside Ventura, a group opposed to the controversial Taylor Ranch  site announced Friday that a telephone poll of 4,100 residents shows strong  support for building the campus somewhere else in the county.  </P> <P> Steve Bennett, a spokesman for a group called Voters for Alternate Sites,  conceded that the telephone poll of Ventura residents conducted by his group  was not a scientific sampling of community sentiment. But he said he believes  it reflects the feelings of Ventura residents on the Taylor Ranch issue.  </P> <P> According to Bennett, who was one of the leaders of the Alliance for Ventura's  Future that helped elect three new slow-growth members to the Ventura City  Council last year, the telephone poll showed that 48% of Ventura city residents  oppose a university at Taylor Ranch.  </P> <P> Of the 4,100 people contacted, 30% favored the site and 22% expressed no  opinion, Bennett said. He said he plans to use the poll results to encourage  Ventura City Council members to play a strong role in an environmental review  reporting process now under way for a new Cal State site.  </P> <P> Although Bennett called his telephone survey significant, the survey was  dismissed by Cal State Vice Chancellor Jack Smart, who said there was  insufficient information on how the survey was conducted and who did the  telephone interviews. Smart noted that the survey conflicted with a poll  conducted by The Times earlier this year on the same subject.  </P> <P> "I have no comment on this poll, nor do I know how it was conducted nor much  about the people who conducted it," Smart said. "We think the poll that was in  the Los Angeles Times, a scientific poll as I understand it, is a good  reflection of public opinion."  </P> <P> The Times poll, which surveyed 818 county residents in January, found that 54%  of those polled throughout the county supported the Taylor Ranch site. The poll  was statistically significant with a margin of error of five percentage points.  </P> <P> Of the 818 people surveyed in the Times poll, 197 were residents of the city of  Ventura. In that group, 51% favored a university at Taylor Ranch, 41% voiced  opposition and 8% had no opinion. The margin of error among Ventura city  residents was seven percentage points.  </P> <P> In the telephone survey conducted by the Voters for Alternate Sites, according  to Bennett, members of his group identified themselves by name and then made  the following statement:  </P> <P> "I'm calling as part of a survey to find out if you prefer putting the new CSU  campus at Taylor Ranch or if you prefer finding another site in the county."  </P> <P> The telephone survey was conducted between March 3 and March 25 by 75  volunteers from Voters For Alternate Sites, which Bennett described as a group  of 100 people with no connection to the Alliance for Ventura's Future or  Patagonia Inc., the Ventura company that has played a leading role in opposing  the Taylor Ranch site.  </P> <P> Bennett said the volunteers worked from a list of about 15,000 Ventura city  residents who voted in the 1987 municipal or 1988 general elections. The  Alliance for Ventura's Future used a similar list during last year's election,  but Bennett said his new group paid $175 for its own list to avoid being linked  to the alliance.  </P> <P> The Taylor Ranch opponents will continue to poll Ventura residents, Bennett  said. But he added that he does not know whether the group will survey all  15,000 voters on its voter list.  </P> <P> Although Bennett conceded that his telephone survey is not considered  scientific or statistically accurate because it was not conducted according to  prescribed procedures of professional pollsters, he stressed his belief in the  results.  </P> <P> "We think this clearly contradicts the proponents of Taylor Ranch who claim  that the majority of this city is in favor of that site," he said.  </P> <P> The director of the Los Angeles Times Poll, I.A. Lewis, said there is no way to  determine the margin of error or degree of accuracy in a non-scientific poll.  In addition, he said, there can be biases in the lists from which volunteers  make their calls or in the manner in which questions are asked.  </P> <P> "Just by the way you talk and ask a question, you can force an answer if you  have an opinion as the questioner," Lewis said.  </P> <P> Bennett, who helped organize the Alliance for Ventura's Future, said there is  no connection between the two groups. He said the Alternate Site group receives  no funding from Patagonia and includes only three or four members who also  participate in the alliance.  </P> <P> Patagonia, which spent about $15,000 during last year's election for political  mailings and advertising that opposed the Taylor Ranch site, would likely  contribute to Bennett's group if it were asked for a donation, company  spokesman Kevin Sweeney said.  </P> <P> Sweeney said that no such request has been received and that Patagonia is  deliberately keeping its distance from the Alternate Site group to avoid the  appearance that it controls the group. He said, however, that the group does  meet at Patagonia's corporate headquarters.  </P> <P> Gary Tuttle, a Ventura councilman who has been among the most outspoken  opponents of the Taylor Ranch site, said Friday that the results of the  telephone survey were predictable.  </P> <P> "I knew for a fact the residents of this city did not support a university at  Taylor Ranch because I knocked on that many doors when I was running for  council," he said of the 4,100 voters called.  </P> <P> Bennett's group has called for the Ventura City Council to adopt a resolution  seeking an official role in the environmental-impact review writing process,  which would include evaluating other potential sites for a new campus. Tuttle  said he expects that resolution to come before the City Council on April 9.  </P> <P> But both Tuttle's opposition to Taylor Ranch and the telephone survey by the  Alternate Site group drew an angry reaction Friday from Councilman Jim Monahan,  who supports a new campus at Taylor Ranch.  </P> <P> "Where were these Alternate Site people five years ago when we looked at 27  sites?" Monahan asked. "The Cal State people have already spent too much money.  It's the people of Ventura who are going to lose."  </P> <P> Monahan said he would not support a resolution to ask for an official city role  in overseeing the environmental-impact report process.  </P> <P> "I don't think that's appropriate," he said. "We don't do that for anyone else.  I think Mr. Tuttle is just inexperienced and he just doesn't understand the  system, the process of city government."  </P> <P> Cal State officials said the telephone survey's results do not affect plans by  the university system to move ahead with the environmental-impact report on the  Taylor Ranch campus, which would ultimately serve from 12,000 to 15,000  students when it reaches capacity in 30 years.  </P> <P> In addition, Smart said, a new countywide advisory committee that is now being  formed to oversee the environmental review process will negate the need for a  direct role by the City Council. Letters of invitation to join the committee  are to be sent out next week, he said.  </P> <P> Representatives from all 10 cities in the county, the county itself, opposition  leaders and proponents will be invited to sit on the committee, Smart said.  </P> <P> "If it isn't just another booster club, I think that will be a step in the  right direction," Tuttle said of the proposed advisory committee.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Brasilia -- Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, the PT  [Workers Party] presidential candidate, is planning to make this  year a campaign that will be quite similar to that of 1989. As  in 1989, his vice presidential candidate will again be Jose  Paulo Bisol, a senator for the PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party]  from Rio Grande do Sul. His campaign jingle in electoral  rallies and television programs will again be "Lula-la,"  although this time its backdrop will consist of rock and samba  music and sheer fun. The alliance that is now proposing Lula's  candidacy is the Brazilian Front of Citizens [Frente Brasil da  Cidadania], which will be only slightly different from the 1989  coalition. This front will include the People's Socialist Party  and the PSTU [United Social Workers Party] and will exclude the  Vanguard Party. There will be just a slight change in the PT  strategy: The 1989 slogan No Fear of Happiness will be replaced  by a new one: It Was Worth the Wait.    Lula has already picked his vice president, whose name will  not be announced until May. Yesterday, Lula and Bisol had  breakfast together and decided the ticket. Addressing Bisol,  Lula said: "As far as the PT is concerned, you will be my vice  president. It is now up to the PSB to decide. The PSB will  formally nominate Bisol on 9 May as soon as it concludes  consultations with the PSB grassroots. PSB branches of 17  states have already endorsed Bisol, except for the one in Minas  Gerais, which would like to nominate Belo Horizonte Deputy Mayor  Celio de Castro. [passage omitted]</p>

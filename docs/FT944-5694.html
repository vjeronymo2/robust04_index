			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Mawhinney warned of gridlock at London's airports A powerful group of aviation, business and tourism bodies today urged Mr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, to increase capacity at airports in the London area before the region reaches 'gridlock'. Demand at airports in the south-east will exceed the capacity of existing and proposed airport development early in the next century, according to a letter sent to Mr Mawhinney yesterday. The letter is the most co-ordinated attempt by organisations lobbying for increased capacity and comes shortly before the government joins the debate over a recent Department of Transport working group report, Runway Capacity to Serve the South East (Rucatse). The letter is from the chairman and other senior executives of the British Air Transport Association, the Chartered Institute of Transport, the Air Transport Users Council, the Confederation of British Industry, the British Chambers of Commerce, the London Chamber of Commerce, the British American Chamber of Commerce and the Association of British Travel Agents. It warns that traffic lost to the UK will be to the gain of 'our near European neighbours,' such as Charles de Gaulle in Paris, or Schipol in Amsterdam. The letter counsels the government to assess the economic consequences of failing to meet future demand, especially the loss of potential inward investment and tourism revenues. It says the government should consider alternatives to Rucatse. The Rucatse report argued that more use could be made of existing airport capacity in the south-east than had been assumed. Greater use of regional airports would delay the need for expansion in London. The options, according to the letter, would include 'complementary facilities' - which are understood to mean satellite feeder airports close to Gatwick or Heathrow - and 'close parallel runways', meaning second runways next to existing ones. The Bata said figures last month from BAA, the airports operator, showed passenger numbers up 7 per cent at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted in the first nine months of 1994, compared with a year ago. The association said the figures were higher than earlier BAA and Department of Transport projections which had suggested that London's airports would be able to accommodate demand until 2015.</p>

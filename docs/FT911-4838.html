			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Gorbachev to reduce Far East forces THE SOVIET military presence in the Asia-Pacific region is to be cut, President Mikhail Gorbachev will tell the Japanese parliament today. He will also call for a five-nation Pacific conference on security and co-operation and a zone of co-operation in north-east Asia, around the rim of the Sea of Japan. The call is aimed particularly at the US, which has military bases in the Pacific, including Subic Bay in the Philippines and Okinawa in Japan. Moscow has been reducing its forces on the Chinese border and lowering its presence in the area but maintains naval bases in the Pacific and Indian Ocean area. The principal base for its Pacific fleet of surface ships, submarines and aircraft is at Vladivostok. Its other bases are at Petropavlovsk, Magadan and Sovetskaya Gavan in the Soviet Far East. The Soviet navy also has repair and other facilities at Cam Ranh bay, the former US base in Vietnam. Mr Gorbachev's move is set in the context of a proposal, which he has previously foreshadowed, for a conference in 1993 of the foreign ministers of China, India, Japan, the Soviet Union and the US as a first step towards creating an organisation of multilateral consultations on security and economic co-operation. Neither Japan nor the US is likely to see the proposals as substantial unless agreement is also reached on the future ownership of the disputed Kurile islands, which has plagued relations between Tokyo and Moscow. The US supports Japan's claim to the four islands, seized by the Soviet Union in 1945. Parts of the speech echo earlier calls for detente in Asia by Mr Gorbachev during past visits to the Soviet Far East. The US and Japan and other Asian countries were disappointed then that his remarks were not followed by decisive Soviet military cuts. The burden of Mr Gorbachev's speech, parts of which were leaked to Japanese media last night, was confirmed by a spokesman for the Soviet delegation in Tokyo. The speech, to parliamentarians in the Japanese diet, will come during a second day of talks with Mr Toshiki Kaifu, Japan's prime minister. Bluer skies ahead, Page 2 Foreign Affairs, Page 15</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / The Markets: Oil becomes a security risk barometer - Global Investor Markets are notoriously bad at assessing political or security risks. Nor is it easy for investors to know just how far markets are discounting such risks in advance. Yet the questions cannot be sidestepped. Would the dollar now be substantially lower and US bond yields higher without the row over North Korea's nuclear intentions? How far do recent rises in commodity prices reflect concern over global flashpoints? And to what extent are the more mundane political worries of the developed world exerting upward pressure on global bond yields? It is hard to believe that the dollar can be playing much of a safe haven role when east Asian markets have resolutely failed to panic. Even in South Korea share price declines have been less than catastrophic, given the nature of the threat. And there are more fundamental questions, anyway, about what constitutes a safe haven in today's circumstances. If the threat from rogue nuclear powers in the third world is one of global incineration, there is not much point in markets seeking to discount it. But for the outward-bound survivalists who persist in packing shotguns and baked beans, the currencies of the remoter reaches of the southern hemisphere would seem a better bet than the dollar. If, on the other hand, the threat is one of destabilising regional conflict, the economic consequences may not be wholly adverse. It was, after all, the Korean War which set Japan on the path to its economic miracle. As for commodities, the traditional bolt hole, gold, has not been notably buoyant. But is it really a safe haven any more? In a high-technology world where financial transaction costs have collapsed, it is much easier to transfer financial balances from one end of the globe to the other at the press of a button than to shift bars of gold. The barbaric metal, as Keynes called it, may be a hedge against political or inflationary risk in third world countries with under-developed financial markets. Yet the market which nowadays seems a more plausible barometer of security risk is oil. The threat of conflict in Korea could be expected to lead to precautionary stockbuilding. And now that there is a fully developed market in oil, complete with derivatives trading and the rest, hedge funds can add financial leverage to the equation. Sure enough, the oil price was rising strongly last week. It may not be quite the same as a safe haven, but it clearly struck some speculators, as well as cash buyers, as a safe bet. But where stock markets are concerned, past history suggests that investors prefer to address global flashpoints when the bad news actually occurs. TECTONICS That is not to say that shifts in the global and regional political balance are unimportant. Usually they are reflection of longer run changes in underlying economic strength. And a further lesson from history is that when a hegemonic power goes into political and economic decline, and is forced to cede its role to another leading actor, the transition can be associated with volcanic upheavals in markets. Between the wars, when the US turned isolationist and was reluctant to see the dollar take over sterling's role in the global system, international capital flows were subject to interruption, trade friction turned into rampant protectionism, stock markets crashed and currencies were prone to sustained misalignment. In the 1980s and 1990s the transition is more complicated. To the extent that the US is passing its economic mantle, it is not to a single hegemonic power but to more than one country, with the developed world's only big creditor, Japan, reluctant to be primus inter pares. We also have the additional hazard that the relatively stable bipolar nuclear world has given way to a more fluid and less easily defined political order. It is not surprising then that over the past two decades or more, when the Japanese have given in to US pressure to support the dollar, the world has once again seen constant interruptions to capital flows, growing resort to bilateralism in US-Japanese trade relations and a Japanese version of the 1929 Wall Street Crash. One lesson is that when the global system is coping with huge adjustments in the balance of power, currency markets need to be free to act as an escape valve for the pressure. The collapse of the Bretton Woods system was, after all, a symptom of what the historian Paul Kennedy identified as imperial over-reach in the US. The point applies with equal force to regional power shifts, such as German reunification. At times like this, the tectonic plates are not prone to obey the dictates of fixed exchange rate systems. SOUTHERN DISCOMFORT In contrast, bond markets this year have not only failed to act as an escape valve, but have added to political risk, at least in the short run. Take Italy, where the yield on 10-year benchmark bonds have topped 10 per cent. The resulting high real interest rates savagely impair the Berlusconi government's ability to stabilise a huge inherited public sector debt stock. Spain, whose bond yields have also topped 10 per cent, faces a comparable bind. Yet these are countries with a dismal record in managing their public finances. The Italian administration consists of a motley collection of politicians, short on experience; the Spanish government is discredited by scandal and corruption. If the effect is to stiffen the sinews of the politicians and force them to confront the need to raise taxes and cut expenditure, the longer run impact will prove benign. The alternative - a prolonged bond market strike and hyper-inflation - is not a recipe for stabilising anything.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 2/6/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    % change over period                     US     Japan     Germany    France   Italy    UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash Week              0.08      0.04      0.10       0.11     0.15    0.09 Month             0.36      0.18      0.44       0.48     0.64    0.42 Year              3.63      3.22      6.69       6.50     9.88    5.88  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year Week             -0.20      0.04     -0.53      -0.90    -2.04   -0.36 Month             0.82     -0.61     -1.89      -2.31    -3.68   -1.30 Year              0.65      5.94      5.68       3.99    11.56    3.66  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year Week             -0.47     0.219     -1.22      -2.14    -4.10   -1.00 Month             0.79     -1.59     -3.45      -4.82    -7.51   -3.00 Year             -0.93      7.21      2.97       1.13    11.52    2.16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities Week               0.9      -0.8      -3.3       -4.2     -7.7    -0.2 Month              4.3       3.7      -9.4      -10.4    -12.4    -2.9 Year               6.0       8.2      20.6        8.8     36.5     9.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

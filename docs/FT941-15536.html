			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Arts: Into the mind of Modigliani - William Packer admires the collection of largely unknown drawings at the Royal Academy The life of Modigliani too often gets in the way of the work, especially a life so tragically romantic as his - the doomed, dissolute, handsome artist, unrecognised by the world and dead too soon. What his drawings tell us, however, is that whatever else he was or did, he kept a clear creative intelligence, responding critically to all that he saw about him and resolving it into something unmistakably his own. Last year, at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice, more than 400 drawings by Modigliani went on public show for the first time. It was certainly the exhibition of the year, if not the decade. Paul Alexandre was Modigliani's doctor first, then his friend. From the time of the artist's arrival in Paris in 1906, at the age of 22, until his own departure for the war in 1914, Dr Alexandre acquired every drawing by Modigliani that he could lay hands on. The two men never met again and Modigliani died of TB in the January of 1920. Dr Alexandre lived on until 1968, ever cherishing the intention of publishing his collection along with a memoir of his relationship with Modigliani. It has fallen to his son, Noel, to realise, at last, the paternal ambition. The scope of the collection is the surprise and revelation, more than doubling as it does the published canon of the artist's graphic oeuvre, and transforms our understanding of his work overall. The Alexandre collection now comes to London not in its entirety, but in a selection, made by Mary Anne Stevens of the Royal Academy, of some 240 drawings. This substantial reduction is both welcome and regrettable. Drawing is a special and often recondite study and those 400 sheets and more of Modigliani, the mass of them insistently repetitive, were quite enough to daunt even the most committed of connoisseurs. While requiring still the closest critical attention, what seemed in Venice perhaps too severe and exhausting an exercise, should be, in London, so much more readily accessible to a general audience. At 240 or so, nothing of the scope of the collection has been sacrificed; and yet that insistent, testing repetition was, for me at least, rather the point. Swings and roundabouts I suppose. The signal importance of the collection lies in what it tells us, in intimate detail, of Modigliani's development in his work from the first flowering of his talent to the period of its full maturity. It is a period marked by what once seemed abrupt shifts and transitions, in practice as in interest: from painting to sculpture and back to painting; from the direct observation of the figure to an extreme stylisation, based on tribal and classical examples, and back again. What we are now able to see and realise  -and I must emphasise that we may do so just as well in Dr Stevens' selection as in the full feast - is that those transitions were not abrupt at all, but natural, consistent and inevitable, the work all of a piece. Here is the young man, looking now at Lautrec, now at the more decorative expressionism of the Secession, now at the harder expressionism of the Germans, now at the symbolism of early Picasso, with his clowns and saltimbanques. But then the image of the figure is sharpened and simplified into something more sculptural. The form may place him close to Brancusi, but yet these kneeling caryatids with their swayed hips and shoulders, for all that they carry the world on their shoulders, are clearly drawn not by invention but from the model in the studio. Even the severest of the busts, the most rigid of the standing figures, carry with them the sense not of the remote and abstracted image, carved in stone, but of the living model, flesh and blood. And so it is that the reversion back to painting, to the portraits and the spectacular late reclining nudes, done long after Dr Alexandre had gone off to the War, come as no surprise at all. It is rather those sculptural qualities, there all the time, that are now the surprise. The line dances down the contour, with the merest inflexion this way or that. The touch is by turns light, heavy, simple, subtle, crude - so deceptively crude. There it is, conjured out of the barest outline, the palpable human presence in all its weight and volume and living movement. Wonderful. The Unknown Modigliani: Royal Academy of Arts, Piccadilly W1, until April 4. Then on to Cologne, Bruges, Tokyo, Mexico, Luxembourg, Montreal, New York, Madrid and Rouen; sponsored in London by Glaxo and The Guardian.</p>

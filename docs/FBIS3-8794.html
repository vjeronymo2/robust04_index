			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian </F> Democratic Movement, by Jana Patsch in Bratislava; date not  given: "Government of Experts"]    [Text] [Patsch] What will the government be like?    [Carnogursky] It will be a government of experts. No single  party chairman is among them. For example, the new foreign  minister has experience as a UN ambassador, and the new finance  minister is a banking expert.    [Patsch] Will the alliance of the opposition, which has been  so much at variance so far, hold?    [Carnogursky] There are, of course, different views within  the government. But all know what is at stake. We have a joint  objective....    [Patsch] ...the elimination of Meciar?    [Carnogursky] Above all, the future of our country.  Moreover, I believe that it might work better than many assume.  Peter Weiss (chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left--SDL)  is a man with whom one can have a reasonable talk. At any rate,  I am optimistic.    [Patsch] How can early new elections be pushed through?    [Carnogursky] This is difficult because the Constitution  does not provide for it. Basically, we are sticking to our  point of view: new elections in September or October. We would  need a three-fifths' majority for it. If Meciar rejects our  proposal, we have to look for another way. It would be  conceivable to ask the president to open the road to new  elections by a referendum. It should contain only one question:  early elections--yes or no?    [Patsch] A referendum has already been initiated by  Meciar....    [Carnogursky] ... which does not meet the requirements.  Signatures turn up two and three times. There are names on the  list that are not registered anywhere.</p>

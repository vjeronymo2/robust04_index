			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / FT guide to the week 19 MONDAY Biological weapons treaty Government representatives meet in Geneva (to Sep 30) to discuss ways of checking compliance with the United Nations' treaty outlawing biological weapons. The 131-member treaty currently has no system to guard against cheating. The Italian government of Silvio Berlusconi meets union leaders to discuss pension reform. Mr Berlusconi last week postponed a showdown with the powerful trades union movement over proposed cuts in the generous state scheme. Cutting pension benefits is an essential element in the right-wing coalition's plans to reduce public spending in the 1995 budget. Angry trades unionists have carried out several protest stoppages, including one at Fiat's Mirafiori plant in Turin. European Union economics and finance ministers meet in Brussels after the summer recess to resume discussions on excessive deficits in member states, convergence programmes, and the white paper on growth, competitiveness and employment. A two-day agriculture council meeting also starts today. Ministers will focus on reform of the wine sector, the future of union policy on fruit and vegetables, and protection of animals transported live. John Major, UK prime minister, leaves Jeddah for Abu Dhabi and then South Africa after talks with Saudi Arabia's King Fahd on Middle East issues and arms deals. Mr Major arrives in South Africa on Tuesday for the first official visit by a British prime minister since Harold Macmillan's 'wind of change' speech in 1960. Mr Major (left) will see President Mandela and other political leaders, and address an informal joint session of parliament. Behind the scenes, talks will focus on trade, aid, and British participation in the republic's fledgling privatisation programme. Art market: The most important blue diamond ever offered at auction, estimated to fetch Dollars 8m, goes on exhibition at The Regent, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Sotheby's, along with rivals Christie's, sees the greatest potential for art market growth in South East Asia, and for the first time is taking to Malaysia some of the jewels it is selling in New York on October 17 and 18, in the hope of attracting bids. Holidays: Chile (Armed Forces Day), Israel (Eve of Sukkot), South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan (Moon Festival). 20 TUESDAY Japan announces tax cuts Japan's ruling coalition is to publish a draft tax reform bill, including one-off and permanent income tax cuts. The finance ministry wants a rise in sales tax to fund the hand-outs. But the draft bill may be vague on that controversial subject, because of strong objections by prime minister Tomiichi Murayama's Social Democratic Party. The United Nations begins its 49th General Assembly in New York. Pollution: Budapest hosts an international conference on environmental contamination in central and eastern Europe (to Sep 23). The 300 delegates include representatives of Nato and the US Environmental Protection Agency. They will assess the region and discuss how to measure and reduce air, soil and water contamination. Irish prime minister Albert Reynolds arrives in Canberra, and will brief Paul Keating, his Australian counterpart, on the Northern Ireland peace process. More than a third of Australians claim Irish ancestry - including the prime minister himself - although the demographics are changing with higher levels of Asian immigration. UK economy: Market expectations for August growth of M4, the broad measure of the money supply, are still subdued. Moderate M4 lending, expected to come in at a seasonally adjusted Pounds 2.2bn, would give a 0.4 per cent rise on the previous month, leaving the annual growth rate at 4.8 per cent, towards the bottom of the government's 3 per cent to 9 per cent monitoring range. Chess: The Professional Chess Association world championship semi-finals holds its opening ceremony at Linares, Spain (to Oct 6). Britons Nigel Short and Michael Adams play Gata Kamsky of the US, and the speedy Indian, Vishy Anand, respectively. The incentive for success in the 10-game matches is another multi-million-pound challenge to Gary Kasparov. Play starts on Wednesday. Headmasters' conference: Heads of the UK's most prestigious independent mixed and boys schools gather in Bournemouth. In a departure from normal practice, no education minister will address the meeting, but delegates intend to use the three-day conference to finalise an ambitious plan for reforming A-level and GCSE exams. Holidays: Israel (Sukkot), South Korea, Taiwan (Moon Festival). 21 WEDNESDAY Danish general election Denmark holds a general election. The four-party centre-left coalition headed by Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Social Democratic Party leader, will almost certainly lose its one-seat majority. His main opponent, Liberal Party leader Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, hopes for victory, but the odds are on a minority government under Rasmussen. France's budget for 1995, due to be announced today, is expected to be austere. Edouard Balladur's centre-right government intends to cut the deficit from FFr301bn (Dollars 56bn) this year to FFr275bn, largely by a clampdown on public spending and higher taxes on petrol and local businesses. Indonesian trial: Muchtar Pakpahan, the chairman of the largest independent trade union, SBSI, is due to stand trial in the north Sumatran town of Medan for his involvement in the Medan workers' riots in April. He also faces charges for trying to organise a nation-wide strike in February this year in protest at Indonesian workers' conditions. Portugal's parliament is due to debate constitutional revision, focusing on electoral law and presidential powers, and on adapting the constitution to the process of European integration. Any changes require a two-thirds majority and thus consensus between the centre-right governing party and the opposition Socialists. Scottish Nationalist conference: The party, which fights for Scotland's independence and is led by Alex Salmond MP (left), begins its annual conference in Inverness (to Sep 24). It took a record 32.6 per cent of the Scottish vote in June's European elections and gained a second seat at Strasbourg. UK economy: August's non-EU trade balance will be scrutinised for continuing signs of improvement. Exporters' expectations are rising, while the slowdown in consumer spending indicated by last week's retail sales figures should pinch imports. If, as expected, the trade deficit is about Pounds 500m, the average for the past three months will be lower than the Pounds 595m average for the previous three. Alzheimer's Disease: The 10th international conference on senile dementia opens in Edinburgh on the first World Alzheimer's Day (to Sep 23). FT Surveys: International Equities and Logistics. Holidays: Hong Kong, Israel (Week of Sukkot), Malta (Independence Day), South Korea. 22 THURSDAY Uruguay ratification urged Members of the preparatory committee for the World Trade Organisation, meeting in Geneva, are expected to criticise the US, the European Union and Japan for dragging their heels on ratifying the Uruguay Round trade accords. These include establishment of the WTO itself, and are supposed to come into force next January. Telecommunications ministers from 50 countries meet in Kyoto, Japan, to discuss creating a global information network using optical fibre and how it could help reduce the technology gap between rich nations and the developing world. EU-Asean foreign ministers hold their two-yearly meeting in Karlsruhe (to Sep 23). Once again, the EU will seek to prise open the markets of the six-member Association of South East Asian Nations and to reduce their trade surplus. On Saturday, the foreign ministers meet some 200 chief executives from leading European and Asian companies to continue discussions. The Bolshoi Theatre's postponed new season opens today, but is in jeopardy after President Yeltsin ordered the introduction of western-style contracts instead of lifelong tenure. Artists may strike in protest. Party conference: One of the UK's most colourful political parties, the fringe Monster Raving Loony Party, holds its annual conference at a hotel in Ashburton, Devon. 23 FRIDAY US-N Korea talks resume The US and North Korea will resume high-level talks in Geneva on the terms of a deal by which Pyongyang would accept full nuclear inspections in exchange for improved relations with Washington. North Korea would dismantle its current graphite reactors in return for the supply of safer light-water models. One difficulty, however, is that Pyongyang wants them to be Russian, while the US and South Korea want to supply a US-designed model. Questions also remain about the disposal of the North's stockpile of nuclear fuel and about the means to determine whether Pyongyang has already built an atomic bomb. UK economy: The markets will be focusing attention on the September CBI industrial trends survey. The survey provides a snapshot of the mood of industry, because of its potential importance in monetary policy decisions. Previous surveys have shown factory gate prices rising to levels last seen in late-1990. Although output and prices balances are strong at the moment, a slowdown in consumer demand should allow both to fall back. FT Surveys: Venture and Development Capital and West End Property. Holidays: Japan (Autumnal Equinox Day). 24-25 WEEKEND Bavarians go to the polls Bavarians vote on Sunday to elect a state parliament, the last state election before the national elections on October 16. The results are unlikely to give any further clues about the outcome of the latter, however. While the opposition Social Democrats have fought a spirited campaign, the Bavarians are likely to return the Christian Social Union with an absolute majority - as they have since 1962. President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, together with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, meets UK prime minister John Major and foreign secretary Douglas Hurd on what is forecast by Russian officials to be a 'relaxed' visit - before heading the following week to the US for meetings with President Bill Clinton in Washington. The issues will include: the state of the ceasefire in Bosnia; the upcoming summit of the International Monetary Fund; and Russia's plans for reform in the year ahead. Mr Yeltsin and Mr Kozyrev have an agenda of their own - including pressure for the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to take over many of the functions of Nato. Mr Yeltsin, who has been holidaying on the Black Sea, is expected to address the nation on Thursday before flying to London. Compiled by Patrick Stiles and Martin Mulligan.

			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> My husband and I would like to voice our appreciation of "Murphy's Law." The  stories are well-written, the characters have lots of charm, interest and  believability, and all the actors portraying the leads are terrific. George  Segal is wonderful, as usual, but the others are truly entertaining.  </P> <P> Mr. and Mrs. R.E. Brock, San Clemente  </P></p>

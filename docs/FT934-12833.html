			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Management: A meeting of minds - Christopher Lorenz sheds fresh light on strategic alliances Common sense would seem to support Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of British Airways, in his declaration that a strategic alliance between two companies is more likely to last if at least one of them has an equity stake in the other. It would appear obvious that such a link not only increases the partner's influence, but also makes it more likely that both sides will make an all-out effort to resolve any problems which arise, rather than just abandoning their collaboration. Sir Colin's comment was made in response to this month's deal between Lufthansa and United Airlines. Initially, this is merely a marketing arrangement. But United's redoubtable boss, Stephen Wolf, seems to agree with Marshall, since he wants to buy shares in the struggling German airline when it is privatised next year. Whatever the past experience of BA and United may be - including an abortive attempt to ally with each other - their bosses are seriously misguided on the matter, according to Jordan Lewis. Lewis is an alliance expert who flies constantly around the world from his Washington base advising large companies how to get together, repair a shaky relationship, or end it with the minimum of pain. His hands-on book on alliance management, Partnerships for Profit, has been translated into 10 languages, including Japanese. * Among a catalogue of general misconceptions about how to mount, manage and protect alliances, Lewis rates the 'equity stake' issue pretty high. Its popularity with many airlines 'reflects a misunderstanding of alliances', he says. The truth, he claims, is that 'alliances survive as long as each company regards the other as its best partner. Many equity alliances have ended, usually because that condition was no longer met. But many non-equity alliances have continued for years because it continued to be met'. One instance is the link between GE of America and France's Snecma in aero engines, which is now more than 20 years old. Lewis's comments were made just after the Lufthansa-United announcement, at a two-day Management Centre Europe briefing on alliances. His other tips included the following points: Mutual need. Controversially, Lewis says this is much more important than who controls an alliance. Each partner must take what steps it can to ensure that the other continues to need it. Shared objectives. Most companies are used only to buy-sell relationships. In alliances, they must agree clearly 'on what they intend to maximise together'. Shared risk. Both (or all) partners must accept the bearing of a considerable degree of shared risk - it cannot be loaded onto one partner, 'as in other commercial relationships'. The risks can be personal, as well as economic. Relationships and trust. These are at the heart of the success of an alliance, 'but companies don't invest nearly enough effort in building them  -which takes years'. Many partners don't realise the need for investing in relationships until they hit a significant problem, says Lewis. 'They don't think that way - they think in terms of deals.' Trust starts between the people immediately involved, 'and hopefully spreads slowly into both organisations'. Hence Lewis's insistence, in contrast with other alliance consultants, that it is impossible to put everything on paper at the start. 'You can't write contracts about enthusiasm', he says. 'You need a keen, two-company team. But I don't see that very often'. 'When GE and Snecma got started, there were only two people who trusted each other, but they gradually buried this deeper and deeper in each organisation'. Disputes. Partners should agree at the start that 'tough issues' can and must be raised with the other side. Exit strategy. This also should be negotiated upfront, in case mutual need disappears, or the shared objectives change. 'Otherwise you end in court'. Lewis's emphasis on deep relationships should not be taken as advocacy of links between parent companies, such as the almost barren one between Daimler Benz and Mitsubishi. He warns that 'corporate-to-corporate alliances are a mistake - they should be between business units'. Extolling the general advantages of what he calls 'alliance-thinking', Lewis says it 'forces companies to focus themselves - you can't be good at everything'. It reinforces the growing tendency of managements to narrow the definition of their companies' 'core competences', and to 'outsource' or 'partner' the rest of their activities. *Free Press/Macmillan Pounds 22.95.</p>

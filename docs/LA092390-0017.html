			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: THE VAUGHAN BROTHERS' BLUES-GUITAR LEGACY;  </P> <P> *** 1/2 THE VAUGHAN BROTHERS "FAMILY STYLE"EPIC: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF  ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> Not the in-yer-face, six-string razor whip-out! one might expect from the first  collaborative record by these two Texas guitar-slingin' siblings, but a warm,  kinda kicked-back, decidedly non-competitive,  just-dropped-in-to-pick-'n'-grin-after-dinner session.  </P> <P> This triumph of feel over content extends to the songwriting, although the  Stax-track soul ballad for universal brotherhood ("Tick Tock") and the James  Brown funk vamp ("Baboom/Mama Said") are surprising pleasures.  </P> <P> Fronting a skintight rhythm section (with occasional keyboards, horns and  backing vocals added for color), Stevie Ray handles most of the vocals -- older  brother Jimmie takes two (a first) -- but it's the three instrumentals that  really put the peppers in the potluck.  </P> <P> The Lonnie Mack-inspired "D/FW," the swirling, guitar-as-organ, move 'n' groove  "Hillbillies From Outerspace" and especially the live-in-the-studio,  passing-one-guitar-between-'em, first-take blues "Brothers" that ends this  combination platter are nuthin' but fine, fine, superfine, respectively.  </P> <P> Vaguely melancholic, too, mostly because it's hard not to think about Stevie  Ray's recent death in a helicopter crash, making the prospect of the flashy  fretgrinder and his arguably more bluesicianly bro' doing it live! an  impossibility.

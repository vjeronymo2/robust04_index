			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Highlands Gold decreases 45% Highlands Gold, the Papua New Guinea-based mining company in which Australia's MIM Holdings holds a majority stake, yesterday reported a 44.8 per cent fall in earnings in the six months to December 12, to K12.1m (USDollars 12.3m), writes Nikki Tait. Sales revenue was down to K53.5m from K71.4m. Results in the second quarter comprised a net profit of K4.6m compared with just over K9m in the same period of 1992. The figures reflect Highlands' reduction in interest in the Porgera gold mine, to 25 per cent from 30 per cent. Highlands' share of production from the Porgera mine provided sales of 144,417 ounces of gold at an average realised price of USDollars 363 per ounce during the six-month period (compared with 194,500 ounces at USDollars 363 in the same period of 1992). The total contribution from Porgera to group sales was K51.6m.</p>

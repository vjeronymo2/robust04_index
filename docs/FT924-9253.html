			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / People: Chris Bryant to be life-president At the age of 69, Chris Bryant has retired as chairman of Bryant Group, the publicly quoted Midlands-based construction company started in 1885 by his grandfather, Christopher Bryant. He is replaced by Colin Hope who becomes non-executive chairman; appointed a non-executive director of the company last year, is chairman of T&amp;N and deputy chairman of Ibstock Johnsen. Chris Bryant joined the then family business in 1946 after graduating from Birmingham University and serving as an officer with the Fleet Air Arm. He became a director in 1948. At the beginning of 1987, Bryant, who was determined the group would remain an independent company, successfully fought off a hostile Pounds 187m takeover bid from English China Clays. He was chairman and managing director from 1962 to 1988, but will retain his connection by becoming life president. The company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 20.3m during the 12 months to end May compared with a depressed Pounds 10.3m in the previous 12 months. ***** Roy Elsey, a former detective superintendent in the City of London Fraud Squad, has been appointed by City solicitors Berwin Leighton as an investigator in its insurance and financial institutions department. The firm claims this is the first appointment of its kind by an English law firm. The insurance and financial institutions department was set up recently to deal with an increasing number of domestic and international claims under bankers' blanket bond insurance policies and professional indemnity policies for merchant banks, stockbrokers, accountants and surveyors. Berwin Leighton has acted for a number of insurers in connection with claims under blanket bonds, arising out of employee dishonesty or forged documents. The work involves close liaison with the police and other investigating authorities and this prompted the firm to look for its own in-house investigator. Elsey, 60, was with the Fraud Squad for 15 years.</p>

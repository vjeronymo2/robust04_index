			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Eduardo McBride, president of Exporters </F> Association, by Manuel Castillo Ochoa; place and date not given:  "We Need a Different Economic Program"; first paragraph is  QUEHACER introduction]    [Text] Adjustment fatigue seems to have hit high levels.  The dollar is still low and exports have not taken off. In  discussing this difficult issue and other related matters, the  president of ADEX [Exporters Association], Eduardo McBride,  calls for a change--going from a monetary peg to an exchange  peg; says there will be an initial cost--a rise in inflation;  and calls for economic consensus, the basis for political  consensus. His controversial statements follow.    [Castillo Ochoa] Unlike the flight of capital from Latin  America in past years, we have recently seen an influx of  capital from abroad--much of it short term, or "rolling stone"  capital, including in our case the repatriation of Peruvian  capital. This has kept the dollar low and prolonged the exchange  arrears. This tends to favor imports at the expense of exports.  What should be done to turn these trends around?    [McBride] One consequence of a structural adjustment,  anywhere in the world, is that in the first phase there is a  combination of exchange arrears and high interest rates.    These two elements are very directly related. So we need to  attack the exchange rate directly or attack the interest rate  indirectly. Obviously, that cannot be done in the short term.  But since this process began in August 1990 and so far has had  no positive consequences, we believe that both phenomena--the  rise in interest rates and the exchange rate arrears--have had  too high a cost for the adjustment process. We think this could  have been done very early--during the program's first phase, and  even up to December 1993.    Now we have reached the conclusion that if we continue to  maintain the same economic policy we are not going to achieve  greater progress with either the interest rate or the exchange  rate.    We know there are factors affecting the exchange rate, like  "rolling stone" capital. Much of that capital, about $250  million a month, comes from Peruvian businessmen who started to  return in 1990, either to strengthen their companies, improve  their technology, or simply to maintain some level of activity  and avert bankruptcy. I personally believe a third of that  capital is coming in for speculative purposes.    We have heard of Peruvian promoters and bankers who have  encouraged the influx of all this capital from abroad, most of  which--I believe, though I can not give you a percentage--is  Peruvian capital.    [Castillo Ochoa] We can understand the reasons for this  influx of foreign capital and repatriation of Peruvian capital:  economic liberalization, reduction in the price of the dollar,  interest rates higher than international averages, etc. But it  is detrimental to exports. How do you exporters see the solution?    [McBride] We know the economic program has helped us with  the  readjustment. Inflation has been reduced, and we even had some  growth in 1993, though more for temporary than structural  reasons, I believe. So it has had some good points.    But if our primary goal is the nation's development, and  secondly, for exports to be the fundamental factor driving this  development, then we need another economic program.    [Castillo Ochoa] And what might that be?    [McBride] That economic program has two key elements. The  first is to change the monetary peg which we have had until now,  which affects the Central Reserve Bank's monetary policy.    By reducing the money supply and applying strict fiscal  discipline, expressed in a national government budget,  satisfactory results have been achieved in fighting inflation.  But that is not an essential factor now. We need a peg linked to  the dollar.    [Castillo Ochoa] Going from a monetary to an exchange peg?    [McBride] Right. But it cannot be done overnight. And here  is  the second aspect. As nobody has a magic wand and can say  exactly what is going to be done, we have to sit down to talk  during the first six months of 1994. People from professional  associations, from the universities, from technical economic  institutions, associations involved in exports, people in the  government. Sit down to think about how the exchange policy can  be modified, since there are certain commitments from which we  cannot be released--with the World Bank and the International  Monetary Fund--and they will affect our decisions.    We have to talk about how far we can change specific  elements, in a gradual way, so the export sector will really  provide the basis for economic development. Not because I say  so, but because that is what the government itself is proposing  now.    What bothers me most is that the people running the  government, the government leaders, talk a lot about exports as  the nation's factor for development, while in practice they work  against the companies involved in exports.    [Castillo Ochoa] But will going from a monetary peg to an  exchange peg cause inflation to heat up once again??    [McBride] Yes, in the first phase it would have a cost. I  will not deny that. There was an initial cost in 1990 when the  monetary peg was created, when we moved from 300 percent peak  inflation in one month.    But then the great opportunity for an exchange peg was lost.  Well, there is no point in bemoaning that. Doing so now would  have an initial cost, of course: a rise in inflation. But I  think that can be absorbed. What we propose is to bring  everybody together so that cost, which is going to come about in  any event, will ultimately produce collective  benefits.    I believe that factor, that search for dialogue, the appeal  to all the technical people, might be a starting point for an  economic consensus that can later be transformed into a  political consensus. There is no political consensus unless  there is first an economic consensus. That is essential.    [Castillo Ochoa] That sounds very good. But specifically,  now  that we have touched on that issue, one thing concerns me. You  are talking about a national political consensus, an economic  consensus. But some sectors have the impression that Peruvian  businessmen are not investing because they do not want to. A  little while ago the historian Pablo Macera said that. And  President Fujimori repeated it. Is it true that they are not  investing? There is great uncertainty about business behavior,  which would make any consensus difficult.    [McBride] I am going to quote something said by Juan Antonio  Aguirre of CONFIEP [National Confederation of Private Business]:  "The business community today is in a state of ferment." He said  that in the sense of innovative dynamism. It is not only  investing what it has, but what it does not have. As a  consequence of the structural adjustment, the business community  has lost a great deal of its assets. The export sector, at  least, has lost its credit capacity. We are no longer very  profitable for banks. The export business is not very  profitable. The Office of the Superintendent of Banks now  demands very strict loan guarantees. We constantly have fewer  loan guarantees to offer to the banking system to be able to  recover our credit. But even with that deterioration, we are  making use of the opportunities and the knowhow we have.    I could give you many examples, like the investments in  asparagus, the interest of foreign investors in the quality of  our skills and the qualifications of our labor, unlike other  regions such as Africa, which are suitable for growing  asparagus, but where they lack the technical skills and labor  capacity that we have in Peru.    The conditions are right in Peru, and we Peruvians are  investing. I myself am investing in land in San Lorenzo for  mango exports. In the past we bought all our mangos from farmers  and processed them. Now we are entering a new phase and I think  that just as we are investing in agricultural exports, a great  deal is also being invested in other fields (textiles, metal,  and mechanical products).    [Castillo Ochoa] President Fujimori spoke of both foreign  and  Peruvian investors and compared them, calling upon national  investors to follow the lead of foreign investors.    [McBride] Foreign investors have a great public image. They  are talked about a lot, but we Peruvians invest every day to  keep business going. We put our money where our mouth is, as the  saying goes. A large part of the capital influx from abroad is  from Peruvians who are investing, reconverting, keeping their  businesses going, and that is also investment.    Let us not disparage ourselves. Nobody talks about us in the  newspapers. But we invest every day. When we buy Peruvian  products, we are investing. When we process products, we are  investing. When we sign a contract for a new unit, we are  investing, not just in machinery but also in new jobs. That is  not reported in the newspapers, it is not added in, no records  are kept, nor is there an economic unit or office in Peru that  keeps track of this activity.    When we train our employees and send them to take courses at  ESAN [School of Business Administration], at IPAE [Peruvian  Institute of Business Administration], or at CEADEX [expansion  not given], who knows about that? Nobody. Foreign companies have  an image, they make more noise; then they sell. They invest 200  million in five years. We invest 200 million in a single year.  That is the truth.    [Castillo Ochoa] There is an idea that businessmen have been  receiving the benefits of a number of different economic  incentives. You had been receiving the Certex [Export  Certificates]. Now you want a "draw back."    [McBride] We are trying to get a tax rebate now. That is  clear and specific. Why? For a principle that is generally  accepted all over the world: that taxes are not exported. That  prevails in Chile, Colombia, the United States, Europe, and  Japan.    As we pay a single direct tax, we are at a disadvantage in  relation to this general principle of market competition.    [Castillo Ochoa] The government says that its model treats  all economic agents the same, that no agent should have  prerogatives over another. They should compete efficiently and  let the market decide.    [McBride] That is not entirely true.    [Castillo Ochoa] Why?    [McBride] Because, for example, in tax legislation people  who  invest in tourism are exempt from the minimum income tax.  However, at this time it would cost us exporters 2 percent,  unless we are buying new machinery. In that case, we could  deduct something.    [Castillo Ochoa] There is not equal treatment for all  economic agents?    [McBride] Until 31 December there seemed to be equal  treatment. But now we have learned that until that date  reinvestments in the mining sector were completely tax-free. The  industrial sector did not have those incentives, nor did the  fishing or service sectors. And now they have been eliminated  for mining.    I think that in terms of promotion, incentives, leadership,  orientation, there is instability and total confusion. We know  this.    We, as industrialists and service exporters, are not  interested in hurting mining reinvestments. I am not going to  say: listen, why give that to him and not to me? But on 31  December the mining industry was also stripped of its  incentives. That seems ridiculous to me. Now they are not giving  incentives to mining, to industry, to fishing, to services, or  to anyone. There is really no organization.    Still, tax legislation to stimulate tourism has come out.  That seems welcome and excellent to me. And the tax on  unimproved land was removed, and some other advantages were  devised for the construction sector. That seems good to me.    It seems good that there is movement in the direction of  saying: this year we are going to develop our economy, starting  with construction and tourism. But why did they not do this with  the export sector two years ago? Now it would be leading the  nation's development.    [Castillo Ochoa] You say that as a national development goal  proposal.    [McBride] It is. We need a real and integral development  plan, which is being denied for totally dogmatic reasons.    [Castillo Ochoa] But would not this call for a change or  modification in the economic program mean tossing overboard what  has been done on exports since 1990?    [McBride] I would never support sacrificing economic  stability, the adjustment, and the reduction of inflation for  some vague benefit. But we should start to think--as Dornbush  said in his speech at Catholic University--that continuing to  insist on reducing inflation is absurd at this time. I believe  that what we need to do is reactivate the economy through  exports by resolving the exchange arrears problem.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Sharp rise in spending lifts PSBR A SHARP RISE in central government spending last month compared with a year before pushed up the public sector borrowing requirement for September to Pounds 5.88bn, Treasury figures showed yesterday. In the first half of the financial year the gap between government spending and revenues was 31 per cent higher than in the equivalent period of 1992, in a development that may strengthen the case for a fiscal tightening in next month's Budget. The deterioration in public finances accelerated in the second quarter of the financial year. This saw borrowing increase 40 per cent on a year previously, after a year-on-year rise of 25 per cent for the first quarter. The figures add weight to worries about the rapid rise in borrowing, which has been caused partly by increased social security payments and a rise in tax revenues that has been subdued because of the recession. The Treasury expects the deficit to reach Pounds 50bn this financial year after Pounds 36.7bn in 1992-93. The gap between government spending and revenues in September was slightly above City expectations. It brought the PSBR for the first six months of the financial year to Pounds 24.2bn after Pounds 18.4bn in the first half of 1992-93. Last month central government departments spent Pounds 22.27bn, 14 per cent up on the Pounds 19.5bn spent in September last year. Central government revenues, mainly from tax, came to Pounds 16.1bn last month, 7 per cent higher than the Pounds 15.1bn registered the previous September. In the first six months of the financial year, cash receipts by central government departments came to Pounds 98.5bn, up 4 per cent on the Pounds 94.8bn collected in the same period last year. Spending by these departments totalled Pounds 123.7bn in the first half, 8 per cent up on the Pounds 114.3bn for the first six months of last year. Local authorities repaid Pounds 324m in September, compared with a Pounds 279m repayment 12 months before. In the first six months of the financial year these authorities repaid Pounds 1.1bn after a repayment of Pounds 1bn in the same period last year. In the second quarter of the financial year the overall PSBR was Pounds 10.8bn after Pounds 13.4bn in the first quarter. The equivalent figures for 1992-93 were Pounds 7.7bn and Pounds 10.7bn.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INSPIRATION POINT GETS ARTY NEW LOOK  </P> <P> The sunbathers who gaze out to sea from the Corona del Mar coastal bluff called  Inspiration Point found their turf invaded by a small crowd of people in  citified dress Thursday afternoon. The occasion was the official dedication of  Newport Beach's first Art in Public Places project.  </P> <P> Formerly run-down and erosion-prone, the lookout point on Ocean Boulevard  between Narcissus and Orchid streets was refurbished by Cunningham Design Inc.  of Santa Barbara with artists Helen Mayer Harrison, Newton Harrison, Marcello  Petrocelli and Paul Hobson. They were the co-winners of a 1987 design  competition sponsored by the city's Arts Commission and the Parks, Beaches and  Recreation Department.  </P> <P> Called "Disappearing Path," the $310,300 project is nothing if not low-key.  Replacing the former asphalt pathway, a steep, undulating sunken concrete  walkway leads down from street level to a broad plateau and continues to the  beach level below. The plateau offers sunbathers who want to linger a choice of  concrete steps, boulders and simple-but-stylish teakwood benches on which to  perch.  </P> <P> Stripped of its scrubby tangle of ice plant (and also, inadvertently, of some  native plants that should have remained on the site) the coastal bluff is now  virtually bare. The site has been seeded with grass as a temporary  erosion-control measure, but next winter a plant specialist will revegetate the  area with coastal sagebrush, California buckwheat, black sage, lemonade berry  and other native species.  </P> <P> This replanting scheme, which will add texture and color as well as erosion  control, is a key part of the project. Lloyd Dalton, a design engineer with the  Newport Beach Public Works Department, explained that the delay in replanting  is partly due to the fact that some of the plant materials have to be  propagated from seeds rather than from cuttings, and most of the plants don't  go to seed until August.  </P> <P> The original "Disappearing Path" plan, budgeted by Cunningham Design at  $402,770, would also have provided for the restructuring of the upper area of  the site, adjacent to the road. This level was to have been lowered several  feet and enhanced with seating and a fountain, all constructed with boulders.  </P> <P> But the city's original budget for the project was only $152,661, so the design  had to be scaled down. (The final costs for the walkway and landscaping were  $202,800; the other $107,500 paid for restoration of the badly eroded bluff by  the Public Works Department. Additional money for the project came from various  Parks, Beaches and Recreation Department accounts.)  </P> <P> Other less-visible parts of the project include a drip-irrigation system, the  relocation of a sewer that runs under the site and the riprap, or grouted rock,  that protects the end of the pathway from being washed out during storms.  </P> <P> A chain-link fence at street level is a temporary device that will be removed  as soon as the replanting is completed. But the temporary chain-link fence at  the edge of the middle platform will be replaced this summer by a 42-inch-high  safety railing because of potential liability problems.  </P> <P> For maximum visibility and good looks, Cunningham Design would like to see  stanchions supporting a railing made of horizontal stainless-steel cables  ("inspired by the lifeline on a yacht," according to principal partner Bob  Cunningham). Dalton is concerned that such a design would cost too much,  however, and a final decision on the design has not yet been made. The steep  grade of the "disappearing path" -- which caused a few visitors to grumble  several days ago -- was unchanged from that of the original trail, Dalton said.  </P> <P> Landscape architect David Black, another Cunningham Design partner, called the  project "very simple, very straightforward," with "a certain elegance of the  forms." He said the architect-artist team "articulated the path in a way we  felt was very artistic in terms of the curves.  </P> <P> "Obviously we had some constraints in budget, but we tried to do something  functional yet creative. . . . I think we handled that in a sort of unobtrusive  yet elegant way. They (the city) didn't want something outrageous or  avant-garde."  </P></p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor (2): Well paid, well equipped and subject to market forces Sir, The Cadbury Committee must be very pleased with itself: remuneration committees throughout the land have been unflinching in their quest to award executive directors the going rate for their job, however high it may be. Struggling employees and shareholders can sleep easily in their beds at night, in the knowledge that their executives are now better equipped than ever to deal with the harsh commercial problems facing their companies. D Miller, 16 Shipfield, Norwich NR3 4DX</p>

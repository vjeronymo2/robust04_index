			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Arts: Today's Television How 'green' are the oil giants? That is the question investigated in Channel 4's Critical Eye: The Heat of the Moment (9.00). Oil discoveries have never done a lot of good for the environment. Filmed secretly in Ecuador, Nigerian, Gabon and Papua and New Guinea, the film suggests that despite the much flaunted green credentials of oil companies, drilling means health risks for the locals and irreparable damage to disappearing habitats. If you are looking for something which will weigh less heavy on the soul, tonight is strong on comedy although of the four on offer only the geriatric jollities on BBC 1's Waiting For God (8.30) is actually new. Choucroute has always seemed to me as one of the more horrible dishes of French cuisine - although it can always be blamed on the Germans. However, there are many more palatable aspects of Alsatian cooking as Mireille Johnston amply demonstrates in A Cook's Tour of France: Alsace on BBC 2 (8.00). Ghouls have a feast with Crimewatch File: Murder Without Motive on BBC1 at 9.30, re-enacting an appalling murder solved with the help of psychologists and handwriting experts.</p>

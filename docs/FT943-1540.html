			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Nobo expands into Europe with Pounds 6m deal Nobo Group, the office and business products supplier, is expanding into continental Europe with the acquisition of the De Visu Companies, four private companies based in France under common control, for an aggregate Pounds 6m. An initial consideration of Pounds 5.2m will be satisfied as to Pounds 3.9m in cash and Pounds 1.3m by the issue of 544,746 new ordinary shares to the vendors. The balance is profit-related. Nobo also announced an open offer of 4.89m new ordinary shares on a 2-for-5 basis to raise about Pounds 10.2m net. The proceeds will finance the cash element of the acquisition and a deferred Pounds 1m consideration for the Elite Optics purchase, completed on September 13. The balance will be used to reduce the enlarged group's debt. The placing and open offer are fully underwritten by Granville Davies. The De Visu Companies comprise De Visu, Lara Audiovisuel, Comevi and Artois. They make visual display and training products and drawing office equipment. For 1993 losses amounted to about Pounds 2m on turnover of about Pounds 18m. Sales are principally to trade distributors within France, with about 10 per cent relating to exports. Nobo is also proposing that, following the acquisition, its share premium account be reduced by Pounds 16m to Pounds 500,000 to be transferred to a special capital reserve against which any goodwill may be written off.</p>

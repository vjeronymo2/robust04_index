			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Guinness judge offers trials plan THE GUINNESS trial judge who called for a solution to long fraud trials has produced his own radical and controversial proposals. Speaking publicly last night for the first time since the trial of former merchant bankers Mr Roger Seelig and Lord Spens was stopped in February, Mr Justice Henry said parliament should oblige defendants to detail their defences before the trial. He argued that the judge and not the prosecutor should make the opening statement in a trial, giving the jury an impartial indication of the various issues involved. A defendant would be more ready to give advance details of his defence if he knew that his side of the story would be indicated to the jury at the outset of the proceedings. Parliament might need to impose time limits on jury trials. Save in exceptional cases, four months should be long enough, Mr Justice Henry said. He also argued in favour of keeping juries in serious fraud trials. Giving the Child &amp; Co Lecture at the Council of Legal Education, the judge said: 'The competence of the criminal law to deal with serious fraud is clearly crucial today when the power-driven, greed-fed, dishonest excesses of the 1980s have not proved to be the end of an unfortunate era but an introduction to worse since. 'We have to be able to deal with serious fraud: to deter it, to detect it, and to punish it. 'We must do this to protect the creditors, employees, and shareholders of limited liability companies. 'We must do this to protect the public, whose pensions and insurances depend on it. We must do this to protect the integrity of the market.' Serious fraud trials took too long, were insufficiently focused on the real issues, cost too much and placed too great a strain on those involved, he said. Advocating the retention of juries, he said the great majority of judges who had tried long fraud cases had come through confident in their jury and in the verdicts they would give. Equal justice in cases of white-collar crime as in blue-collar crime was one reason for keeping the jury, he said. Juries needed more help, though. 'It seems to me there is a case for the trial judge opening both the law and the issues to the jury. This would require him to summarise each defendant's case.' He would also like to be able to give the jury his own running summaries of the evidence on each issue.</p>

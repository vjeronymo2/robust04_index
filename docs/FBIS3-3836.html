In a speech at the Seoul airport, Kim said that he will  discuss with Japanese and Chinese leaders cooperation among the  three countries as well as peace and stability in eastern Asia,  including the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula.    He said that Japan and China were geographically and  historically South Korea's close neighbors, and that the three  will become partners in the forthcoming Asia-Pacific era.    He pointed out that interdependence among nations is  increasingly important, especially since the Uruguay Round of  multilateral trade talks of the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade reached an agreement which will bring about fierce  competition in world trade.    This situation highlights the significance of close  cooperation among South Korea, Japan and China in seeking joint  stability and prosperity, he stated.    The three countries can benefit from complimentary  cooperation to improve their own competitiveness as they have  different business structures and are in different stages of  development, President Kim stressed.    He added that Japan is South Korea's second largest trading  partner, while China is the third largest and has attracted most  of South Korea's overseas investment.    Kim is expected to meet with Japanese Emperor Akihito and  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, address the Japanese  parliament, and visit Waseda University.    He is scheduled to leave Japan on March 26 for Shanghai,  China's largest city, and will remain in China for five days.  During his stay he will hold talks with President Jiang Zemin,  Premier Li Peng and other top Chinese leaders.    President Kim will also visit the economic development zones  in Shanghai and Tianjin and deliver a speech at Beijing  University.</p>

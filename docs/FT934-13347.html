			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Canadian voters look to Reform: Populist or extremist, it could go from one Commons seat to as many as 50 IT is no small achievement for a politician to draw 4,000 people to an election rally in suburban Toronto on the same night that the Toronto Blue Jays are playing the Philadelphia Phillies in the World Series baseball championship. Mr Preston Manning did just that on Tuesday. The crowd which packed the Pickering Trade Centre, east of Toronto, was further evidence that Mr Manning's populist, right-of-centre Reform party will be a big winner in next Monday's general election. If opinion polls and political pundits are correct, Reform's presence in the House of Commons in Ottawa will soar from a lone member representing a remote Alberta constituency, to as many as 50 or more MPs from all five provinces west of Quebec. With a large number of three- and four-way races, the precise breakdown of seats is unusually difficult to predict. But the ruling Progressive Conservatives, led by Ms Kim Campbell, the prime minister, have stumbled so badly in the seven-week campaign that few analysts will be surprised if Reform or the separatist Bloc Quebecois ends up as the official opposition. The Liberals, currently the main opposition party, are almost certain to form the next government. It is not yet clear however, whether they will win enough seats for an outright majority. The bulk of Reform's support has come from unhappy Conservatives in western Canada. But the fledgling party, formed in 1987, has also become an outlet for disaffected Liberals, and even for members of the left-of-centre New Democratic party, which is expected to be virtually annihilated in the election. Reform is a peculiar political party. In one sense, it is little more than a protest movement. The typical Reform supporter is a disgruntled English-speaking Canadian who is fed up with high taxes, immigrants (especially refugees), early parole for criminals, affirmative action and gay rights. Reform has also become a rallying point for Canadians in Ontario and the west who think the time has come to stand up to Quebec. The Reform view is that if Quebec refuses to accept the same constitutional powers as the other nine provinces and decides to go its own way, so be it. But Reform has also won wider respect by presenting the campaign's most detailed and fearless platform, including a plan to eliminate Ottawa's yawning CDollars 35bn (Pounds 17.2bn) budget deficit within three years. It has had the guts to acknowledge that chopping the deficit would involve some painful choices. The Reform platform pledges a radical overhaul of such sacred cows of Canadian society as unemployment insurance, social welfare and universal healthcare. Mr Manning is often compared with Mr Ross Perot, the US populist billionaire. Aged 51, the son of a former premier of Alberta, he has the same clean-cut appearance and preaches the same traditional values as Mr Perot. Among his hobbies listed in Who's Who are shopping, fishing and horse-riding with his family. Although somewhat less cocky, Mr Manning shares Mr Perot's knack for presenting seductively simple solutions to complex problems. One of his favourite lines is that 'the best thing the government can do for Canadians is to get off their backs and get out of their pockets.' But, like Mr Perot's movement in the US, the Reform party's uncomplicated view of the world makes many Canadians uneasy. Critics note that the 'zero-in-three' deficit-elimination plan would be impossible to implement without a huge jump in unemployment (already at over 11 per cent) and severe cuts in government services. Its uncompromising attitude towards Quebec and its intolerance towards rising immigration clash with values which up to now have been hallmarks of Canadian society. Other than Mr Manning and Ms Deborah Grey, Reform's sole MP, little is known about its candidates. While Mr Manning comes across as a decent and honest politician, there is considerable evidence that his party has become a haven for more extreme elements. Earlier this month, Mr Manning hurriedly dismissed a Reform candidate in southern Ontario who made racist and anti-Semitic remarks. Other candidates are reported to have expressed similar views. Mr Manning insists that such views are not Reform policy nor typical of most of its candidates or members. He told the crowd in Pickering: 'We refuse to be influenced by the racists of the right, and refuse to be intimidated by the fanatics of political correctness on the left.' No matter how well it fares on Monday, Reform's base is far from secure. Its support appeared to be ebbing earlier this year before Ms Campbell and her advisers drove the Conservatives' electoral machine into the ditch. An improving economy could see many Reform supporters drift back to the Conservative, Liberal or NDP folds. Even in the closing days of the campaign, concern about Reform's policies and candidates appears to have made some voters think twice. Furthermore, the inexperience of Reform's new MPs could make them an easy target in the new Parliament. Mr Manning's plan to loosen party discipline in the House of Commons and make MPs more accountable to their constituents runs the risk of weakening party unity. While Reform is not yet firmly entrenched in the mainstream of Canadian politics, it could be a formidable force on the opposition benches. At the very least, it will long be remembered for putting a firecracker under Canada's traditional political parties.</p>

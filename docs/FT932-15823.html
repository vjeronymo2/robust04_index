			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 2,800 tested in poor turnover A DISAPPOINTINGLY small reduction in money market repurchase rates in Germany deepened the gloom in the UK stock market yesterday, and the FT-SE Index bounced uncomfortably on the 2,800 mark before rallying weakly in late trading. A blue chip sector already hurt by renewed selling of Wellcome and tobacco issues took further losses after a sell-off in stock index futures. Seaq-reported trading volume was thin, but dealers commented that the retail business, always reported one day in arrears, has remained strong as the market has slipped by nearly 39 points on the Footsie scale over the past trading week. Equities opened firmly as renewed improvement in sterling buttressed hopes that domestic rates might be cut soon. Reports that March had brought the largest monthly upturn in UK house prices for four years also helped sentiment. But the early gain of 4.8 on the Footsie scale was quickly reversed when the June future contract on the index ran into sellers. Share prices then drifted lower, with the setback restrained by some arbitraging against stock index futures. However, the very modest slackening in German repurchase rates, which are seen in London as the most likely arena for an easing of Bundesbank policy, sent share prices on the downward trend. At worst the market touched 2,800.6 on the Footsie, a net 31.6 down, lending conviction to those analysts who have predicted a Footsie in the 2,780 area before long. In the absence of selling pressure, however, London staged a thinly traded technical rally at the close, encouraged by an early gain of 17 Dow points as New York opened. At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index was 10.1 off on the day at 2,822.1. Trading volume barely moved in the final hour, bearing out comments from the dealing rooms that there had been little strength behind the late recovery in share prices. At 508m shares, Seaq volume was down from the 538.4m recorded the previous day; retail volume worth Pounds 1.13bn on Tuesday indicated that genuine investment activity has remained satisfactory, from the point of view of the London-based securities houses. Most of the blue chip sectors continued to lack support. Among the much-battered pharmaceuticals, Glaxo showed some recovery but Wellcome was again sharply lower. Tobacco shares, too, remained under the pressure imposed last week by the decision by Philip Morris, of the US, to cut cigarette prices. Some confidence was shown in the building materials and construction sectors, which are likely to be the immediate beneficiaries of economic recovery. But doubts that the recovery will be consumer driven were reflected in losses across the brewery and distillery stocks. Traders comforted themselves with the belief that UK securities markets had already slowed down ahead of the Easter weekend, which will shut the London markets from tonight until Tuesday morning. But anxious glances were thrown at the Footsie 2,800 mark, which many analysts expect to face further testing today unless there are more positive factors to encourage investors in the UK equity market.</p>

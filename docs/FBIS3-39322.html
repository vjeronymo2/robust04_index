Bente Juncker was forced to resign after having circulated  unproven sexual insinuations about Poul Thofner, the head of the  Fyrreparken institute for the mentally subnormal in Naestved.  He is now threatening a court case for defamation.    Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (Social Democratic  Party)  did not protest at the social affairs minister's resignation:  "I agree with Bente Juncker's decision," he said. "It was a  sad day, but let us look forward instead of being too  depressed." [passage omitted]    The new social affairs minister will be former Center  Democrat Folketing deputy Yvonne Herlov Andersen. She comes  from a job as head of an institution for the mentally  handicapped and is the first trained social worker to fill the  post.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: Treasury prices mixed despite stronger dollar US Treasury prices were mixed yesterday, with the market gaining some support from a stronger dollar and data which suggested the chance of favourable news in today's pivotal employment report. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/8 better at 87 3/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.319 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note edged  1/32 lower to 99 5/16 , to yield 5.855 per cent. The focus was squarely on today's data on April non-farm payrolls and unemployment, which will give the market its first comprehensive reading on the strength of the economy in the early part of the second quarter. Forecasts centre on a payroll increase of 170,000, and an unemployment rate of 6.5 per cent. Yesterday's announcement of rising claims for unemployment benefit last week was marginally encouraging for fixed-rate investors, who are looking for indications of weak inflationary pressures. The good news was offset by the announcement that unit labour costs jumped 5 per cent in the first quarter. Trading was largely confined to professional dealers, who were squaring their positions ahead of today's data. Improvement in the value of the dollar against the yen and D-Mark was helpful at the long end, but most traders were content to remain on the sidelines. Their over-riding concern remained the likelihood of an imminent move by the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates for a fourth time this year, perhaps as early as this morning. The Spanish government bond market bounced back up yesterday to end over a point higher, recovering part of the losses made in the previous two days. The market saw sharp declines of over a point on Tuesday and Wednesday as further news about the political corruption scandals triggered more selling, particularly by foreign investors. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, was forced to respond to political attacks about the recent scandals at a press conference. Two of Mr Gonzalez's ministers have resigned in recent days in connection with the scandals. Meanwhile Mr Mariano Rubio, the former governor of the Bank of Spain, was arrested late on Wednesday and charged with tax fraud. Yesterday saw some renewed buying interest in Spanish paper, inspired mainly by the realisation that Spanish 10-year yields were hovering close to 10 per cent, while the yield spread over 10-year German paper had widened out to well over 300 basis points. 'At close to 10 per cent yields, people felt there was relative value out there,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. The Spanish government bond futures contract quoted on Meff opened at 94.00 and touched a low of 93.55 early in the session, before climbing steadily back up to a high of 95.67 and ending the day at 95.36. The strength of the German economic recovery provided the main focus of attention in the German government bond market again, with some market participants wondering whether independent German economists are likely to revise their growth forecasts upwards again. 'The rise in unemployment was smaller than expected, and we continue to see signs that the German economy is recovering,' said one analyst. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 94.39, fell to a low of 93.77, and then climbed back up to a high of 94.44, settling at 94.32. Elsewhere in Europe, French government bond prices mostly followed bunds in the course of the day, despite a 10-basis-point cut in the intervention rate, from 5.70 per cent to 5.60 per cent. Dealers said the Treasury's auction of stock yesterday was generally well-covered, but they were disappointed at the yields accepted. The Treasury sold FFr13bn of 10-year stock with a 5.5 per cent coupon at an average yield of 7.09 per cent. The notional futures contract opened at 119.48 and settled at 119.24. UK gilts bounced back to end a point higher on the day, although dealers said the recovery in prices was technical. The gilt market will be focusing on the outcome of the local elections and the US data today.</p>

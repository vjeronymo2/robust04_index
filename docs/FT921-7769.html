			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Observer: Sentence(s) Ex-Guinness chief Ernest Saunders is transforming himself from famous defendant to respected pundit. Following appearances on television and radio, Saunders has now made his debut in the Solicitors Journal, where he argues that City-type offences which have resulted in no personal gain for the alleged offender should be removed from the criminal process. The fact is, he believes, that the public identifies fraud with stealing large sums of money and pocketing the proceeds. 'Maybe the law should follow this reality and find a new terminology for a category of regulatory offence without personal gain and with appropriate penalties and a tribunal,' he writes, somewhat inelegantly. Saunders' appearance for the first time since his release from jail last year, in apparent good health and spirits, has revived suggestions that the appeal court's halving of his sentence, and his release after serving 10 months, resulted from him having feigned illness. For the record, the medical evidence at his appeal was based on a brain-scan which showed abnormalities, the appeal judges halved his sentence because they thought it 'substantially too high' - adding that his illness did not justify immediate release - and, like any other prisoner, he became eligible for parole after serving a third of his sentence.</p>

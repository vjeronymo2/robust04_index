			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 24 Jun -- "The developing format of a  political G8, which includes Russia, must ensure that more  constructive solutions are reached to pressing international  problems, solutions based on mutual respect for the interests of  leading states and their responsibility for international  security and stability," says a statement which was distributed  today by the Committee on International Affairs of the Russian  Federation Council. The statement was issued in connection with  the summit of G7 countries which will be held in Naples on 9-10  July. The summit will be attended by Russian Federation  president Boris Yeltsin.    The results of the economic section of the forthcoming  summit  meeting will depend in many respects on whether there is a  readiness to set about real implementation of agreements reached  at previous summits on support for reform in Russia, a readiness  to take practical steps to intensify and develop them. The  statement stresses that "without Russia's participation it is  difficult to see how many global economic problems, including  the problem of foreign debt, can be effectively resolved. It  has to be recognized that Russia is not just a debtor but also a  creditor. Russia, which has inherited the huge debts owed to  the former USSR by developing countries, is entitled to  participate in the evolution of approaches to this problem by  other creditors of third world countries."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social </F> Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) by unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN  reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] A sensation has been caused by your  statement to the effect that "a general election should be held  just once under the current multiseat constituency system  through dissolution of the Diet by mutual consent."    [Murayama] We favored political reform bills and they were  subsequently approved by the Diet. It is natural that a general  election should be held under a new election system if a new  constituency map is made. However, this does not mean that the  Diet cannot be dissolved unless a new constituency map is drawn  up. When pending problems at home and abroad cannot be solved,  there is no other way but a general resignation of the cabinet  or a dissolution of the Diet. To listen to the will of the  public, the supreme leaders, and to make a fresh start, without  a mere rotation of the reins of government through dissolution,  are regular procedures of constitutional government. Some  people label those who favor dissolution of the Diet and a  general election under the current multiseat constituency system  as people who are intent on crushing political reform. However,  the nation will suffer a misfortune when the current minority  administration comes to a standstill but general elections are  prevented from taking place under whatever circumstances.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Is there any possibility of the SDPJ  submitting a no-confidence motion against the cabinet?    [Murayama] We will make our judgment after fully grasping  how the Hata administration conducts the affairs of state. We  are not bound by the fact that we voted Mr. Hata prime minister.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What is your stance toward the Hata  administration?    [Murayama] So long as the Hata administration takes over the  reformist line of the Hosokawa administration and promotes it,  we are ready to cooperate with it where cooperation is possible.  However, if the character of the Hata administration changes,  that will alter the case. We will take responsibility for the  budget bill and the bills related to the budget that we drew up  jointly when we were in the coalition government. As to matters  thereafter, we will adopt a free and unbiased policy.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What does the change of character of the  Hata administration mean specifically?    [Murayama] In addition to the remarks of former Justice  Minister Shigeto Nagano, a succession of remarks by the foreign  minister and the chief cabinet secretary about the right of  collective self-defense and a national emergency law is symbolic  of the fact that the Hata administration as a whole is  undergoing a change of character, whatever the prime minister  may say.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Then, you have no intention of rejoining the  coalition government?    [Murayama] The answer is no. If we rejoin the coalition  government now, it looks as if we have a lingering desire for  ministerial posts.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What is the SDPJ's next administrative  strategy?    [Murayama] We aim at forming a nucleus that can assume the  helm of state affairs by marshalling forces known as social  democratic liberals. We are ready to cooperate with forces that  have a democratic government in mind.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Is there any possibility of the SDPJ  reconsidering its platform and policy?    [Murayama] We must transform ourselves so that we can cope  with the changing times. However, we do not need to change our  doctrine or judgment formed on the basis of the spirit  underlying the SDPJ's creation to form a coalition government.  What a coalition government must do is agree on concrete  policies for the time being through mutual concessions.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Can you join forces with the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP]?    [Murayama] Joining forces with the LDP does not lead to a  change of politics. The Japanese people are expecting a change  in politics.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What is your view on North Korea's suspected  development of nuclear arms?    [Murayama] One-sided propaganda is much in vogue: Japan has  no alternative but to cooperate with the United Nations when  negotiations fail to solve the nuclear issue and when the United  Nations decides on sanctions against North Korea. There are  means for further negotiations and it is natural that we should  search for those means.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] How about tax reform?    [Murayama] In an aging society, we will face the problem of  how and who will bear the expenses for pensions, medical care,  nursing, and welfare. It is impossible to cover the increase of  burdens by income taxes alone. We have to pay attention to  assets and consumption to make the sharing of burdens just and  fair. We will have to discuss the best form of indirect taxes.  We will watch the moves of the tax reform council of the ruling  parties and draw our own conclusion.</p>

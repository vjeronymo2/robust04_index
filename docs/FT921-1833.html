			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Healey's pips - Ballot Box Denis Healey offered to pay Pounds 10 on BBC Breakfast News yesterday to anyone who can prove that he said 'I'll squeeze the rich until the pips squeak' when he was chancellor. We can't do that, but we can offer the original image: 'We will get everything out of her that you can squeeze out of a lemon and a bit more . . . I will squeeze her until you can hear the pips squeak.' That was Sir Eric Geddes as the first lord of the Admiralty in 1918. He was talking about Germany.</p>

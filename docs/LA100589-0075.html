			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OCTOBER IS THE PERFECT MONTH TO CELEBRATE THE APPLE;  </P> <P> POPULAR FRUIT CAN BE ENJOYED AS PART OF A BREAKFAST, LUNCH OR DINNER MENU  </P> <P> Celebrate October as Apple Month. Enjoy cold apple cider, apple pancakes, apple  strudel, apple dumplings and, of course, apple pie.  </P> <P> Want more? How about apple muffins, apple fritters, caramel apples, alcoholic  and non-alcoholic apple drinks?  </P> <P> According to the International Apple Institute, total apple production for 1988  was 9.1 billion pounds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says the dollar  value for the 1988 crop was $1.1 billion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rich in Fiber  </P> <P> Apples are rich in fiber, have no cholesterol and contain only 81 calories.  They range in flavor from sweet to tangy.  </P> <P> Apples are grown commercially in 35 states including Washington, New York,  Michigan, California, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina and West Virginia.  </P> <P> The season for apples begins in July and August, with early varieties such as  Gravenstein and Early Cortland, and continues through November with the  harvesting of such late varieties as the Golden Delicious and Granny Smith.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Popular Varieties  </P> <P>  -- The 15 most popular varieties of apples, listed in order of 1988  production, are: Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, McIntosh, Rome Beauty, Granny  Smith, Jonathan, York, Stayman, Newtown Pippin, Winesap, Idared, Cortland,  Northern Spy, R.I. Greening, Gravenstein.  </P> <P>  -- The Granny Smith is growing faster in popularity than any other variety, a  125% increase from the five-year average.  </P> <P> The International Apple Institute says more than half of the U.S. apple crop is  eaten as fresh fruit; the rest is processed into apple products including apple  juice and cider, applesauce, dried apples and canned apple slices. Other uses  include baby food, apple butter and jelly and vinegar.  </P> <P> You can enjoy apples from a local supermarket, produce stand or right off the  tree -- there are hundreds of "u-pick-em" orchards nationwide. For information  about orchards in your area, contact your state travel bureau, chamber of  commerce, or agricultural extension service.  </P> <P> Apples can be stored in the fruit bowl on the kitchen table. However, if you  don't plan to eat the apples right away, put them in the refrigerator. Cold  temperatures slow down the ripening process. Apples can be stored in the  vegetable crisper or in a plastic bag in the coldest part of the refrigerator.  If there isn't enough room in the refrigerator, wrap each unblemished fruit in  paper and store in slotted boxes in a cool, dark, well-ventilated storage area.  </P> <P> To freeze apples, core, peel and slice them, then dunk the slices in lemon  juice, and pack the slices closely in a container that can go into the freezer.  Or make a large batch of applesauce and freeze it in small containers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cooking Tips  </P> <P>  -- When using sliced apples in a cold dish like apple salad, rub all exposed  apple flesh with a mixture of equal parts of lemon juice and water so the  slices won't turn brown too quickly.  </P> <P>  -- Don't use water in apple pies or in brown Betty recipes. Apples are  naturally high in water content, so they rarely need any extra moisture for any  dish. When cooking applesauce, use only enough water to avoid scorching.  </P> <P>  -- Use apple pie filling as a topper for ice cream, or use on Belgian waffles  with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkling of cinnamon.  </P></p>

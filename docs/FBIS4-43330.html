			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. IP/94/517: "The Information Society and </F> Employment"]    [Text] "Diffusion of new technologies will contribute to  job creation in Europe," said Commissioner Martin Bangemann at  the European Information Technology Conference -- EITC '94 --  organised by the European Commission on 6-8 June in Brussels.    "What is the alternative?" -- asked Mr. Bangemann. "Either  we grasp the opportunities before us and master the risks, or we  bow to developments, together with all the disadvantages this  may entail. If the European Union would be late using new  technologies, we undoubtedly would lose competitiveness and  destroy employment. Job creation will occur mainly in new  services and in the `content' industries such as information  services and audiovisual programme production. At the same  time, this evolution will help preserve the diversity of  European culture."    The 1994 European Information Technology conference  coincided  with two important events: The launch of the fourth framework  programme for Community research and technological development  and the announcement of the report on "Europe and the Global  Information Society" by the high-level group chaired by  Commissioner Bangemann.    "We must keep up the momentum," said the Commissioner.  ``Three specific actions are expected to be developed on the  basis of this report during the German presidency: Accelerate  the current deregulation of telecommunications; prepare  necessary European regulations on domains such as intellectual  property rights, privacy and security; and promote experimental  applications.    ``We are in the midst of a revolution. In such a situation  of discontinuity, the costs of inaction are higher than the  costs of action. It is for this reason that I look to the  European Council meeting in Corfu on 24 June, as the occasion  where the necessary mechanisms for action should be set in  motion.    ``Action means: Adapting existing policies to change. That  is what we have done for the area of information technology in  the 4th R&amp;D framework programme. And now we must follow a  similar approach for other policies.''</p>

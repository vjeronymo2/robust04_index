			<p>EL92" to Kyoto University's Nuclear Energy Research Institute   <F P=102> 94FE0288B Tokyo GENSHIRYOKU SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 9 Dec  93 p 5 </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0288B </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo GENSHIRYOKU SANGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] In February of next year, the CRC Research Institute  is going to deliver a supercomputer system "Cray 92EL" made by  the U.S. firm Cray Research to Kyoto University's Nuclear Energy  Research Institute.    The CRC Research Institute received this order after it  participated in a recent general competitive tender for the  introduction of a computer system for Kyoto University's Nuclear  Energy Research Institute. This company introduced the first  supercomputer "Cray-1" into Japan, in 1980, and it has had  additional experience marketing Cray computers since 1992.    The Nuclear Research Institute plans to use this  supercomputer system to carry out large-scale and high-volume  scientific and technological computations and for experimental  research. Scientific and technological computations are to be  carried out across a wide spectrum of research fields, starting  with areas connected to nuclear power, such as nuclear reactor  safety, nuclear power plant operation safety and reliability,  and nuclear fusion reactor simulation, as well as new quantum  energy engineering research and man-machine system research  topics, including the high-precision analysis of boiling heat  transmission and mixture flow, Beam Engineering simulations, and  oscillating mechanisms for free-electron lasers. In the area of  experimental research, this system will be used to perform  functions such as analyzing and evaluating adaptive interface  devices which integrate and process various biological  information, an outer space-type interface which utilizes  virtual reality, and the design of man-machine systems.    The system to be provided is an epoch-making one, which  brings the functions of a Cray supercomputer to the desk-side.  In a cabinet 60 cm wide, 66 cm deep, and 104 cm tall, a maximum  of two processors, each of which has a theoretical maximum  capacity of 133 MFLOPS, can be installed.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Recruitment widens Proteus loss to Pounds 3.55m PROTEUS, the computer-aided molecular modelling company, reported increased losses of Pounds 3.55m in the year to end-March, but said it was making 'exceptional' progress in its development programme. Increased expenditure - including the cost of boosting the number of PhD's employed to 80 - led to an increase from the previous year's deficit of Pounds 2.41m, in line with the company's expectations. This expenditure meant all scheduled work could be supported for the foreseeable future. Losses per share rose from 10.86p to 13.52p. Despite not making a profit since it floated on the Unlisted Securities Market in 1990, the share price has almost defied gravity, rising from a launch price of 84p to yesterday's 368p, down 11p. This capitalises the company at over Pounds 100m, the largest of the blue sky high-technology pharmaceutical companies quoted in the UK that are yet to make a profit. Mr Kevin Gilmore, chairman said there had been particular progress in HIV/Aids, DNA-binding drugs, fish fertility control, animal immunocastration and arthritis. Shareholders had to date invested on faith and belief; but within 18 months to two years, the group should produce its first revenue streams, he said. Within the next year the group would be forming joint ventures with large international companies for the marketing of the drugs coming through. Among the first likely to come to the market were a diagnostic for Tuberculosis and one for BSE and scrapie in cattle and sheep respectively. Mr Gilmore said the value of the potential markets these could serve was not reflected in the share price. He added that six products were now heading for clinical trials or the veterinary equivalent. Mr Gilmore said he would not hesitate to go back to the market to raise more capital if there was proper justification.</p>

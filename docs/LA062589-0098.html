			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PARENTS AS PROTECTORS OF CHILDREN'S LIVES  </P> <P> In following the coverage of the tragic fire at the day-care center in  Huntington Beach, I am dismayed that there is no mention whatsoever of any  sympathy for Pat Orozco.  </P> <P> If the background you printed was accurate, it sounds like she was a very  conscientious person, doing a good job of caring for children for many years.  She was following instructions -- she got a fire extinguisher when she was told  to get either that or a smoke alarm.  </P> <P> It sounds like she made heroic efforts to rescue the children. Others tried and  were unable to do it. She was not only burned in the fire, she will be  emotionally scarred for life. The memory of this will be hell to live with.  </P> <P> What is left of her home? Is she covered by fire insurance? If not, how will  she rebuild? She made her living caring for children. Will she be able to do  this again? Will the stigma of this tragedy prevent parents from ever leaving  children in her care?  </P> <P> I do not mean to belittle the devastating tragedy that has occurred for the  families of the children. I simply think we should be recognizing the  heartbreak for Pat Orozco.  </P> <P> PHYLLIS KILLINGSWORTH  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

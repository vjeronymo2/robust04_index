			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> U.S. MEMO PROBES USE OF RICO IN TAX CASE  </P> <P> Remember the controversy over whether prosecutors in the recent  Princeton/Newport Partners trial were railroading the defendants by charging  them with racketeering for allegedly engaging in a securities-related tax fraud  scheme?  </P> <P> Despite claims that they were being overcharged because of their connection  with Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., five officials of the New  Jersey securities firm and a former Drexel trader were convicted last month of  violating the tough Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or  RICO.  </P> <P> Now, however, some apparent support for the defendants' position that RICO  should not have been used has surfaced from an unlikely source: an internal  U.S. Department of Justice memorandum.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mail Fraud Alleged  </P> <P> In a so-called blue sheet recently added to the policy manual for U.S.  attorneys, tax division chief Shirley D. Peterson noted: "It is the position of  the tax division that Congress intended that tax crimes be charged as tax  crimes and that the specific criminal law provisions of the Internal Revenue  Code should form the focus of prosecutions when essentially tax law violation  motives are involved, even though other crimes may technically have been  committed."  </P> <P> In the Princeton/Newport case, federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged that a  series of phony securities trades with Drexel, used improperly to realize tax  losses, constituted mail fraud -- and that the mail fraud was a RICO violation.  </P> <P> Peterson's memo, however, noted: "A similar policy will be followed with  respect to the filing of RICO charges predicated on mail fraud charges, which  in turn involve essentially only a tax fraud scheme. Tax offenses are not  predicates for RICO offenses -- a deliberate congressional decision -- and  charging a tax offense as a mail fraud charge could be viewed as circumventing  congressional intent unless unique circumstances justifying the use of a mail  fraud charge are present."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Going to Bring Up'  </P> <P> The memo, which does not mention the Princeton/Newport case, was added to the  manual on July 3 -- just two weeks after the Princeton/Newport trial began --  said a spokesman for the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys in Washington.  Peterson was unavailable for comment. Neal Cartusciello, a prosecutor in the  case, declined comment.  </P> <P> But defense attorneys said the memo could help efforts to get U.S. District  Judge Robert Carter to overturn the RICO verdict. While three defendants were  charged with stock manipulation and the tax scheme, three others were charged  only with the tax scheme.  </P> <P> "We're going to bring this up in our (appeal) papers," said defense lawyer  Robert Schwartz. "Judge Carter has approved an indictment that the Justice  Department now says it will never approve again."  </P></p>

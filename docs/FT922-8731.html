			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Letter: Bidder for Midland cannot sustain nationalist position Sir, The current debate about the future of the Midland Bank should be viewed from the perspective of the longer term dynamics of international banking. It is clear that the combined impact of technological and legal changes confront all banking organisations with stark choices. The fundamental difference between the two bids for Midland is that one is premised on an internationalist view of banking in the 1990s while the other is based on an essentially nationalist view. If Hong Kong and Shanghai gains control of Midland the UK will become home to another of the world's large banking organisations. Midland's customers, large and small, will have access to the facilities and competencies of a worldwide organisation. If Lloyds gains control of Midland, rationalisation will involve substantial job losses. The UK will still have only one truly international bank, reduced choice for small business borrowers (where margins are already good) and increased competition for big business borrowers (where margins are wafer thin or non existent). Moreover, Lloyds and Midland share virtually nothing in information technologies. So it is unlikely that rationalisation can proceed at a timescale to produce the rate of cost savings forecast by Lloyds. An inward looking strategy inevitably rests on the following premises that retreat from international pressures is possible; that banks 'own' their home markets; and that because continental banks have not yet entirely solved the problem of entering British markets they will never do so. There is no evidence to support these premises. All the research shows that the long run forces are completely opposite: existing protected positions within national markets are unsustainable as technology continues to transcend artificial national boundaries and existing suppliers seek to maintain growth and secure economies of scope and scale realisable through international expansion. Being a 'domestic' player may well have short-term attractions: downsizing with its emphasis on cost reduction together with a careful focusing on selected sectors and segments does offer shareholders short-term benefit. But the resulting bank organisation will be ill-suited to face the challenges of competitors which entered the international market place and won market share worldwide.

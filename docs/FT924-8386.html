			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: De La Rue achieves 48% advance to Pounds 46m A SUCCESSFUL acquisition helped De La Rue, which prints banknotes and makes cash-handling machines, boost pre-tax profits by 48 per cent to Pounds 46m in the six months to September 30. The UK group's figures reflected for the first time a full contribution from Inter Innovation, the Swedish competitor in payment systems for which it paid Pounds 94.7m last October. Turnover rose by 64 per cent to Pounds 272.7m. Mr Jeremy Marshall, chief executive, said the Swedish acquisition had, as predicted, not been dilutive. Indeed earnings per share grew by 23.2 per cent to 17p (13.8p). Mr Marshall said: 'I am delighted with the continuing progress De La Rue is making, which is reflected in these results. Security printing has continued to grow strongly, while the addition of Inter Innovation to payment systems has proved to be a valuable acquisition. In spite of depressed economic circumstances, prospects for De La Rue remain good.' The board said that the sustained increase in earnings, together with good prospects for the rest of the year, justified a 10 per cent increase in the interim dividend. from 3.5p to 3.85p. Mr Marshall said that in spite of the uncertain outlook for economic growth in the UK, and in many countries overseas, the order books in both security printing and payment systems remained strong. Demand for banknotes and other high-security documents grew particularly strongly in formerly Communist countries. Having raised Pounds 160.3m in a rights issue last year to help fund the Swedish acquisition, the group still has net cash of Pounds 109.9m. Interest receivable rose from Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 5.6m. COMMENT Mr Marshall's transform-ation of De La Rue has been one of the great City success stories of recent years, so a 5p drop in the group's shares to 648p seems a rather grudging response to these figures. Analysts were slightly concerned by the drop in security printing's profit margins, which reflect in-creased competition. However, they also acknowledged that Mr Marshall's cost-cutting skills should produce further benefits from Inter Innovation. Forecast full-year profits of about Pounds 96m put the shares on a premium prospective multiple of just over 18. Although the shares may not advance much in the short-term, the group is building a strong market position for the time when banks can afford the capital investment necessary to replace staff handling money with machines.</p>

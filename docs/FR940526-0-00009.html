			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, it has been determined that a national marketing quota for the 1994 MY of 33.7 million pounds is necessary to make available production of 32.0 million pounds. In accordance with section 312(b) of the 1938 Act, it has been further determined that the 1994 national marketing quota must be increased by 20 percent in order to avoid undue restriction of marketings. This results in a national marketing quota for the 1994 MY of 40.4 million pounds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, dividing the 1994 national marketing quota of 40.4 million pounds by the 1989&hyph;93, 5-year national average yield of 2,275 pounds per acre results in a 1994 national acreage allotment of 17,758.24 acres. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the provisions of section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, a national acreage factor of 1.05 is determined by dividing the national acreage allotment for the 1994 MY, less a national reserve of 40 acres, by the total of 1994 preliminary farm acreage allotments. The preliminary farm acreage allotments reflect the factors specified in section 313(g) of the 1938 Act for apportioning the national acreage allotment, less the national reserve, to old farms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Dark Air-Cured (Types 35&hyph;36) Tobacco <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The yearly average quantity of dark air-cured (types 35&hyph;36) tobacco produced in the United States, which is estimated to have been consumed in the United States, during the 10 MYs preceding the 1993&hyph;94 MY was approximately 10.6 million pounds. The average annual quantity of dark air-cured (types 35&hyph;36) tobacco produced in the United States and exported from the United States during the 10 MYs preceding the 1993 MY was 1.9 million pounds (farm sales weight basis). Both domestic use and exports have trended downward. Accordingly, a normal year's domestic consumption has been determined to be 10.0 million pounds and a normal year's exports have been determined to be 1.6 million pounds. Application of the formula prescribed by section 301(b)(14)(B) of the 1938 Act results in a reserve supply level of 31.6 million pounds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers and dealers reported stocks of dark air-cured (types 35&hyph;36) tobacco held on October 1, 1993, of 24.2 million pounds. The 1993 dark air-cured (types 35&hyph;36) tobacco crop is estimated to be 9.9 million pounds. Therefore, the total supply of dark air-cured (types 35&hyph;36) tobacco for the 1993 MY is 34.1 million pounds. During the 1993 MY, it is estimated that disappearance will total approximately 10.0 million pounds. By deducting this disappearance from the total supply, a carryover of 24.1 million pounds at the beginning of the 1994 MY is obtained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The difference between the reserve supply level and the estimated carryover on October 1, 1994, is 7.5 million pounds. This represents the quantity of dark air-cured (types 35&hyph;36) tobacco which may be marketed which will make available during such MY a supply equal to the reserve supply level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> More than 80 percent of the announced national marketing quota is expected to be produced. Accordingly, it has been determined that a national marketing quota of 8.8 million pounds is necessary to make available production of 7.5 million pounds. In accordance with section 312(b) of the 1938 Act, it has been further determined that the 1994 national marketing quota must be increased by 20 percent in order to avoid undue restriction of marketings. This results in a national marketing quota for the 1994 MY of 10.6 million pounds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, dividing the 1994 national marketing quota of 10.6 million pounds by the 1989&hyph;93, 5-year average yield of 2,105 pounds per acre results in a 1994 national acreage allotment of 5,035.63 acres. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the provisions of section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, a national acreage factor of 0.95 is determined by dividing the national acreage allotment for the 1994 MY, less a national reserve of 28.0 acres, by the total of 1994 preliminary farm acreage allotments. The preliminary farm acreage allotments reflect the factors specified in section 313(g) of the 1938 Act for apportioning the national acreage allotment, less the national reserve, to old farms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Travel: Clear the Highlands again] - Nicholas Woodsworth heads north in search of Scotland's great deserted wilderness Wednesday, en route The cafeteria food is awful, the traffic outside on the motorway north of London is bumper to bumper, and my history of the Highland Clearances lacks something of the zingy style required of holiday reading. A quick sample? ' . . . the entire population were then compressed into a space of 3,000 acres of the most barren land in the parish, and the remaining 130,000 acres were divided among six sheep farmers . . .' Normally, historical disputes of this sort have me rooting for the underdog. In this case, I feel won over wholeheartedly to the cause of absentee landlordism and sheep. Londoners should be so lucky as to have 3,000 acres of barren highland at their disposal - if my Scottish historian is looking for real compression, let him try the London Underground on a close summer's day. I am depressed by pawed-over countryside and cities that sprawl, one into another, far over the horizon. The idea that, somewhere on this island, is an area as wild and empty as any in western Europe is reassuring. I sigh with happy anticipation and abandon my soggy little motorway lunch. Who needs Vegetarian Bake when raw Scottish nature lies just around the corner? Thursday, Thurso Bring back cruel landlords, bring back mass evictions] Something has gone horribly wrong. In spite of everything the brochures say, the Highlands are swarming with people. At least, Thurso is. It is the town on the far north coast of Scotland where the ferry leaves for the Orkney islands. Not everyone, it seems, throngs the Mediterranean coasts in summer - at peak season, large numbers of Mediterraneans, seeking relief from the tourist invasion of the south, turn around and invade the north. Every bed and breakfast on the Orkneys is, consequently, full and the overflow, waiting for a free bed, is jammed into Thurso. I spend this evening in Sandra's Cafe with hordes of Italians. We all eat pizzas and watch video clips on the satellite channel MTV - hardly the Highland escape I was hoping for. The Orkneys, molto belle as they are, deserve a visit at a quieter time of year. Friday, Ullapool Ullapool is hardly any more peaceful. It is a pretty little town, three hours' drive north of Skye - far enough, I would have thought, to out-run the tour groups that ply the Highlands and Islands' routes. But no: the harbour-side street running along the quiet waters of Loch Broom is packed with tea rooms, souvenir shops and woollen mill outlets doing a roaring trade. It is not the Italians but the French who seem to have claimed Ullapool as their own. They are voracious shoppers. They snap up boxed presentation sets of single malt miniature bottles; silver-plate Nessie earrings, commemorating the yet-to-be-found monster; shortbread wrapped in Cellophane plaid; dismal videos of hairy men singing Danny Boy; and postcards of the what's-under-that-kilt variety. High road, low road, any road in between, few avenues are unexplored by Scottish kitsch. I have snapped up something, too - an Ordnance Survey map showing, I hope, an escape route away from these Highland horrors. On it, I have circled Achiltibuie, a village sitting on a single-track road on the Coigach peninsula north-west of Ullapool. My guidebook makes only passing mention of it. It has no Highland games, no castles, no shops selling woollens, no sheepdog trials, no Celtic music festivals, no celebrated golf courses, no stately homes open to the public from 10am to 5pm, no fragrant, peat-smoking distilleries to visit. It sounds a good bet. Saturday, Achiltibuie It is. What surprises as you drive into Achiltibuie is land, sea and sky, and just how much there is of each. The village, a thread of white-washed stone houses stretched along a rocky shore, hardly impresses itself upon the eye at all. It is nature that everywhere overwhelms - the bald, treeless moor sweeping down from the top of the hills to the edge of the sea; the confused archipelago of the Summer Isles sitting offshore like a great fleet caught in some muddled manoeuvre; fold upon fold of the mountains of Ross receding into infinity across a broad stretch of cold, north Minch water. What holds it all together in such soothing manner are the soft and muted colours of the Highlands. Forget Harris tweed. Slate greys and kelp greens, beech reds and wrack browns, bilberry blues and heather mauves all combine more subtly in this vast landscape than they do in any jacket. Repose for the eye is one thing, rest for the tired traveller another. Where to stay in this great uncluttered space? Along the whole Coigach coastline - five little communities spread along 15 miles of water - there are just 300 residents, one pub, and one small hotel. I pull up at the Summer Isles Hotel in Achiltibuie, drawn by the sound of fiddles and accordions. It is early, the afternoon sun still bright in a calm sky. But, outside the bar, in a little courtyard overlooking the sea, I spy a crowd of drinkers and half a dozen musicians flailing away in a wild storm of jigs and reels. In the parking lot I meet a tiny, silver-haired woman who tells me she was married here many years ago; today is her anniversary. The wedding was tragic, she laughs; the night before the reception, the fishing fleet sailed in. 'They drank the bar dry,' she says. 'Our tongues were on our knees, but you could'na get a drink for love nor money.' She rushes off to the bar to make up for it. Is this the perennial fear of all those present, their grounds for early and avid tippling? The fleet, one feels, must be just around the point and bearing down hard on Achiltibuie. There may be cheer and music aplenty at the Summer Isles Hotel today, but there is not a room to be had. 'Try Mrs Campbell,' someone suggests, whisky-inspired, giving me a telephone number. Finally, after a dram of this and a call to Mrs Campbell, a dram of that and a call to Mrs Barnes, more drams and more calls to Mrs Mackenzie and Mrs Macleod, I find myself a guest in the bed and breakfast establishment of Mrs Lottie Ross. There is nothing tweedy about my room, it is bright pink: pink bedspread, pink walls, pink carpet, pink lampshades. I like it, anyway. Outside, dim white puffs of sheep wander in the moonlight and the grey sea swells and surges on the ragged rocks below my window. Lottie and Jimmy Ross sit me down in front of a fire in their sitting room before they step out to the pub for the evening. 'Make yourself at home,' they say, showing me the coal scuttle and tea kettle. I am beginning to realise I am a long way from London. It is not that the Rosses are unaware of the nasty possibilities of leaving a complete stranger alone in their home - before he retired from the police force, Jimmy walked a beat in Glasgow. But things in Achiltibuie simply do not work the way they work elsewhere. Sunday On Sundays, in fact, most things do not work in Achiltibuie at all. 'This is Free Church of Scotland territory,' Lottie tells me over a truly magnificent, unstintingly generous, mountainously high-cholesterol fried breakfast. I have been asking about a fishing trip out on the Hectoria, the tour and sea-angling boat that leaves from Achiltibuie's little harbour. 'We're still a bit traditional and the Hectoria never sails on Sundays, I'm afraid. But we are beginning to move with the times - a few years ago, I couldn't even hang out my laundry to dry on a Sunday.' I have no laundry to hang out. But a vague Sunday morning mood of culpability persists - the product, no doubt, of too many Saturday evening whiskies. I make my way down the seaside road to a white, wooden building on the edge of the village. There is nothing for lingering guilt like a morning service at the Free Church in Achiltibuie. The Wee Frees, as they are known, get no prizes for interior decoration; their church makes the average anchorite's cell look like a riot of sensual abandon. There is no colour, no ornamentation, no graven image of any kind. There is no organ to give false courage to our singing. Nor is there even much chance, it seems, of redemption or forgiveness. There is just a stiff, wooden pew and the stern voice of Douglas Gebbie, the Free Church missionary, reminding us of our own awfulness. I suspect it does everyone gathered a power of good. It certainly does something for me. Stumbling out of the gloom, I emerge into bright sunshine, fresh northern air and a thousand sheep browsing on grass cropped as smooth as a bowling green. I feel exhilarated. Beyond the churchyard lies endless sea and island and mountain, a view that has not changed since creation. Once again, I sigh with happy anticipation. I have arrived in the Highlands.</p>

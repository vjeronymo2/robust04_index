Speaking on Monday [14 March] at the Korean Police Academy's  commencement ceremony in Yongin, about 40 kilometers East of  Seoul, the chief executive said the more advanced a country, the  more powerful its police. "Rule by law can be realized with a  strong police force... We can't maintain law and order with a  weak police force," he stressed.    Unlawful, violent demonstrations cannot be justifed under  any  circumstances, nor can any violations of law and order be  forgiven, he added.    "The people want the police to be a strong sentry of law and  order... The police must have a sense of mission to protect the  people and the nation," he said.    Kim said the government would not spare any efforts to  modernize the country's police force and to improve their  treatment and working conditions.</p>

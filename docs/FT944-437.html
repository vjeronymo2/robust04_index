			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Assad in surprise summit King Fahd of Saudi Arabia arrived unexpectedly in Alexandria yesterday for a summit meeting with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and President Hafez al-Assad of Syria. Mr Safwat el-Sherif, the Egyptian information minister, said it would focus on 'resolving Arab differences and co-ordinating efforts towards solidarity on Arab, regional and international levels'. There was speculation in Egypt yesterday that Mr Assad had sought the meeting to express his concern over the pace at which Israel was establishing relations with Arab countries, particularly in the Gulf, while still occupying large areas of Arab territory. Israel is talking to Qatar about the supply of gas, while Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, has just made a surprise visit to Oman. There has been no indication of an early Saudi move towards formal contacts with Israel, although Riyadh has given its blessing to the peace agreements involving Israel, the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Jordan. Syria and Israel have meanwhile made little progress in their negotiations over the Golan Heights, captured by Israel during the 1967 war.</p>

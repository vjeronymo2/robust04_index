			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Manufacturers report falls in output and export orders DOMESTIC and overseas demand for manufactured goods failed to live up to post-election expectations in all but one region of the UK. Manufacturers in almost every region also reported a fall in output over the past four months and all reported continuing job losses in a survey which showed that southern England and the West Midlands remain the areas worst affected by the recession. According to the latest survey of regional trends from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and Business Strategies Limited (BSL), the decline in orders since April was due to worse-than-expected export orders and a sharp decline in demand for intermediate goods. Northern Ireland was the only region to experience an increase in demand for manufactured goods. It was also one of only three regions - the others being the East Midlands and East Anglia - to report a slight rise in output, against eight that expected an improvement when last surveyed in April. The outlook for employment remained grim, with manufacturing job losses reported in every region. The fastest falls were in the West Midlands, the north-west, south-west and south-east, but the rate of job shedding eased in Wales, East Anglia and the East Midlands. Official figures out today are expected to show there was another big rise in unemployment in July. Yesterday, the Alfred Marks Bureau, an employment agency, said vacancies for full-time jobs fell by 8 per cent in July compared with a year ago. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the survey showed that British business was losing hope. 'There is no point ranking each region to see which is doing worst. The key point of this survey is that all regions are in trouble,' he said. The CBI and BSL pointed out that earlier expectations of rising orders of intermediate goods proved misplaced. A recovery in such goods, which are used as inputs by other industries, is a frequent development at the beginning of an upturn. In fact, regions with a high concentration of companies manufacturing intermediate goods, such as chemicals and metals, suffered the most disappointing falls in output. These included the north and Yorkshire and Humberside. Scotland, the region with the smallest proportion of intermediate goods manufacturers, fared better than other regions, while Wales, due to its good export performance, was also less badly affected.

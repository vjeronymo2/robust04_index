			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Herald is sold to management for Pounds 74m A TEAM of managers and editors yesterday completed the Pounds 74m management buy-out of the Herald, formerly the Glasgow Herald, one of Scotland's quality newspapers. It was purchased from George Outram, which is owned by Lonrho. The MBO, which involves funds with a total value of Pounds 93.5m, was organised by Robert Fleming, the merchant bank, and is backed by Scottish banks and financial institutions. It was welcomed in Scotland as the return to Scottish ownership of a significant formerly Scottish-owned company. Lonrho acquired Outram in 1979 when it bought Scottish &amp; Universal Investments. Outram is being sold to reduce Lonrho's substantial debt. In addition to The Herald, Outram publishes the Evening Times, the Glasgow evening paper, and magazines including the Scottish Farmer. The sale does not include The Observer. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, had offered Pounds 70m for the remainder of Outram, but was outbid by the MBO team and did not wish to get involved in an auction. The MBO, which has formed a company called Caledonian Newspaper Publishing, was the inspiration of Mr Liam Kane, managing director of Outram. Its executive directors include Mr Arnold Kemp, editor of The Herald, and Mr George McKechnie, editor of the Evening Times. Under the deal debt of Pounds 43m has been underwritten by Bank of Scotland, Royal Bank of Scotland and Robert Fleming to finance the acquisition and Caledonian's future working capital requirements. Mezzanine debt of Pounds 10m has been underwritten by 3i and Fleming. Some Pounds 40.5m of equity has been underwritten by Fleming. The executive directors will initially own 6 per cent of the ordinary equity, while 3 per cent will be set aside for employees through an employee share scheme. Outram, which employs 1,000 people, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.6m on sales of Pounds 58.4m in the year to September 30 1991. Mr Kane said last night that profitability had to improve, and there would be changes in the way the papers were run, which would be discussed with staff. 'I don't think staff should be nervous,' he added. Editorial independence was guaranteed. He said he hoped to install a full page electronic composition system by the end of the year, and add new colour printing units. Some Pounds 12m of the capital raised is being used to eliminate leasing finance from the balance sheet.</p>

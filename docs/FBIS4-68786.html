			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Pavel Borodin, administrator of affairs of </F> the president of the Russian Federation, by Andrey Uglanov:  "Ministers Come and Go, but the Administrative Machinery  Remains"]    [Text] State machinery is eternal. Without it--there  is anarchy and chaos. The ministers, deputies, and the thousands  of people who stand behind them need housing, communications,  and the organization of rest. Our interlocutor is Pavel Borodin,  administrator of affairs of the president of the Russian  Federation.    [Uglanov] Pavel Pavlovich, what is the secret of your very  rapid career--from Yakutia to Moscow, and immediately to the  Kremlin?    [Borodin] I am an economist by education. I did not engage  in  party work. I spent the last five years as mayor of Yakutsk. I  did not write slogans, I worked. In 1990 Boris Yeltsin flew to  Yakutsk during the harshest season: December, the temperature  was minus 57 degrees centigrade, and the aircraft barely landed.  He looked at how the economy of the city was being run under  these very difficult conditions. Apparently, he remembered what  he saw. Last year I received an invitation to Moscow. I did not  refuse.    [Uglanov] You were a people's deputy of the Russian  Federation. Do you have any nostalgic feelings for those times?    [Borodin] It is impossible simply to up and severely  criticize everything that was done by us. We legislatively  turned the economy toward the market, and we introduced the  institution of the president in Russia. At the same time, I  cannot say that our successors got rid of all the defects of the  preceding convocation. As for nostalgia, three years as a deputy  contained so many events that they will never leave my memory.    [Uglanov] Just what are the presidential services? How and  with what is the numerous retinue provided?    [Borodin] Even though we are called the administration of  affairs of the president of the Russian Federation, we are more  like a federal service that supports the vital activity of all  the higher federal organs of authority. I have in mind the staff  of the president, the government apparatus, the staff of the  Federation Council and the State Duma, and the apparatus of all  the courts: the Constitutional Court, Supreme Court, and Court  of Arbitration. It is maintenance of buildings, reconstruction,  technical reequipping, motor vehicle service, rest, and hotel  management. There are more than 30,000 workers and 75  enterprises in the administration of affairs. These are  government buildings, the Kremlin, hotels, truck farms, rest  homes, tailoring establishments, and shoe repair shops. That is,  a state within a state.    [Uglanov] The circle is closed? Previously there was an  administration of affairs of the CPSU Central Committee. It was  also responsible for everything.    [Borodin] We combined the administration of affairs of the  CPSU Central Committee, the USSR Supreme Soviet, the USSR  Council of Ministers, the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR, and the  RSFSR Council of Ministers. The number of chiefs was reduced by  a factor of exactly five. Practically all the workers remained.  It was very difficult to retain top professionals at a wage of  10-15,000 rubles [R]. But now we have been authorized to support  our own budget owing to commercial activity. All summer home  operations have been removed from the state budget and are on  self-financing. The same goes for hotels.    [Uglanov] You are a high-ranking civil servant. Many think  that indispensable attributes of a civil servant are a big  chair, a beautiful secretary, and long negotiations behind a  lavish table with drinks.    [Borodin] I essentially have a nonstandard workday. In a  year's work here I had only a couple of free Sundays. I have a  car telephone, a summer home telephone, and a home telephone. I  can be called and contacted everywhere. There is work, work... I  have been in this position a year, and I would like to say  several good words to the workers of the administration of  affairs and support those civil servants with whom we work.    [Uglanov] There is a visible side of the life of a civil  servant. But there is also an invisible side, which in our  consciousness is associated with some kind of pleasures that are  not accessible to everyone.    [Borodin] He does not receive pleasures very often, and not  very much. The average wage is R150-200,000. The very highest,  of course, even get R700,000. Civil servants of higher rank get  personal summer homes. I have in mind ministers and chiefs of  main administrations.    [Uglanov] Summer homes with cooks?    [Borodin] There is a law which was adopted by the former  Supreme Soviet. Only guarded persons are provided cooks. There  are about 20 such persons today. They have both cooks and guards.    [Uglanov] Are these summer homes being privatized.    [Borodin] No. According to an edict of the president, the  privatization of state summer homes is categorically prohibited.    There is a second category of senior civil servants, of  which  there are about 150. They have summer homes year round. There  are also those who get summer homes only for the summer season.  There are approximately 200 of these persons. We rent some of  the summer homes to commercial structures: Resources are needed  to maintain this operation. Moreover, the civil servants and  businessmen live separately. There is a system of rest homes for  Saturdays and Sundays.    [Uglanov] When the Politburo was located here, people were  invited to work in Moscow, frequently through political  influence. They were given elegant apartments. How is your  practice different?    [Borodin] We are now doing our own construction, on the  order  of 200-300 apartments a year. We also have an agreement with the  Government of Moscow about acquiring another 500 apartments in a  year. A tough procedure for their allocation has been  established. If we invite ministers or first deputy ministers to  Moscow, they receive a right of permanent residence without a  license. If a rank lower, the inviting structure pays for the  license, Very few prestigious apartments are being built.  Ordinary prefabricated houses.    [Uglanov] As far as I can recall, every ruler who comes to  power in Russia tries to build himself a residence. And Boris  Nikolayevich?    [Borodin] He has a number of suburban residences. All of  this  corresponds to diplomatic protocol. Everything remains that  there was before. No new residences are being built or financed.  There are many rumors. But I work on this matter directly. He  leads the life of an ordinary person.    [Uglanov] The Soviet Union had significant property abroad.  There were rumors that there are islands in the Aegean Sea that  were given to Russian tsars at one time.    [Borodin] This is a very difficult question. There are no  intergovernmental agreements. What was in Ukraine became  Ukrainian, and what was in the Baltics became Baltic.    [Uglanov] That is all the Crimean residences of the Russian  emperors...    [Borodin] Yes. They are going to ruin, because they require  proper capital investments. They have to be reconstructed, and  it is necessary to manage them. It is generally a paradox: It is  better to let them go to ruin, to collapse, but not to give them  to anyone.    [Uglanov] Do you have any contacts with your colleagues in  Ukraine?    [Borodin] We are attempting to prepare a number of  intergovernmental agreements. With both Ukraine and the Baltics.  But everything is getting bogged down.    [Uglanov] You are an experienced executive. Do you sense  that  it is already possible to work in Russia, or do you use the  "sovereign's knout?"    [Borodin] As for the sovereign's knout, this is absolutely  not the case. We want to work in a rule-of-law, economic space  of Russia, and only according to its laws.    Some regulating laws, edicts, and statutes are necessary.  There are many complicated problems. But today we have the kind  of society in which people who are able to work feel like a fish  in water. There are difficulties outside the borders of the  Russian Federation. But inside, any problem can be resolved, if  you are able to work. Specialists have already grown up in the  banking business, in construction, in trade; moreover, they are  young men. Today, heads decide everything. And there is an  infinite number of proposals.</p>

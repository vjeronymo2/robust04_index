			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): A taxing time ahead - Charles Batchelor answers queries raised by the Inland Revenue's new Pay and File system On quiet days accountants have been known to mull over the story of the legendary company which has never agreed a corporation tax assessment with the Inland Revenue since 1965 when the tax was introduced in the UK. If that company does exist, it is in for a shock. From the start of next month the present system of paying corporation tax is to be replaced by one known as the Pay and File method. Out goes the present procedure which can involve a Revenue assessment, a preliminary payment accompanied by an appeal and final agreement on the tax liability 12 to 15 months after the year-end. In comes a system requiring companies to assess their own liability for tax coupled with a prompt payment of the amounts due. There will still be room for later adjustments but the Revenue's intention is to speed up the whole process of calculating and collecting corporation tax. At present three-quarters of the 800,000 tax assessments issued annually are estimated. The new system will put a greater responsibility on the company to get the calculation of its tax liability right the first time. Not only does Pay and File mean that the Revenue gets its money sooner. It also frees tax inspectors to devote more time to making inquiries and pursuing investigations, warns John Whiting, tax partner at accountants Price Waterhouse. Companies should enjoy the benefit of having a clearer view of their tax affairs and will also be freed from the administrative burden of the present system. But they may also end up paying their tax a little earlier and would be well advised to bring their tax affairs up to date before the new system comes into force. Seventy per cent of the effort which goes into computing a company's tax liability is taken up by data collection, says Richard Collier-Keywood, tax partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Relatively minor changes to a company's systems can lead to big savings in the work involved, he suggests. But companies are often slow to respond to the details of tax changes and many have still to take action, notes Joy Svasti-Salee, tax partner at KPMG Peat Marwick. Pay and File is only one in a series of tax changes which companies have had to absorb in recent months. At the start of the year they had to deal with a radical change in the VAT system to coincide with the launch of the European single market while an unusually fat Finance Act brought in a raft of changes in many areas. Nor are companies the only ones to suffer. Details of a new system of self-assessment for the unincorporated business and the self-employed are expected in the November budget. Implementation will probably be delayed until 1996-97 so small businesses will have a breathing space. Q. What will be the main changes brought about by Pay and File? A. Companies will be required to assess their own tax liability with a greater degree of accuracy. Tax will have to be paid within nine months of the year-end and the return submitted within 12 months of the year-end. Q. When will the new system take effect? A. It will apply to accounting periods ending on or after October 1 1993. There will be no transitional arrangements. Q. Will the new system affect the amount of tax I pay? A. There will be no change in the way your tax liability is calculated by the Revenue. Only the administration and payment procedures will change. Q. Will assessments be abandoned altogether? A. No. An assessment will be issued once the Revenue has agreed your liability. But the number of estimated assessments should be significantly reduced - though they may still be needed in cases of dispute. The normal appeals procedure will continue to apply. Q. What happens if I do not submit my return on time? A. Automatic penalties will be levied for late filing, starting at Pounds 100 and rising to Pounds 1,000 plus 20 per cent of the unpaid tax for longer delays and repeated failures. The penalties start low but can build up rapidly if a company fails to keep to deadlines. Q. What happens to the present system of charging interest if payment is delayed? A. Pay and File should lead to a simpler and more immediate system for calculating interest on late payments and overpayments. Interest on tax paid late will run automatically from the date payment was due to the actual date of payment. The Revenue will pay interest on any over-payment you make but at a lower rate than that charged on late payments. Q. What should I do if I realise I have not paid enough tax? A. It will be to your benefit to make an additional payment immediately to avoid interest and possibly penalty charges. The Revenue will not prompt you to make additional payments. Q. What should I do if I do not have all my figures ready in time to complete my tax return? A. You should do your best to estimate your likely liability but you should explain why you are making an estimate and the basis for your calculations. Top up any underpayment as soon as possible. Q. What if I think the inspector may not agree with my calculations? A. You could submit your return well before the payment date so that contentious issues can be cleared up. This would minimise the risk of having to pay interest or penalties. Q. I have been late in preparing for the introduction of Pay and File. What can I do to make up lost time? A. You should make sure any tax backlog which has built up under the present system is cleared. The Revenue has said it will not accept a backlog from previous years as a reasonable excuse for failing to submit a return on time. You should also review your accounting systems to ensure they can produce the information you need. You should plan a timetable for producing future accounts and tax returns. It may make sense to allocate responsibility for understanding and handling Pay and File to one or two people in your company.

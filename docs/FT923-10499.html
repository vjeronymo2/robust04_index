			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Cumulative losses of Dollars 358m in swaps market CUMULATIVE losses in the swaps market total Dollars 358m, or 0.115 per cent of the notional principal amount of swaps outstanding, according to a survey released yesterday by the International Swap Dealers Association. The survey was conducted among ISDA members, who account for about 70 per cent of the Dollars 4,300bn swaps market. 'More than 90 per cent of the swap transactions in the portfolios surveyed were with investment grade counterparties. This confirms the traditional high credit quality of swap counterparties,' said Mr Akira Watanabe of Mitsubishi Bank, vice-chairman of the association. UK local authorities were the source of almost 50 per cent of the Dollars 358m of net losses. Other categories of counterparties representing net losses were companies (26 per cent), non-dealer financial institutions (17 per cent), and US savings and loans institutions (6 per cent). The report provided added ammunition for the association's fight in the US against attempts to move over-the-counter swaps and options business on to regulated exchanges, and bolstered ISDA's argument against calls for greater regulatory control of over-the-counter derivatives business. Some bank regulators have expressed concern that over-the-counter derivatives business is increasing the level of risk undertaken by banks. ISDA pointed out that losses in the swaps market compare favourably to other types of credit losses.</p>

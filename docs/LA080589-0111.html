			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. CAR PRICES WILL REMAIN STABLE, STUDY SAYS  </P> <P> U.S. car sales are likely to grow by less than 1% a year through the year 2000  and prices should remain steady, leading to heated competition for buyers,  according to a University of Michigan study released Friday.  </P> <P> The Delphi V forecast also found that auto industry officials do not expect  cars of the 1990s to be as technologically advanced as they had predicted in  earlier studies.  </P> <P> The biennial report by the university's Center for the Study of Automotive  Transportation said the domestic market will remain mature through the next  decade, with more products offered to a relatively fixed set of customers.  </P> <P> The Delphi forecast, based on questionnaires sent to about 750 executives,  automotive engineers, consultants and others associated with the industry,  predicted that passenger car sales in the decade will grow by less than 1% a  year from 10.1 million in 1990 to 10.9 million in the year 2000.  </P> <P> At the same time, prices are likely to remain stable. A typical $14,000 car  today will cost $15,000 in 1995 and $15,900 in the year 2000. The typical  $15,000 import model will rise to $17,000 in 10 years, the survey estimated.  </P> <P> The key elements that will mark competition in the next decade are quality,  cost and product innovation, the study said. "Both world-class cost and quality  are considered as just entrance tickets to the international competition of the  future," the forecast noted.  </P> <P> It said the intensity of competition will accelerate and the winning companies  will be those able to develop strong relationships with their customers. The  forecast predicted that auto makers will have to think increasingly in terms of  quality for the life of their products, not just until the warranty runs out.  </P> <P> In 1987, at least one-third of Delphi participants thought plastic could  replace steel by 1995 in key body parts such as hoods, fenders and rear panels.  This year, 20% of respondents or fewer thought plastic would be used in  important parts of the auto body.  </P> <P> In another area, the new study predicted that collision warning systems are the  most likely safety feature to be incorporated in cars during the next decade.  Other expected safety improvements include improved exterior and interior crash  protection, anti-lock brake systems and radar brakes.  </P> <P> The study found that many industry officials believe that the percentage of  foreign parts on cars built by the Big Three U.S. auto makers will rise if no  domestic content legislation is passed.  </P> <P> Estimating that 21% of parts on U.S. cars are now foreign built, the study  predicted that the figure will rise to 26% by 1995 and 30% by 2000. More parts  will be produced in Mexico and South America, while fewer parts will be  imported from Japan, the study said.  </P></p>

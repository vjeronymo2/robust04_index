			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Japan looks at options for Pyongyang sanctions Japanese government departments and agencies are considering the prospect of measures against North Korea if the United Nations Security Council adopts sanctions, Tokyo said yesterday. The move, revealed by Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, marks Tokyo's growing alarm over North Korea's defiance of international pressure to open its nuclear sites to full inspections. Pyongyang's suspected development of missiles capable of reaching Japan, with or without nuclear warheads, has heightened public anxiety. Until recently, Japan shared China's reluctance to consider economic penalties, for fear of further isolating Pyongyang's unpredictable leaders. But Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa told US President Bill Clinton at their summit last month that Tokyo would take part in sanctions if the Security Council called for them. Official Japanese exports to North Korea totalled Dollars 250m (Pounds 148m) in 1991, making it the country's second largest trade partner after China, according to the Japan External Trade Organisation. But North Koreans living in Japan are estimated to remit another Dollars 600m a year in cash. The possibility of sanctions puts more pressure on the Japanese government to curb unofficial remittances to North Korea, a sensitive political problem. Support for the North Korean regime from the Social Democratic Party, the largest member of Mr Hosokawa's seven-party coalition, has declined since last year's visit to South Korea by Mr Sadao Yamahana, the former Socialist leader. But some analysts believe North Koreans in Japan are generous contributors to Socialist election funds. North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons programme will be on the agenda when South Korea's President Kim Young-sam meets Mr Hosokawa tomorrow, at the start of a three-day visit to Japan. They are also expected to discuss US deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea and timing of US-South Korean military exercises.</p>

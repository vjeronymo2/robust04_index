			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Harrisons &amp; Crosfield advances 15% to Pounds 98m Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, the chemicals and commodities and feeds group, announced a 15 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 98m for 1993 in spite of a poorer than expected result from the agricultural feeds business acquired for Pounds 67m in 1992. Sales were 14 per cent ahead to Pounds 2.21bn (Pounds 1.93bn). The shares edged back 4p to 205p. Mr Bill Turcan, the finance director who will take over as chief executive in May, said some of the difficulties which had hit the feeds business last year and prompted the trading statement in December would continue to affect the company into the first quarter. Nevertheless, he was cautiously optimistic about further growth in 1994. Earnings per share benefited from a lower than expected tax charge and rose by 13 per cent to 8.6p (7.6p). However the total dividend is uncovered at an unchanged 9p with a proposed maintained final of 5.4p. The collapse in pig prices and a sharp fall in margins on compound feeds left profits at BOCM Pauls 28 per cent lower. 'We missed our targets on BOCM by a mile,' Mr Turcan said. Compound feed margins had since recovered, but pig prices remained some 16 per cent lower than 1992 levels. The difficulties at BOCM left operating profits in the food and agriculture division 2.3 per cent lower at Pounds 37.9m. The other businesses in the division had performed well, Mr Turcan said, with profits, excluding BOCM, about 15 per cent ahead. The chemicals business increased operating profits by 44 per cent to Pounds 39.9m, or by 30 per cent after adjusting for reorganisation costs. The businesses had benefited from increased demand and an industrial restructuring which had left capacity more in line with demand, Mr Turcan said. Timber and building supplies suffered a two point fall in margins in the second half, as sales began to accelerate. Cost-cutting helped the division report a 31 per cent increase in operating profits on sales 9 per cent ahead to Pounds 786m. Plantations advanced by 20 per cent to Pounds 24.2m. The effects of the devaluation of sterling largely offset the decline in the dollar price of palm products. COMMENT The main attraction of Harrisons in recent years has been its substantial yield premium. However, this is beginning to look a bit less seductive as the quality of that yield comes under pressure. Harrisons has neither earnings nor cash to cover its dividend, leaving it with limited room for manoeuvre. The recovery may offer some solace, but there may be others in the sector with more flexibility. Forecasts range between Pounds 115m and Pounds 120m, with the prospective p/e hovering around 19. The shares may tread water until they go ex-dividend, when the main attraction fades.</p>

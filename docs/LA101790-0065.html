			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> JORDAN RANCH BACKED  </P> <P> Through the Jordan Ranch project there is a good chance that we can get a lot  of open space donated to the Santa Monica Mountains for public use if we act as  responsible people instead of selfish people who have all they want.  </P> <P> I have lived in the Conejo Valley for 20 years and have seen a lot of wonderful  growth.  </P> <P> Some of the growth has been less than acceptable. Through the years we have  learned what is good and what is abused. The Jordan Ranch development is by far  one of the best land uses I have seen.  </P> <P> For the few people who think Bob Hope should give all his land to the Santa  Monica Mountains, please think about giving away all of your land in the valley  to them. I don't think that is a fair thing to ask. What he has offered is fair  and we should act.  </P> <P> Most of the people opposed to this project have lived in our valley only a few  years. The new houses that they live in would never have been built if we, the  longtime residents, took the view that they are taking. Think about that,  please. We all need to be fair to each other.  </P> <P> KENNETH MYERS  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

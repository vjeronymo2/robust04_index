			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / British retailers warned of threat to profits: Survey points to challenge from discount stores BRITISH retailers risk a sharp decline in profitability unless they drastically reduce their costs and improve operating efficiency, says a study by McKinsey, the international management consultancy. It says the British retailing industry increasingly faces market conditions similar to those in the US. They included much greater price sensitivity among consumers and the expansion of discount stores, which threatened sales volumes at traditional outlets. British retailers had yet to adjust to those challenges, though. On average, they had much poorer productivity, higher labour costs and higher prices than their American counterparts, which were more advanced in use of automation. McKinsey argues that keener competition will increase pressure on the UK industry to move closer to US standards of efficiency and to lower prices. It says British supermarkets are particularly exposed to these trends, even though they are the only retail sector that is consistently more profitable and efficient than in the US. The unpublished study estimates that a 12 per cent cut in UK supermarkets' prices would wipe out their profits. If they lowered prices to US levels, they would need to reduce the prices they pay suppliers by 28 per cent, or cut labour and fixed costs by 75 per cent, to maintain recent profitability. The study is based on a survey of retail prices covering 268 products at stores in the US and Britain. They include food and drink, clothing and footwear, household products, consumer electronics, toys and cosmetics. The survey finds that, on average, the products cost 32 per cent more in Britain, including local taxes, and 22 per cent more before tax. The comparison is based on the exchange rate of Dollars 1.60 to the pound when the survey was made late last year. The dollar has since risen to close at Dollars 1.478 to the pound in London on Friday. However, the average difference between prices of the products surveyed would not be eliminated unless the dollar rose above Dollars 1.22 to the pound. The biggest price difference was for do-it-yourself goods, which were 77 per cent more expensive in Britain, after tax, and the smallest was for clothing, which cost 17 per cent more. Prices at fast-food restaurants were 44 per cent higher in Britain, while toys were 37 per cent dearer and electrical goods cost 29 per cent more. Personal care products and food, most of which carries VAT at zero rates in Britain, cost about a quarter more there. Transatlantic prices are an ocean apart, Page 7</p>

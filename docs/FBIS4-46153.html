			<p>CSO     [Text] Jammu, April 17--Pakistani agencies have issued  fresh directions to some militant outfits and their agents  operating in Jammu and Kashmir to kill India's political  leaders, according to top official sources, reports PTI.    The sources said, that recently intercepted radio messages  from across the border revealed that major contacts within the  state have been told to attack political leaders wherever  possible.    This, the sources said, was being done to thwart the  initiation of political process and subsequent elections in  Jammu and Kashmir.    The major targets, according to these messages, were the top  leaders of the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference and of the  pradesh Congress committee.    However, leaders from the Janata Dal and CPM [Communist  Party  of India] were also placed high on the target lists.    One message intercepted during the recent Jammu tour of the  Union minister of state for internal security, Mr Rajesh Pilot,  had asked its contacts to do "anything" to eliminate the  visiting dignatary.    In view of these threats, most of the political  personalities  in the state, including those in the Jammu region, have been  provided with a tight security cover in the form of armed guards  at their residences. More than 2,000 police personnel were  deployed for security cover duty in the state.    There were about 550 to 600 politicians and other political  activists who had migrated from Kashmir to Jammu and Delhi after  several political leaders and former legislators were killed in  the Valley.    The militants recently gunned down Mr Wali Mohammed Itto,  the  former speaker of the J and K assembly and Mr Ghulam Qadir Mir,  a former independent MLA [Member of Legislative Assembly] and  close lieutenant of Sheikh Abdullah.    While Mr. Itto was killed outside a mosque after offering  prayers in Khati-ka-Talab area of Jammu on March 18, Mr. Mir was  shot dead in his house at Muran village of Pulwama district in  Kashmir valley on April 9.</p>

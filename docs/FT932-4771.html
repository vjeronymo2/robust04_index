			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Unions protest over Ford imports UNIONS protested to Ford, the car producer, yesterday over the import of 2,000 Fiestas from a plant in Spain, Diane Summers writes. The AEEU engineering union said it was 'shocked' by the imports, which followed the shedding of 4,000 Ford jobs in the UK last year. The TGWU transport union said the company had 'let too many people go' at the plant in Dagenham, London, at which Fiestas are made. The unions added that they had been assured by the company that no cars would be imported. Ford said yesterday it was importing the cars because the assembly line at Dagenham was being updated. The work coincided with a projected increase in demand for Fiestas this summer. The company said: 'Even if we had twice as many workers at Dagenham they could not make enough vehicles because of the equipment constraint.' The Dagenham factory employs about 9,000 workers and produces 900 cars a day.</p>

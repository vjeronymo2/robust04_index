			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Survey of Bangladesh (4): The people can only take so much - The economy is improving but the international paymasters remain dissatisfied A DECADE ago Bangladesh was in trouble with its international creditors for failing to meet economic targets. Last year it exceeded most targets, but this was still not good enough. The painful reality is that more still needs to be done before the invisible hands guiding the economy - the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank - can be withdrawn. 'I am in a predicament,' says Mr Saifur Rahman, the finance minister who is credited by donors and the multilateral lending agencies with having achieved success so far. 'How far can I go in attaining the targets without threatening our fragile democracy?' Surgery is being applied at two levels to the heavily-regulated economy. Under its agreement with the IMF, Bangladesh is seeking to liberalise trade, overhaul the tax and tariff regime and improve the balance of payments. Mr Saifur has met all the targets laid down by the IMF: inflation is 5.0 per cent, down from 7.2 in the previous year; money supply growth has been contained to less than 14 per cent, largely as a result of low demand for loans in the private sector; government expenditure has been curbed; the current account deficit is down and foreign reserves are at a record high of Dollars 2bn, though a large component of this is money from donors waiting to be spent. Second, a World Bank reform package aims to improve the domestic competitive environment. This should be achieved by privatising state-owned industries. Most state industries are uncompetitive, have massive excess capacity, are over-manned and burdened with bad debt. The jute sector, fattened by years of easy credit, crippled by plummeting world jute prices in the 1980s and now burdened with bad debts of Dollars 925m, presents the government with its most formidable challenge. Under the IMF's macro-programme the biggest success has been tax collection, which has risen by 10 per cent net of inflation well ahead of target. The finance minister's doggedness in achieving this has provoked criticism from a powerful business lobby in parliament (59 per cent of MPs are businessmen). Better tax mobilisation has enabled the government to increase its contribution to the annual development programme, which covers capital projects and is largely financed by aid. In 1989, the programme was wholly funded by donors. This year the government is aiming for a 27 per cent contribution, rising to 30 per cent in 1993-94. Higher tax revenues and tighter curbs on spending - high wage demands notwithstanding - have also enabled Mr Rahman to cut the fiscal deficit from 8 per cent of GDP in 1989-90 to 5 per cent last year. The big issue facing the finance minister in his next budget is how to sustain the revenue drive while containing spending, mostly salaries. But the World Bank reform programme will prove the greater test. Privatisation forms the core of the package. 'Our government is committed to this programme. We must reform sectors, improve management, withdraw obsolete equipment and make them competitive. But this will take time,' says Mr Rahman. Many believe it is taking too long. Two years ago 42 companies were nominated by the government for privatisation but none of these plans has advanced. 'Privatisation should have been a clear signal to the private sector that the government means business. But they have made a mess of it by trying to sell the least attractive (jute) first and the best last,' says an economist. Three main problems confront Mr Rahman in making his privatisation package stick: the realisation that the jute, sugar processing, textile and other industries operated in what a senior World Bank official describes as an 'unparalleled debt culture'. These debts would almost certainly have to be written off as part of any restructuring. resistance from organised labour which fears massive job losses. and the bureaucrats charged with implementing the programme have strong vested interests in stopping it. It is the size of the bad debts in the jute industry - mostly to nationalised commercial banks - which is worrying the authorities. Failure to resolve this issue could torpedo banking sector reform, now at an advanced stage. The World Bank is expected to announce a funding plan to carry out jute reforms by the summer. 'Then the pain will begin,' said a local banker. Other sectors also carry large non-performing debt. Unions, though not numerically significant within the total workforce of 50m, continue to exert a powerful disruptive effect. Hartals - or general strikes - have a crippling effect on the economy. A local employers' group estimates the cost of a one-day hartal at Dollars 11m in lost production and distribution. Last week Skop, an umbrella organisation of labour groups covering textiles, jute, railway and others, staged a two-day hartal to demand a minimum wage and the implementation of a wages commission recommendation. The World Bank publicly denounced Skop's demands as unjustifiable. The finance minister accused them of 'economic terrorism'. Finally, the bureaucracy, which is charged with enforcing this state sell-off is widely seen as incompetent and corrupt and a significant drag on any implementation. 'There have to be more sacrifices from these interest groups: labour, civil servants and all the sick industries which for years have been supported by protectionism and subsidies. Things have got to change,' says a local commentator. Privatisation's only real success story has been in agriculture, which represents 38 per cent of GDP. It has improved in terms of output and efficiency following the withdrawal of fertiliser subsidies, the introduction of shallow and tube wells, better irrigation and the decision to privatise the distribution of fertiliser. And for the past three years there has been a bumper crop. An increasing concern for government is aid disbursement. Donors have always doubted Bangladesh's capacity to absorb aid and use it effectively, largely because of an inept civil service. Implementation has always been slow. Today, some Dollars 5.5bn is jammed in the aid pipeline. The other aspect of this backlog is that if aid money is not disbursed it creates the wrong investment climate for the private sector. 'The government must speed up implementation and spend. It must lead by example,' says a western banker. Private investment in Bangladesh - at 10 per cent of GDP - is one of the lowest in the region. Increased private investment will be an important component of the export-led growth - garments being the best example so far - that the government believes is the only way forward. 'Import-substitution is no good if the products we produce are uncompetitive,' says Mr Rahman. 'We need export-led growth. There is no other way industry (currently just 16 per cent of GDP) can succeed,' he says. Last year, the economy grew by 3.8 per cent, ahead of the population growth of 2.4 per cent; the government needs minimum economic growth of 5.5 per cent if it is to make a real dent in poverty and sustain the successes of the past 18 months. It is this follow-through which is now causing problems. According to one economist: 'The government is hitting the ball but it isn't going over the net.'</p>

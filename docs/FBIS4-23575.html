			<p>BFN     [Text] About 20 people have been injured by gunfire in  Djibouti when police dispersed a demonstration against the  bulldozing of homes in an Afar district of Djibouti's capital.  Afar sources and the United Front of the Djibouti Opposition  said four people were killed during Sunday's [5th June] protest  in the Ahabia District of Djibouti. The opposition front also  claimed that security forces arrested more than 300 people  including the front's president, Muhammad Ahmad Issa known as  (Chiko).    The incident was seen as the latest in a conflict between  Djibouti's Afars, and the authorities and security forces  dominated by Issas, the main ethnic group in Djibouti. The  Association for Human Rights and Freedom quoted witnesses as  saying that there were many demonstrators wounded. It said more  than 300 people have been left homeless and dispossessed of  anything which might be useful to them.</p>

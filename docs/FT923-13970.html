			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / France breaks through political roadblock: Despite a faltering start, the government has done well to resolve the truckers' dispute After 10 days of chaos and confrontation, the French government has pretty well brought an end to the nation-wide truckers' protest, through a shrewd orchestration of heavy police power and astute negotiation. But it has been a gruelling ordeal for all concerned, and it is still not clear whether the government's public standing will have suffered lasting damage from the crisis. Conservative commentators have argued that the government displayed incompetence and mismanagement; they may have a point. The new driving licence regulations, which were the ostensible cause of the truckers' protest, became law three years ago, were due to come into effect at the beginning of this year, and were then postponed to July 1. By any reckoning the start of the holiday season must have been the worst possible moment to enforce an unpopular innovation of this kind. Yet the government appears to have been taken by surprise by the scale of the truckers' protest. At that stage the main count against the government was that it was simply out of touch with the national grass roots, and in particular out of touch with the attitudes of the lorry drivers. The truckers object to the new points system for driving licences, under which drivers can lose points for traffic offences, because they claim that their high mileages make them specially vulnerable. Yet the government was obviously unaware that these objections were about to explode in a nationwide conflict. Some French commentators have argued that the government's apparent insouciance on this occasion, was in fact only a particular confirmation of a general rule: that the political elite in Paris is cocooned from the rest of France, and that the centralised government machine is far removed from the real world. Even if this general rule is not in fact valid, it is widely believed: survey after survey has shown that many French voters feel that their governments and their political leaders are remote from everyday life, and indeed are indifferent to the concerns of ordinary people. This grassroots critique of politicians is directed against all parts of the political spectrum, regardless of ideology. Yet it is obviously focused most immediately on the party in office, and after 11 years of a Socialist presidency, the charge may stick. What is not really in doubt is that under the Fifth Republic power in the French political system has increasingly become drawn towards the office of the presidency, with unfortunate consequences for the political system: successive governments have become increasingly dependent on presidential approval while parliament seems marginal. In the truckers' dispute, however, the government recovered from a poor start and finished well. All last week it was fumbling for a strategy, but getting nowhere. Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy promised that the 'black boxes' in lorry cabs would not be used for retrospective evidence of speeding offences, but insisted there could be no going back from the new licence system; the Ministry of the Interior veered between half-hearted threats to withdraw the licences of striking drivers, and ineffectual attempts to start negotiations on the operation of the new system. By Monday, however, the government had finally gripped the central fact, that the new licence was not the real cause of the conflict, but only the last straw for a workforce suffering from the pressures of cut-throat competition. In 1986 the then Conservative government freed the road transport industry from price and licensing restrictions. Deregulation attracted an inflow of new entrepreneurs, many of them very small; the number of trucking outfits rose from 24,000 in 1983 to 33,000 in 1989. At first there was enough business to go round, and road transport's share of total goods transport in France rose from 47 per cent in 1970 to 70 per cent in 1990. But already in 1989 the economy started to turn down, forcing an inexorable cycle of price cutting: the large transport companies forced price cuts on the small sub-contractors, to the point where some say that a quarter of self-employed small truckers may be operating unprofitably. In turn the sub-contractors have forced wage cuts or longer working hours on the drivers. As a result, working practices are often unsafe. Out of 340,000 trucks checked on the roads last year, one-tenth were found to be in breach of laws on working conditions, notably hours worked and rest periods. This is where the new driving licence regulations come in. Even the drivers complain that competitive pressures commit them to journey times which require them systematically to break the speed limits. At the last count, trucks accounted for 7 per cent of total vehicle-kilometres in France; but they were involved in nearly 15 per cent of the fatal accidents. On Monday and Tuesday, in two successive all-night negotiating sessions with the employers' unions, Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, the transport minister, rammed through a double package designed to mitigate the effects of cut-throat competition. There will be new safeguards to protect drivers from exploitation by the sub-contractors; more important, perhaps, there will also be measures to prevent main transporters from imposing sub-contracts which manifestly cannot cover costs. No one can be sure that the new deals will do the trick; they certainly do not solve the central problem of over-capacity in the trucking industry. But by yesterday virtually all the truckers' roadblocks had been cleared, and traffic was again flowing freely on the French roads. Considering that the drivers are virtually un-unionised, semi-anarchic and without recognised leaders, the government has done well to defuse the dispute relatively quickly, and with much less police violence than became familiar in some British labour conflicts such as the coalminers' strike of 1984-85. Naturally, the government does not expect any applause; but there is still one question which worries it: will this dispute tilt the balance against the Maastricht referendum on September 20? There is no reason to conclude that it is evidence of a general upsurge of popular discontent with the government. President Francois Mitterrand remains deeply unpopular, but Mr Beregovoy is much more popular than his predecessor, Mrs Edith Cresson. Nevertheless, the Maastricht treaty will be strongly contested by an ill-assorted alliance of nationalists led by traditional Gaullists. Aware of this challenge the government has done its best to clear the decks of all other contentious issues. Two weeks ago it postponed until the autumn a controversial bill on the control of medical spending. Nevertheless, there is some danger that the trucking dispute, like the rolling waves of farmers' protests, will be blamed not just on the government, but also on the economic liberalism associated with the European Community. For the moment, it does not look as though the referendum is in danger. The two most recent opinion surveys show a clear majority in favour, though the margin is narrower than in some previous polls; and these polls were both taken on July 3-4, when the truckers' dispute was already in full swing. In any case, for most Frenchmen, the holidays are still ahead, and may bring forgetfulness.</p>

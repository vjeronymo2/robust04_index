			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Turmoil at Ferruzzi group prevents release of results FERRUZZI-Montedison, the troubled industrial group which owes its bankers more than L28,000bn (Pounds 11.6bn), yesterday said that uncertainty about the group's future made it impossible to issue first half-figures. The boards of Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) and of its Montedison industrial subsidiary said the restructuring plan being prepared by the group's bankers could significantly affect first-half earnings. Among the most contentious points of the plan, which was originally due to be released at the end of August, is a moratorium on interest payments and a rescheduling of the group's massive debts. The Ferfin board, which met just before a gathering of Montedison's directors, said it would reconvene on October 14 to approve the six-month figures. The decision to set such a tight deadline may represent an attempt to put pressure on the group's bankers to come up with a restructuring package in time. Those figures which were released confirmed an improvement in Ferfin's performance at the operating level. Group sales rose by 19 per cent to L11,489bn, while net operating profits went up by 69 per cent to L722bn. The improvement was also reflected in figures adjusted for the effect of last year's devaluation of the lira. On that basis, Ferfin's turnover increased by 3 per cent, while net operating profits climbed 45 per cent. A similar trend was evident at Montedison, where revenues jumped 26 per cent to L10,287bn, while net operating profits almost doubled to L784bn. Adjusted for currency factors and acquisitions or disposals, net operating profits rose 45 per cent and sales were 7 per cent higher. The amelioration had been seen across the range of Montedison's activities. Agro-industrial operations, concentrated in the Eridania Beghin-Say sugar and foods concern, had seen a rise in sales to L6,855bn from L5,367bn, while the gross operating profit had increased to L704bn from L481bn. Chemicals, energy and engineering, Montedison's three other main businesses, had also raised sales and gross margins significantly. Turnover rose to L3,381bn from L2858bn.</p>

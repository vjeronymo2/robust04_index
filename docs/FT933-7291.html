			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Warning of riots over jail reforms THE PRISON reform movement yesterday forecast jail riots if Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, went ahead with plans to make life tougher for prisoners. According to leaked Home Office documents, authenticated by the Prison Service, Mr Howard believes that prisons are 'too comfortable' and discipline 'too lax'. The documents, written by Home Office officials, say Mr Howard 'inclines to the view that prisoners should spend more time working and less time on activities most people would regard as leisure'. They add: 'What the home secretary would therefore like . . . is a paper setting out the ways in which prison might be refocused to become a more austere experience.' Mr Howard's proposals outraged prison reformers, who had hoped that rehabilitation of prisoners would be given a higher priority in line with the recommendations of Lord Woolf's report on the 1990 riot at Strangeways prison, Manchester. Ms Frances Crook, director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said Mr Howard was 'building up enormous trouble'. The tougher policy would lead to riots. She added: 'It may even be the cause of suicides. The Home Office's own research has shown that poor or spartan regimes are responsible for high self-injury rates and suicides.' However, Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the Prison Service, said the home secretary remained 'fully committed' to the prison reform policies set out in the white paper following the Woolf report. Mr Howard's proposals were fully in line with Lord Woolf's call for prisoners to take part in more constructive work and training activities. Mr Lewis said: 'We need, as far as regimes are concerned, to make sure that time is not simply frittered away.' Mr Alun Michael, Labour's home affairs spokesman, said the leaking of the documents reflected Mr Howard's need to give the Conservative conference the impression he was 'doing something' about law and order. The number of accused women denied bail should be 'massively' reduced because only 25 per cent subsequently receive jail sentences, the Prison Reform Trust said yesterday. Research by the Greater London Bail Information Scheme showed women were three times as likely to be denied bail as men when charged with dishonesty and twice as likely for drug charges.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the UTD Steering Committee on 23 </F> March; place not given]    [Text] The Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD] steering  committee met today. After analyzing in detail the situation  prevailing in country and taking into consideration the emotions  and anxiety that misunderstandings between the two parties have  raised, the UTD hereby appeals for calm. The UTD has decided to  send the following letter to Mr. Yaovi Agboyibor, president of  the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR]:    Following the discussions that we held recently, I would  like  to bring the following clarifications to your attention in my  capacity as president of the UTD:    1. The UTD has no intention to vie for any government or  parliamentary post in the institutions of the Fourth Republic  under any controversial circumstances. It is therefore clear  that in the absence of any consensus, the UTD will not accept  any of these posts.    2. The UTD understands that as far as it is concerned, the  CAR wants to occupy all or part of these posts. The UTD does  not find this inconvenient at all.    3. The UTD is on the side of the Togolese people in their  march toward the establishment and consolidation of the rule of  law and democracy.    4. The UTD hopes that these points will help clarify the  present situation and strengthen the cohesion of the  parliamentary majority so much yearned for by the Togolese  people.</p>

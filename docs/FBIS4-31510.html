			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Mihai Mihailescu: "Out of Too Much Honesty"] </F>   [Text] It has become clear by now to every Romanian  citizen what the four-year rule of the Iliescu group means.  However, the main characteristic of the Romanian people's  attitude is great anemia rather than revolt or the wish to bring  about change. As a matter of fact, the Iliescu group has worked  in such a way as to bring us to a state of despair that makes us  see nothing before our eyes but the fierce struggle for  survival. Very few people think about an alternative.    Thus, the opposition has to offer us one. First of all, the  opposition must convince us that this poor nation is really in  need of an alternative. However, it seems that the opposition  has not been very convincing.    Without minimizing the force of the Democratic Party  (National Salvation Front), one should still stress that the  central pillar of the opposition is the Democratic Convention of  Romania [CDR]. Its moves lead or decide on matters of the  strategy of the opposition in the political game. The latest  developments of the CDR should be examined from this angle.    Nobody contests the fact that the most incisive member of  the  CDR is the Liberal Party-1993 [PL-93]. Many have even accused  this party of being extravagant. If one examines the issue  correctly and carefully, it becomes clear that the extravagance  of the PL-93 is in reality well calculated. The debate on and  endorsement of the law on the 1994 budget seemed to face a  serious struggle. A heated atmosphere prevailed at the opening  session of the joint meeting of the two chambers of Parliament.  The PL-93 called for legal action against Prime Minister  Vacaroiu and Finance Minister Florin Georgescu. In spite of the  fact that the request of the PL-93 was very surprising, the  arguments showed common sense and were indeed well- founded.    Again, the fire lasted only for one day. The majority of  parliament representatives succeeded in eliminating from the  agenda the discussions on the issues proposed by the PL-93.  However, the CDR members, in their addresses, permanently  incriminated the prime minister and finance minister. But  again, nothing happened. Even the members of the PL-93  abandoned the attempt. The fact that not much was achieved does  not matter. However, it would have been an intelligent move  against the Iliescu group. Through the echo of such a move,  people would have realized that they are ruled by an incompetent  government. Many people asked why the liberals gave up so  easily. We do not believe that the reason was the CDR's  inconsistency, its weakness, or its lack of dexterity in the  political game. But the CDR did not wish to be accused of  blocking in any way the proceedings of Parliament. In any  event, although the result would have been the same, the CDR  would have gained a lot in the political struggle.    Coposu's declaration to the effect that the PNTCD will fight  for a change of the Constitution and the reestablishment of  monarchy came as an explosion. It has been proved and we  believe it, that, at least for a long period of time, the  constitutional monarchy is the best solution for Romania.  However, unfortunately the majority of the population has not  understood this. We are convinced that Mr. Coposu made this  statement out of the wish to honestly communicate the intention  of the PNTCD if it comes to power. There is no question about  the fact that Mr. Coposu is the symbol of a righteous person.  We are not convinced, however, that this was the right moment  for such a declaration.    How many of those who changed their option and started  moving  toward the CDR were bothered by this declaration? Many people  were expecting a dispute to break out between the parties  included in the CDR after the PNTCD leader declared its  intentions. However, he explained that he had made the  statement on behalf of the party. We admire Mr. Coposu's  frankness, but repercussions for the CDR might still emerge in  the Romanian political system.    Out of too much honesty, one can lose the political ability.  Let us not forget that while the Iliescu group promised  changes, it is frantically working for restoration. It was a  fat lie, but still, the Iliescu group is doing fine. Even with  Mr. Vacaroiu....</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: NI loophole was the law Sir, It was disappointing to read Mr Peter Lilley's reported remarks ('Lilley takes shine off City bonuses', August 24) about 'companies and their accountant advisers who devise ways of paying earnings which avoid their liability for National Insurance contributions'. Mr Lilley would do well to remind himself that it is Parliament, not the electorate, that makes the law. National Insurance legislation explicitly defines what is, and what is not, 'pay'. The choice confronting companies is (or was) simple: payment in cash carried a 10.2 per cent surcharge, payment in kind did not. Which would the social security secretary recommend employers choose, given the free choice provided by law? Perhaps Mr Lilley might more productively turn his attention to the wasteful practice of running two parallel tax systems (one national insurance), requiring two administrations, two collection agencies and two sets of legislation.

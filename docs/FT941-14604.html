			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Elf stake worries ease There were said to have been a number of market stories driving Enterprise Oil shares sharply higher yesterday. The stock price, a poor performer in the FT-SE 100 and the oil sector recently, jumped 13 to 462p as the market responded to talk that Elf Aquitaine, the French state-owned oil company, had put the long-rumoured sale of its 10 per cent stake in Enterprise Oil on to the back burner. Worries about the possible sale of Elf's stake in Enterprise have proved a drag on the latter's share price. The French group was said to have indicated its preference to sell some of its other holdings, such as its stakes in Generale des Eaux and Bidermann International.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>   [Text] The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, and the  Fatah Hawks--the military wing of the Fatah movement--signed an  agreement in the occupied areas of Palestine yesterday, Friday,  to stop all kinds of hostile operations against each other.    This agreement, which was welcomed by popular and political  Palestinian circles, ends the conflict between these two groups  which had been going on for the past few months, and opens a new  chapter of fraternal ties between them. Prior to the signing of  the agreement halting hostilities between Hamas and the Fatah  Hawks, the Zionist regime officials expressed concern about this  and threatened the PLO, which is engaged in talks with that  regime. They described the agreement as a sort of division of  labor between Hamas and Fatah.    The Zionist regime's environment minister, who is playing an  active role in the PLO-Tel Aviv talks, stated: If the PLO  believes that it is carrying out a division of labor by this  action and is giving Hamas permission to carry out anti-Israeli  operations while engaging in talks itself, it is mistaken. He  added: If the PLO signs an agreement with Hamas, it cannot sign  any agreement with Israel.    In order to sow further discord in the Fatah and PLO  ranks--headed by combatants of the Islamic Movement and 'Arafat,  respectively--the Zionist regime threatened the PLO that in the  event of continued anti-Zionist operations by Hamas, talks will  be suspended. Despite the Zionist regime's efforts to the  contrary, the agreement between the Hamas and Fatah Movements  opened a new chapter of bilateral relations. This agreement was  signed when Hamas was able to organize four important  anti-Zionist operations--in a short period of time--in revenge  for the blood of the martyred fasting worshipers at the  al-Ibrahimi shrine in al-Khalil [Hebron]. As a result of these  operations, 14 Zionists were killed and 77 were wounded.    Following the shattering debacle of the al-Khalil carnage,  Hamas had pledged that it would carry out five operations in  revenge against the Zionists. So far, it has carried out four  operations and a fifth one is expected. What imparts greater  significance to the cessation of hostilities between Hamas and  Fatah is the approach of the time when the security of the  Gaza-Jericho autonomous regions is to be delegated to  Palestinian police. Israel is very optimistic that the  Zionist-Palestinian confrontation will be transformed into a  Palestinian-Palestinian war.    However, the Palestinian Islamic Movement's sensitivity to  this issue and its principled attention to confrontation with  the Zionist regime has resulted in the closing of this path  before such a calamity takes place. The PLO leaders hope that  this agreement will result in halting Hamas operations in the  autonomous Gaza-Jericho regions following the withdrawal, or in  more precise terms, a rearrangement of the array of  occupationist forces takes place, so that the struggle is  transferred to other parts of the usurped territories.    It does not seem likely that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad  Movement believe in any boundaries as regards their anti-Zionist  operations throughout the occupied territories. This has left  some ambiguities in the accord but the PLO is well aware that  without an agreement with Hamas it cannot administer these  affairs. In any case, the negative reaction of the Zionist  regime is in itself enough indication of the importance of such  an agreement for the Palestinians.</p>

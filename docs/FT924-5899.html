			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / International Company News: Arnotts threatened with legal action CAMPBELL Soup, the US food group, yesterday threatened legal action to force the board of Arnotts, the Australian biscuit company, to drop a key plank in its defence against a hostile takeover bid. Campbell, which is offering ADollars 8.80 a share for the 17.2 per cent of Arnotts it requires for majority control, also sought permission from the Australian Securities Commission to extend its bid. Campbell's bid values Arnotts at ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 857.1m). The group would spend only ADollars 206m to gain control of 50.1 per cent of Arnotts' shares, but has offered to buy all the 67.1 per cent of the shares it does not own. Arnotts' main defence is a 1985 agreement signed by the two companies when Campbell took a friendly 32.9 per cent stake to help protect Arnotts from a hostile bid by Mr Alan Bond, the former Australian entrepreneur. Arnotts claims the agreement gives the board the right to prevent Campbell exercising majority voting rights or appointing a majority of directors unless the US group acquires more than 85.1 per cent of the shares. Mr David Johnson, Campbell chief executive, challenged Arnotts' interpretation of the agreement in a strongly worded letter sent to all Arnotts' directors at their home addresses. Mr Johnson said Arnotts' interpretation was 'flagrantly contrary to Australian law and public policy' and 'prejudicial to shareowner interests because it is intended to interpose the existing board between the bid and the shareholders'. He also claimed the agreement was illogical and unenforceable, inconsistent with Arnotts' articles of association, and contrary to the rules of the Australian Stock Exchange, which generally requires voting rights to reflect ownership. Mr Johnson said Campbell would have 'no choice other than to commence appropriate court proceedings' if the board refused to acknowledge that its interpretation of the agreement was incorrect. Campbell's bid is subject to approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board (Firb), which has been widely lobbied to reject the bid to prevent control of Arnotts from passing outside Australia. The bid has also been criticised by Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer (finance minister), who will make the final decision on whether to allow it to proceed. Mr Dawkins suggested that Arnotts had failed to keep promises relating to investment and marketing which were made to the Firb when Arnotts acquired its existing stake in 1985.</p>

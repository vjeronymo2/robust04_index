			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Bangemann says Europe's car sector must adapt THE European Community car industry will have to sacrifice jobs, cut working hours and introduce new training methods and working patterns if it is to compete with US and Japanese manufacturers, the EC's industry commissioner said yesterday. Mr Martin Bangemann told a Turin conference on the future of the EC car industry that the Commission would encourage training and re-training, and back technological innovation to help improve the competitiveness of the car industry. Mr Bangemann also called for the development of an EC-wide computerised road-pricing system, which would replace toll-kiosks on main European highways, and help reduce congestion and pollution. 'We do not abolish frontiers in Europe just to see ourselves forced to stop every few kilometres to pay a toll,' he said in his speech, the text of which was released in Brussels. The Commission has just submitted to member states a draft of its latest report on the state of the EC car industry. Industry ministers will discuss the study at their meeting on November 18 and Commission officials said yesterday they expected several weeks of fierce political debate about how the EC should respond to the industry's problems. A final report is likely to be adopted in early 1994. In his speech yesterday, Mr Bangemann urged the industry to invest in new plants with the aim of creating a European 'lean production' system as productive and cost-efficient as the Japanese equivalent. But he added that there would also have to be changes to the internal organisation of companies and to their relationship with outside partners, component manufacturers and the sales network. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, is in Brussels today to cajole the EC's industry and competition commissioners into agreeing plans for the future of Ekostahl, the east German steelmaker. The Treuhand privatisation agency wants Riva, the private Italian steelmaker, to buy 60 per cent of Ekostahl, and invest in the construction of a hot-rolling mill. But Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, is understood to be insisting on further cuts in capacity at Ekostahl to offset the addition of the new mill. Mr Van Miert and Mr Martin Bangemann, who is in charge of industry policy, are keen to limit state subsidies to publicly owned steelmakers.</p>

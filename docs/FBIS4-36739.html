			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source at the Presidential Council in  the Democratic Republic of Yemen made the following statement to  the Yemeni News Agency, Aden:    We have heard about a so-called initiative from 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih presented by his envoy al-Ashtal [as heard] to  the United Nations which stipulates for a cease-fire as from  midnight this evening, and commissions what he called a Joint  Military Committee, formed during the union period which has  been blown up by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, to examine the situation.    We would like to illustrate clearly the position of the  Democratic Republic of Yemen in the following manner:    First, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his forces were those who  started the aggression on the Democratic Republic of Yemen's  forces and territories.    Second, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his regime have rejected  all  Arab and international initiatives.    Third, the Security Council has issued its resolution No.  924  and we had sincerely announced our adherence to it immediately  after it was announced, but 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his regime  clearly refused to abide by this resolution until yesterday when  he announced his adherence to its text and spirit and specified  3 o'clock in the evening for the start of implementing the  ceasefire, though the resolution has stipulated for adherence to  it and though 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has previously announced two  cease-fires which he violated.    Fourth, for the third time 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his  forces violated the ceasefire last night. The whole world knows  that it was he who violated the cease-fire half-an-hour after  the time he committed himself to cease the firing.    Fifth, we shall continue to adhere to the rulings of the  Security Council's Resolution No. 924 without preconditions, and  will only defend ourselves against any violation or aggression  by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his forces.    Sixth, the Joint Military Committee or a Yemeni military  committee, which 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih claims to have set up  perviously, do not exist any more. International observers, not  imaginary committees formed by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, should  monitor the cease-fire.    This the position of the Democratic Republic of Yemen which  it adheres to and announces to the international community.</p>

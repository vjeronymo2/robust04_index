			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The GOLD price held on to early gains inspired by fears over the Middle East situation, although dealers said the prospect of further central bank sales meant that the underlying tone was bearish. The London bullion market price closed at Dollars 329.25 a troy ounce, up Dollars 1.10 on the day. BASE METAL trading was routine on the London Metal Exchange, with all the markets suffering from a lack of news, and prices were mostly higher at the close. At the London Futures and Options Exchange COCOA and COFFEE prices rallied following Monday's falls. Cocoa futures were boosted by constructive sentiment on charts and news that Gill &amp; Duffus, the London trade house, had raised its estimate of the world supply deficit for 1992-93. The May contract ended the day at Pounds 736 a tonne, up Pounds 18. Coffee prices were marked higher following an overnight rally in New York and the March position closed at Dollars 967 a tonne, up Dollars 10. Some traders believed, however, that the overall decline might not yet be over. Compiled from Reuters</p>

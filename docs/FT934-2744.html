			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Fashion: Get dressed up for the Medieval revival - Velvet is the dominant fabric in evening wear The best-dressed parties this winter have a touch of the Gothic about them - anything from medieval high romance, through Renaissance richness to the arts and crafts movement. It is easy to see from where this revival comes. The current dominant shape is flattering fit and flare - a snug, narrow-shouldered bodice fluting out gracefully to a full hem - and it is but a short step in the designers' imagination to a medieval fantasy of raised waists, scooped-out necklines, flared sleeves, rich velvets and figured damasks, jewelled crosses and huge rings - even small trains on those fluted skirts. Velvet is the unifying thread running through this winter's fashion stories and it asserts its supremacy even more strongly for evenings, its natural habitat. Crushed, pleated, panne, embroidered, beaded, devore or just smoothly glossy, it is the must-have fabric of the moment. If you are buying one evening piece this winter, make it a simple, loose-cut black velvet tunic: Ben de Lisi's is one of the best. Get Gothic for now with spanking great crosses and oodles of jet, but have the comfort of knowing such a classic will look just as good in other guises when fashion returns to the 20th century. Black is still highest-rated for evening but velvet gives hope to those who believe there is night life after black. Its pile is woven as tiny loops, which are then shaved off. This very fine, carpet-like texture creates a depth of colour and sheen that lends itself to the glowing shades of medieval art - ruby, burgundy, deep green royal blue and purple. Many fibres can take a velvet pile. Cotton is tough but has little sheen or drape and is best for tailoring; Liberty sells it for Pounds 13.95 a metre. A viscose-acetate mix, around the same price, is softer but for a sinuous, shimmering medieval dress, a viscose and silk mix at Pounds 49.95 would drape much better. Pure silk velvet is now an haute couture rarity. All velvets show marks, so the crushed type, where the pile is pressed in, is more service-able. Whatever its finish, velvet has an instantly dressy effect which is also versatile. Without any adornment, the basic budget velvet dress, usually in stretch panne velours with a scooped neck and fluty skirt, would be fine for an informal dinner or anywhere on the young and stunning. A short, cap-sleeved version in green or black from Marks and Spencer (Pounds 39.99); Monsoon's long style in black with a tracery of gothic patterning (Pounds 80); or Monix's emerald-green flute and Whistles' purple tunic style would pass muster worn innocently with a simple silver cross on a leather thong and plain, centre-parted hair. And yet, as a foil for a treasure chest's worth of beads, baubles and jewelled crosses, any of them could look immensely grand. At the other end of the market, designers tend to add the jewels for you, trusting their own taste rather than that of their customers. Amanda Wakeley's blackberry velvet, strappy column, moulded to every curve, has a high-waisted bodice encrusted with whirls of old gold beading (Pounds 699). David Fielden's sleeveless midnight blue fishtail style (Pounds 404) has a wide, beaded hip belt that would grace a medieval siren; while a silken hood overlaid with old gold lace and scattered with golden beads adds a touch of mystery to Hardy Amies' burgundy couture sheath (dresses from Pounds 2,500).</p>

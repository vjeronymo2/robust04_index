			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Belorussia [Belarus] Gives Up </F> Strategic Nuclear Systems Forever. Now Only Russia Will Have  Them"]    [Text] The full-scale withdrawal from Belorussian  territory to Russia of the Strategic Rocket Forces grouping  temporarily stationed in the cities of Mozyr and Lida has begun.  IZVESTIYA's military correspondent learned this from  well-informed sources in the Russian Defense Ministry.    The Strategic Rocket Forces grouping in the Republic of  Belorussia comprised two divisions (eight missile regiments)  armed with the RS-12M "Topol" road-mobile missile system or, as  it was called in the West, the SS-25. A total of 72 launchers.    The first regiment (nine "Topols") stationed in Postavy was  withdrawn to Russia back in summer 1993. The next four  regiments (36 launchers) will leave the republic in 1994 in  accordance with the schedule agreed by the two states' defense  ministries, and the rest in 1995. By mid-1996 the Mozyr and  Lida missile divisions will have totally ceased to exist, they  will be disbanded in accordance with the START Treaty.    At the same time the arms and combat hardware withdrawn from  Belorussian territory will be deployed at Strategic Rocket Force  bases and arsenals -- they are to replace missiles and launchers  that have outlived their service life in those regiments on  combat alert duty on Russian territory that do not come under  the START-1 and START-2 Treaties.    Our newspaper has already reported (No. 25, 9 February) that  the modernized RS-12M system's standardized solid-fuel  multiple-warhead missile is to be the basis of Russia's  Strategic Rocket Forces. Moreover the ratio between fixed-site  and mobile systems will be 30-40:70-60.    Specialists have calculated that these systems and the  delivery to target of their warhead will cost the country 3-5  times less than for the sea-based nuclear forces and 5-10 times  less than for the air force, although they do not cancel out the  two other components of the nuclear triad. At the same time  mobile launchers' survivability is 4-5 times greater than that  of fixed-site launchers.    It is very hard to ascertain the location of a wheeled  vehicle in a vast position area, but silo coordinates are always  known. To support this idea specialists cite the example of the  obsolete Iraqi Scud systems, whose launch preparations took many  hours. During the Gulf War state-of-the-art U.S. reconnaissance  systems, including space reconnaissance, were unable to detect  them on the move and in position areas and consequently avert  missile launches.    This factor, as well as many others, promises the Russian  "Topols" a good future.    Incidentally, officers and warrant officers from the missile  regiments being withdrawn from Belorussia and disbanded, along  with the enlisted men and NCO's on compulsory military service  and contract personnel, will not be discharged into the reserve.  They will make up the strength of other Strategic Rocket Forces  units experiencing today a considerable shortage of specialist  missilemen of all kinds. I was assured at the Rocket Forces  Main Staff that they have all been guaranteed the social rights  and benefits extended to soldiers of the Russian Federation.    Officers and warrant officers from the regiments being  withdrawn to Russia who do not want to leave Belorussia will be  discharged into the reserve. They will enjoy all the rights of  the citizens of the state in which they have remained to live,  they and their families will keep the apartments in which they  are now living, and those who have served in the army for 20  years or more will be paid a military pension in line with  current legislation. At the Strategic Rocket Forces Main Staff  I was assured that there has not been a single case of  infringement of the legitimate rights of the Russian troops  remaining in Belorussia.    Once the strategic offensive arms installations have been  eliminated on Belorussian territory, the missilemen's military  camps will be handed over to the republic's defense ministry and  the vacated apartments to people on the military department's  waiting list or to other Belorussian citizens.    Once it has given up its "Topols" Belorussia will be the  only  post-Soviet state to have carried out its commitments to the  world community without any conditions and stipulations and to  have really subscribed to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of  Nuclear Weapons as a nonnuclear country.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Inchcape completes resources withdrawal INCHCAPE, the motor and business services group, yesterday lost another link with its colonial past as Inchcape Berhad, its 63 per cent owned Singapore-based subsidiary, sold its timber offshoot to local investors for Pounds 24m. The move completes Inchcape's withdrawal from resources operations. In 1991 it sold its tea investments and is now almost exclusively focused on its core motor, marketing and services businesses, apart from the odd country club and time share operation, acquired in March 1992 when it bought TKM, funded by a Pounds 376m rights issue. Inchcape Timber Group has operations in Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Singapore and Hong Kong and is involved in the extraction of tropical hardwood and softwood logs, and the processing and trading of timber products. Inchcape's interest in timber stretches back to the 1860s. The company incurred a pre-tax loss of SDollars 200,000 (Pounds 83,875) for the 1992 year on turnover of SDollars 198.1m. Inchcape said that the sale would result in an extraordinary profit of Pounds 3.5m, less expenses. The sale is conditional on regulatory approval. ITG's trading profit had declined in the last three financial years following the expiry of its main logging concession, the difficult operating environment at the new logging concession in Papua New Guinea between 1990 and 1992, and recessionary conditions in the main timber markets, Inchcape said. Mr Charles Mackay, chief executive, said: 'The deal is a good one for Inchcape in both strategic and financial terms. At the same time, it will ensure a good future for the partners, management and employees in the timber business.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] As was already reported by Kigali Radiodiffusion  Nationale de la Republique Rwandaise in a Defense Ministry  announcement, and as was reported by the world's radios,  President Habyarimana has reportedly died in a plane crash near  Kanombe Airport at around 2000 hours. [passage omitted]    Youth Minister Seth Sendashonga, a member of the RPF  [Rwandan  Patriotic Front] political bureau, said that under the law it  was difficult to replace President Habyariman, but that  politically the problem could be solved.    Mr. Seth Sendashonga said that President Habyarimana's  party,  the Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development  [MRND] would provide two candidates, one of whom will be chosen  in accordance with the provisions of the peace accord.    Mr. Seth Sendashonga was also asked about those persons who  say that the plane might have been shot down by the RPF. Seth  Sendashonga said the RPF held in contempt the shameful act of  killing people in that way. He said the RPF had fought a tough  war and had done enough to prove its power. He said that a  peace agreement had been signed and that things were almost  coming to a conclusion. So there was no reason for the RPF to  kill Habyarimana.</p>

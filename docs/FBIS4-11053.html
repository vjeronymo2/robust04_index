			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The Colombian Government today admitted punishment  for drug traffickers is very lax and suggested that sentences be  doubled through changes in the law. The recommendation is not  designed to make changes to the frequently discussed Procedural  Code but to the Penal Code.    [Begin Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez recording] What is  obvious is that the sentences need to be significantly harsher,  and there are several reasons for this. I believe that current  sentences should be at least doubled. [end recording]    Justice Minister Gonzalez said that for the government's  policy to be successful, stronger sentences for drug traffickers  must be accompanied by appropriate interpretations of the system  used to reduce sentences.    [Begin Gonzalez recording] I believe there are many  loopholes  certain lawyers use to get sentences reduced. These loopholes  are not included in the law. [end recording]    It is very clear to the government that some of the  guidelines established in light of the internal unrest and  former state of siege gave the drug traffickers too many  advantages, and, in turn, these advantages resulted in absurd  sentences.</p>

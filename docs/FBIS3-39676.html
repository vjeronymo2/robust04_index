Ministers have insisted for weeks they are not waiting for  an  IRA/Sinn Fein response but are pushing ahead with efforts to  find agreement between political parties on a predominantly  internal settlement.    In an interview in today's BELFAST TELEGRAPH, however,  Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister responsible for  developing the suspended inter-party talks, concedes that peace  and a political settlement are "inextricably linked."    "The declaration and the talks are part and parcel of the  same process," he said. "I don't believe you can have peace  without a widely acceptable political settlement and I think you  probably can't have a widely acceptable political settlement  without peace." His comments imply that without the IRA  renouncing violence, the prospect of inter-party talks reaching  agreement are slim.    Mr Ancram's comments come on the eve of the meeting between  the Irish Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, and John Major at Downing  Street to review progress of the inter-party talks as well as  Sinn Fein's response to the joint declaration signed by both  governments before Christmas.    Yesterday, the Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick  Mayhew, said that he was hoping to see new institutions of joint  co-operation between the North and south of Ireland set up as  part of his package designed to bring agreement between Dublin,  London and the four constitutional parties in Northern Ireland.    He welcomed "any step that is intended to develop  co-operation on economic and other matters." He thought that  the new institutions "could be undertaken...without impinging on  the sovereignty of Northern Ireland."    Sir Patrick, speaking in the Commons, was pressed by his  shadow, Kevin McNamara, on whether new North-South bodies  dealing with issues like as the economy or infrastructure should  have an executive role, based on ground rules laid down by both  governments.    Sir Patrick argued that "any organisation, call it a board  or  a structure, should have clear objectives, with clearly defined  lines of authority, coming from wherever it is appropriate,  whether it is Westminster, Dublin, or any subsequently  established legislative body."    The British Government sent secret outline proposals to  Dublin this month on the extension of co-operation between the  two parts of Ireland.    The Ulster Unionists would like the bodies to be almost  exclusively consultative, but are willing to see the British  representatives drawn from a Northern Ireland assembly.    James Molyneaux, the Unionists' leader, indicated that  representives of a proposed Ulster assembly could talk to the  South, as long as "the sovereignty of Northern Ireland remained  undiminished."</p>

He believes the meeting's agenda reflects this tendency by  including all key issues ranging from the protection of human  rights to the protection of borders, more efficient  peace-keeping operations and the prevention of regional  conflicts. "Clearly, none of us will solve these problems. We  should do so only within the framework of the Community on the  basis of equality and mutual respect," he said.    Kozyrev believes that there is no need to speak about the  international recognition of the Commonwealth of Independent  States. "We need no international recognition. It is enough to  have the decision of our presidents and parliaments for the CIS  to work on and occupy a worthy place in the world. We should  only speak about the development of CIS contacts with other  international structures," he said.    At the meeting CIS foreign ministers plan to discuss the  draft convention on the protection of the rights of national,  ethnic, and religious minorities and the possible creation of a  standing consultative commission for peacekeeping activities  under the CIS Council of Foreign Ministers, diplomatic sources  have told Interfax.    The Ministers intend to coordinate a plan of multilateral  inter-ministry consultations within the CIS framework for 1994.  They are also to discuss a CIS-CSCE cooperation.    The Ministers will have their say on the NATO program  "Partnership for Peace."    In addition, the issue of talks between Russia and the  Caucasian and Central Asian states on cooperation with the third  countries on the protection of borders.    The Ministers will discuss Kazakhstan's proposal on a  special  session of the UN General Assembly on problems of the  post-confrontation age.    Also to be discussed are the steps for the division of  civilian sea vessels of the ex-Soviet Union between the CIS  countries and the Baltic states.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Netanyahu voted Likud leader MR Binyamin Netanyahu was yesterday elected leader of Israel's right-wing opposition Likud party and is likely to be a strong contender for the premiership when it is contested in about three years' time. At 46, he is the first of the younger generation of Israeli politicians to emerge as a contender for the country's highest office and can be expected to launch an immediate assault on the performance of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, who led Labour to victory in last June's general election - the result that prompted the retirement of the veteran Mr Yitzhak Shamir as Likud's leader. Mr Netanyahu, best known in Israel as 'Bibi', won the four-cornered contest by a surprisingly large margin of 52.1 per cent of the vote by Likud members, against 26.3 per cent for Mr David Levy, a former foreign minister, 15.1 per cent for Mr Benny Begin, son of former prime minister Menachem Begin, and 6.6 per cent for Mr Moshe Katsav, a former transport minister. The size of Mr Netanyahu's victory should allow him to exercise authority over a divided party which suffered from a bruising and bitter leadership campaign. The run-up to the election was marked by an extraordinary allegation by Mr Netanyahu that a senior Likud opponent had attempted to blackmail him over his marital infidelities. Mr Levy, who claimed that the allegation was aimed at him, said in advance of yesterday's result that he could not serve under Mr Netanyahu. After yesterday's result Mr Levy asked: 'Can I co-operate with someone who called me a criminal?' He refused to congratulate the winner but said that he would stay in the party. The other two candidates both said they would co-operate with the new leader. It is believed most other former Likud cabinet ministers also voted for candidates other than the winner. Mr Netanyahu is best known internationally as Israel's principal spokesman during the Gulf war but has also served as deputy foreign minister and ambassador to the UN. His mastery of television, good looks, and ability to speak in short, pithy sentences, worked in his favour but has prompted accusations that he lacks depth and political conviction.</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> NEW EUROPE: A SHAPE FAR FROM DECIDED;  </P> <P> WILL THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY BE MORE THAN A CAPITALISTS' CLUB?  </P> <P> During one Christmas season in the course of World War I, German and Allied  troops fraternized across the trenches, to the horror of their commanders. The  men much preferred saying "Happy Christmas" to trying to kill each other. There  are no trenches now, but today the argot of amity is more complicated. During  the mid-December Euro-summit in Rome, the newspapers sprouted an almost  impenetrable undergrowth of prose about the "hard ecu" and the merits of a  central bank for the entire European Community.  </P> <P> The complexity makes some folk reel and holler for traditional verities, like  the "good old pound." Such nostalgia about the national currency is probably  more a function of age than anything else. Polls show that younger people are  much more laconic about Euro-fusion. But some British people over 60 cherish  the old, white five-pound note, which looked like a personal letter from the  governor of the Bank of England. As a boy who used to get a few of them pressed  into my palm by uncles and aunts at Christmas time, I revere the former Irish  half-crown, a beautiful silver coin with a horse on it.  </P> <P> It's the same with national boundaries. Back in the 1950s, the working people  of Cork City thought it a fine holiday to travel down by rail some 30 miles to  the spacious beaches of Youghal. We folks of Youghal traveled over to Ardmore,  eight miles east, for our vacation. I took a poll in the pub in Ardmore the  other night and recent holiday destinations included the Canary Islands (very  popular with the Irish), Turkey, as well as the United States, which of course  is second home and workplace of last resort. In this perspective, "Europe" is a  matter of work permits, customs dues and other brusque economic realities, but  not an affront to national senses of identity.  </P> <P> But behind the varying "senses" of Europe (which in Ardmore means a sign  outside the village announcing that the European Community is financing the  widening of the local highway) there are some basic, crude questions that can  be glimpsed through the verbal fog. These concern not so much the desirability  of a more closely federated Europe but what the nature of this federation would  be.  </P> <P> At the moment there is no real federated structure. The community has no army,  no police, no prisons and only a few thousand employees. But, despite the lack  of a federal infrastructure, there are pan-European structural realities, most  fundamentally the economic power of Germany, hence of the deutsche mark. To  offset this, the British are maneuvering for a "hard ecu" (European currency  unit), but this could end up being essentially the selfsame deutsche mark, with  values and interest rates set by a European Central Bank dominated by Germany.  </P> <P> This raises the question of democratic control, just as the role of a Federal  Reserve dominated by Eastern bankers has raised questions about democratic  control in the United States ever since the establishment of the reserve  system.  </P> <P> Right now the European Council of Ministers uses EC powers to press through  measures that have no detailed sanction from either national parliaments or the  European Parliament. The community suffers from something politely known as a  "deficit of democracy." This deficit springs from the original impulse for the  European Economic Community, which was an attempt to achieve some coordination  among a collection of regional capitalist powers.  </P> <P> And indeed the community could, in the next phase, remain just such a  coordinating unit: a formidable cartel set to do battle with the emerging  dollar and yen blocs west and east of it, but without proper democratic  supervision and hence without pressure for communitywide standards on wages,  the work week, labor rights, women's rights, civil liberties, environmental  standards and so forth.  </P> <P> Crammed up against the windows of this bloc, peering enviously in from the  cold, perhaps given "associated status," would be the Eastern European nations,  allowed a sparse amount of bailout money and treated as a reserve army of the  unemployed or low-paid with which to chasten better-paid Western European  workers.  </P> <P> The effort to establish an alternative to this corporate utopia will be the  business of the next generation of the European left, starting with full  membership for Eastern European nations as well as for Austria, Sweden and  Turkey, which are now pressing to join. In such a truly pan-European community  the struggle for democratic accountability and controls can honestly begin, in  language rather more accessible than the bureaucratic lingo that is the present  idiom of the community.  </P></p>

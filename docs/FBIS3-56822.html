			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The CONTACT INFORMATION AGENCY reports that the  press secretariat of the Georgian head of state has issued the  following statement:    On 13 January this year the Independent Information Agency  IBERIA released information alleging that the Russian Government  had informed the Georgian authorities through unofficial  channels that it would agree to accept Georgia into the ruble  zone if Georgia met seven conditions. These conditions include  relinquishing foreign assets in Russia's favor; handing over  gold reserves to Russia or mortgaging Georgian state property  against imported Russian rubles; allowing Russia to approve  Georgia's state budget; and allowing Russia to appoint one of  the vice presidents of the republic's National Bank by the  Russian Government.    The press secretariat of the Georgian head of state is  authorized to state that neither it nor the Cabinet of  Ministers, the relevant ministries and agencies, or the head of  state possess any documents confirming the above-mentioned  information.    According to information in our possession, principles of  the  ruble zone formation are still being formulated. There are  differing opinions in this regard among the Commonwealth member  states. It should also be noted that none of the drafts being  considered includes the conditions listed in the report released  by IBERIA. Moreover, conditions for republics' entry into the  ruble zone can only be decided on the basis of bilateral talks  with individual republics. No one has had such talks with  Georgia, which reaffirms the erroneousness of the released  information.    There is an impression that certain forces are deliberately  trying to mislead the population and use methods unacceptable in  journalism as well as nonobjective information to prejudice  public opinion. It is also regrettable that the newspaper  AKHALGAZRDA IVERIELI [young Iberian] has published the  above-mentioned information without checking it first.    The press secretariat of the Georgian head of state is  authorized to state that the Independent Information Agency  IBERIA has more than once released unchecked information like  this. Therefore, the press secretariat believes that when  releasing information like this, which does not contribute to  the objective coverage of a problem, it is always necessary to  indicate the source of the information to prevent similar  inaccuracies.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Frustration of auditors over liability Sir, I am delighted your editorial, 'The liabilities of auditors' (May 23), recognises there is a serious issue to address: '. . . In principle, the argument for reform seems sound. It must be unreasonable for auditors to be held wholly responsible for corporate disasters when they have not been the direct cause of the problems.' You recognise that reform would require radical changes in the law 'overturning the principle of joint and several liability', and that there is no likelihood of this reform being introduced soon. That is the dilemma which has resulted in what you term 'a flawed alternative'. Auditors are well aware that the change proposed to Section 310 of the Companies Act 1985 is the second-best solution. However, it is surely better to do something to improve an unfair position, even the second-best option, than to do nothing at all? Readers may remember that five years ago the Liklerman report suggested, among other steps, the change to Section 310 which the big firms now propose, yet nothing has been done since then. You also commented on the reluctance of firms when sued for audit negligence to go to court, particularly when the courts have 'in practice demonstrated considerable sympathy for the profession, tightly restricting its duty of care . . .' Decisions not to go to court are based on a case by case commercial assessment of the likely cost, etc - legal costs have represented more than half the total costs of settling claims against major firms. Cases like Caparo and Galoo have been heavily criticised in many quarters and those defending suits would be unwise to rely on the courts taking a similar line in other circumstances. The blunt fact for the auditing profession is that we are exposed at present to the very real risk of massive claims and of bearing a disproportionate share of responsibility. You have pointed out this situation is unreasonable. I hope you and your readers will also be sympathetic to our frustration in having to put forward a second-best solution to a problem.

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Accord near on future of nuclear power industry OUTLINES of a compromise on the fraught future of Germany's nuclear power industry, allowing the current generation of power stations to keep operating for up to 40 years, have been worked out in top-level talks between the government and opposition. The plan would mean a switch from reprocessing nuclear waste to direct disposal - provided a new direct disposal site can be found by 2005. This would mean the current reprocessing contract with Britain's Thorp plant at Sellafield would not be renewed after the first phase, ending in about 2005. However the chances of the plan being approved by the full Social Democratic party (SPD) opposition, committed to abandoning nuclear power generation within 10 years, are still regarded as slim. SPD leaders are angry that the government is seeking to link any accord on long-term subsidies for the coal industry with a deal on future use of nuclear energy. The compromise has been thrashed out by a four-man working group representing Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister, who is a member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and Mr Gerhard Schroder, SPD prime minister of the state of Lower Saxony. Mr Schroder is expected to present it today to a meeting of the SPD national executive in Bonn, ahead of the next round of cross-party 'energy consensus' talks on Wednesday. The compromise represents the first sign of a breakthrough in the long-running battle over the future of nuclear energy in Germany, which has been in effect frozen since the Chernobyl nuclear accident in the former Soviet Union. The deal is understood to include: a switch from waste reprocessing to direct disposal after the current reprocessing contracts (with France's Cogema and Britain's BNFL) expire; a search for alternative sites for direct disposal to the Gorleben salt mines in Lower Saxony (Mr Schroder's greatest concern); no moves to finalise Gorleben as a direct disposal site before 2005, but agreement on a 'long-term temporary storage' plan for high-level nuclear waste; a deal on a 35- to 40-year working life for the present generation of nuclear power stations - less than the industry wants, but much more than the SPD has hitherto been willing to concede; the go-ahead for one new 1,500MW nuclear power plant of the new generation, currently being developed by Siemens of Germany and France's Framatome, to be sited in Bavaria.</p>

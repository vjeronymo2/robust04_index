			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Sweden turns to Euroyen market to raise Ecu6.6bn The Kingdom of Sweden restarted the Ecu31bn borrowing programme it launched last year to rebuild its foreign currency reserves by tapping the Euroyen market yesterday for the first time in nearly five years. In its latest round of borrowings, Sweden has already tapped the Euromarkets for D-Marks, French francs, sterling and US dollars. It now needs to borrow a further Ecu6.6bn or so to complete the programme, and will not restrict itself to the capital markets for the balance. Mr Staffan Crona, director-general of the National Debt Office, said commercial paper and private placements were other possibilities. Although Sweden has now rebuilt its published reserves from last September's low point to pre-crisis levels, the figure being quoted yesterday of around SKr160bn shows slippage from the SKr176.1bn quoted in November. The government's foreign debt currently stands at around SKr250bn. Nomura International, leading the first Euroyen issue of the year, said the bonds were bid at around the issue price after being freed to trade. The volume of business done in sterling provided the surprise of the day. Eurofima, the Basle-based rolling stock company which is an infrequent borrower in sterling, reopened the sector with a Pounds 100m five-year issue offering a spread of 27 basis points over comparable gilts. The bonds were targeted to continental European investors, said lead-manager Daiwa. Eurofima, which says it plans to borrow SFr4bn to SFr5bn in 1993, agreed that the spread on its first international bond launched this year was tight, but said it was confident it would tighten further. This is the first Eurosterling deal solely led by a Japanese house for a non-Japanese borrower, said Daiwa. The three other sterling deals, for Pounds 100m each from Credit Foncier de France, National &amp; Provincial Building Society and Nordic Investment Bank, all mature in the second half of 1998, in order to take advantage of the steepness of the yield curve. This allows the borrowers to benefit from better swap rates, while still paying investors the sort of yield they would expect on a straight five-year maturity. Bankers attributed the flurry of activity in sterling to a combination of swap opportunities and European demand for sterling bonds. The rush of new bonds quickly outstripped demand, bankers said. International Finance Corp's Dollars 300m three-year issue was described by some bankers as aggressively priced at a spread of 18 basis points over US Treasuries. IFC suffers from a relative lack of name recognition, despite its triple A status as a World Bank affiliate. Lead-manager Morgan Stanley International said the notes traded at the issue price after breaking syndicate. The issue comes on the heels of the European Investment Bank's Dollars 400m deal earlier this week and could go a long way towards satisfying current demand for shorter dated dollar paper, said bankers. Set for pricing this morning is LKB's DM1bn five-year Eurobond, led by Dresdner Bank, Morgan Stanley International and Trinkaus und Burkhardt. Bankers said the indicated spread looked tight at 17 to 19 basis points over German governments, particularly when compared with the large five-year issues from the UK and KfW late last year. Both were yesterday trading at spreads of around 17 basis points. Morgan Stanley led another small reverse floating rate note, for the European Bank for Reconstruction &amp; Development. The DM100m seven-year issue pays a coupon of 8 1/4 per cent in the first year, and 19 per cent minus twice six-month Libor thereafter.</p>

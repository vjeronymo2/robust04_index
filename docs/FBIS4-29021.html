			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent Yi Chong-su's report from Washington] </F>   [Text] It has been learned that former U.S. President  Carter, who will visit North Korea today, has a nonofficial  package offer to solve the North Korean nuclear issue and  U.S.-North Korean relations simultaneously.    In an interview with the Korean Broadcasting System, KBS,  today a U.S. scholar, who has reportedly played a  behind-the-scenes role for former U.S. President Carter's visit  to North Korea, revealed that former President Carter's  nonofficial package offer contains the improvement of U.S.-North  Korean relations and the measures for guaranteeing the overall  security of the Korean peninsula in return for guaranteeing  North Korea's nuclear transparency.    This scholar, who did not want to be identified, said that  if  former President Carter achieved no success in his visit to  North Korea this time, public opinion in the United States would  quickly turn toward imposing sanctions against North Korea  within or without the framework of the United Nations.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LABOR IN VEHEMENT ATTACK ON DEUKMEJIAN PRISONER WORK PLAN  </P> <P> Organized labor vehemently declared its opposition on Wednesday to Gov. George  Deukmejian's plan to require prison convicts to help pay for their keep by  working, contending that the proposal would create "a captive labor force  surrounded by armed guards."  </P> <P> The plan, a major legislative initiative announced by Deukmejian in his State  of the State speech in January, flew into a wall of opposition from labor at a  hearing of the Assembly Labor and Employment Committee.  </P> <P> It was defended by top-level Administration officials, including James A.  Rowland, director of corrections, who insisted to the committee that "we don't  want to displace one law-abiding worker" by putting prisoners to work in  privately operated enterprises at prison sites.  </P> <P> From a prisoner's presumed minimum wage earnings, 20% would be withheld to help  pay the room and board, 15% would be deducted for restitution to victims and  40% would be taken for a mandatory savings program. Inmates could spend the  remaining 25% as they wished.  </P> <P> John F. Henning, the crusty veteran executive secretary-treasurer of the  California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, denounced the proposal as a "turning back  of the clock of history" that would be seized upon as "the ideal for the  employer who wants to exploit."  </P> <P> "It is a captive labor force surrounded by armed guards," he boomed out in the  deep baritone voice of an old-fashioned union organizer. "It is turning back  the clock of history to foist this on prisoners . . . ."  </P> <P> The California Constitution has long prohibited the use of state prisoners to  perform work for private employers. Many attempts to repeal the prohibition  have been killed by organized labor, which fears, among other things, that  prisoners would displace civilian workers.  </P> <P> Deukmejian has proposed that 7,000 inmates, the same number now enrolled in  prison industry work programs, participate in his program. He has said it would  help ease the budget crunch and allow taxpayer dollars to be spent for services  other than prisons.  </P> <P> The governor also has indicated that if the proposal does not receive the  required two-thirds favorable vote of the Democratic-dominated Legislature, he  may sponsor a ballot initiative in 1990 seeking to implement the program.  </P> <P> Henning warned Wednesday that "bureaucrats" could be counted upon to vastly  expand the working convict program. "They (the bureaucrats) are willing to lick  the paint off the walls of San Quentin to get this," he said.  </P> <P> He said he favors expansion of labor-endorsed work programs that enroll 222  apprentices for skilled crafts and the prison industries program that involves  7,000 participants. These programs operate under many restrictions designed to  keep them from doing jobs that otherwise might be done by civilian labor.  </P> <P> Asked by committee chairman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) if labor would be  prepared to compromise on Deukmejian's proposal, Henning shot back: "Not on  convict labor."  </P> <P> Assemblyman Bill Baker (R-Danville), legislative author of Deukmejian's  proposed constitutional amendment, and others noted, however, that 60,000  convicts a year are being released from crowded California prisons, whose  population is expected to soar from 72,927 last year to 110,230 in 1990.  </P> <P> He and officials of the Department of Corrections said these released convicts  must be provided with "meaningful" jobs or they are almost certain to commit  more crimes and return to prison at taxpayer expense.  </P> <P> Under the project, modeled after a program for California Youth Authority  offenders, private businesses would acquire space at prison sites and employ  adult convicts to make products that could be sold on the open market.  Currently, such prison-made items as furniture can be sold only to government  agencies.  </P> <P> The committee was told by an optical laboratory operator and a sheet metal  contractor that goods manufactured by the Youth Authority inmates in its "free  venture" work program have undercut their businesses.  </P></p>

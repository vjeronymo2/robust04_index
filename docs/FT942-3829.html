			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Brussels to rethink planto rescue steel industry: Van Miert seeks more flexibility on state aid The European Commission will this week reconsider its rescue plan for the steel industry amid renewed warnings from Mr Karel Van Miert, European Union competition commissioner, that he will walk away from it unless he wins support for a flexible interpretation of rules on state aid. Mr Van Miert's stand puts him on a collision course with Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator. Sir Leon is unhappy about the planned grant of Ecu415m (Pounds 319.55m) in Italian state aid in exchange for the closure of steelmaking in Brescia, northern Italy. Sir Leon fears that this would undermine efforts to reach a steel agreement with the US. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Van Miert said the Brescia cuts were crucial for the Commission reaching its target of cutting steelmaking capacity in the EU by a total 19m tonnes by September. Some bending of the rules was necessary if the targets were to be met, he added. In Brussels, Mr Van Miert's allies are betting that Sir Leon will soften his position in order to win the backing of the Italian government for his bid to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as the next president of the European Commission. A spokesman for Sir Leon said the two issues were entirely separate. Mr Van Miert's decision to distance himself from the steel rescue plan means that the slim chances of a revival lie with Germany's Mr Martin Bangemann, EU industry commissioner. Mr Bangemann, co-architect of the plan, wants a generous inter pretation of the rules to take account of the complicated cross-ownership of the Brescia mini-mills. The web of company shareholdings means that not all companies linked to steelmaking would shut down, raising the legal question of whether state aid could be used for 'partial closures'. Last month, Mr Van Miert suffered a defeat after Sir Leon argued in favour of a rigorous interpretation of the steel code on state subsidies. Mr Van Miert said he was relaxed about a possible collapse of the steel plan. 'I was simply trying to do what I had been asked, but if the conclusion is we can't go ahead, that is no problem,' he said. He repeated warnings that the EU would open proceedings against Italian steel industry aids as well as a case against Luxembourg steel production. Mr Van Miert noted that he had opposed proposals to adopt an interventionist steel policy based on production quotas that would have only resulted in freezing capacity. German steel producers are believed to have favoured such a 'crisis cartel' approach. Instead, Mr Van Miert and Mr Bangemann had opted for the more flexible approach, combining support measures in exchange for capacity cuts. Unless the deadlock can be resolved, the Commission will put an end in September to the flanking financial aid measures currently available for the decommissioning of capacity.

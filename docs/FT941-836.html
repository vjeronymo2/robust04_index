			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Survey of Risk Management (5): Directors rush for shelter - Liability Environmental liability and employers' liability may be the hot issues for companies in the Nineties but they face many other liabilities equally difficult to handle. Directors' and officers' liability (D &amp; O), public liability, and product liability are all areas where there has been an increase in litigation and awards, or out-of-court settlements. The problem for companies and their insurers is that liability claims are subject to the whim of the courts, and awards, especially personal injury, are rising. One of the most noticeable trends recently has been the increasing liability of directors, who are being sued alongside their companies. Greenpeace, for example, began a campaign to single out directors of polluting companies. The first recourse of a director is a D &amp; O insurance policy which provides cover for claims made against directors for wrongful acts or trading, and defence costs. According to the latest Wyatt UK D &amp; O survey (with 123 responses, admittedly only a small sample) 62 per cent of respondents had insurance cover (compared to 84 per cent in the much larger US survey). D &amp; O insurance claims give a good idea of the growing incidence of claims against directors and the source of those claims. The Wyatt survey shows that 26 per cent of participants have experienced at least one claim in the past 10 years, compared to 1991 when the figure was 17 per cent. Claims were brought by employees or former employees (32 per cent), competitors (21 per cent), shareholders (21 per cent) and government bodies/regulators (18 per cent). Martin Beagley, of Willis Corroon, says the main exposure is in the US: 'There have been more claims in the last six months than there have been in the last six years, and most are employment-related, coming from large UK multinationals operating in the US.' In the US claims from shareholders account for nearly 50 per cent of all D &amp; O claims, and inadequate financial disclosure claims are on the increase while claims from merger and acquisition activity, from where the majority of UK claims stem, have fallen. The D &amp; O insurance market is very competitive with new capacity coming in, and the old participants refocusing, so that while there has been an increase in claims, the premiums are still relatively cheap. There are some exclusions in D &amp; O policies, including dishonesty or fraud, except where there is a successful defence, product liability and libel or slander. More importantly, most policies specifically exclude pollution, whether gradual or sudden and accidental. However, a specific D &amp; O pollution policy was launched recently by AIG. The Cadbury Report has had a profound effect upon directors and has certainly increased the awareness of directors of the liabilities they face. Similarly, the well-known recent scandals involving directors have helped to concentrate the mind of directors on their potential liabilities, and, indeed, the threat of a heavy fine, or even imprisonment, may be driving risk management within companies. At the very least, it can be used by risk managers to bring risk management to the attention of senior management. As Liz Taylor, risk manager at Harrison &amp; Crossfield, points out: 'I think that risk managers should use all the incentives that they can, and personal incentives for managers are a very useful tool.' Public liability insurance (PL) provides protection for companies against financial loss stemming from third party personal injury or property claims, and, as with most liability insurance, claims are on the increase. Since 1991, PL policies have included gradual pollution exclusion wordings, but they still offer cover for sudden and accidental pollution, though most in the industry now feel this will not be the case for much longer. In contrast to the relaxed attitude to pollution liability, many PL policies in the energy field now exclude third party liability in cases involving electromagnetic fields (EMF), in spite of there being no case history or proven liability. The 1985 EC Directive on Liability for Defective Products (which resulted in the Consumer Protection Act in the UK in 1987) imposed a regime of strict liability, which, combined with the growing 'deep-pocket' approach to claims, has driven greater risk management among manufacturers. And the forthcoming EC General Product Safety Directive will impose new responsibilities to encourage risk assessment and prevention. While awards escalate in the US, the UK product liability market is relatively stable. This is partly because there simply are not the huge awards in UK courts that are found in the US. The biggest claims in the UK occur in the pharmaceutical or chemicals industries. These industries are normally only able to obtain cover on a claims-made basis, but for other industries there is little problem in getting cover on an occurrence basis. Paul Maynard, technical director in the UK division of Minet, the international insurance broker, says that in 1985/86 insurers, where their insureds had a US exposure, tried to force all policies towards claims-made wordings, but the attempt was short-lived. He adds: 'The commercial market today could be described as hard, though it is not as bad as in 1986. There may not be big reductions at renewals, but it is not difficult to find good quality capacity.' While product liability may not be a problem area for companies, D &amp; O looks set to be a significant problem if the UK follows the US example. According to the Wyatt survey in the US, the average D &amp; O claim last year was Dollars 3.25m, with shareholder claims averaging Dollars 5.4m. Douglas McBean, a D &amp; O specialist with Minet, sounds a note of caution for European companies which are listed on US stock exchanges, or which are considering doing so: 'Used to the relatively lax reporting requirements in the UK and mainland Europe, many companies are caught unawares regarding the stringent rules of disclosure of information to shareholders and regulators in the US. Plaintiff lawyers and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) have not been reticent in exercising their powers.' Many will say that it is only the US's contingency fee system that inflates liability claims, and that it will never happen on the same scale in the UK. But be warned: there is considerable pressure to bring in some form of contingency fee litigation in the UK. Editor of the commercial insurance and risk management monthly Corporate Cover.</p>

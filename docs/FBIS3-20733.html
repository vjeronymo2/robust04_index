			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zoran Jelicic: "Economic Chaos: Three </F> Governments, Two Dinars, One Illusion"]    [Text] It will be a big and pleasant surprise if it  turns out that collecting foreign exchange from the citizens and  the economy is not the main goal of the new economic policy.    At the beginning of next week, the new dinar will be put  into  circulation, even though there is little chance that the  dilemmas surrounding the question of how the economy will  function with two domestic currencies will be resolved by then.  Since last Wednesday, SLUZBENI LIST has probably been one of the  most sought-after commodities, since that is where the federal  government's decree on the new dinar was published. However, the  decree in question is only the beginning of the dilemmas.    The federal government has introduced the new dinar as a  means of payment in the territory of the FRY [Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia], but the old, existing dinar has also been  preserved. The new dinar is divided into 100 paras and can be  exchanged for foreign currency, while the National Bank will use  its previous mechanism to determine the relationship between the  new and old dinar--although we are not allowed to exchange the  old dinar for the new one, and thus not for foreign currency  either. Everyone who is obligated to keep business records is  obligated to indicate their status in new dinars (the  recalculation from old into new dinars will take place on the  date when the new dinar is put into circulation), and they will  be used to indicate all prices of products and services.  Finally, both the new and the old dinars will be used in trade  payments in the FRY, but in separate accounts with the Trade  Payments Service (with the noted obligation to keep business  records in new dinars), while all monetary amounts will be in  new dinars, except for those instruments of trade payments that  are earmarked for old dinars (e.g., checks issued to citizens).  <H5>  Beneficiaries of the Budget </H5>   The federal government has decided that the average exchange  rate of the new dinar will be equal to the value of one German  mark and that it will be uniform, except for clearinghouse  payments, where it will be 30 percent lower than the exchange  rate of the new dinar to the U.S. dollar.    Businessmen, at least those consulted by VREME, are confused  and worried, precisely because they expect the economic and  state authorities to halt the hyperinflation and protect the  stability of the domestic currency. The confusion comes  primarily from doing business with two dinars--while the worry  comes from the inability to perceive the authorities' ultimate  intentions.    The introduction of yet another dinar to the trade payments  system brings with it the practical need to open up a completely  new line of account settling--from companies, through commercial  banks, to the trade payments service and the central bank. It is  inherent to the way that they operate that commercial banks will  be the most overburdened, precisely because they are forced to  develop new banks within themselves for all ordinary bank  transactions, but with the new dinars. While some are utterly  desperate because of the congestion that is already present only  in the sector of private checking accounts, others are hoping  that the onslaught will not come all at once, since the new  dinars will not come flooding in either. The fact that the state  has allocated around $4 million to back the complete issue of  new dinars clearly does not mean that the entire new money  supply will be put into circulation immediately. In fact,  businessmen do not know how many new dinars will be in  circulation next week, nor who will have them, but it can be  assumed, judging from statements--albeit imprecise and  inadequate ones--made by officials that beneficiaries of the  budget will be the first to get new dinars. Thus, all the  hirelings of the state apparatus, from the military and police  to health care, education, and the other budget beneficiaries.  Pensioners will be included with them, but it is unclear what  will happen with the mass of nearly two million people who are  genuinely unemployed. It is certain that this figure will be  reduced, but it is still unknown by how much and at what pace.  Naturally, one particular unknown is how much wages will be and  how much the subsidies to uncontroversial budget beneficiaries  will be.  <H5>  From the Baker On </H5>   This much appears indisputable: Everyone who does not get  the  new dinars, individuals or enterprises, but who needs them, has  only one legal way to get them. That is by selling convertible  currency to the bank. That is the only way to open an account in  the new dinars. Anyone who goes to a commercial bank with  foreign exchange, to buy dinars or for some other payment, will  wait for his bank to do the same thing with the SDK [Public  Auditing Service] or the central bank.    People and enterprises will be forced to sell off foreign  exchange by the fact that old dinars will progressively drop in  real value (if the authorities keep their promise that the issue  of those dinars has been definitively halted). The amount of  dollars and German marks in the reserves of business and the  population remains unknown, even as a rough estimate. If it is  true that the new dinars will go only to budget beneficiaries,  then it will quickly become apparent which companies have  foreign exchange reserves at their disposal: After all, in order  to pay their employees, they will have to sell the corresponding  sum of foreign exchange to their commercial bank, and based on  that foreign exchange it will get the equivalent value of new  dinars from the central bank. Foreign exchange or gold remains  in the state reserves, and there are no more prime-issue loans,  as long as feeding the budget with the bought-up foreign  exchange reserves of citizens and business is not understood as  a continuation of the credit arrangement. The commercial banks  will be able to supply credits to their representatives only  once both parties fill their accounts with new dinars. For  example, bakers will first get new dinars from pensioners and  state employees, but anyone who knows anything about the scale  of the national economy knows that this and similar flywheels  are too small and slow for the functioning of the overall  economy. All that remains is the aforementioned way of speeding  things up: the sale of foreign exchange reserves, in effect, to  the state.  <H5>  Straw Mattresses and Holes </H5>   One special, and especially big subject is the fate of those  who in fact have no foreign exchange reserves. Another question  is this: What the state will do with those firms that offer  foreign exchange for sale, but are not registered for foreign  trading, i.e., had no legal right to foreign exchange accounts?  Who acquired dollars legally under sanction conditions?  Naturally, this is only a scarcely likely turn of events if the  main goal of the authorities is to extract as much foreign  exchange as possible from citizens and business. But this is in  fact the catch: If the straw mattresses and secret accounts are  opened up, the collectors of the foreign exchange will have no  reason to inquire into the money's origin; if, despite draconic  penalties, business continues to be done primarily in German  marks instead of in superdinars, the authorities, such as they  are, will have to turn to a less subtle way of collecting  foreign exchange reserves. And although their size is unknown,  those reserves are running low. On Wednesday the federal  government allocated another $300 million: The central bank is  authorized to go that far into debt, at the state's expense,  with enterprises and individuals, for no longer than one year.    Is it only malicious people who will say that this is a new  link in the well-known chain of old and semi-old Dafina-type  foreign exchange savings? At the same time, the old foreign  exchange savings are becoming the state's public debt; there is  a semblance of honesty: The state accepts the obligation to pay  out every cent, although depositors' claims are frozen for  several years, and to then begin payments in the established  monthly and annual portions. In the meantime, this debt, through  tiny monthly payments, is reduced to a little more than $3  billion. In banking circles, the theory is circulating that  approximately 90 percent of all depositors possess only 10  percent of that total, and these are generally old people, in  view of when most of these savings came into being. Paying them  off quickly and completely appears painless, and this would  provide a large number of people with basic living expenses for  several years: on the one hand only 10 percent of the total old  foreign exchange deposits, while on the other hand a huge number  of pensioners who are currently receiving "stamps" or some  coupon for financing the pension fund over several decades. But  this "little sum" is equivalent to what the federal government  is promising to return if the central bank buys up that much  foreign exchange, in other words, what it is able to offer, even  if it is as a mere promise.  <H5>  Trust in Promises </H5>   Anyone who does not want a thorn in his healthy foot will  reason something like this: It is perfectly all right that no  one will be able to convert the old dinar into the new, i.e.,  into foreign exchange. However, the schoolgirl's happiness is  spoiled by the fact that on Wednesday evening before the cameras  of "Studio B" the head of the government's project, Dragoslav  Avramovic, had no response to the direct question-conclusion by  Dr. Tomislav Popovic, the director of the Institute of Economic  Sciences, that hyperinflation began in the FRY in the summer of  1992--to be more precise, with the adoption of the stabilization  program of the Radoman Bozovic government, with this same  Avramovic as the author of the program. This same schoolgirl's  happiness is also spoiled by Serbian state television's failed  efforts to hide the fact that the entire expert team (two  institutes and the School of Economics) renounced authorship of  the document signed by three governments and Mr. Avramovic: The  director of the Economic Institute did not comply with state  television's wish that he deny the conflict between experts and  the authorities pushing "certain lists," because he only said  that the experts have not given up on what they proposed to the  governments, upon which he was cut off in mid-sentence.    Will the new dinar too settle in like the Serbian foreign  exchange loan at the pinnacle of Milosevic's power four years  ago, or will this type of power prove to be a financial ruin in  the coming weeks and months? It is not right to the reader to  end an article with a dilemma, neither under normal conditions  nor under our conditions, but all hope must nevertheless be  ceded to those who believe that man can change, only if he  decides to do so, beginning tomorrow, or beginning Monday, or  perhaps beginning at the first of the month....</p>

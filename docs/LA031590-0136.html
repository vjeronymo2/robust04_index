			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASADENA UNIFIED MOVES ACTING CHIEF TO SUPERINTENDENT;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS: THE BOARD AND ITS CHOICE WILL MEET TODAY TO DRAW UP A NEW CONTRACT  DESPITE CRITICISM THAT A BROADER SEARCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE.  </P> <P> The acting superintendent of the Pasadena Unified School District has been  given the job permanently and will meet with the school board today to draw up  a contract.  </P> <P> If both parties agree to the contract terms, which are being negotiated, the  board will confirm the appointment of Phil Linscomb, 58, at a special meeting  this afternoon.  </P> <P> "I'm very grateful to the board for demonstrating the kind of confidence they  have by offering me this position," said Linscomb, who was Pasadena's deputy  superintendent of instruction for four years. On Jan. 3, he was appointed  acting superintendent after the retirement of Phillip Jordan, who left the  $91,000-a-year post last year.  </P> <P> The decision to offer Linscomb the job was criticized by board member Elbie  Hickambottom, who has long favored an outside search.  </P> <P> "When you are talking about the chief executive for a school district the size  and diversity of Pasadena, I think (at) minimum a state search would be in  order, if not a national search," Hickambottom said.  </P> <P> Linscomb, who cautioned Wednesday that the contract remains to be signed, said  nonetheless that he hopes soon to formalize his temporary arrangement with  Pasadena Unified.  </P> <P> "It's a wonderful challenge that . . . I look forward to," Linscomb said. "This  is a very diverse school district and I believe that diversity is one of its  strengths."  </P> <P> Linscomb has spent most of his adult life in education. He has a doctorate in  school administration from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah; a master's  degree from Cal State Los Angeles and a bachelor's degree from UCLA in  elementary teaching.  </P> <P> Before Pasadena, he was an associate superintendent of instruction for Los  Angeles Unified School District for eight years. Linscomb also served as  director of student integration for that district.  </P> <P> In his four years at Pasadena Unified, Linscomb helped start a variety of  programs that:  </P> <P> Improved CAP scores districtwide. In eighth-grade history and science, CAP  scores have risen 23 points in two years, Linscomb said.  </P> <P> Involved Pasadena Unified in the annual academic decathlon and pentathlon  competitions.  </P> <P> Increased opportunity for minority youngsters with programs such as MESA, the  "math and engineering science achievement" program.  </P> <P> Established teaching partnerships with Cal State L.A.  </P></p>

Rubets, deputy chairman of the Ukrahrokhim </F> Association, chief of the administration of the state plant  protection service, and M. Lisovyy, director of the Ukrainian  Institute of Plant Protection of the Ukrainian Academy of  Agricultural Sciences [UAAN], academician: "We Will Protect Our  Grain"]    [Text] Severe frosts and autumn sowing shortfalls  significantly narrowed the winter grain crops wedge [on the pie  chart]. Now another problem has been added: the crops are being  threatened by pests, disease, and weeds. Grain crops are in  danger of being harmed by the gout fly, oat leaf beetle, cereal  flea beetle, and other pests. But the greatest threat in the  southern, forest-steppe, and steppe regions comes from the sunn  pest. Despite severe winter frosts, its numbers remain very  high, especially in Zaporizhzhya, Kherson, and Mykolayiv  oblasts, and a number of rayons of Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, and  Kirovohrad oblasts. The diseases posing a danger include  septoria, powdery mildew, and root rot, which have appeared on  winter wheat in a number of rayons in Zhytomyr, Donetsk,  Chernivtsi, and other oblasts. As to weeds -- it goes without  saying that with no herbicides and fuel to speak of, they have  moved in widely in recent years.    What should be done? If there is dense weed growth in the  tillering phase, sown areas are sprayed with 40-percent amino  salt 2,4-D (1.5-2.5 liters per hectare), 70-percent sodium salt  2m-4X (1.5-2 liters per hectare), and 40-percent dialen (1.9-2.3  liters per hectare). To control the sunn pest (when numbering  two, three, or more per square meter) and other pests during the  mass infestation of winter wheat (in the booting phase), spring  wheat and barley (tillering phase), it is necessary to spray the  sown areas or around them in a 100-meter-wide strip with  40-percent metaphoson (0.5-0.7 liter per hectare), or 40-percent  phosphamidon (1-1.5 liters per hectare), or 2.5-percent decis  (0.25 liter per hectare). On spring crops, if the tilling dates  coincide, mixtures of these insecticides and herbicides may be  used in the recommended doses.    If more than one percent of the plants are affected by  powdery mildew, or more than five percent by septoria in  conditions of high humidity, high temperatures, and frequent  rains, the plants should be sprayed with 25-percent [bayleton]  (0.5 liters per hectare), 25-percent [tylt] (0.5 liters per  hectare), and 40-percent [alto] (0.15-0.2 liters per hectare).  Controlling pests and diseases should be combined by using  mixtures of insecticides and fungicides in the recommended doses.</p>

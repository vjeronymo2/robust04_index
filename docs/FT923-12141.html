			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Philips to reduce working capital and sell property PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group whose share price has fallen by nearly a third over the past four weeks, is planning to reduce working capital and the size of its property portfolio by 'several billions of guilders' in a multi-year effort to cut borrowings. The company said that more efficient management of group assets would 'have a positive impact on profits, interest cover, utilisation of tax losses and the debt/equity ratio'. According to an article in the company's in-house magazine, the decision was taken at a recent meeting between senior managers and the group management committee headed by Mr Jan Timmer, president. It described the move as a new phase in Mr Timmer's two-year campaign to turn round the fortunes of the Netherlands' premier industrial company. The lowering of working capital is to be achieved over the 'next few years' by reducing the amount of money invested in inventories and receivables, which last year totalled about Fl 25bn (Dollars 15bn). Philips also said that the 45,000 jobs cuts of the past two years had led to opportunities for reviewing its property and building portfolio. However, the sale of property would probably take longer than the reduction of working capital because of the malaise in the property market. Philips noted that each 1 per cent cut in inventories and receivables would generate Fl 250m in cash and reduce annual interest payments by Fl 25m. The company had liabilities of Fl 16.9bn in 1991. Philips' share price has plunged to around Fl 26 from Fl 38 on June 17, when the company warned that the depressed state of the global consumer electronics market would cause a substantial decline in second-quarter results. The downturn was accelerated last week following the news that a top executive in consumer electronics, Mr Gaston Bastiaens, was leaving to join Apple Computer.</p>

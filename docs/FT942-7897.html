			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / European Elections (June 9 and 12): General in the van of Forza attack - Financial Times Correspondents in Italy, the Netherlands and Britain follow the fortunes of three candidates seeking election to the European parliament As befits a military man, General Luigi Caligaris began his campaign for the European parliamentary elections by studying a map of his constituency. Heading the Forza Italia list in a constituency covering the whole of northeast Italy, he needed to base himself somewhere with easy access to places as far apart as Bologna and Trieste, writes Robert Graham in Rome. He has ended up renting offices outside Mestre in a flashy business park half empty because of the recession. Mestre, the depressing industrial adjunct of Venice, has the great advantage of being criss-crossed by a network of motorways. 'We have to cover an enormous area, nearly a quarter the size of Italy; and we are without the help of national television,' says the 62-year-old general turned military analyst and commentator. In a week he reckons to have driven almost 4,000km, grabbing little food and even less sleep. 'If I wasn't trained as a soldier and didn't keep fit, I don't know how I'd cope,' he says. He has barely recovered from campaigning in the March general elections in which he was the most spectacular casualty among the Forza Italia candidates. Having cast himself as a future defence or foreign minister, Gen Caligaris failed to be elected. But, as a consolation, he has been made standard-bearer in these elections for Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister. His campaign has been put together at high speed in mid-May helped by three full-time staff (one provided by Forza Italia from Rome), and a handful of volunteers including his picture restorer wife. He reckons to spend about L200m (Pounds 83,000) on the campaign, part supplied by Forza Italia and the rest coming from friends - often in kind, like a campaign car. The biggest cost is campaign slots on local television, the most effective means of getting his message across. In such a diffuse constituency, the general admits it is hard to give a focus to the campaign especially when voters are apathetic in the wake of the general elections. 'There is too much toing and froing,' he says, citing the frustration of driving a 400km round-trip for a poorly attended 40-minute meeting. But he is buoyed up by the support he finds for Forza Italia. 'They've seen us winning and everyone now wants to jump on the bandwagon,' he adds. Forza Italia's success under the mantle of Mr Berlusconi is not without its problems. The movement encouraged people to form their own support clubs in the run-up to the general elections, and these remain autonomous, little co-ordinated and often rivals. Indeed, a new political organisation directed from Rome is being built parallel to the clubs. More than 2,000 people applied to be Forza Italia candidates in the European elections, and of the 16 selected in the general's constituency, none have had previous political experience or close dealing with Brussels. 'Explaining the real nature of the EU is not easy in Italy because Europe has been taken so much for granted. This is the first time I think any election here has begun to question the nature of our Europe,' says Gen Caligaris. He denies being a Euro-sceptic; but equally he is not a Euro-enthusiast. A Euro-questioner might be a more apposite label for him and Forza Italia. 'I do not see a strong common desire for the Union - the UK is too sceptical; Italy is always too rhetorical; the Germans and French are too exclusive. . . . In going forward, we have to strike a compromise between full sovereignty and loss of sovereignty. The most important thing is to be clear what part of our sovereignty is worth losing.' Perhaps more important, the general believes Italy has failed to exert sufficient weight in European institutions. 'Italy has lost its influence,' he bemoans. He is determined to use Forza Italia's presence at Strasbourg to remedy this.</p>

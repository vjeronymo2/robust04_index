			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Floods destroy bridge FLOODWATERS of the Missouri river toppled a railway bridge yesterday while the Mississippi continued to rise, Reuter reports from St Louis. Sections of a bridge in Glasgow, Missouri, about 150km east of Kansas City, collapsed as strong currents knocked over two trestles. The broken pieces of the span were hurled against a separate road bridge. In eastern Missouri the rising waters of the Mississippi deepened concern that it could menace the St Louis metropolitan region and the area immediately south. The river's crest is expected to reach the St Louis area, home to about 2.5m people, on Tuesday.</p>

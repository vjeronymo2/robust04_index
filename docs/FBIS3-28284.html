			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Takao Toshikawa: "Who Makes the Decisions in </F> Japan-U.S. Negotiations?"]    [Text] The other day I had a chance to meet with Han  Sung-su, South Korean ambassador to the United States. As it  were, it was an unofficial meeting of a little less than an  hour, but during the meeting we covered a wide range of topics,  such as the critical nuclear problems posed by North Korea (the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea), the state of development  of the meetings between U.S. and North Korean high government  officials, Japan's political reform Diet, and the drastic reform  policy by Kim Yong-sam's South Korean Government.    When I took my leave of the ambassador after the passage of  our allotted time, I said to him as a matter of form: "I should  very much like to see you in Tokyo some day." Ambassador Han  winked at me, saying: "If I were appointed ambassador to Japan,  I could meet you very often. But do not tell this to the  present ambassador." I was a little surprised and impressed by  his ready wit and humor.    The reason is that I have heard Ambassador Han is an  influential person expected to become deputy prime minister and  minister of the Economic Planning Board.    Almost all of the influential persons who assumed important  posts under the No government were purged by the Kim Yong-sam  government, and Ambassador Han is a rare exception. Such an  influential ambassador talked to me frankly, listened to me with  attention, and furthermore made a witty remark in reply which  convinced me of his greatness.    At the same time, that made me think of our Japanese  ambassador to the United States, and inadvertently made me  compare the Japanese and South Korean ambassadors. My frank  impression is there is a great difference between the two men.    Takakazu Kuriyama, ambassador to the United States, occupies  a very high level in Japan as a diplomat. His father was also a  diplomat. He has a good family background and served as a  bureaucrat within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as chief of  the Legal Affairs Division of the Treaties Bureau; chief of the  Personnel Division of the Minister's Secretariat; director  general of the Treaties Bureau; and director general of the  North American Affairs Division. He was expected to be "future  administrative vice minister" earlier on. He became  administrative vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  in 1989 and ambassador to the United States in 1992. He is  nimble and a model of the serious-minded "elite." He is also a  spirited man, for during the Gulf war he offered resistance to  the dispatch of the Self-Defense Forces as proposed by Ichiro  Ozawa, then secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party,  and was deprived of his position.    In short, although both Japanese and South Korean  ambassadors  to the United States are excellent, they are evaluated quite  differently in Washington. My cursory inquiry into the matter  prompted the following responses from diplomatic sources in  Washington:    "Ambassador Han certainly has a good command of English.  Most of all, he has a sense of humor and a rich stock of  topics, which makes him popular in diplomatic circles.  Therefore, he is always called upon to make a speech. However,  although Ambassador Kuriyama is good at English, to our regret  his speeches are uninteresting. Thus, he is rarely called upon  to speak." The story goes that a member of the Japanese Embassy  staff happened to listen to Ambassador Han's speech at the  National Press Club in Washington in July 1993 and breathed the  following remark: "He will never find this fellow." To my  regret, I am obliged to say that the Japanese ambassador is  slightly outdistanced by the South Korean ambassador.  <H5>  What Is the Ambassador Doing? </H5>   Is the difference between the Japanese and South Korean  ambassadors to the United States only a matter of a sense of  humor and their skillfulness in making a speech? The answer is  absolutely in the negative.    [ Therefore, the problem is what kind of diplomatic  activity are the Japanese ambassador and the embassy staff  engaged in? We have heard some true stories about how Japanese  ambassadors to the United States were not very useful at  critical moments.    For example, a famous story is told about former Japanese  Ambassador to the United States Ryohei Murata (present  ambassador to Germany) who, upon arriving at his post, had  considerable difficulty in meeting with Secretary of State Baker  despite his repeated contacts with the White House under the  Bush administration. Another occasion occurred in November 1991  when the Miyazawa cabinet, which had just came to power, turned  pale due to the sudden postponement of President Bush's visit to  Japan which had already been scheduled. Ambassador Murata tried  to meet with Brent Scowcroft (in charge of national security),  but without success. Ambassador Murata managed to meet with  Scowcroft through the good offices of former Japanese Ambassador  to the United States Nobuo Matsunaga (currently a government  representative) who was in the United States in connection with  the public relations of the newly established Miyazawa  administration, and who was an old friend of Scowcroft. Murata  was told by the United States that President Bush's visit to  Japan was not canceled but only postponed.    In addition, recently there was another occurrence.  Ambassador Kuriyama managed to meet with Secretary of State  Christopher four months after the inauguration of the Clinton  administration. Armacost, a former U.S. ambassador to Japan,  said "the relationship between Japan and the United States is  the most important bilateral relationship," but Ambassador  Kuriyama could not meet with the U.S. secretary of state --  which corresponds to the Japanese foreign minister -- for four  months. Ambassador Kuriyama met with Secretary of State  Christopher only because they had business to attend to in  preparation for a Japan-U.S. summit meeting. At that time, the  rumor spread that Ambassador Kuriyama would be replaced.    Compared with Japanese ambassadors who have often been  slighted in this way, South Korean Ambassador Han Sung-su is  conspicuous for his unique and strenuous efforts.    Compared with Japanese ambassadors, South Korean ambassadors  are handicapped and cannot easily meet with high U.S. officials  even if they want to. Therefore, Ambassador Han tried to gain  access to the White House by energetically working by himself.  Through the good offices of Vernon Jordan, a big-shot lawyer in  charge of the transitional team for the Clinton administration,  and of former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Robert  Strauss, the most influential senior member of the Democratic  Party, Ambassador Han made resolute approaches to the White  House. After the APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation)  summit meeting held in Seattle in November last year, the  Clinton-Kim meeting was realized, which was said to be largely  attributable to Han's contacts. The first banquet held by  President Clinton for foreign heads of state visiting the United  States was for South Korean President Kim Yong-sam.    Whichever country it may be, ambassadors to the United  States  play an important role in deciding that country's diplomatic  policy. This is especially the case with the relationship  between Japan and the United States. Viewed from the U.S.  position, this is evident by the fact that Ambassadors  Reischauer and Mansfield led U.S. policy toward Japan. In this  respect, Japanese ambassadors to the United States cannot  compare with their South Korean counterparts.    Not only the ambassador but also the diplomats of the South  Korean Embassy in the United States are very active. Concerning  the collection of material from public hearings in Congress,  which is the important work of diplomats, diplomats of the South  Korean Embassy diligently visit both the Senate and House of  Representatives, and never fail to follow the themes under their  charge and collect information on them.    On the other hand, the diplomats of the Japanese Embassy  do not visit the U.S. Congress very often, and they seldom  collect materials on public hearings held by the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, which should be considered the most  important hearings. Even if they do attend, they entrust actual  work to the local staff. Top officials at the embassy say, "We  are short of hands and thus we cannot cover them." The reason  for their being busy is that they have "chores," which are  called attendance. In short, they have to receive and welcome  politicians, local government leaders, and the heads of  ministries and agencies, which prevents them from completely  carrying out the primary functions of diplomats.  <H5>  The Decline of the North American Affairs Bureau </H5>   We have touched on the fringe of the malfunctioning of the  Japanese Embassy in the United States. Now, how is the  decisionmaking of the bureaucratic organization carried out?  In other words, by what process are policy decisions made?  Here we would like to investigate the actual state of  decisionmaking by verifying Japan's policy toward the United  States.    As Mr. Taichi Sakaiya [not further identified] says, "the  myth that Japan and the United States are inseparable" is one of  the three "myths" that have prescribed Japanese politics under  the so-called 1955 system, together with "the myth that the  administration of the Liberal Democratic Party is eternal" and  "the myth that the bureaucrats are dependable." Japan's  diplomacy as the embodiment of the myth that Japan and the  United States are inseparable is based on the Japanese-U.S.  axis, and Japan's diplomacy toward the United States has been  Japan's diplomacy itself.    And, in the structure (organization) of the Foreign  Ministry,  this policy toward the United States is supposed to function  under the hierarchies commanded by the administrative vice  minister of foreign affairs. There are two lines of authority:  One is the chief of the First North American Division  (politics), the director general of the North American Affairs  Bureau, and the deputy vice minister of foreign affairs (in  charge of politics); and the other is the chief of the Second  North American Division (economics), the director general of the  North American Affairs Bureau, the director general of the  Economic Affairs Bureau, and the deputy vice minister of foreign  affairs (in charge of economics). In short, this is the  organizational mechanism that governs the decisionmaking of the  Foreign Ministry.    As its name indicates, the director general of the North  American Affairs Bureau is the key man who plans and implements  Japan's policy toward the United States, and he holds the  central post in the mechanism of the decisionmaking of the  Foreign Ministry. Therefore, under the reality that Japan's  diplomacy toward the United States is Japan's diplomacy itself,  the holding of the post of director general of the North  American Affairs Bureau has meant climbing the ladder of success  for the bureaucrats of the Foreign Ministry. And, in fact, the  persons who held the post of director general of the North  American Affairs Bureau such as So Yasukawa and Fumihiko Togo  have been promoted, through the post of administrative vice  minister, to be ambassadors to big countries such as the United  States.    However, the popular belief that holding the post of  director  general of the North American Affairs Bureau will ensure one the  post of administrative vice minister and eventually the post of  Japanese ambassador to the United States did not apply to the  last four directors general of the North American Affairs  Bureau. They are: Hiroaki Fujii, incumbent ambassador to  Thailand, who was director general of the North American Affairs  Bureau during the Nakasone administration; Tatsuo Arima,  incumbent ambassador to the Netherlands, who was director  general of the North American Affairs Bureau at the time of the  Takeshita administration when frictions between Japan and the  United States over communications and construction issues were  at their peak; Koichiro Matsuura, incumbent deputy vice minister  of foreign affairs (in charge of economics), who was director  general of the North American Affairs Bureau during the Kaifu  administration when the Gulf war broke out; and Yukio Sato,  incumbent director general of the North American Affairs Bureau  and who is expected to be transferred as the ambassador to a  medium-sized country in Europe.    Considering that the last four directors general of the  North American Affairs Bureau fell off the ladder of success,  Kasumigaseki [the seat of Japanese bureaucracy] expressed the  opinion that "the North American Affairs Bureau has lost its  influence." Actually, the decline of the voice and influence of  the bureau's director general is noticeable in various ways.  However, this phenomenon is not confined to Japan. The truth  is the United States has also greatly changed its diplomacy  toward Japan.    Under the Bush administration there was a team of three  policymakers in the White House, with presidential aide Brent  Scowcroft as the central figure. In the State Department there  was the assistant undersecretary of state in charge of East  Asia-Pacific affairs; he played a leading role in the U.S.  policy toward Japan. However, under the Clinton administration  the National Economic Council (NEC) was newly established, and  this White House carriage is pulled by a pair: Anthony Lake,  who is in charge of the National Security Council, and Robert  Rubin, who is in charge of the National Economic Council. The  subsidence of the National Security Council is also noticeable  here, and Lake is called a "lame duck," which metaphorically  means "he is virtually dead."    It is somewhat symbolic that the key men for both sides --  the director general of the North American Affairs Bureau within  Japan's Foreign Ministry, and the presidential aide in charge of  the U.S. National Security Council -- are both on the decline.  There is an interesting story in connection with this matter.    Director General Sato of the North American Affairs Bureau  has been friendly with Anthony Lake ever since his service with  the Embassy in the United States during the Nixon  administration, to the point he entered his daughter in Mount  Holyoke College where Lake had taught; Lake is also the  guarantor of Sato's daughter. Therefore, when it became certain  Clinton would win the U.S. presidential election in the fall of  1992 and Lake would become a member of the White House, Sato no  longer hid "his long association with Lake." However, the  Clinton administration's diplomatic and security team made a  mistake as regards the former Yugoslavia, Haiti, and Somalia,  which made the resignation of Defense Secretary Aspin  inevitable. In addition, Lake is also on the verge of being  fired. In short, Sato could not foresee the subsidence of the  National Security Council.    A phenomenon considered to be a kind of diastrophism in the  decisionmaking mechanism of the Foreign Ministry seems to be  taking place in other posts besides the director generalship of  the North American Affairs Bureau. The chief of the bureau's  First North America Division is the implementor of Japan's  policy toward the United States. For Foreign Ministry  bureaucrats, holding this post means entering the fast track of  advancement, if not the fastest track. However, recently those  who occupied the post have failed to enter the fast track of  advancement. It is possible they happened not to qualify for  that post, but we cannot deny that former chiefs of the First  North America Division have also increasingly failed to enter  that track.    To cite concrete examples, in the past there was Yoshio  Karita (ambassador to Denmark); recently there was Sadaaki  Numata (councilor in charge of press), Ryuichiro Yamasaki  (minister to Britain); Yukio Okamoto (retired), and Nobuaki  Tanaka (counselor to Thailand). As stated above, recently  successive chiefs of the First North America Division have  failed to become top bureaucrats within the Foreign Ministry.    What does the subsidence of the director general of the  North  American Affairs Bureau and chief of the First North America  Division signify?    To mention one thing about the recent trend, this  phenomenon coincides with changes in the U.S. policy towards  Japan. Before the collapse of the Cold War structure, the  Japanese and U.S. decisionmaking concerning the Japan-U.S.  relationship was in good order. Under the Bush administration,  Scowcroft was the number one man in the White House, while Karl  Jackson, the chief of the NSC's Asian Division, and Doug Pearl,  head of the Japan Section, managed the U.S. policy toward Japan.  Japan conducted its decisionmaking toward the United States  under the following lineup: the chief of the First North  America Division, the director general of the North American  Affairs Bureau, the deputy vice minister of foreign affairs, and  the administrative vice minister of foreign affairs.    With the end of the Cold War, there was a relative decrease  in the need for security, which was the axis of the Japan-U.S.  relationship. Furthermore, with the appearance of President  Clinton who "decides everything by himself," the U.S. lineup  collapsed, which influenced Japanese decisionmaking. As a  result, the arrangement which "attaches too much importance to  the North American Affairs Bureau" has lost its balance, causing  chaos in the Foreign Ministry's decisionmaking mechanism.    In other words, this proves that the Foreign Ministry's  decisionmaking process has been conducted by a very small number  of bureaucratic elite, sometimes in a very arbitrary manner and  without a spirit of independence, following in the footsteps of  the United States. In addition, there lies in the background  the deadlock of the distinct vertical system observed by  Japanese bureaucracy.    The Foreign Ministry has always advocated the  "centralization  of diplomacy," but the "centralization of diplomacy" and the  vertical system of administration have become increasingly  incompatible with each other amid the mutability of the world  situation due to the end of the Cold War as well as to the  acceleration of a borderless economy. The reason is the Foreign  Ministry finds it difficult to take the complete initiative in  any given field -- such as Japan-U.S. trade frictions in every  field, peacekeeping operations, the preservation of the Earth's  environment, and rice.    Under such circumstances, the decisionmaking process  initiated by the North American Affairs Bureau has lost its  authority and executive faculty. In the Foreign Ministry, the  following posts of the administrative section have been regarded  as the fastest tracks for success, and have increasingly  acquired importance: the chief of the Policy Coordination  Division of the Secretariat, the chief of the Personnel  Division, the chief of the Treaties Division of the Treaties  Bureau, and the chief of the Legal Affairs Division of the  Treaties Bureau.    For one thing, this means that men of superior ability show  a  strong tendency to avoid diplomatic frontline posts chock full  of difficulty, and thus take the social escalator, tolerating  the holding of posts.    If such a mood prevails, a typical bureaucratic process will  exercise greater influence in which the acting chief will make  plans, the chief will flesh them out, and the director general  will lay the groundwork within and without the Foreign Ministry  for the approval of the plans, thus further increasing the  opaqueness of decisionmaking.  <H5>  The Decisionmaking of the "Ichi-Ni Combination" </H5>   Rightly or wrongly, there is a saying that "Japanese  politics  is third rate, its economics is first rate, and its bureaucracy  is ultra-first rate." In the background of such a saying lies a  situation in which the bureaucrats have taken the leadership  under the collusive relationship among "politicians,  bureaucrats, and the business world." Taking advantage of such  a situation, the "bureaucracy" has taken an active part not only  in the decisionmaking of ministries and agencies, but also in  the process of national policy decisions.    This has been made possible principally due to the  weakness and corruption of "politics." If politicians are  strong and steady, they can apply the brakes to undue  intervention in policy decisions or to arbitrary decisionmaking  by the bureaucrats, driving a wedge between them. Actually  there are some cases in which "politicians" have attained  hegemony amid weakness and corruption.    In the field of diplomacy, former Foreign Minister Michio  Watanabe exercised leadership as an "influential minister"  during the passage of a peacekeeping operations bill and in  arranging the emperor's visit to the PRC. He also mediated for  the normalization of relations between the United States and  Vietnam, and between the PRC and Vietnam, with the greater aim  of rehabilitating Vietnam. Evaluations aside, we can cite the  following examples: 1) Ichiro Ozawa, deputy chief cabinet  secretary of the Takeshita administration, went to the United  States as a government envoy and led the Japan-U.S. construction  consultations to a successful conclusion; 2) the opening of  normalization negotiations between Japan and North Korea was  decided upon through the visit to North Korea by Shin Kanemaru,  vice president of the Liberal Democratic Party; and 3) Ryutaro  Hashimoto, finance minister in the Kaifu administration, took  the initiative in providing an international contribution of $9  billion during the Gulf war.    However, politicians cannot wage an effective rollback  policy  against the bureaucrats because the information and knowledge  which are the foundation of a strong initiative have been held  by the bureaucrats during the long administration of the Liberal  Democratic Party. Information is available only when there is  knowledge and connections. In that respect, the bureaucratic  organization, which has enormous power of approval and license,  as well as a network of various organizations, holds a dominant  position. Furthermore, to make matters worse the coalition  parties which have come to power in place of the Liberal  Democratic Party are in a disadvantageous position.    The weakening of the base of the coalition parties, as well  as the decline of the decisionmaking mechanism within  policy-making government agencies, as seen in the subsidence of  the Foreign Ministry's North American Affairs Bureau, has  induced the Finance Ministry to expand its "hegemony." At  present, "restrictions" imposed by the Finance Ministry on  "politicians, bureaucrats, and the business world" are very  severe.    Of all the industrialized countries, Japan's Finance  Ministry  is said to be the only agency which monopolizes absolute power  over budgets and finance. It can be said the Finance Ministry,  through its supreme command of finances, is obtaining control  over the bureaucracy. With contacts established widely and  deeply, and with his overwhelming power to collect information,  Administrative Vice Minister Jiro Saito -- who is said to be "a  vice minister of great caliber who appears only once in twenty  years" -- is among the top bureaucrats within the Finance  Ministry. Saito, in combination with Ichiro Ozawa,  representative secretary general of Shinseito who is said to be  "the behind-the-scenes producer" of the current coalition  government, is said to have gained great influence. This is  called the Ichi-Ni combination.  <H5>  Seven Men in the Inner Sanctuary </H5>   Many examples show how powerful bureaucratic control  actually  is. For example, before the Hosokawa cabinet could implement  urgent economic countermeasures, Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa himself  had to meet with Saito directly, seeking his cooperation on two  and one occasions respectively. Moreover, Prime Minister  Hosokawa had wanted to assure President Clinton of the  implementation of an income tax cut at their meeting in November  last year, but Hosokawa could not obtain a "tax cut" because the  Finance Ministry would not forego a consumption tax increase of  7 percent as the revenue source for the income tax cut.    The decisionmaking of the Finance Ministry is based on  the principle of having affairs run by a few select people of  superior quality. It is said a major issue like determining the  rate for consumption taxes is decided upon by seven men -- the  administrative vice minister, the director general of the  Secretariat, the director general of the Tax Bureau, the  councilor in charge of the Tax Bureau, the chief of the  Coordination Division, the chief of the Second Tax Division, and  the assistant chief of the Second Tax Division of the Tax  Bureau. One of the reasons this is possible is that excessive  sectionalism is thoroughly practiced within the Finance  Ministry. For example, the chief of the First Tax Division --  one of the elite -- cannot meddle in the affairs regarding  consumption taxes because he is in charge of the direct tax.    It goes without saying that decisionmaking undertaken by  only  seven bureaucrats in the inner sanctuary of the Finance Ministry  cannot be transparent.    It is also needless to say that the bureaucrats are not  elected by the people and thus cannot be discharged by the  people. The greatest issue is whether it is permissible to let  such bureaucrats, and a very few of the able bureaucrats at  that, control national policies at their own will.    Lynn Williams, former deputy U.S. trade representative who  had a verbal dispute with Japanese bureaucrats at Japan-U.S.  trade negotiations, offered incisive criticism: "We cannot  understand the concrete substance of Japanese rules and  regulations unless we ask the bureaucrats about them. Of the  industrialized countries, Japan is the only nation which  continues to have a system deficient in transparency" (NIHON  KEIZAI SHIMBUN, dated 9 November 1993). However, the aim of  Japanese bureaucracy is to make rules and regulations which are  "incomprehensible without the help of bureaucrats."    David Sanger, Tokyo Bureau chief for THE NEW YORK TIMES,  asked Prime Minister Hosokawa at a news conference following the  Japan-U.S. summit held in November last year: "Political reform  is now being promoted with the birth of the new administration  in Japan, but will it not be difficult for the prime minister to  carry leadership over into Japan's powerful bureaucratic  organization?" That question, which touched upon the core of the  matter, frightened the prime minister's circle.    The reason is that Sanger's question is indicative of his  recognition that Ichiro Ozawa, the creator of the Hosokawa  administration, and Jiro Saito, super-vice minister of the  Finance Ministry -- the so-called Ichi-Ni combination -- have a  firm grip on the coalition government. It may be needless to  say such a view underlies the Clinton administration's  recognition of Japan.    However, Ozawa is shocking Kasumigaseki by advocating a  rather bold idea of excluding bureaucratic control. The  essential features of Ozawa's plan are: 1) abolition of a  bureaucrat's reply at the Diet as a government delegate; 2)  parliamentary vice ministers will be renamed vice ministers, and  two or three vice ministers will be stationed at each ministry;  3) several Diet members will be placed under vice ministers as  parliamentary deputy vice ministers. Upon hearing this,  Kasumigaseki grew agitated, saying: "Great Heavens! Is  Nagatacho (the center of Japanese Government) going to take over  Kasumigaseki?"    In response, Ozawa answered in his book "Plan for Reforming  Japan": "This is not a takeover of government offices by  politicians. All the bureaucrats have to do is observe  political neutrality as bureaucrats and whole-heartedly assist  politicians as technocrats." Whatever political aim Ozawa's  idea may have, all the same it deserves attention and high  evaluation in the sense that it has proposed a concrete measure  against bureaucratic control.    Masahisa Naito, who was the director general of the  Industrial Policy Bureau and was certain to be "the next  administrative vice minister of the International Trade and  Industry," was advised to resign by International Trade and  Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagaya at the end of last year.  This incident, which became the topic of discussion, is an  example of the embodiment of Ozawa's idea; Kumagaya is a  well-known close aide of Ozawa.    At any rate, what is important now is to propose a concrete  plan for breaking away from the current politics, which is  controlled by the bureaucrats. In that respect, unless  effective reform measures are initiated, it will be impossible  to enrich our political options.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at  1830 GMT on 20 May, in an item from the "Slavyanka" program of  the Russian Defense Ministry, carries a report on the  controversy over the defense expenditure projected in Russia's  federal budget. It includes undated interviews with Sergey  Yushenkov, Russian State Duma defense committee chairman, and  Russian Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin. On the subject  of a reduced defense budget, Yushenkov says the following:    "A situation is emerging whereby the reduction of  expenditure  on defense is already, if you like, crossing a definite  physiological boundary beyond which disintegration begins. In  principle, it is no longer possible to reduce defense  expenditure, because all of this could assume a catastrophic  appearance.    "In this connection, I'll just cite one instance linked to a  recent event: the explosion of the stores on the turf. This  was a direct consequence of the Defense Ministry being neither  properly funded nor sufficiently equipped to maintain, store,  and guard these munitions. Sixty-five trillion rubles is the  minimum figure."    On the effect underfunding is having on Russia's  technological defense capability, Kokoshin says:    "Our misfortune and our greatness is that traditionally  everything we have that is most valuable has been concentrated  in the defense complex. If we lose that now, we will find  ourselves hurled back 10 years. We wouldn't recover from that  for a very long time. History won't forgive us if we lose that  now."    The Mayak reporter then reports that Yushenkov suspects the  cuts are not based on economic considerations alone, saying:  "In the opinion of Sergey Yushenkov, it cannot be ruled out  that certain forces have an interest in seeing a sharp cut in  defense outlay. In this way they are counting on aggravating  the social tension in the armed forces and using it for their  political aims."</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Standard's deviation Standard Chartered seems to have enormous difficulty breaking with its past. The bank protests that its latest troubles in Hong Kong go back to a time before its management and risk control were strengthened, but there is inevitably a sense that Standard is simply accident-prone. If the market shrugged off the latest announcement, this may have been because it has not involved a financial loss while much of the detail was already known. Coming hard on the heels of the Bombay debacle, though, it raises questions about inherent risks in developing country banking and, in that context, how deeply involved a bank like Standard Chartered should be in local securities markets. Arguably Standard's business is one of high rewards accompanied by high risks. Few other UK banks could produce a net return on ordinary shareholders' funds to match the 21 per cent managed by Standard last year. Yet few also run the risk of operating in the domestic markets of a broad range of developing countries. The market will always have to take account of that when rating the shares. Hence consensus forecasts put Standard on a multiple of around eight times 1994 earnings, which is at a discount to the sector. Improved risk control could enhance the rating of Standard's shares, but the market will take time to be convinced that the new management is effective on that score. Standard could also staying away from securities and concentrate on safer businesses like trade finance at which it excels. That, however, would be a strategic sacrifice. Economic growth will increasingly lead Asian companies to raise funds in the securities market rather than through banks. If Standard withdrew from that business, it would be piling up risks of a different sort for the future.</p>

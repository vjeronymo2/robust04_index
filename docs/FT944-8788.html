			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Vocational training project launched General vocational quali-fications for 14-year-olds will be piloted in English and Welsh schools next year, with an assessment system which has been radically altered in response to attacks from inspectors. Schools already experienced in vocational education have been asked to tender for pilot courses in three subjects - business and finance, health and social care, and manufacturing - from September next year. Ministers want to pilot more courses in 1996 including leisure and tourism, art and design and science. They also want to expand to include schools with little experience of teaching vocational courses. If all goes well, the courses, to be known as General National Vocational Qualification (GNVQ) Part Ones, will be offered to all secondary schools from September 1998. Each GNVQ will be equal to two GCSEs. The education and employment departments have worked jointly on the syllabuses for the new courses, following proposals made in January by Sir Ron Dearing, the chief government curriculum adviser. Sir Ron attacked claims that vocational qualifications would be viewed as second-rate. He said: 'I think that's a traditional view and it's a national tragedy. We've suffered grievously from that value structure, and our competitors have not.' He said the new courses would be attractive to the most academically able pupils. The system for assessing the qualifications has been overhauled after criticism from Ofsted - the government's education inspectorate - of last year's pilot scheme for GNVQs for sixth-formers. The inspectors said GNVQs needed tougher external checks. The qualifications made insufficient attempts to grade students and merely checked whether students had achieved a basic competence. Under the new arrangements for GNVQ Part Ones, students must prove their competence by gaining at least 70 per cent in multiple choice 'mastery tests'. These can be taken at three times during the year, and are included at the request of employers. Students must also produce a portfolio of work to show that they have satisfied various performance criteria. In practice this will require extensive work experience with local employers. They cannot, however, win 'merit' or 'distinction' marks without taking further external extension tests, designed to assess the depth of their knowledge. Controlled assignments have been added to GNVQs for the first time. Pupils must undertake tasks set by the bodies awarding the qualifications, under the supervision of a teacher. They will be marked by both the teacher and the awarding body's assessors. Ofsted said these developments answered its criticisms on standards and external checks. Both innovations are likely to be adopted for advanced GNVQs if the pilot is successful. Students will be barred from passing their GNVQ if their coursework for academic GCSEs does not demonstrate mastery of the core skills of literacy, numeracy and use of information technology. The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the proposals, saying they had the potential to 'transform the learning of young people'. It said that teaching staff in the pilot schools should receive extra training, and that they should have established links with employers. Teachers' unions welcomed the initiative, but insisted that they should be properly resourced with 'appropriate in-service training'. Labour was more guarded. Mr David Blunkett, shadow education secretary, said: 'There is a very real danger that we will end up with a two-tier qualification system if we don't ensure that GNVQs are seen alongside GCSEs as of potentially equal esteem.'</p>

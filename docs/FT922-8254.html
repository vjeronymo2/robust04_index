			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / People: New chairman for C&amp;G John Bays, 50, has been appointed chairman of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, which has assets of Pounds 14.8bn and is one of Britain's fastest growing financial institutions. Bays, a chartered accountant, is a director of Sharpe &amp; Fisher, a small Cheltenham firm of builders' merchants, and has sat on the C&amp;G board since 1975. He has been vice-chairman of the society since last year and takes over from Stephen Price, 67, chairman for the past five years. Price, a retired practising chartered accountant, has been a director of C&amp;G for over 30 years and will remain on the board. C&amp;G has been growing faster than many of its rivals and through a series of acquisitions has become a significant force in the industry. Its undoubted success owes much to the drive of its chief executive, Andrew Longhurst, who is thought to be the highest paid executive in the industry. However, in common with some other fast growing societies, there has been concern that its board of non-executive directors is not strong enough to control a powerful chief executive. Typically, building society boards have been composed of local worthies, rather than well-known businessmen. C&amp;G has taken steps to strengthen its board in the past year with the appointment of Timothy Brookes, the 42-year-old chief executive of In Shops, and Douglas Strachan, 58, a former chief executive of Allied Breweries. Yesterday, it reappointed Alastair Ross Goobey, 46, James Capel's chief investment strategist, who left the board last year when he was made a special adviser to Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer. Chris Tennant has become a partner of PHILDREW VENTURES. ***** Alasdair McKerrell, Malcolm Moir and Todhunter Bensen have become partners of Cazenove. ***** Glen Grant, Andrew Pisker, Carolyn Moses, Gary Weinstein, Katherine Klein and Greg Fitzgerald have all been appointed managing directors at LEHMAN BROTHERS INTERNATIONAL. ***** Brian Colls, director of technical services, is appointed director of financial services division at EXTEL. ***** Richard Cooper is appointed to the board of TULLETT &amp; TOKYO FOREX (LONDON). ***** Roy Dinsdale is appointed head of OTC equity derivatives marketing and sales at DAIWA EUROPE; he moves from Nippon Credit International. Jeff Harris (left), the new chief executive of UNICHEM following Peter Dodd's retirement at 55 this week, forecasts the new style at the top as 'plus ca change'. An accountant by training, he joined UniChem in 1985 and was made finance director the following year. He points out that, having 'been at Peter's side' as the pharmaceutical wholesaler evolved into a major public company 'it would be pretty irrational to want to wreak havoc when the business is running extremely well'. As Unichem looks to expand further into Europe, Harris, 44, admits that 'being a different generation' means that he does have ambitions to draw more people into the company's decision-making process. 'There are a lot of very able people below board level who should be involved,' he says. The succession was made clear last autumn when Harris was promoted to deputy chief executive. Scuba-diving enthusiast Dodd, who is off to spend the first four months of his retirement submerged in the Caribbean, drew attention before he left to the undesirability of chief executives boasting good golf handicaps. Harris, needless to say, does not play golf.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Brazil angered by WTO choice Brazil yesterday reacted angrily to reports that Argentina, theoretically a close ally, had backed Mexican President Carlos Salinas to head the World Trade Organisation instead of the Brazilian candidate, Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero. Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentine economy minister, was asked to cancel a visit to Brazil later this month. Brazil's Foreign Ministry said this was not a reprisal, but the visit was considered 'not opportune' because of Brazil's preparations for a new currency. However, the ministry said the Argentine action had caused 'great discomfort' and had been viewed as 'diplomatically inelegant'. Only one candidate from Latin America is expected to be considered by the new body. But Brazil insisted yesterday that Mr Ricupero, the only person to have officially put his name forward, remained a 'viable' candidate.</p>

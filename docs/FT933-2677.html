			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Security of Israel dependent upon a successful Palestine Sir, Andrew Gowers is to be congratulated for his well-informed Middle East feature, 'Fragile hopes light the horizon' (September 8). He shows great insight into Israeli-Palestinian affairs and his article is very well balanced. I would just like him to reflect upon his contention that the Palestinian issue is 'at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict', because although it has provided a useful rallying call for Israel's warring neighbours, I doubt the Arab nations have every really wanted a separate Palestinian state. Mr Gowers may agree with me that the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict lies in the very concept of a Jewish state existing in the midst of Islam and that sore will never go away, even if Israel were to retire completely to its recognised borders. There will never be a day when Israel can relax its security vigil, nor can I visualise a time when the dictatorial Arab states will not fight among themselves. Unemployment and poverty in a Palestinian state are Israel's greatest danger, and I hope that any international funding will be used wisely - not to build huge industrial estates without the proper infrastructures to support production and distribution. My fear is that the goods produced will not reach the standards demanded by the western world and my hope is that Israel will be permitted to provide its expertise to promote Palestine's industrial future. A successful Palestine will be Israel's greatest safeguard. S Goldman, 81 Stonesgate Road, Leeds LS6 4HZ</p>

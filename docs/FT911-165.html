			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: CRA increases offer for Cail to ADollars 8.50 a share CRA, the Australian mining group, yesterday attempted a knockout blow in its hostile takeover bid for Coal and Allied Industries (Cail) by raising its offer from ADollars 7.85 to ADollars 8.50 a share, valuing the company at ADollars 472m (USDollars 370m). CRA, a 49 per cent subsidiary of RTZ of the UK, holds around 13 per cent of Cail. The acquisition would probably allow it to overtake the Broken Hill Proprietary Company as Australia's biggest coal exporter by the middle of the decade. The group also declared its bid unconditional, and said it was confident of receiving acceptances for more than 50 per cent of Cail shares before the offer closes on Monday. However, Mr Neil Currie, Cail chairman, told shareholders in a letter that they should continue to reject the offer, which is pitched 10 cents below last night's closing price of ADollars 8.60 on the Australian Stock Exchange. The revised offer is also substantially lower than a valuation of between ADollars 10.70 and ADollars 11.20 put on Cail last week by Grant Samuel and Associates in a report commissioned by Cail. The report said the CRA offer failed to reflect the strategic value of the low-cost mines operated by Cail, Australia's second largest coal producer. CRA said the revised offer represented a premium of 33 per cent on the average market price for Cail during the current year, and warned it would not be increased. Analysts said it was unclear whether the offer would tempt sufficient shareholders to give CRA victory. However, National Mutual and BT Funds Management, which each hold around 7 per cent of Cail, said they would consider the offer. CRA has been cautious in its pursuit of Cail because of losses on its ADollars 300m purchase of most of British Petroleum's Australian coal assets in 1989, for which analysts say it paid too much. In a separate development yesterday, CRA said Novacoal, a 60 per cent subsidiary, had sacked 278 employees following a walkout at its Howick coal mine in the Hunter Valley, the premier coal-producing region of New South Wales. The walkout followed the sacking of three employees for refusing to comply with changes in work practices implemented to reduce losses running at ADollars 9.5m a year. The dispute is expected to go before an arbitration commission tomorrow but CRA said it would not continue to operate the mine at a loss. The mine, 40 per cent owned by Mitsubishi of Japan, produced 3m tonnes of steaming and coking coal last year.</p>

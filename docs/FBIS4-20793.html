			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Parliament Approves Air Corporation Bill"] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, March 7. Parliament today approved the  Air Corporations Bill to convert Air India and Indian Airlines  into public limited companies, with the Rajya Sabha passing the  measure by 63 to 29 votes in a division amidst a noisy protest  by the Opposition members.    The Opposition members, especially from the left parties,  took exception to the absence of the Civil Aviation Minister,  Mr. Ghulam Nabi Azad, who was to have replied to the discussion.  The reply was given by the Surface Transport Minister, Mr.  Jagdish Tytler.    Mr. Gurudas Das Gupta (CPI) (Communist Party of India) and  Dr. Ashok Mitra (CPI-M) (Communist Party of India-Marxist), who  raised points of order in this connection, were told by Mr. V.  Narayanasamy, who was in the Chair, that Mr. Azad had sought  permission from the chairman, Mr. K.R. Narayanan, for leave of  absence and for allowing Mr. Tytler to move the Bill on his  behalf. The permission to both had been granted to him by the  Chairman, he told the members.    The Opposition members insisted that the consideration and  passage of the Bill be put to division which showed 63 `ayes'  and 29 `noes.' The BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) members did not  participate in the voting process, though one of them, Mr.  Maheshwar Singh, moved a resolution disapproving of the  ordinance promulgated on January 29.    Earlier, participating in the discussion, members expressed  concern at the "unequal competition" between private airlines  and Air India and Indian Airlines. They also urged the  Government to take steps to stop serving of liquor by private  domestic airlines.    Some members said the Government was changing its course  midway without planning and the mixed economy was being given a  go by in the name of privatisation. -- PTI</p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: HIGH TECH: REALITY CHECK DUE  </P> <P> High-technology stocks, the stars of the first quarter, suddenly are leading  Wall Street's "uh-oh" list.  </P> <P> That's uh-oh, as in, "Uh-oh, the company just said earnings are going down  instead of up. There goes the stock price."  </P> <P> Thursday, two more tech companies that had been on a lot of brokerage "buy"  lists announced that they will fall short of analysts' earnings expectations  for the recent quarter:  </P> <P> Tandem Computers, which makes high-performance "un-crashable" computer systems,  said revenue in the quarter ended March 31 ran below the bullish levels it had  expected. As a result, the company warned that quarterly earnings will be below  the 29 cents a share earned in the Dec. 31 quarter, though still above the 17  cents earned in the first quarter of 1989.  </P> <P> Investors gave Tandem no quarter: The stock plunged $4.625 to $22.625, a drop  of 17%.  </P> <P> ADAC Labs, a producer of medical imaging equipment, announced that earnings for  the last quarter will be substantially below year-earlier levels because of  growing competition and tighter hospital budgets. The stock slumped 62.5 cents  to $1.125, a loss of 36%.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Businessland Inc., a computer retailing chain, said Thursday that  its operations probably just broke even in the March 31 quarter because of  "inventory adjustments" and lower profit margins at stores outside the United  States. Businessland stock tumbled $1.50 to $8.875.  </P> <P> The latest announcements follow a spate of disappointing sales and earnings  projections from other tech companies, including software hotshot Oracle  Systems and voice-mail equipment maker Digital Sound Corp. And they all raise  one big question: Is the high-tech group overall going to make fools out of the  investors who jumped into the first-quarter rally, believing that there was  value in the beaten-down stocks?  </P> <P> The simple answer is that the only way that can happen is if the economy was  far weaker in the first quarter than most people now estimate. And if that was  the case, earnings will look lousy everywhere. So a lot of people will feel  foolish.  </P> <P> The better way to digest the latest disappointments, veteran tech investors  say, is to realize that high tech is a big universe, and at any given time some  companies are bound to be running into trouble. Though the disappointments are  getting the attention now, it was just three weeks ago that Apple Computer  announced that its first quarter would be better than expected, partly because  of stronger sales, notes analyst Bruce Lupatkin at Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San  Francisco.  </P> <P> Of course, that's little consolation to someone who just bought Tandem at $27 a  share. But investors buying Tandem, Apple, Oracle or any other tech stock  should be following the cardinal rules of investing in volatile fields like  this one. That is, you never sink a big share of your portfolio into one of  these stocks; you diversify like crazy, and, if you've made a lot of money in a  short period, you take some profits.  </P> <P> Tech companies, for all their promise, have to be approached differently from  many other industries, said Roger McNamee, who runs T. Rowe Price Associates'  Science &amp; Technology stock mutual fund. "What we've seen is a reality check  in the last 10 days," he said. And reality is that "these are very difficult  businesses to run for quarterly earnings."  </P> <P> Because tech product order cycles can be so unpredictable, most tech company  managers know they'll fail if they try to meet quarterly profit projections,  McNamee said. Instead, they concentrate on meeting their annual targets.  </P> <P> McNamee owns Tandem stock and insists that the company has a hot line of  computer products that solve the database and networking problems of many  computer users. The latest quarter may not have been on target, he said, "but a  year from now you'll look back and say, 'So what?' "  </P> <P> As for the tech group in general, despite its first-quarter surge, McNamee and  other analysts still say the stocks' price/earnings multiples are reasonable by  historical standards. A stock that sold for 50 times annual earnings per share  in 1983, at the peak of the last tech cycle, now may sell for 25 times  earnings. "Valuations are anything but ridiculous," Lupatkin argues.  </P> <P> Even so, if the recent tech frights make you look a little closer at your  portfolio, good for you. Steven Gerber, analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill  Richards in Los Angeles, removed his "buy" recommendation on ADAC Labs on March  26 -- when the stock was at $2.625. (The stock had been as high as $6.25 last  year.) Gerber's feeling was that, though ADAC looked cheap relative to  earnings, "It was expensive on a price/book value basis." Meaning the assets  backing up the stock price "left nothing to fall back on" if trouble developed,  he said.  </P> <P> Moral: If you own tech stocks, this is a great time for a reality check of your  own.  </P> <P> Europe's New Confidence: Eric Miller, the seasoned chief investment strategist  at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York, recently  returned from a trip across Europe. What he found in discussions with big money  managers there is a significant shift in the way they approach U.S. stocks  versus their own stocks.  </P> <P> "On the whole, European investors seem to be sold-out bulls regarding our  market -- expecting it to go up but not participating very heavily at present,"  Miller said.  </P> <P> In other words, they think the U.S. remains a great place to invest, but  they're putting their money elsewhere just the same. And that "elsewhere" is  Europe itself.  </P> <P> In the wake of the crumbling of the Berlin Wall, and in anticipation of the  1992 economic unification of the Continent, Europeans' attitude toward their  own economies and stocks has turned sharply, Miller found. "Never in the 20  years that we have made such trips have we seen optimism as high as it is now  -- especially in West Germany," he said.  </P> <P> Not surprising, the West German stock market is up about 11% year to date,  leading all major world markets. And if German investors are worried about  their market getting too pricey, they aren't showing it. "The German investors  we met with are way under-invested in the United States," Miller said. "They  wonder why they should bother when the opportunities in their own country's  market still looked so appealing."  </P> <P> "Talk of the future may have been less heady in Switzerland, Paris, Brussels  and Milan -- but not a whole lot less," he said.  </P> <P> The bottom line seems to be this: There's a strong likelihood that Europe is on  the verge of being reborn economically. That means potential problems but also  many opportunities. Any U.S. investor who hasn't put some long-term funds into  European stocks may be missing a great chance to make money. It's easy enough  to invest in Europe via stock mutual funds that focus on the Continent.  </P> <P> Briefly: Big bank stocks got hit Thursday as Prudential-Bache Securities  analyst George Salem changed his "hold" ratings to "sell" for several banks,  citing growing credit problems. Chase Manhattan was downgraded and fell 62.5  cents to $27.875. Bank of New York lost $2.50 to $31.25 on Salem's ratings cut.  Not mentioned but falling just the same: Security Pacific, off $1.25 to  $35.625, and First Interstate, down $1 to $32.50. Most of the stocks are  approaching their 52-week lows again. . . . Proof that stock splits attract new  investors: Pasadena-based Jacobs Engineering, which split 2 for 1 Tuesday,  jumped $1.625 to $22.75 Thursday, after rising 25 cents Wednesday and 62.5  cents Tuesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HIGH-TECH LETDOWNS  </P> <P> How some high-tech stocks have suffered after recently disclosing anticipated  disappointment in quarterly revenue and/or earnings gains.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.32IN:2.44IN:1.78IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Price before  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Thurs.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Stock  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> bad news*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> close  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Change  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> ADAC Labs  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $ 1 3/4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $1 1/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -36%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Oracle Systems  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 25 3/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 17 5/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -31%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Network Equipment  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 29 3/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 21 1/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -28%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Tandem Computers  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 27 1/4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 22 5/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -17%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Businessland  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10 3/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8 7/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -15%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Digital Sound  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8 1/2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -15%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Chips &amp; Technologies  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 21 1/2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 18 1/2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -14%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 3Com  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 15 1/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 13 1/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -13%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> * close just before news was announced  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Commander of the Fourteenth Russian Army,  Lieutenant-General Aleksandr Lebed once again criticized the  Transdniestrian leadership and proposed that new elections be  held to all power bodies in the self-proclaimed Transdniestrian  Republic.    "We showed people for whom they have been fighting and  revealed their tricks when running Transdniestria," Lebed said  in an interview with the Dnestrovskaya Pravda newspaper today.  He added that the present power had completely outlived its  time and that the composition of all its bodies must be changed  through early simultaneous elections monitored by international  organizations. It would be good also to vote confidence in  current President Igor Smirnov, Lebed said.    He said that Transdniestria had no future with its present  leadership. "The Transdniestrian people will only be facing  more disasters and finally Transdniestria as a republic will  decay from its roots with no external interference. Moldova has  realized this, calmed down and is just waiting. Only Tiraspol  is reluctant to understand this. The local leaders are rushing  ahead without thinking about the disaster lying ahead," Lebed  said.    Lebed said he believed that the Transdniestrian leadership  must not count on the Russian opposition's coming to power. "It  is even worse than utopia to hope that Alksnis or Umalatova will  come to power. It is something fantastic -- not smart enough.  As far as Zhirinovskiy is concerned, nobody knows definitely  whether he will need Transdniestria when in power," Lebed said.    Lebed categorically refuted the accusations that he had  concluded a hidden agreement with Moldova and certain Russian  forces interested in the elimination of the non-recognized  Transdniestrian Republic. "While Mr Snegur, who has blessed  this fratricidal war, remains in power, I have nothing to say to  them," Lebed said.</p>

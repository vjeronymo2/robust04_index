			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A small plane whose pilot was spotting schools of fish for a fishing boat  crashed into the Pacific off the Orange County coast, prompting a search by the  Coast Guard and Navy for the flier, authorities said. Searchers found a  sneaker, a flight plan, an aerosol can and pieces of the aircraft, but no sign  of the pilot, Joseph A. Shirley, 42, of Del Mar, several hours after the plane  nose-dived into the ocean 10 miles southwest of Dana Point. Coast Guard  spokeswoman Elizabeth Neely said crews aboard a Coast Guard cutter and patrol  boat and two Navy vessels searched for the pilot of the Cessna 172 until  nightfall. The plane is believed to have taken off from Gillespie Field near El  Cajon in San Diego County, Neely said. Shirley was working with the commercial  fishing vessel Horizon, spotting schools of fish.  </P></p>

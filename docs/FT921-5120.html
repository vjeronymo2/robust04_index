			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Arts: The Pocket Dream - Albery Theatre Charlie Chaplin used to say that all he needed to make a comedy was a park, a policeman and a pretty girl. A short-staffed performance of A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Albery finds Mike McShane and Sandi Toksvig reduced to a similar minimalism in their very funny Pocket Dream. The play is based on the single idea of short-handed Shakespeare, and has just enough stamina to last the evening. Shortened Shakespeare is nothing new: the 'Skinhead Hamlet' runs to three pages in the Faber Book of Parodies; and in the theatre, Tom Stoppard's Dogg's Hamlet and Cahoot's Macbeth are distinctly succinct. What The Pocket Dream offers is a cast of five taking on 18 parts and delivering most of the essentials of Shakespeare without ever trespassing on seriousness. The play starts in crisis; 16 of the cast have repaired to the local pub, the theatre manager has placed the evening's box office on a greyhound in Catford, and the audience (played here by the audience) wants either a show or its money back. The Stage Manager (Sandi Toksvig) and the Front of House Manager (Mike McShane) decide the performance must continue. Add the PE teacher boyfriend (Lee Simpson) of the leading actress (Louisa Rix), an overdone leading man (Phelim McDermott) and an ursine stage-hand (Clive Mantle), and high jinks ensue. The plot follows Shakespeare, but the atmosphere on stage is made so informal by Toksvig and McShane, that the funniest moments of the evening come from watching them get back on terms with the real play. The gags range from the smutty ('I haven't had my legs this wide in years') to the witty ('I have never been so insulted' - 'Oh, you should get out more'); there is even space for the Buster Keaton falling wall gag. The set is supposed to be basic provincial repertory, although the artificial grass seems unkind. However, the show belongs to McShane, the bulk of the evening. From the first unwilling speech wrested from him ('I'm outta here'), he threatens to descend to new levels of anarchy each time he appears. Toksvig, who co-wrote with Elly Brewer, dovetails the backstage madness into the Shakespeare, manages some lively slapstick as Puck on a trapeze, and strikes up a fine rapport with both McShane and the excellent Clive Mantle. The audience has a chance to assist in the debacle of Pyramus and Thisbe, principally in the form of sound effects which have the stalls on their feet in an extravagant Mexican lion's roar, the galleries barking and the dress circle waving torches. There are even some lines to be spoken collectively; so if, as Prince Philip reportedly said, one can be forgiven a great deal if one can quote Shakespeare in an economic crisis, then absolution is at hand in the Albery.</p>

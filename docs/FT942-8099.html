			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Gatt air talks to restart The US, the European Union and other members of the 22-strong Gatt civil aircraft committee agreed on Thursday to resume talks in July on a replacement for the Gatt's 1979 code of fair trade practice with the aim of reaching a deal by the end of this year, reports Frances Williams from Geneva. The US wants any new accord to be limited to 'multilateralising' its 1992 bilateral pact with the EU which puts a cap on subsidies for the European Airbus. The EU and most other committee members are insisting that the new agreement cover all types of civil aircraft and components, and all forms of state support including indirect assistance through space and military research contracts as practised by Washington.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Savers shrug off C&amp;G cash blow The counters of the Cheltenham and Gloucester branch in central Birmingham remain unmarked. There was no storming of these financial barricades yesterday. Customers of the building society, which wants to be owned by Lloyds Bank, generally accepted with cynical resignation the High Court obstacles to their receipt of unexpected cash presents - Pounds 500 for mortgage holders and up to Pounds 10,000 for savers. 'It's disappointing, but I wasn't expecting it in the first place. It was too good to be true,' said Mr Mark Abella, who works in accounts at a television station. 'You can't rely on things in this day and age. It never comes off.' But he will not desert the C&amp;G. 'I've got my mortagage with them and you can't easily pick it up and shift it.' He shrugged his shoulders. 'It's disappointing that a building society like the C&amp;G and a bank like Lloyds should have gone public before getting clearance,' said Mr Peter Williams, an educationist. 'They shouldn't offer things they can't deliver. The takeover plan was a bolt from the blue when it came, and now this . . . ' He hurried away into the grey drizzle of Temple Street, where the building societies congregate in Birmingham. There was a gentle flow of lunchtime customers into the C&amp;G. One woman did not know there was a takeover in prospect. For others, the takeover and the court ruling were games other people play. 'It's meaningless to me at the moment. I'm not really fussed. You can always get money elsewhere,' said one anonymous small investor. Mr Ravi Bhardwaj, a trainee solicitor, acknowledged that 'most people would have been pleasantly surprised if they got a bonus'. But his main concern was cheap borrowing and good investment returns. Mrs Sue Darnell, a theatre administrator and a C&amp;G account holder for 15 years, was fed up. 'I've just tried to draw money out of my account. They've changed the rules about the minimum you can have in the account. They never advised me.' It is in such cases that the C&amp;G may be in trouble with its customers. Another example was Ms Lisa Hurst, a housewife. She was with Heart of England before C&amp;G took it over. 'I feel duped a bit,' she said. 'To us it's quite a considerable amount of money and it's money which in my brain I've spent.' Mrs Janet Whitehead, an accountant, on the other hand seemed to be enjoying takeover prospects. 'I'll possibly put a few hundred pounds in another building society where it looks as if the same thing might happen.' Her next bet is Birmingham Midshires.

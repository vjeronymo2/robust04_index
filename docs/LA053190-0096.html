			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESS / CAMPAIGN REFORM;  </P> <P> LAWMAKERS PLUGGING FOR FREE TV ADS;  </P> <P> THE HIGH COST OF AIR TIME, SOME ANALYSTS SAY, FORCES POLITICIANS TO COMPROMISE  THEMSELVES IN A CONSTANT SEARCH FOR FUNDS.  </P> <P> In the realm of political advertising, the phrase "free TV" has become the  rallying cry for a growing number of members of Congress who want to limit the  enormous cost of political campaigns.  </P> <P> Indeed, since Senate Democrats and Republicans recently began negotiations on a  bipartisan bill to reform the nation's political campaign system, the issue of  television advertising has proven to be the only aspect of the debate on which  members of both parties can agree.  </P> <P> Television ad costs, which now account for as much as 60% of the total budget  of a typical congressional election campaign, are viewed by many critics as the  motivating force behind the frantic quest for contributions. If these costs  were eliminated, some reason, there would be no need for members of Congress to  risk compromising themselves to raise millions of dollars.  </P> <P> In addition, Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.), one of the most outspoken critics  of the current campaign finance system, contends that while television  advertising has driven up the cost of campaigns, it has driven down the level  of political discourse. He notes that most candidates rely on 30-second  television ads that exaggerate negative aspects of their opponent's record.  </P> <P> "The 30-second television commercial has become the be-all and end-all of  political campaigns," Danforth said in a recent Senate floor speech.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Background  </P> <P> Free air time for political candidates is by no means a new idea. In fact, free  radio time was first proposed in 1936 by Frank Knox, the running mate of GOP  presidential nominee Alf Landon. It has been revived many times since then by a  variety of experts, most recently by University of Virginia Prof. Larry J.  Sabato.  </P> <P> According to Sabato, the United States is the only major democracy in the  industrialized world that does not require radio and television stations to  provide free air time to candidates during elections.  </P> <P> Under a law enacted in 1972, politicians are supposed to be charged the lowest  rate for television air time. But in reality, they often pay a much higher rate  than other advertisers to ensure that their ads will not be preempted.  </P> <P> David Bienstock, who buys television time for Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), says  one 30-second, prime-time political spot in the Los Angeles market can cost as  much as $35,000.  </P> <P> "It's out of control," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Proposals for Change  </P> <P> The leading Senate proposal for free TV was devised by a bipartisan panel of  experts who recommended that broadcast stations be required to provide eight  hours of free political advertising each year. The free time would be divided  among the major political parties, which would distribute it to all candidates  in five-minute, 60-second, 30-second and 10-second segments.  </P> <P> Another bill, authored by Danforth, would simply lower the cost of television  ads by requiring broadcasters to adhere to the intent of existing law. It is  similar to a proposal by Sen. David L. Boren (D-Okla.) that would give the  lowest rate only to those who comply with voluntary limits on campaign  spending.  </P> <P> Likewise, proponents of public financing for campaigns want the government to  pay for television ads -- opening the way for government funding of all  campaign costs in the future. Boren's bill would give each candidate federally  financed vouchers to purchase TV time, up to 20% of their alloted spending  limit.  </P> <P> Danforth's bill would provide one or more five-minute blocks of free air time  to candidates on the assumption that they would be forced to deal with issues  in a positive manner if the available time exceeds 30 seconds. He would also  discourage negative, attack-style ads by requiring candidates to appear in  their own commercials.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prospects  </P> <P> Despite the idea's growing popularity, television advertising for congressional  candidates is unlikely to become completely free in the near future.  </P> <P> Reason: The concept is opposed by the powerful National Assn. of Broadcasters,  whose members not only contribute heavily to members of Congress, but also are  in a position to set broadcasting policies affecting politicians.  </P> <P> What is expected to emerge is a negotiated agreement between broadcasters and  congressional leaders providing some reduction in current rates for political  advertising. In fact, even if Congress does not pass an overall campaign reform  bill this year, experts say, it is possible that legislation governing  television ads will be enacted anyway.  </P></p>

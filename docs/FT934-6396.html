			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / People: Leigh Interests Bowden Shaun Bowden, right, has been appointed chief executive at Leigh Interests, the waste management group, moving on from AH Marks, a private company specialising in crop protection products and organic chemicals. Bowden, 46, had been chosen by Malcolm Wood, chairman and chief executive, who intended splitting the roles following the growth of Leigh Interests. Wood, however, barely had time to usher Bowden into the company before dying from a heart attack, aged 62, on October 29. Paddy Custis, non-executive deputy chairman of Leigh Interests since 1982, is taking over as non-executive chairman. Custis says that since Bowden had the imprimatur of Wood the company has every confidence that the transition will be smooth; Bowden is starting work at Leigh on December 13. Bowden is a director of the British Agrochemicals Association and was formerly a director of the Bradford &amp; district training and enterprise council. He has an MBA from Manchester Business School.</p>

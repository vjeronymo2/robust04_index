			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Strong first half at Woolworths Woolworths, the Australian retailer, is on line to match forecasts released in the prospectus for its 1993 public float after a solid first-half sales and earnings performance. The company yesterday announced a net profit increase of 15.5 per cent to ADollars 109.9m (USDollars 78.5m) from ADollars 95.2m in the 28 weeks to January 9 on a 12 per cent sales rise to ADollars 6.15bn from ADollars 5.48bn. Mr Paul Simons, Woolworths chairman, said the company would pay a dividend of 6 cents a share and was well positioned to match prospectus forecasts of a ADollars 188m net profit and ADollars 310m gross profit for the full year. The latest result was held back by a rise to ADollars 15.2m from ADollars 2.3m in net interest payments, reflecting the cost of refinancing in last year's public float. Tax provided was down to ADollars 55.3m from ADollars 62.5m because of a lower corporate tax rate while depreciation rose to ADollars 62.5m from ADollars 60.7m. The bulk of the company's earnings continued to come from its supermarkets where sales increased by 12.2 per cent to ADollars 5.21bn and gross earnings rose 10.3 per cent to ADollars 168.5m. The general merchandise division lifted sales by 8.5 per cent to ADollars 770.7m and gross earnings by 9.5 per cent to ADollars 38.1m while the specialty retail group increased sales by 14.2 per cent to ADollars 168.9m and gross profit by 26.4 per cent to ADollars 12.9m. Ampolex, the Australian petroleum producer, has again passed the interim dividend after lower crude oil prices cut into earnings in the six months to December. Net profit fell 10.5 per cent to ADollars 26.7m from ADollars 29.8m in the period in spite of a 2.5 per cent increase in revenues to ADollars 187m from ADollars 182.6m. Interest expense rose to ADollars 18.2m from ADollars 15.5m and depreciation was up to ADollars 71.4m from ADollars 51.9m. Tax provision was down to ADollars 25.4m from ADollars 37.6m.</p>

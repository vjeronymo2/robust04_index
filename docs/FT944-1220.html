			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Sun Life blocks plan to restructure I&amp;S trust Ivory &amp; Sime, the Edinburgh-based fund manager, risks defeat in its effort to restructure British Assets Trust, its flagship investment trust, following opposition from the trust's largest institutional shareholder. Sun Life, with an 11.06 per cent stake, has voted against the restructuring proposals. 'We do not consider the proposals are in the interests of shareholders,' said Mr Jim Stride of Sun Life Investment Managers. 'They are unnecessarily complex.' In particular, Sun Life is concerned that the restructuring would create 76.8m new shares seven years from now, the dividends of which would have to be financed by the trust's total returns. Also, some shareholders and investment trust analysts have questioned whether I&amp;S, which earned Pounds 2.8m in fees managing both British Assets and its sister investment trust, Investors Capital Trust, deserves to continue as fund manager. The net asset value of British Assets, which owns about 65 per cent of Investors Capital, fell 7.6 per cent last year while the FT-SE-A All-Share Index rose 0.3 per cent. Some analysts are asking whether there should be resignations from the boards of both companies, which overlap considerably. Directors of both trusts earned an aggregate Pounds 76,000 in the year to September 30, up from Pounds 70,000 the year before. Mr Roger Inglis, chairman of British Assets, is due to retire next June. One of British Asset's directors is a director of Ivory &amp; Sime TrustLink, set up to promote investment trusts in the retail market. British Assets is committed to investing Pounds 1.6m in the project by 1997. Sun Life is expected to call for a poll at an extraordinary meeting in Edinburgh tomorrow, forcing all proxy votes to be counted. I&amp;S will need at least 126m shares to vote in favour to achieve the necessary 75 per cent approval. Institutional investors with 61.4m shares have already said they will support restructuring. I&amp;S has launched a campaign to encourage its personal equity plan clients, who own roughly 15m shares, and other retail clients to vote in favour. Mr Gordon Neilly, finance director, said that of the private investors who had voted so far, '99.9 per cent have voted in favour'. The Pounds 600m trust had sold shares with the promise that it would pay annual dividends increasing each year in line with inflation. While the investments had a return sufficient to cover the promised dividend in the late 1980s, more recently it has been paying out more than its investments earned. As a result reserves are down to 47 per cent of last year's dividend bill. The trust already has sufficient volunteers for the restructuring proposals to cut its dividend bill by 16 per cent. Those willing to forgo dividend income would exchange 25 ordinary shares for 21, plus four new growth shares with five warrants attached, exerciseable into ordinary shares at the net asset value on the date of restructuring.</p>

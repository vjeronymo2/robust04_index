			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Observer: Cheers Nice to see that Observer's favourite - Phyllis Cunningham of the Royal Marsden - won Veuve Clicquot's much-hyped Business Woman of the Year award. Being chief executive of a leading cancer hospital with 2,000 staff and an annual budget of Pounds 60m a year is a more demanding job than many in the private sector. All the same, the competition was not as fierce as it might have been. It's said that Kathleen O'Donovan, BTR's spectacular finance director, was short-listed but refused to contend. Could she have been worried that a win might sharpen boardroom jealousy of her fame?</p>

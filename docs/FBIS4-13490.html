			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["On the Road" column by Talal Salman: "Diplomatic Killing </F> and Sectarian Dialogue"]    [Excerpt] A diplomatic identity card is not an indulgence  or a certificate of good conduct.    Killing is killing. Justifying it, as in the case of Shaykh  Talib Suhayl al-Tamimi, is worse than the killing itself. The  abhorrence of the crime is not lessened by a heated legal debate  on diplomatic immunity and how to deal with the crimes committed  by diplomats.    It saddens the Lebanese that the Iraqi regime, after all the  disasters brought about by its policy of internal oppression and  its subjection to foreign humiliation, should insist on pursuing  its opponents with silencer-equipped guns and bombs from  diplomatic bags while allowing foreign inspection committees to  raid their presidential palace, besiege the Defense Ministry,  humiliate the Iraqi Army every minute, and dictate to the tyrant  his pocket money and his movements on land, sea, and air.    It is just as sad for Iraq and the Iraqis as it is for  Lebanon and the Lebanese (and all Arabs).    After all the oppression, coercion, humiliation, starvation,  and mass killing of Iraqis at home, death squads are formed to  pursue those who could not bear the humiliation of estrangement  and went abroad! Has this great people been condemned to mass  execution?    It is futile to blame Saddam Husayn for what he is  doing--yet  again, against Lebanon. Surely, his mercy for Lebanon and the  Lebanese is not greater than his mercy for Iraq and the Iraqis.    What is shocking, however, is that there is no authority to  take our complaints or grievances to in hopes that the oppressor  will be deterred even morally. Perhaps this is one of the  things that encourage him to carry on with his oppression.    Hence, the responsibility of the Government of Lebanon to  directly protect people living in this country, using its own  resources.    But this should not be used as an excuse for us not to  succor  political refugees, those fleeing the oppression of their  rulers, or those who seek refuge among us to protect their  families and, more importantly, to pursue their dream for change  and their right to a homeland.

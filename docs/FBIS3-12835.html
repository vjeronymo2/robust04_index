			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Days" column by Jalal 'Arif: And they are asking </F> us for self-restraint]    [Text] Thus is normalization!    Yes. These are the normal relations as seen by a gang that  has usurped our territories and established a state. It knows  that it was established through terrorism and that it will  continue to exist through terrorism.    Thus is normalization. Palestinians kneeling in prayer to  God in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron are killed by the  Israelis' bullets. This picture is an accurate representation  of Israeli terrorism and a summing up of the Arab tragedy.  Countless Arab revolutionaries and rulers had earlier knelt in  Washington seeking protection and offering their obedience and  loyalty in hopes that thrones and regimes whose lifespans ended  several years ago might continue to exist and in the hope that  "leaders" who have gone bankrupt and whose roles have come to an  end might find some new role, even if it means serving Israel.    The massacre has now come to expose the truth of everything.  It comes in the midst of a big clamor selling illusions of  peace and depicting the agreements for total capitulation as  historic solutions. The massacre reminds everyone that even  total capitulation will not make them show mercy to anyone but  merely gives the enemy a wonderful opportunity to practice  terrorism. They have not and will not abandon their Zionism.  Hence, in their view, the battle will continue until they  establish their "promised" kingdom from the Euphrates to the  Nile and until they control the water, resources, oil, and land.  Everything is permissible for this purpose and nothing outside  this design is of any value.    The massacre also reminds those who have forgotten or  pretend  to have forgotten of the real relationship between Israel and  the United States. They are saying that the killer is American,  mad, and an Israeli. Regardless of the naivity of the claim  that the crime was committed by a single person acting amid the  tight security thrown around the site, the truth that should be  apparent to us is this: the real criminals in this crime, as in  other crimes, are the U.S. and Israeli governments. It is the  Israeli government that has been built on terrorism, that  constructed the settlements, armed the settlers, gave them  money, weapons and protection, and pushed them into practicing  terrorism against the Arabs, and then released the killers  following nearly farcical trials. It is the U.S. Administration  which has supported all this and turned the Jewish gangs into a  state and the state into a gang that takes all it wants from the  United States -- ranging from financial, military, and political  support, and even the tools of terrorism such as Goldstein and  his ilk used, to atomic power and missiles.    What will happen after the massacre is very well-known --  advice for self-restraint and this U.S. call: "Forget what  happened, and let us play, or negotiate, so that the peace  process will not stop!"    As for self-restraint, we have practiced it, willingly or  unwillingly, for many years, and now we see the result. When we  hear the Likud leader, who is a candidate for prime minister  after Rabin, expressing appreciation that there are many people  like Goldstein among the settlers, what can we say to those who  shout in our faces saying: We demand the blood of our sons'  killers in every case and regardless of the place; anyone allied  with them is a traitor; revenge is a must; there are plenty of  guns available and also madmen.    As regards the negotiations, everybody knows they will only  lead to further concessions. Those who want peace must return  to international legitimacy. Let the beginning be a full  withdrawal from all occupied territories, removal of all the  settlements, and the recognition of the Palestinian people's  rights. Without this, any talk about peace and stability in the  region is nothing but a mirage.    The leadership of the organization that was established to  liberate Palestine should return to the right course and stop  what it began in Oslo. Otherwise, it should leave the scene  rather than lead its people to be massacred without resistance.    And the trumpets here that call for turning the cold peace  with Israel into a warm one should stop. Let them tell us how  peace can be established between the killer and the victim, and  how do Israeli bananas taste in their throats when they are  stained with the blood of the martyrs [reference to the  agriculture minister's admission that Egypt imports bananas from  Israel]    As for us, we have no choice but to resist to the end.  Therefore, we call upon all those who believe in a just and  comprehensive peace and who refuse to surrender to Israeli  hegemony to engage in serious work to establish a popular  organization that will serve as a spearhead in the prolonged  battle against the Zionist presence on the soil of Egypt in all  its shapes; an organization opposed to normalization and a  Middle East market; an organization that will muster all efforts  to support the Palestinian intifadah and mobilize the masses  against the Israeli-American conspiracy against our national  security and pan-Arab interests.    We have only two choices: To resist despite difficulties in  order to impose a just and honorable peace of the strong, or to  submit to the status quo, eat Williams bananas, entertain  ourselves with what they call "the challenge" [catch phrase in  articles by the chief editors of government newspapers that call  for a warmer peace with Israel], place our fate in the hands of  Israel and the United States, and receive congratulations for  self-restraint while turning ourselves into a nation of refugees  and martyrs.</p>

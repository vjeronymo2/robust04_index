			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: European coal outlook bleak A bleak outlook for coal in Europe in the coming decade but buoyant demand in China and elsewhere in Asia is predicted by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in its latest annual report on the world coal market. World coal use, production and trade fell in 1993, as a result, overwhelmingly, of big reductions in Europe, which are expected to continue this year and for the foreseeable future, the report says. While world output dropped by 1.8 per cent last year to 3.43bn tonnes, production in the European Union slumped by 13.2 per cent and in central and eastern Europe by 8.9 per cent. At least 10,000 EU coal mining jobs will be shed in 1994 and about 150,000 are likely to go in the former Soviet bloc countries over the next 10 years, according to the ECE. 'It is a tragic predicament that, in spite of constantly increasing productivity, the underground and difficult coal mining in Europe will not be able to reach the competitiveness of countries overseas where coal can be mined opencast and easily,' the ECE comments. By contrast, further strong growth in demand and output is predicted for the main coal consuming and producing countries in Asia, which now account for well over 40 per cent of the world market. China alone is expected to boost output by 250m tonnes by the turn of the century. Australia and Indonesia are readying to increase coal exports by 40m tonnes each over the same period, the report says. Nevertheless, the ECE cautions that the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to curb global warming could lead to coal being challenged by more environmentally friendly fuels worldwide.

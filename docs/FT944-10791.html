			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Arts: A dramatic lack of originality - Television They had a full house at the Everyman Theatre, Cheltenham, on Sunday, not for an early panto but for a tribute to a television playwright: a local boy, the late Dennis Potter. There were readings and video extracts from his work, from Stand Up Nigel Barton (1965) to Lipstick On Your Collar (1993), and then a debate on the question of whether new and challenging writing could find a place in television drama during the 1990s. It is a subject on which Potter was characteristically vituperative, claiming that there was an occupying power in our society, threatening our personal sovereignty, a power sustained most subtly through the broadcasting media. He was pessimistic about the idea of anybody setting out in the 1990s as he had in the 1960s to get his voice heard via television drama. So what is the state of television drama in Britain today? Judging from what could be seen last week there is far greater freedom now than there was 30 years ago to show, say, sexually explicit material, one of several 'difficult' areas with which Potter was particularly identified. The Spanish film Lovers, shown by Channel 4, about a young man seduced by his landlady, an older but decidedly attractive woman, contained remarkably vivid erotic scenes. Dropping a silk scarf onto her young lover's naked backside the woman murmurs 'Put it in', promptly adds 'No, you're so clumsy, I will' and does. Then the camera pans down to mattress level to show her whipping it out again at the moment of climax. There was more: no hints, no trains rushing into tunnels, but the sort of explicit material which, even 10 years ago, would have been available only in stag movies. It made the much-protested bonking scene in Potter's The Singing Detective look genteel. Of course a late night movie is not what we generally mean by 'television drama', yet it is drama on television, and what is in movies today will be in television's own material tomorrow. I am not aware of any protest about Lovers. Of course you would not find such material on ITV. There the most drastic changes following the last lot of broadcasting legislation have been not in journalism, as some of us feared, but in drama. ITV is now using drama like extruded plastic building blocks: 55-minute series about firemen, soldiers, doctors and policemen are being spat out for the 9 o'clock slot as though by automata and used to build the ratings edifice. Cracker is the high quality end of this phenomenon, a special-edition, hand-finished example which is well worth watching: Robbie Coltrane is on top form as the intolerable yet fascinating Fitz in the current story about a girl in the clutches of religious loonies. Revelations, the late night ITV soap, looked at first as though it might break some new ground. However, time is proving that even though we have a bonking bishop, with a nymphomaniac schoolgirl daughter, a drug addicted son, and a wife who personally administers the son's methadone injections, it has none of that chutzpah with which Dallas captured so many viewers. Ninety per cent of ITV drama today is forgettable the instant it finishes, and the idea of ITV - the channel which, during Potter's career, took us from Armchair Theatre to Jewel In The Crown via The Naked Civil Servant - even bothering to consider the work of a new young non-conformist iconoclast like Potter nowadays is laughable. And the BBC? Far more difficult to summarise. Pessimists will note that Peter Ransley, who in 1981 gave us the deeply felt and unforgettable account of 19th century rural life in Bread Or Blood, is now giving us the 1940s saga Seaforth which is highly professional but looks as though it was made for that 9 o'clock slot on ITV. There was a striking science fiction drama in The X-Files on BBC2 last Thursday about a killer-building driven by artificial intelligence: the washroom dunnit (killed the unsympathetic boss). It was not only entertaining but thoughtful, yet no more so than many episodes of The Twilight Zone, and The X-Files is another American import. In the area where it is so often urged to put its main drama effort, the classic repertory of Shakespeare and Dickens, the BBC has looked pretty impressive in the past week. True, there were infelicities in Measure For Measure, for example in the scene - so heavily trailed - where the director had Angelo drag Isabella across the floor and fling her on the sofa. He says 'Redeem thy brother by yielding up thy body to my will', but scarcely in the heat of passion since he adds 'Answer me tomorrow'. So much for the dragging and flinging inserted by the director. This production was, however, bent to television's purposes pretty successfully and, considering how odd the scale of values seems to many of us today (particularly death before loss of virginity) a difficult play was made impressively accessible. Better still is Martin Chuzzlewit. As with the Shakespeare, this is not one of the author's easiest texts, but the opening episode of David Lodge's dramatisation took us straight into the essentials and established many of the key elements - Pecksniff's humbug, his daughter's alliance of offence and defence, Tom Pinch's naivety - astonishingly fast. When backbench Tory MPs call on the BBC to stick to its last and keep delivering those programmes which cannot make a nice profit for commercial broadcasters, it is doubtless the likes of Martin Chuzzlewit that they are thinking of. This is cosy winter television of a deeply comforting sort; watching it is like pulling a rug round your shoulders and sipping a whisky-mac. Which was never the purpose of Dennis Potter. In the week before The Singing Detective began in 1986, this page carried the most enthusiastic review I have ever written, including: 'If all this sounds complicated, so it is - but in a wonderfully entertaining way. Here we have not some old novel adapted for television but an original work created specifically for the electronic medium, by a master craftsman who has served a long and productive apprenticeship. Today Potter uses television with the familiarity and assurance that Dickens brought to the writing of novels.' We now know that we are to receive Potter's legacy next year: two drama serials, Karaoke and Cold Lazarus, the first produced by the BBC with repeats on Channel 4, and the second produced by Channel 4 with repeats on the BBC. So there are still two of Britain's four terrestrial networks which will finance and screen his work. But long before he died Potter had won himself a very special position in British television, and there was never much chance of these being turned down. Going back to Potter's own doubts, the question is: what would be the reaction if someone came along now whose work seemed as different and difficult as Potter's was by the standards of his day? Despite the presence of Michael Grade from Channel 4 and Alan Yentob, Controller of BBC1, on the stage of the Everyman, and their co-operation over the legacy serials, there must be great doubt whether the work of such a person would make it to the screen given the new ethos in British broadcasting.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Warsaw, 25 June--The Sejm passed a law on  redenomination of the zloty today. With effect from 1 January  1995, "old zlotys" will be gradually replaced by new notes and  coins. The new zloty will be divided into 100 groszy, and its  value will be the equivalent of the present 10,000 zlotys. The  law was passed with 306 votes for, one against, and one  abstention.

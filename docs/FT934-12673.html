			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Gatt fears ease over procurement hurdle - Japanese pledge on construction contracts SIGNIFICANT new offers to open up national procurement markets were tabled in Geneva yesterday, reducing concerns that disputes over the issue will jeopardise progress towards successful completion of the Uruguay Round of world trade liberalisation talks. Japan tabled proposals to open up domestic construction contracts, both national and regional, to international competition. This has been a sticking point between Japan and the US in protracted bilateral negotiations in Tokyo in recent weeks. The US has also bowed to European Community pressure to include sub-federal procurement business in the package being negotiated. A new US offer gave assurances that contracts from 'entities from all 50 states' would be subject to foreign competition. 'The US has yet to say which entities these are, but inclusion of sub-federal bodies looks like good news,' an EC negotiator said yesterday. Officials in Geneva yesterday were perplexed by suggestions that disagreements over opening up the telecommunications sector had triggered a crisis in talks. On the contrary, they noted the US and the EC had agreed a memorandum of understanding in May this year hiving telecommunications off from the procurement package. A joint study of the sector is in progress, with a bilateral agreement targeted for March next year. 'It is true that telecommunications was formally withdrawn today,' an EC negotiator said: 'But that was purely a technical matter and a surprise to no one.' The US and EC have been sparring over government procurement rules for months. The US claims that bidding opportunities worth Dollars 16.8bn (Pounds 11.1bn) were offered to EC contractors under the Gatt government procurement code in 1990, compared with only Dollars 7.8bn in EC contracts open to US companies. The EC agrees that, in absolute terms, the 1990 Gatt figures confirm the US is more generous; but Brussels officials argue the value of EC contracts open to US companies rose sharply between 1985 and 1990, while the value of US contracts fell over the same period. Following withdrawal of telecommunications, talks have focused on three areas: access to contracts awarded by central government, ranging from works contracts to goods and services; access to similar contracts awarded by local or sub-federal bodies; and contracts in the utilities sectors, excluding telecommunications. These include electricity, gas, water and transport. The EC yesterday 'fleshed out' its procurement offer by detailing the 12,000 national and local bodies which would be subject to the agreement. Other countries had not yet presented such detailed offers, 'but there seems a fair chance we can get substantial liberalisation at a sub-federal level', an EC negotiator said. A US negotiator said the details of the US offer at a sub-federal level remained 'very fluid', adding: 'We are working intensively with states seeking commitments, but we don't want to force things on them.' Disagreements have also narrowed over the threshold level at which contracts will have to be opened up to competitive bidding, particularly in the construction sector. The US, which has consistently pressed for the lowest thresholds, has apparently raised its proposal closer to the majority preference for Dollars 4.5m per contract. More significantly, Japan has agreed to lower its proposal for a Dollars 15m threshold. It has not offered a new figure, which 'is being negotiated internally', an official said in Geneva.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Supercomputer trade row brews THE choice of a Japanese supercomputer by the country's Ministry of Education appears set to become an embarrassing trade dispute between Tokyo and Washington, which hoped the ministry would choose a US machine. The ministry chose a supercomputer made by NEC of Japan over a model from Cray Research of the US, which appealed in July against the decision to a new disputes panel. But the panel this week rejected the complaint from Cray, whose political influence in the US has ensured that supercomputers have been a sensitive bilateral trade issue for the past decade. Cray described the panel's decision as 'disappointing', but stronger words are likely to be used after Mr John Rollwagen, the company's chairman, arrives in Tokyo today. His company had complained that the ministry's institute for fusion science, which bought the machine, allegedly set technical specifications favourable to NEC and leaked information to the company. NEC said yesterday the US supercomputer market was less open than Japan's.</p>

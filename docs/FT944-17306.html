			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: First, catch your (Maine) lobster . . . - Eating out / Nicholas Woodsworth's worthwhile struggle with steaming crustaceans Lobsters, I decided sitting back one evening and surveying my shell-strewn, butter-spattered table at the Dolphin Marina Restaurant, are hard work. I should have guessed as much when they began handing out foul-weather gear. Disposable plastic bibs are de rigueur for lobster-eaters in even the more sophisticated seafood establishments in America - in some places motherly waitresses will tie them on for you. Then came the specialised equipment - the pincers for cracking claws, the long skewers for probing recessed corners, the bowls for rinsing. It was all new to me. I felt like a trainee dentist. And what about the vast expertise required? How much experience, how many botched jobs does it take before the seasoned lobsterer can artfully dismember this complex little crustacean? I watched one man at the table beside me deftly remove the meat from his lobster's tail with one clean pull. There was hardly a drop of juice splattered on his bib. My own chest looked like a Jackson Pollock painting. You could have made Thermidor with what lay in my lap. And is it, in the end, worth it? After the first bite I could only say yes, it most certainly is. But lobsters, sadly, do not come cheap. Here, on the Maine coast, home of what are said to be the best cold-water lobsters in the world, the pound-and-a-half beast I had just consumed cost Dollars 20. Try eating the same creature in some up-scale restaurant in a western European capital, though, and you might have to pay for it by instalments. All in all, I decided, the lobster-lover's lot is a hard one. 'Just about as tough eating a lobster as it is catching one,' I remarked to the young waitress who, as I mopped melted butter from my eyebrows, had begun cleaning up the battlefield in front of me. It was only the happy prattle that comes after a good dinner, of course, but she seemed to take it literally. She looked at me, looked out the window at a wind-whipped sea and boats tossing at their moorings, then back at me again. 'Get real, will ya?' she said. I decided, the very next day, to get real. My waitress had been right - much as I liked lobster, I hadn't the faintest idea of how easy or difficult it was to catch one. All I knew was that they were lured into large crate-like traps. But no one visiting Casco Bay, east of Portland, could avoid knowing that; most people here make their living from lobstering and traps sit in every backyard and on every wharf in sight. It should not be too difficult, I thought, to get as close to a snapping live lobster as a steaming red one. On Cook's wharf, 20 minutes drive from the Dolphin Restaurant on Orr's Island, I came across hundreds of lobsters scuttling about the bottom of a large holding tank. More importantly, I came across Ernest Hillman, the man who caught them, and the Franny Ellen, the 36-ft lobster-boat he caught them from. Hillman was refuelling at the wharf's diesel pumps before heading out to pull up 400 traps he had laid in 80 separate strings two days before. I explained my interest in lobsters - not the ones already swimming in butter but those still crawling about on the bottom of Harpswell Sound, the broad Casco Bay channel that stretched away in front of us. Could I come along, I asked? Why not, replied Hillman, he had something to tell me. We shoved off with Hillman at the wheel and his two deckhands, Joe and Chris, sorting out cases of baitfish in the stern. A purpose-built lobster-boat, the Franny Ellen carries a large tank of pump-circulated sea-water and a platform for traps on her aft deck; there is not much working space left over. 'Better ride with me in the wheel-house', Hillman warned as we headed into the sound. 'Once the ropes start paying out it gets kind of hairy back there  -you get your foot caught in a coil of rope and all of a sudden you'll find yourself being dragged 80ft down on a string of traps. We lose one or two men that way every year.' I rode, very happily, in the wheelhouse. For a layman like me it was a perfect day; the wind of the previous evening had dropped and we cruised out into a sunny, calm, scintillatingly clear autumn morning. In this weather the thousands of coloured lobster buoys that cluttered the sound - each one marking the beginning or end of a string of traps - stood out brightly against the deep blue water. For a lobsterman like Hillman, though, the day was less than perfect. It was full moon, he explained, a phase that created huge tides rising and falling more than 15 feet in Casco Bay. With strong currents like that running, he said, lobsters tend not to wander round in search of food but to stay put in holes and depressions on the floor. We came to a floating buoy marking one of Hillman's strings. His buoys are black and orange, the other 30 or so lobstermen he fishes Harpswell Sound with having their own colour combinations. Nonetheless, with some 12,000 traps out in the sound, locating one's own dispersed strings in this multi-coloured maze - and not tangling them up with a neighbour's  - requires a prodigious memory and skill. The first string, as Hillman predicted, was disappointing. Winding the rope attached to his bouy around a hydraulic winch, he began hauling in his string of five traps. Each held three or four antenna-weaving, tail-flapping, greeny-brown camouflaged lobsters; all but one, however, had to be thrown back. 'Too small', Hillman explained, measuring each carefully with a brass lobster gauge. Take anything measuring less than 3 1/4 in from eye to end of body carapace and you loose your licence for three years. Take a female with eggs and you are in real trouble. For every 100 lobsters I catch I keep only about 20.' As Hillman hauled traps, Joe rebaited them, sewing in two or three bait-fish carefully trussed in nylon mesh. While the quaint lobster pots of the past - knotted cord mounted on light frames of steamed wood - have long been replaced by metal traps, the principle remains the same: lured by a decomposing fish, the victim makes his way through a progressively smaller aperture until, once inside, he cannot find his way out. I began to understand Hillman's warning after Chris had all five rebaited traps lined up on the Franny Ellen's stern. As he threw the first one overboard Hillman hit the gas and 600 feet of rope and 75lb traps began paying out at high speed. When you have to haul anything up to 750 traps a day you do not waste time. As he worked, Hillman talked. He is the quintessential Yankee Down-easter - tough, resilient, enterprising and hard-working. He grew up on Casco Bay and began lobster-fishing when he was 12 years old. In the 1970s a hurricane sank his boat and he had to fight hard to get back into what is an expensive business - a lobster-boat these days costs upward of Dollars 60,000, a single trap Dollars 75. But Hillman loves boats and fishing; they are only thing he knows. He surprised me, then, by asking if I wouldn't like to become the owner of the Franny Ellen and all the gear that goes with her. I would not even have to buy her. All I would have to do was win her. Why? I asked. Six months ago, it turned out, a pile of lobster traps fell on Hillman, damaging his spine and injuring an arm. He is fast reaching the end of his trap-hauling days. When he put the Franny Ellen up for sale he received a number of offers from young fishermen, deckhands wanting to start up on their own. But lobster-fishing is a risky business: while some skippers are in the six-figure income bracket, many more go bankrupt. None of Hillman's prospective buyers could come up with the bank loans they needed. Hillman's solution? He has set up an essay competition. If he can attract 2,000 contestants each paying an entrance fee of Dollars 50, he says, he can recoup the value of his business. He walks away with the entry money, and the writer of the best essay, to be independently judged, walks away with his boat, 750 traps and 14 miles of rope. The essay topic? Fishing, of course - 250 words of finely-honed prose on Ernest Hillman's favourite subject. The morning wore on and slowly the tank on the Franny Ellen's deck filled with lobsters. In the end it turned out to be not too bad a catch: at Cook's wharf we off-loaded about 300 of the little brutes, each with their claws carefully strapped tight with a pair of bright yellow elastic bands. Later, flying home, I day-dreamed about those lobsters. I had no difficulty imagining them flying off, like me, to distant destinations. In my mind's eye I could see them roaming about restaurant display tanks in New York, diving into boiling vats of water in Rome, swimming through Newburg sauce on dinner plates in Paris. And, if I closed my eyes and thought very hard indeed, I could see them in a trap on the deck of my very own lobster boat in Maine.

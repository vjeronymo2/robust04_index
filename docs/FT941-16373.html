			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Japanese imports up The growing taste in Japan for foreign-made cars last year boosted sales of imported cars by more than 9 per cent, according to figures released yesterday by the Japan Automobile Importers Association, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo. Sales of imported vehicles rose 9.1 per cent from the previous year to 201,481 units, marking the first year-on-year rise in three years, the association said. However, the success of imported cars did not reflect a simple rise in demand for foreign makes but was largely supported by increased sales of cars made by Japanese carmakers at their overseas facilities, which rose by 48 per cent. Honda, in particular, saw wide demand for its cars made in the US and sales of Honda of America's vehicles jumped 36 per cent to 26,841 units. The company, which has positioned the US as a world exporting base, expects to raise exports from the US to 28 countries including Japan from 41,694 units last year to 75,000 units in 1994.</p>

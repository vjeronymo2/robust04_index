			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORWEGIAN FILMMAKERS FIND THE PATH LEADS TO DISNEY;  </P> <P> MOVIES: AFTER THE ARCTIC VASTNESS OF 'PATHFINDER,' NILS GAUP AND JOHN M.  JACOBSEN ARE IN GLENDALE FINISHING UP A 19TH-CENTURY PIRATE ADVENTURE.  </P> <P> "Pathfinder," which is playing at the Fine Arts in Beverly Hills, is a starkly  beautiful retelling of a 1,000-year-old Lapp coming-of-age saga set above the  Arctic Circle. The film won a 1988 Oscar nomination for writer-director Nils  Gaup and producer John M. Jacobsen and now it has brought the pair from Oslo to  California, where they are completing Gaup's second film for Walt Disney  Studios.  </P> <P> "Haaken Haakenson," which is the new film's Norwegian title (an alternative  title is yet to be chosen), is a 19th-Century tale about the adventures of a  shipwrecked boy, pirates and buried treasure, and it has provided some  far-flung adventures for the cast and crew as well.  </P> <P> The film, which is being done in English and Norwegian versions, is finishing  up in an industrial section of Glendale after stops in Fiji, Norway, Spain and  Britain. This is large-scale filmmaking, with simulated shipwrecks (shot in  Spain) and sets built to simulate 1852 London (shot in Liverpool). But what  Gaup is most interested in on this early summer day is providing some  historical perspective on his own people.  </P> <P> "I should explain that we Lapps call ourselves the Sami people," said the  35-year-old Gaup. "Lapp is slightly degrading. Our land includes parts of  Sweden, Finland, Norway and the U.S.S.R. We were a nomadic people who didn't  believe in borders. We moved from country to country, but we couldn't go back  and forth between Norway and the U.S.S.R. until perestroika.  </P> <P> "We are one tribe with one language (but several dialects), one religion and  the same culture. Basically, we are a hunting people. Our religion is similar  to the American Indians': We believe that the Mother Earth is alive. To kill  her is the same as killing a person.  </P> <P> "We are struggling to preserve our own culture from being assimilated by the  stronger Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish cultures. We have also been repressed  by these people. In 1980, there was a really big cultural fight. The Sami  people protested the damming of a river -- it was in a reindeer area and the  river had salmon. But 600 policemen were sent up from Oslo, so we lost. I was  arrested."  </P> <P> "The technocrats always win," Jacobsen interjected.  </P> <P> Gaup said it was this loss and ensuing depression that partly inspired him to  write "Pathfinder."  </P> <P> "I was 9 or 10 when we got television," he said, "and TV took over the  storyteller's place in our culture, which has an oral tradition. I wanted to  make a big-scope film as a revenge on television."  </P> <P> It was at this point that Gaup, a former actor, and Jacobsen crossed paths: "I  was making a film, and the cameraman asked me, 'Are you interested in another  project? There's this Sami actor I know trying to raise money to make a film in  the Sami language. I think it would be a very good film.' "  </P> <P> "My reaction was a big yawn," Jacobsen said. "I said, 'A Sami movie? You've got  to be kidding!' My reaction was like that of other Norwegians toward the Sami  people, who are looked down upon slightly, who are regarded with a kind of  indirect discrimination.  </P> <P> "The cameraman said, 'Read it tonight or you won't read it at all,' " Jacobsen  continued. "I was completely hooked by Page 3. Nils really could tell a story  in images. As for doing the film in the Sami language, I believe that the  biggest risk is to do the safest thing. People who sit down and say 'We're  going to do something really commercial' always end up making crap!"  </P> <P> Jacobsen was coming off of a very successful film called "Hard Asphalt" and  said he was in a position to take a chance. With a budget of $3 million --  three times the cost of an average Norwegian film -- and Gaup's plan to shoot  in Sami, "Pathfinder" certainly was that.  </P> <P> "Nobody took us seriously," Jacobsen recalled. "They said, 'This must be a  joke.' Nobody believed it would play south of this particular area where the  Sami people live. But I thought we should make it an event. We would present it  in 70-millimeter -- a first for a Scandinavian film. Now no Norwegian can speak  Sami, so it would be like seeing a film in Hungarian."  </P> <P> Occasionally, quality will out, and "Pathfinder" went on to become the most  popular picture in Norwegian history and then got the kind of break little  films need. Jacobsen said a representative from Carolco Pictures, the same  company that made its international fortune in "Rambo" movies, spotted a poster  for "Pathfinder" while on business in Oslo and, even though the film wasn't  finished, made a deal to distribute it internationally.  </P> <P> In London, the film received rave reviews ("The kind you can frame," said  Jacobsen) and played for six months. Audiences were fascinated by the cultural  detail about a group of people mostly unknown even to the Norwegians, who  partially smothered them.  </P> <P> "As a Norwegian, I've learned things about the Sami people I never knew,"  Jacobsen said. "I didn't know . . . that until the early 20th Century the Sami  people weren't allowed to own land unless they converted to Protestantism and  changed their Sami name to a good Norwegian one. And it wasn't until the late  '50s or early '60s that the Sami people were allowed to speak their own  language in school. It's not that Norwegians are bad people -- they thought  they were helping the Samis for their own good."  </P> <P> "How often do you see a Norwegian film?" asked Gaup. "Swedish, yes, but hardly  ever do you see a Norwegian film in America. We were the first film from Norway  to get an Oscar nomination in about 30 years. It was a great victory for Sami  culture."  </P> <P> "Haaken Haakenson" is even more ambitious than "Pathfinder," and couldn't have  been made with Norwegian money alone. So Gaup and Jacobsen again found a white  knight in Carolco. The company showed "Pathfinder" to agents and studio people  in Hollywood and helped them circulate Gaup's new script. Among the interested  customers: Disney.  </P> <P> "Since it was a family-oriented adventure, to us Disney was the logical  choice," Jacobsen said. "It was a Friday and they said, 'Let's talk on Monday.'  So here we are."  </P> <P> Neither Gaup nor Jacobsen knows what he will do next or whether they will  continue to work together. "But I would like to make another film in the Sami  language," said Gaup firmly.  </P></p>

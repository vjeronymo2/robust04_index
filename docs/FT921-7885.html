			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Underwriters set sights on Spain's 10-year issue NEW ISSUE activity remained light in the international bond market yesterday, with underwriting firms pre-occupied with the launch of Spain's Y125bn 10-year issue, expected to be launched this morning. Nomura International emerged as the winner of a bidding contest for the new issue mandate and said that deal would be priced following consultation with other firms this morning. However, syndicate managers were yesterday divided on the correct yield level for the issue. Some firms commented that the bonds should be priced to yield the same as Belgium's Y50bn 10-year issue - 5.81 per cent in the secondary market yesterday. Others said that Spain's slightly lower credit quality, and the sheer size of the deal, meant that a yield up to 8 basis points more than the Belgian bonds was required for the deal to be a success. Elsewhere, the Victorian Public Financing Agency, which carries the guarantee of the Australian state of Victoria, launched a Dollars 300m 10-year deal lead managed by Morgan Stanley International. The 8 1/4 per cent bonds were priced to yield 76 basis points more the US Treasury bonds, considered fair by participants in the deal although the issue was said to have generated little enthusiasm among investors. Syndicate officials said that only bonds issued by top-rated sovereign and supranational borrowers would sell quickly under current market conditions. The lead managers held the deal at the fixed re-offer price of 99.25 throughout the day. Nacional Financiera, the Mexican state-backed finance agency, launched a Ecu100m five-year deal. This is the longest maturity Ecu bond issue by a Latin American borrower and underlines the extent to which developing country borrowers are gaining access to new currency sectors. In this case, however, the proceeds of the issue were swapped to provide dollar funding at a rate comparable to that available by issuing directly in the Eurodollar market. Lead managed by Swiss Bank Corporation, the bonds pay a coupon of 10 1/4 per cent and were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.875, where the yield is 10.284 per cent. Osterreichische Kontrollbank (OKB), the Austrian state-backed financial institution, launched a L500bn zero-coupon issue. The bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of L34.90, where the yield is 11.10 per cent. Participants reported buying from institutional investors keen to lock into the high yields offered by lire bonds but with a minimal cash outlay. The deal was the first zero coupon issue in the sector and underlined the growing international interest in Euro-lire bonds. Earlier this week Compagnie Bancaire raised L150bn and Crediop L500bn. Last week Deutsche Bank raised L200bn.</p>

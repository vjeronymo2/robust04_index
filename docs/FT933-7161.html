			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Kennedy assassination archive opens: Public given access to secret files in attempt to quell suspicions IT IS the ultimate treasure trove for historians, journalists, conspiracy theorists and Kennedy-worshippers: 800,000 pages of documents relating to the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy, released to the public yesterday. The huge archive was opened for inspection in Washington nearly 30 years after Mr Kennedy's death, following a bill passed in Congress last year that ordered the disclosure of almost all government records on the case. These include most of the few files which have not yet been published from the Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination under the chairmanship of former Chief Justice Earl Warren, as well as documents from congressional committees and 90,000 pages from the Central Intelligence Agency. Early finds in the CIA records include a secret internal memorandum speculating that the Soviet Union had most to gain from the assassination, although offering no concrete evidence of Soviet involvement. The Warren Commission's central conclusion, that Mr Kennedy was killed by Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone, has been backed up by most serious inquiries since then, with the exception of a 1979 House of Representatives select committee chaired by Mr Louis Stokes, an Ohio Democrat, which found that a second gunman probably fired at Mr Kennedy and missed. Most recently, pathologists and doctors who examined Mr Kennedy's body in Dallas in 1963 reaffirmed in the Journal of the American Medical Association their original finding that the president was struck by only two bullets, one of which caused the head wounds that killed him. Both were fired from above and behind, they said. Nevertheless, US public opinion has never accepted this verdict, preferring a series of theories involving a second assassin, as well as Cuban, Russian, Mafia or CIA backing for Oswald. Oswald himself was shot before standing trial. Even in the 1980s opinion polls showed two thirds of those questioned believed there was a conspiracy to kill Mr Kennedy, compared with only 13 per cent who believed Oswald acted alone. Mr Oliver Stone's film JFK last year brought a new intensity to the already thriving Kennedy conspiracy industry. The law ordering the opening of the assassination archive came in response to an upsurge created by the film in public questioning of the Warren report. But members of Congress, including Mr Stokes, warn that no matter what is released it will not be enough to quell public suspicion.</p>

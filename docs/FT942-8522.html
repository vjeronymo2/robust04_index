			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Kennedy clan gathers at bedside of ailing Jacqueline Onassis Members of the Kennedy clan were yesterday gathered at the bedside of Mrs Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who was apparently close to death as a result of complications from cancer. The 64-year-old widow of President John F Kennedy and of Mr Aristotle Onassis, the Greek shipping magnate, was given the Catholic rites for the dying at her home, after she had been told by doctors there was 'no more to be done.' Mrs Onassis had been receiving radiation and chemotherapy treatment all year for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, normally a curable form of cancer. But she was admitted to hospital on Monday with what were described as 'serious complications' before discharging herself 48 hours later. Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachussetts, who visited her on Wednesday night, did not attempt to disguise the gravity of her condition. 'I think all members of the family are distressed by the medical reports,' he said. In the popular eye, Mrs Onassis is probably the closest the American Republic has come to producing something like royalty. As Miss Jacqueline Bouvier, she married the then Congressman John F Kennedy in 1953. They had five children together, but three died shortly after birth. When JFK became the 35th president, she brought to the White House a youthful style and glitter not previously seen there, especially in her emphasis on cultural activities. Her appeal was global, starting with a sensationally popular visit to Paris in the summer of 1961. The tragic nobility of her demeanour when her husband was assassinated in Dallas in November 1963, while sitting next to her in the presidential limousine, moved the country to tears and admiration. Great sympathy was also extended with the assassination of her brother-in-law, Senator Robert F Kennedy, in 1968. Some of that lustre was lost when she married Mr Onassis later in the same year and spent much time outside the US. But after his death in 1975, she quietly re-entered public life, working for a New York publishing house and shunning the limelight to the extent that she could.</p>

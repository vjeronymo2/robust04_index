			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RILEY ASKS STUDY OF O.C. ARTS TO ASSESS NEEDS;  </P> <P> CULTURE: THE FINDINGS COULD BRING ABOUT A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE BOARD OF  SUPERVISORS' HISTORICAL HANDS-OFF POLICY.  </P> <P> Supervisor Thomas F. Riley has asked county officials to conduct a study of the  arts in Orange County. "The county has not played an active role (in the arts)  in the past, and the supervisor has decided to evaluate what kind of role it  should play in the future," said Courtney Wiercioch, Riley's executive  assistant.  </P> <P> "We don't have an arts policy . . . so we're trying to gather information and  determine if we should have a policy and if so what it should be," Wiercioch  said.  </P> <P> The study, to be conducted by the county administrative office, probably will  be completed by late February, Wiercioch said.  </P> <P> Wiercioch said Riley requested the study in response to the "momentum" of the  local arts scene. She cited the $73-million Orange County Performing Arts  Center, construction of an $18-million theater at UC Irvine, and a 1,500-seat  performing arts hall proposed for South County.  </P> <P> Historically, as Wiercioch said, county support of the arts has been somewhere  between "slim and none."  </P> <P> In 1980, the Board of Supervisors designated the Orange County Arts Alliance,  an organization meant to promote and support local arts, as the county's  official arts planning agency. But the board never funded the alliance, which  dissolved after 14 years last December without having achieved its goals.  </P> <P> Supervisors have made, and still make, individual grants to arts groups with  money from their personal discretionary budgets or revenue-sharing funds. And  last year, the board established a task force to study the possibility of an  art program at John Wayne Airport. Supervisors are scheduled to vote in January  on the task force's recommendations to create an ambitious ongoing art program  at the airport's new terminal.  </P> <P> However, none of the county's $2.9-billion budget is earmarked for the arts. By  contrast, Los Angeles County has set aside $35 million for arts projects this  year.  </P> <P> The study requested by Riley will address funding and will analyze the various  ways other counties support the arts, financial or otherwise, as well as  existing municipal arts agencies in and outside of Orange County, Wiercioch  said.  </P> <P> Riley's request for the study has won praise yesterday from the local arts  community.  </P> <P> Martin Weil, an arts management consultant and director of the ad hoc Committee  to Form an Orange County Arts Council, said its members are "strongly  supportive of this step." The committee of 27 local arts officials is working  to establish a countywide arts support organization to take up where the  alliance left off.  </P></p>

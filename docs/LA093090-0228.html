			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WESTERN STATE CONFERENCE FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> RUNNING BACKS PROPEL GLENDALE TO 21-12 VICTORY  </P> <P> Marco Arcipreste returned to action Saturday after breaking his index finger on  his throwing hand in practice two weeks ago, but the Glendale College  quarterback didn't need to throw much in a Western State Conference game  against host L. A. Southwest.  </P> <P> Glendale tailback Bobby Webster rushed for 128 yards and two touchdowns in 30  carries, and backs Wes Bender and Rafik Thorossian added 104 and 74 yards,  respectively, in the Vaqueros' 21-12 victory.  </P> <P> "We did what the coaches felt we needed to do," said Webster, who gained 77  yards in a loss to Bakersfield last week.  </P> <P> "I started getting yards on little runs so we kept on going to it. It was a  beautiful victory."  </P> <P> Arcipreste, a sophomore right-hander from Burroughs High who completed four of  seven passes for 57 yards, was on target when he needed to be.  </P> <P> With Glendale (1-2, 1-1 in conference play) leading, 14-12, early in the fourth  quarter, Arcipreste orchestrated a nine-play, 58-yard scoring drive, capped by  a 23-yard pass to Cotie McMahon that accounted for the final score.  </P> <P> Glendale stopped Southwest (1-2, 0-2) on downs on the ensuing series and took  possession with 7 minutes 42 seconds left.  </P> <P> Glendale never relinquished the ball again, executing 14 consecutive running  plays before time expired.  </P> <P> "(Southwest) has a good secondary and (its players) are very tall," Glendale  Coach John Cicuto said. "We didn't want to pass too much against them and we  did well on the ground."  </P> <P> Southwest's Craig Manigo passed for 154 yards and touchdowns of 23 and 41 yards  to Robert Avery.  </P> <P> Southwest wasted a scoring opportunity in the first quarter after David Mack  returned a Glendale punt 49 yards to the Vaquero 35. But Southwest was forced  to punt after four plays.  </P> <P> "Our offense has struggled," Manigo said. "We had the opportunities, but we  just couldn't punch it in."  </P> <P> Glendale tied the score, 6-6, when Webster ran 16 yards for a touchdown nine  minutes before halftime.  </P> <P> Glendale went ahead, 14-12, on a four-yard run by Webster late in the second  quarter.

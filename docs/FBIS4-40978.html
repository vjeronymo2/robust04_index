			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy Chubarov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 21 Jun -- The idea of holding an  international conference on questions of the security and  nuclear-free status of the Korean Peninsula looks at the present  moment more topical than ever. This was stated today by Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev before his departure by air for  Brussels. In the Belgian capital he intends to meet and have  talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.    "This meeting," the head of Russian diplomacy noted, "is  being held on the instructions of the two presidents to examine  the Korean problem and to agree a common approach in the UN  Security Council."    As yet, he added, we do not have sufficiently complete  information as to what specifically former U.S. President Jimmy  Carter managed to achieve as a result of his trip to the DPRK.  A. Kozyrev voiced the hope that his meeting with the secretary  of state will help shed light on this question.    At the same time, he stated, Moscow cannot be satisfied just  with the assessments of the U.S. side, but intends to be guided  primarily by its own understanding of the situation, since the  problem which has arisen has a direct bearing on the sphere of  Russia's national interests, indeed geographically the Korean  Peninsula is located much nearer to Russia than to the United  States.    In the course of his visit to the Belgian capital the head  of  the Russian Federation's foreign policy department also plans to  sign the framework document of NATO's "Partnership for Peace"  program and the "Russia-NATO" protocol to the eponymous  bilateral cooperation program.    This protocol determines, the minister continued, that  Russia  and NATO will cooperate in the military-political and  military-technical sphere on the main elements of the program  which has already been submitted to Brussels by Russian Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev.    Concerning the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, A. Kozyrev  stated that this question will also be discussed at the meeting  with W. Christopher. He announced that in Geneva in the near  future there might be a second ministerial meeting which would  be primarily devoted to liaison with the warring sides.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Observer: Traveller's tale Is Observer alone in thinking Tony Pidgley, boss of highly-rated Berkeley housebuilding group, sounds too good to be true? Last night's BBC Radio 4 programme - Counting the Cost - gave a fascinating insight into the Bentley Turbo driver's humble background. Now 45, he was a Barnardo boy until the age of four, and was then adopted by gypsies, lived in a railway carriage, and was only 10 when he did his first deal. He bought a sow and profited on the piglets. His gypsy family never bought anti-freeze for its fleet of lorries. Instead, young Pidgley was given the job of draining the radiators last thing at night and refilling them first thing in the morning. He owes a key lesson - 'careless talk costs money' - to his gypsy horse-dealing Uncle Vic, who Pidgley still thinks knows more about real economic events than the chancellor of the exchequer, who seems keen to court him as one of that rarest of British species: a successful housebuilder. Another of his admirers is NatWest Securities' Angus Phaure, one of the City's top building analysts. He says Pidgley knows more about making money 'than anybody in this bank', and describes his grasp of the UK housebuilding business as 'breath-taking'. That perhaps accounts for a further recruit to the Pidgley fan club - George Soros, whose name has just appeared on the Berkeley share register.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- Chairman of the Russian  Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko decided to personally look  into the state of affairs in the Russian Armed Forces on the eve  of the upper chamber's examination of the military budget. On  Friday he left for the Ivanovo region, where a missile army is  stationed.    Shumeyko was accompanied on his trip by commander-in-chief  of  the strategic missile troops Colonel-General Igor Sergeyev. The  missile army is partly armed with the newest "Topol" missile  system, destined to become the core of Russia's future strategic  missile forces.    Igor Sergeyev told ITAR-TASS that today's talks between the  missile troops command and Vladimir Shumeyko would center around  the problems faced by those troops. These problems, he said,  "are rooted in the share of the budget which is to be allotted  the strategic missile troops".    Shumeyko will be shown the troops' battle capabilities and  the main components of the training which those who are  entrusted with the country's nuclear weapons must undergo. The  Federation Council chairman intends to meet with some of the  army's officers as well.    Sergeyev said he was grateful to Shumeyko for deciding to  first visit the strategic missile units before making a decision  on the military budget. "That is explainable, since the Russian  military doctrine lays the most responsibility for the state's  safety and stategic stability on our forces. The strategic  missile troops are the main component of Russia's strategic  nuclear forces", the general said.    He further noted that the many problems encountered by the  troops are being resolved without compromising their battle  capabilities and reliability. The strategic missile troops had  to shoulder most of the responsibility under the START-1 and  START-2 international disarmament treaties.    At present, the commander-in-chief explained, about 60 per  cent of the rocket carriers and warheads of the strategic  nuclear forces are concentrated in the missile troops. These  types of weapons are due to be reduced to one-sixth their former  size. Sergeyev also pointed out that, even without any  international treaties, Russia would have to eliminate the  weapons which used to be produced in the other ex-Soviet  Republics.    Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev declared at a recent  press conference that the country's strategic nuclear forces  were the main guarantee of Russia's security in the modern  world. At present as well as in the future, the top priority in  the development of the armed forces will be given to strategic  nuclear weapons, which are the main deterrent factor against any  outbreak of hostilities, he said.    The divisions and regiments of the strategic missile troops,  which are at the centre of the nuclear forces, are now being  technically reequipped. In the last two years, seven more  missile regiments have been made battle-capable, all equipped  with new stationary and mobile missile systems.    At the same time, strategic missile units are being  withdrawn  from the other ex-Soviet Republics. By the end of 1994, another  four missile regiments are due to be relocated to Russian  territory.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Afghan border focus of region's woes: The hostilities bubbling across central Asia STINGER anti-aircraft missiles were among the deadliest weapons in the arsenal of the Afghan tribesmen who fought Soviet troops. Now the US Central Intelligence Agency, which supplied hundreds of the shoulder-fired missiles to the Afghan resistance, wants them back. Fears of spreading conflict on Afghanistan's border, while central control in Kabul, the capital, remains tenuous, are likely to have added urgency to the CIA's quest to retrieve sophisticated weapons in what a senior Pakistani official calls 'a very tense situation.' The region's troubles, with settlement of Afghanistan's long civil war still fragile, have been worsened by hostilities bubbling on the border between Afghanistan and the central Asian republic of Tajikistan. As the border war has escalated, Moscow has responded to growing cross-border attacks by Afghanistan-based Tajik rebels - who fled Tajikistan after losing a civil war last year - by sending additional troops to defend the beleaguered government in Dushanbe, the Tajik capital. Russia, which has an agreement with the Tajik government to defend the Afghan border, justifies its presence on the grounds that it must stem a fundamentalist Moslem threat and defend the interests of the 200,000-strong Russian minority in Tajikistan. But conscious of the domestic political dangers of again becoming embroiled militarily in Afghanistan after Moscow's severe losses in the 1980s, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, has said: 'Russia will not compensate for a lack of political will towards reconciliation in Tajikistan with the blood of its own soldiers, as happened before in Afghanistan.' Mr Hidayat Amin Arsala, the Afghan foreign minister, has been in Dushanbe this week for talks with the Tajik government, leading to suggestions last night that Kabul try to mediate in the border war. Both sides are under pressure from Moscow and other governments in the region, notably Pakistan and Iran, to negotiate a settlement and prevent another war involving Afghanistan. Western diplomats voice fears over the role of Islamic militants in destabilising the newly independent central Asian republics, as well as in intensifying their activities against other governments in the area. According to a foreign diplomat in Dushanbe quoted by Reuters: 'What the fundamentalists in northern Afghanistan want is not just to bring the Tajik opposition back to power but to move into other countries of Central Asia, destabilise those areas, replace those governments with Islamic governments and move into Russia itself.' Of their allies in Afghanistan, another diplomat in Dushanbe said: 'These people all fought the communist (Afghan) government and that united them. In Tajikistan, they see a revival of communism on the ruins of the former Soviet Union. This is why it's easy for them to project the idea that communists are fighting Islam here.' Mr Sotorios Mousouris, the UN secretary general's personal envoy for Afghanistan, says: 'I hope we don't see any replay of the conflict between Afghanistan and Russia. I don't think this region needs another conflict. Afghanistan has enough problems on its own.' Western diplomats are concerned that the new conflict has come as Afghanistan remains without a clear political settlement and an effective government in Kabul, its capital. As a result, there is no central authority which could use force to restrain the Tajik fighters. Although in recent weeks there has been a lull in large-scale fighting around Kabul, with occasional clashes and small scale casualties, prospects for a lasting settlement remain bleak. 'There is respite at this moment. Kabul is relatively calm,' says Mr Mousouris, adding that 'the various forces which control Kabul are in the same position that they had before, both militarily and politically'. However, Afghanistan's two leading rivals, Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the prime minister, and Mr Ahmed Shah Masood, the former defence minister, remain in control of large numbers of war-hardened mujahideen followers who are well armed. In addition, the powerful Uzbek general, Rashid Dostum, remains in control of a large number of militiamen who can be instantly deployed in battle. Although the Afghan government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani apparently wants to negotiate an end to the border fighting, its ability to restrain dissident groups is limited. Efforts towards reconstruction to facilitate a return of Afghan refugees and normal working of the government have also had little success. Food supplies remain inadequate due to road blocks erected by different area commanders, who prevent convoys from reaching the capital. International donors have given only Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.8m) to rehabilitation efforts in response to a UN request for Dollars 138m. Diplomats are worried that in the absence of a clear political settlement in Kabul, the shortage of funds for relief and reconstruction has made it even more difficult to hope for peace. Meanwhile, demand resulting from the continuing troubles has pushed up black market prices for Stinger missiles to Dollars 100,000, and the CIA does not have enough money to buy them. According to the Los Angeles Times, it has had to ask the Clinton administration for an extra Dollars 55m for operation MIAS (Missing In Action Stingers). The Bush administration had given it Dollars 10m.</p>

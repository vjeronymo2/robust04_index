			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BOSTON'S BIRD STILL SCRAPING OFF THE RUST  </P> <P> As the parking lot emptied outside, Larry Bird sat in front of his locker  dressed in gray corduroys, a sweater, one gray sock and one tasseled loafer.  His other foot was wrapped in an ice pack. All you could see were his toes, as  long and naked as fingers.  </P> <P> It had not been a particularly good night. The Boston Celtics had lost to the  Washington Bullets, letting the game get away in the fourth quarter, and Bird  had scored only two points in the last 21 minutes, missing seven consecutive  shots as the Bullets pulled away at the end.  </P> <P> Still, he was more than happy to sit in the cramped locker room and answer  questions. Spending a year on the sidelines had altered his world view.  </P> <P> "I still hate losing these games, but, right now, I'm mostly just happy to be  playing again," he said.  </P> <P> For the first time in years, he is running the court without feeling pain in  his feet, a result of the surgery that caused him to miss all but the first few  games of last season. His rehabilitation was long and hard -- and successful,  apparently. "I feel great," he said. "There is no pain. I don't even think  about it."  </P> <P> His basketball rehabilitation is another matter. There were moments Wednesday  night when it seemed he had never missed a game. A perfect pass to Robert  Parish on the break. A fade-away 19-footer from the baseline. A fake that  busted the defense and left Kevin McHale open underneath the basket. But for  each of those moments, there was another that showed rust. A forced pass. A  jumper that barely touched the rim.  </P> <P> "My passing and shooting are erratic," said Bird, who missed 17 of 26 shots  against the Bullets. "I make three or four in a row, then miss three or four in  a row. I make some bad passing decisions. My rebounding, I think, is good.  Getting back to playing tough competition night after night, after a year off,  that is an adjustment. I've gotten better. Hopefully, I'm going to continue to  get better."  </P> <P> Whether he returns to his original form, at age 32, is one of the big stories  of the pro basketball season. There are indications that he will. He scored 32  points in the first game of the season. He hit the game-winning shot in the  last seconds against Chicago last weekend. Even Wednesday night, the parts of  his game that troubled him were the ones that should heal with time on the  court. "Passing, shooting -- timing things," he said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, he circles the league drawing ovations at almost every stop.  Wednesday night was no exception. Not so long ago, Bird was booed from the  moment he stepped on the floor at the Capital Centre. Wednesday night, he was  given a warm cheer. It is as if the fans have come to understand they only have  a few years left to appreciate Bird.  </P> <P> "I have gotten a lot more encouragement than I thought I would," he said. "Got  that nice ovation tonight. Got nice ovations throughout the exhibition season.  That's great. That's what you hope for -- to go into enemy territory and be  respected. It is nice to hear that people understand you have been through a  tough time."  </P> <P> Accompanying those ovations, however, has been a battery of questions that has  trailed him from stop to stop. How do you feel? Do you think you can get back  to your old self? Do you feel old? Can you pull the Celtics back up to where  they were before you were gone? Although he is accommodating and patient every  night, he clearly, for some reasons, feels affronted.  </P> <P> "It's a no-win situation, basically," he said. "If I miss a shot, people are  going to say, 'Well, he used to make those.' If a rebound glances off my  fingernails and goes out of bounds, they are going to say, 'Well, he used to  get those.' You can't win that fight. The way I look at it, if I don't get a  lot better, something's wrong. I don't believe in age. If you work hard, you  aren't going to deteriorate. I'm only 32."  </P> <P> Not making his task any easier is the transitional state of the Celtics. A year  ago, Bird left a team that had a rookie coach, Jim Rodgers, and for years had  relied almost solely on its starting lineup. One year later, there is a group  of new faces, and all are getting a chance to play. Gone are the days of  ignoring the bench; Rodgers used 11 players in the first 15 minutes Wednesday  night.  </P> <P> The message: Bird will not play as much as he once did. He does not complain,  because he respects Rodgers, but it is clear he is struggling to get  acclimated.  </P> <P> "I was shooting great in the first quarter, and then I came out, and when I got  back in I couldn't hit a thing," he said. The inference, of course, was that he  should have stayed in the game. Oh, well. He understands.  </P> <P> "This team has a lot of potential because of the depth," he said. "The question  is whether we can play together. Right now, we're trying to find out who plays  well with who, combinations. It's a learning process, and it takes time. Will  it happen? You like to think so. If we can play together, we can go all the  way."  </P> <P> That could be a tad optimistic. The Celtics are shallow in the backcourt and  old in the frontcourt. McHale does not seem to be the dominating player he used  to be. Parish is well past his peak, as is Dennis Johnson. The Celtics are a  team with obvious holes. A healthy Larry Bird brightens the picture  considerably, of course. He has been known to carry a team by himself. He may  still have it in him. Just give him time.  </P></p>

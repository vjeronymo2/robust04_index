			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Observer: Mexican hold-up No sooner had he arrived on a fact finding mission than Kenneth Clarke, Britain's education secretary, found himself on the Mexican school shelf. His main contact - Mexico's education minister - had just resigned. The British embassy stood in a corner holding its breath. Who was going to tutor Britain's pugnacious education supremo on Mexican lessons for Britain's school kids? The local press delved deep into their government textbooks and correctly predicted that Mr Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the budget minister would be made education minister. Other news reports did not receive such high marks. The mayor of Mexico city and the head of the ruling party were both tipped by high sources as the new budget minister. Both were wrong. Mr Zedillo will not be replaced as budget minister at all. His department will simply be subsumed into the finance ministry. Clarke, who has had seven ministerial jobs in 13 years, may have found the confusion faintly familiar.</p>

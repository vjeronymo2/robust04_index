			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Russian troops on full alert over Caucasus fighting Forces loyal to Mr Dzhokhar Dudayev, president of the break-away Chechen republic, yesterday seized a rebel strong-hold. Mr Dudayev's victory comes in the wake of stepped-up Russian efforts to unseat the separatist leader by backing pro-Russian opposition forces. The escalation in the fighting in Chechnya prompted General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, to put Russian military forces in neighbouring regions on 'full combat alert' in an effort to prevent the Chechen conflict from spreading to other parts of the volatile Caucasus. According to the Russian news agency Interfax, Mr Grachev also said that military check-points would be established on roads leading to Chechnya and Russia would tighten its control over Chechen air-space to prevent Chechen aircraft from harassing targets in Russia. But despite the tightening of the Russian military net around the borders of the break-away republic, Mr Dudayev's seizure of the town of Argun early yesterday morning represents an important internal victory. Twenty kilometres east of Groznyi, the Chechen capital, Argun was the strong-hold of Mr Ruslan Labazanov, a 26-year-old rebel warlord who controlled one of the two leading factions opposed to Mr Dudayev and who has vowed a blood-feud against the president. Mr Dudayev's victory, in a battle which Russian reports said claimed dozens of lives, underscores the dangers attendant upon Russia's controversial policy towards the break-away Caucasus republic. Chechnya's assertion of independence three years ago has set a precedent which Russia fears other regions might be tempted to follow. Mr Dudayev's defiance of Moscow has also been perceived as a humiliation to which President Boris Yeltsin, keen not be be outflanked by right-wing politicians, has felt obliged to respond.</p>

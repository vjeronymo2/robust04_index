			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BERNARDI TAKES CHARGE IN DEBATE WITH 6 FOES BEFORE AUDIENCE OF 25  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi came out slugging Wednesday night  in his first -- and possibly only -- appearance with his six challengers in  Tuesday's election for the seat representing the northeast San Fernando  Valley's 7th District.  </P> <P> Instead of waiting for his opponents to attack, Bernardi went on the offensive  before an audience of about 25, who barely outnumbered the candidates at a  political forum sponsored by the NAACP in Pacoima.  </P> <P> He criticized his opponents for portraying Pacoima as a crime-plagued, run-down  community.  </P> <P> "This is a fine community," he said. "Yes, it has problems, and we're  addressing them."  </P> <P> Bernardi used the forum to announce the opening Friday of his first field  office in Pacoima. He also vigorously defended his record on fighting crime and  controlling growth.  </P> <P> Bernardi lashed out at his leading challenger, Lyle Hall, for fighting pension  reform when Hall was president of the Los Angeles city firefighters union.  Bernardi contended that pension reform, which he sponsored, has saved the city  millions of dollars.  </P> <P> "If Mr. Bernardi says there's a lot of money in City Hall, why hasn't that  money come to the district?" challenger Irene Tovar asked.  </P> <P> Hall pledged if elected to establish a citizens committee in each community to  advise him on every proposed new building that requires council approval.  </P> <P> Bernardi said he is preparing to establish such a committee to advise him on  development plans for each community, but he prefers to consult with residents  of affected neighborhoods on specific projects.  </P> <P> Challenger James Braun promised if elected to halt all construction in the  district until a new development plan can be prepared.  </P> <P> Barry Gribs, another challenger, said he would fight crime by providing  "positive reinforcement" to gang members.  </P> <P> "Instead of more police, we need therapists," he said. "Instead of jails, we  need drug treatment facilities."  </P> <P> Jules S. Bagneris III questioned whether Bernardi has fought aggressively  enough to close Lopez Canyon Landfill, to restore a lake in the Hansen Dam  recreation area and to kill the proposed Nancy Reagan Center for drug  rehabilitation in Lake View Terrace.  </P> <P> "Let's for once stop our area from becoming the dumping ground for Los  Angeles," Bagneris said.  </P> <P> Hall, without mentioning Bernardi's name, said the district "needs someone who  can work with the other councilmen." He was referring to Bernardi's reputation  as a maverick on the council.  </P> <P> "If you feel the quality of life in our community is just as good as it is in  Sherman Oaks, then reelect the councilman," said challenger Al Dib.  </P> <P> On crime, Bernardi pointed out that he had secured funding to install a  wrought-iron fence around the crime-plagued San Fernando Gardens housing  project and said he will seek to require all new apartment buildings in the  district to install similar security measures.  </P></p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Queen jeered as Cypriots recall two bitter episodes POLICE in Nicosia yesterday sprayed tear-gas at schoolchildren demonstrating against a controversial visit to Cyprus by Queen Elizabeth. The Queen's visit, planned as part of the Commonwealth Conference which opens tomorrow has revived bitter memories of two critical periods in the island's history - the struggle for independence from Britain and the Turkish invasion of the island in 1974, which has left it divided. The Queen, in Nicosia to receive the key of the city, was greeted by jeering Greek Cypriots who yelled: 'We don't want you here.' Earlier, police had used tear gas to disperse dozens of schoolchildren to clear the road for the Queen. At the ceremony, the mayor of Nicosia, Mr Lellos Demetriades, told the Queen: 'The city has the unenviable title of the last divided capital in Europe.' Outside, angry demonstrators recalled the island's guerrilla war for independence from Britain in the 1950s when EOKA guerrillas fought for unity between Cyprus and Greece. In 1955, Britain hanged nine men accused of guerrilla activity. The Queen had turned down pleas for mercy. Many Cypriots also resent Britain's role during the events of 1974, when Greek Cypriots still hoping for union with Greece, staged a short-lived coup against the then-president Makarios. Turkey, which ruled Cyprus for more than 300 years, responded by invading the north of the island, saying it had to protect the Turkish Cypriot minority. As Greek-Cypriots jeered the Queen during her visit to Nicosia she was able to chat amicably with peacekeepers from her country's former Falklands conflict adversary Argentina, Reuter reports from Nicosia. The Argentinians later stood firmly to attention as a British military band played 'God save the Queen'.</p>

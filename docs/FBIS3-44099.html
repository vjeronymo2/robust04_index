SAP  Public Relations head Maj-Gen Leon Mellet said in a statement on  Tuesday it was of the utmost importance that as many competent  former SAP members as possible be reinstated. "Every available  member will be required for duty over the next few months," he  said. Gen Mellet urged interested former SAP members to  approach their nearest manpower acquisition office for further  information. He said the appeal was not aimed at members who  had retired at pensionable age, those who had taken early  retirement or had retired for medical reasons.</p>

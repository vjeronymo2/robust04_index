			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AID WOULD NEED TO STOP  </P> <P> The case of Jennifer Jean Casolo, a church worker from Connecticut who was  recently arrested in El Salvador and charged with aiding leftist guerrillas,  rightly commands the world's attention today. But her case is just one of a  growing number of troubling instances in which the right-wing government there  seems to be singling out religious workers for harassment, intimidation and  even death.  </P> <P> Casolo, who was working for a Texas-based ecumenical religious group, was taken  into custody after police said they found a cache of weapons buried in the back  yard of her home in San Salvador. She could have put the matter behind her by  accepting deportation to the United States, but has chosen to plead innocent  and stand trial. Casolo's fellow religious workers are convinced the government  is using her case to discredit them, and with them local clergy who criticize  the government's policies and its human-rights record. Some of Casolo's friends  think she was framed. Normally, such allegations would seem naive or even  paranoid. But the way religious workers in El Salvador have been treated  recently, the suggestion is reasonable, even if it's not a proven fact.  </P> <P> Last month's massacre of six Jesuit priests and two women bystanders renewed  the sense of shock felt around the world at the sheer scope of El Salvador's  bloodletting. The murders remain unsolved, and the government has not been able  to refute an eyewitness account that uniformed men carried out the killings --  a report that fed widespread suspicion that the murders were the work of a  right-wing death squad tied to the military or the ruling Arena party.  </P> <P> But there have been many other distressing, if less dramatic, incidents. Dozens  of Lutheran and Episcopal church workers have been detained by Salvadoran  authorities in recent days and expelled from the country. The practice has  become so persistent that nine U.S. religious bodies have charged the  government of President Alfredo Cristiani with a "deliberate and calculated  campaign to intimidate and harass" them.  </P> <P> If that's what is happening in El Salvador -- and the accumulation of incidents  and evidence suggests it may be -- it must stop. U.S. taxpayers have enough  problems already with supporting a government that may be implicated in the  murder of priests, even if such incidents can be explained away as isolated  atrocities committed in the chaos of war. But if the campaign against church  workers turns out in fact to be official Salvadoran government policy, this  would be so intolerable that U.S. aid would need to end at once.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>   [Text] Panamanian President Guillermo Endara and Costa  Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier spoke to  Telemetro about topics of national and international interest.    [Begin recording] [Calderon] Specifically, we had nothing to  discuss regarding bilateral issues. We discussed problems with  our banana policy toward Europe and the possibility of  banana-producing countries meeting in Panama in the next 10 or  15 days to establish a joint position toward Europe.    [Unidentified reporter] How would you assess the work done  by  your administration at the conclusion of your presidential term?    [Calderon] I am very satisfied with the work I did. The most  important thing is not how I view it but how the people view it.  In recent polls, 70 percent of the population said government  action was satisfactory, 9 percent thought it was bad, and the  rest of the population did not comment. This is really  extraordinary.    [Reporter] In what condition will the government be when you  transfer it to President-Elect Figueres?    [Calderon] We had the highest growth rate for Latin America  last year. Unemployment is at 4 percent and there was a  reduction of poverty levels. With this, I will pass the  government on to him in an exceptional condition to continue  moving toward development.    [Reporter] Mr. President, are you confident [Costa Rican]  Foreign Minister Niehaus will be elected to the post of OAS  secretary general?    [Calderon] I have never been confident of any election. I am  used to fighting to the end to win. We have received, in  writing, the formal support of 22 nations of the continent.  Only 18 votes are required to win, and we trust the 22 nations  that have supported us. We are certain none of them will let us  down. [end recording]    Meanwhile, President Endara assessed the talks held with his  Costa Rican colleague.    [Begin recording] [Endara] Costa Rica has asked Panama to  invite the other Latin American banana-producing countries to  meet here to see if we can reach an accord on this issue because  no agreement had been reached. I think Calderon's visit was  very positive from the standpoint of banana production. [end  recording]    After a three-day visit to Panama, Costa Rican President  Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier returned to his country today.  Panamanian President Guillermo Endara Galimany, accompanied by  Vice President Guillermo Ford, bid Calderon goodbye at the  Marcos Gelabert Airport in Paitilla. The Chamber of Commerce,  Industries, and Agriculture invited the Costa Rican president to  Panama to inaugurate the 12th version of the Expo-Comer  Commercial Exhibit.</p>

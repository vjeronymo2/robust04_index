			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Silvio J. Mendiandua] </F>   [Text] Havana, 31 Mar (PL) -- Relations between Cuba and  Mexico are diverse, exhibit mutual respect, and have a very  encouraging future in terms of joint ventures and  technical-scientific cooperation, Mexican Ambassador Carlos  Tello asserted here today.    The diplomat said he was optimistic about the future of  bilateral ties with Cuba after having assumed responsibility for  the Mexican mission in Havana in February.    Tello, who is an economist and a professor with a  comprehensive professional vitae, revealed he had already  attended several economic and technical-scientific cooperation  meetings in the few weeks he has been in Cuba.    Regarding reciprocal assistance, he said a mission from the  Mexican Science and Technology Council had recently visited Cuba  and signed an agreement with the State Economic and  Scientific-Technical Cooperation Committee to increase  scientific ties.    According to this agreement, oceanographers, engineers, and  other specialists have agreed to carry out joint studies and to  help each other in specific projects.    Furthermore, the ambassador added, active exchanges between  the universities of the two countries are continuing and a  history seminar for specialists was held just a few days ago.    To give one example of developing relations in the field of  education, Tello noted that a group from the clinic school,  which travels to different parts of the world, recently visited  Cuba to exchange student experiences.    Asked about Mexico's response to Cuba's policy on opening to  foreign investments, Tello said this area is very promising, and  he revealed there are agreements to set up joint ventures to  produce cement and glass.    We are currently negotiating two very important agreements,  the ambassador stressed. One is a comprehensive agreement on  telephone systems, satellite communications, telex, fax, and  other communications systems which could amount to more than $1  billion. [PRENSA LATINA in Spanish at 2023 GMT on 1 April  transmits a similar report prefaced with a parenthetical note  asking PRENSA LATINA offices to "substitute" the new article for  the one printed here. The new report is identical to the first,  with two changes. The first is a rewording of this paragraph so  that it reads: "We are currently negotiating an agreement on  telephone systems, satellite communications, telex, fax, and  other matters related to this field, the value of which could  exceed $1 billion, the ambassador said." In addition, the  following paragraph has been deleted and the item continues with  paragraph 11.]    The other is the signing of a letter of intent between the  Cuban Government and Mexpetrol to refine approximately 60,000  barrels of crude oil at the Cienfuegos refinery, located in the  country's central region, as well as to manufacture byproducts  that will be sold in the domestic and international markets.    In terms of tourism -- an industry in which the Mexicans are  giving advice to the Cubans -- Mexico and Cuba have signed  agreements to operate hotels such as the Tuxpan, Granma, and the  Old Man and the Sea.    Likewise, Carlos Tello explained that Cuba provides medical,  biotechnology, and social security assistance to Mexico.    Also, both nations continue to exchange experiences,  expertise, and specialists in agriculture, fisheries, and sugar  production, which has resulted in mutual benefits.    The diplomat expressed regret over the current level of  trade, which totalled approximately $124 million in 1992, and he  indicated that there are obstacles, like Cuba's debt with Mexico  and the shortage of freely convertible currency.    The fall of Eastern Europe's socialist bloc was a hard blow  to the Cuban economy because 85 percent of the island's trade  was conducted with this region, a region from which it also  imported 90 percent of its crude oil.    Tello stressed that when these difficulties are overcome,  trade between the two countries will increase several times over.</p>

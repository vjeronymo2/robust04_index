			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Barratt chief hits out at government Sir Lawrie Barratt, the chairman of Barratt Developments yesterday hit out at government policies, including an increase in interest rates, which he said had 'introduced an element of caution and uncertainty which is undermining the recovery of the housing market.' Sir Lawrie used the group's annual meeting to attack the government's recent budget record of substantially eroding mortgage tax relief. He went on to accuse it of adding to the cost of home ownership with the reintroduction of Stamp Duty and hit out at the 'petty measure' last November of applying Stamp Duty to those who require the assistance of builders' Part Exchange schemes. 'The government should accept that a strong and stable housing market is crucial to the recovery of the economy and call an immediate halt to any further increases in interest rates or further erosion of mortgage tax relief,' he added. Sir Lawrie, who came out of retirement three years ago after the group began to incur heavy losses, said 'the housing market is in need of some pro-active initiatives from the government and no further negative measures.' In September, Sir Lawrie reported a 72 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 35.2m for the year to June 30. Turnover was up 23 per cent at Pounds 498.9m. Yesterday, shareholders were told that sales volume in the first four months of the current year was holding up at 16 per cent, which was fully in line with the group's three-year growth plan. The shares fell 6p to 173p. Shares in Raine, another housebuilder, also dropped - by 4p to 47p - as Mr Peter Parkin, chairman, warned at the AGM that achieving profits growth this year would be more difficult than last. Short-term trading difficulties would particularly affect interim figures and result in a greater proportion than usual of profits being earned in the second half, he said.</p>

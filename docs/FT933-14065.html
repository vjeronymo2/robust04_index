			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Special bank may help Nafta win approval THE CHANCES of the US Congress approving the North American Free Trade Agreement have been enhanced by growing support for a proposal to create a North American Development Bank. A bill to establish the so-called Nadbank - to fund infrastructure and environmental projects, and to aid communities hurt by the Nafta - attracted 25 co-sponsors on Wednesday, the day of its introduction in the US House of Representatives. It was submitted by Congressman Esteban Torres, long a Nafta foe. Twenty of the 25 have been critics of the Nafta. 'Nadbank can change the dynamic of the Nafta debate. Nadbank is a vehicle to go beyond the divisive debate,' said Mr Torres. He has yet to commit himself to supporting the Nafta - the free trade pact by the US, Mexico and Canada - asserting that he will first study the supplemental agreements being negotiated on the environment and labour. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, expects the negotiations to end by July 31. Mr Torres said he doubted the side agreements alone would gain the support needed for approval of the Nafta in the House. However, 'a growing coalition of labour, environmental, Latin and community leaders' could be brought on board by 'an alternative comprehensive approach to sustainable trade and development' with Nadbank as its central component. The development bank proposal is also being considered by the Clinton administration, which on Wednesday discussed the appointment of a 'Nafta Tsar' to shepherd the pact through Congress. A new report by the US council of the Mexico-US Business Committee says the two countries will need Dollars 6.5bn (Pounds 4.33bn) over the next 10 years just to bring the water supply, wastewater treatment and solid and hazardous waste disposal at their border to internationally acceptable levels. Billions more will be needed for roads, retraining programmes and compensation for lost tariff revenues. The bill introduced by Congressman Torres would give a Nadbank Dollars 5bn in authorised capital over the next decade, with the aim to issue loans totalling up to Dollars 20bn. The US would provide two-thirds of the paid-in capital, with Mexico and Canada investing the rest. Mr Raul Hinojosa Ojeda, a Californian professor and the chief proponent of the Nadbank, said the institution might be attached to the Inter-American Development Bank, but with its own directors.</p>

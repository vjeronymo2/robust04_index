			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: West country set to keep singing the blues 'LABOUR's tax bombshell,' screams the 48-sheet billboard outside Barnstaple station in north Devon. 'You'd pay Pounds 1,250 more tax under Labour.' And underneath: 'Vote Conservative.' Nothing unusual about that, the posters are all over Britain. However, in the west country, they rankle not with Labour, but with supporters of the party whose London campaign headquarters put them up. What on earth, local Tories ask privately, is the point of erecting anti-Labour posters in the west country when the battle the Conservatives are fighting in the region is almost wholly against the Liberal Democrats? A pro-Labour campaign would do more good: at least that might divide the opposition. It is another niggling example of why the west country perpetually feels hard done by. The further west you go, the more powerful this feeling becomes until, finally, you reach Cornwall. Here, the feeling is all-pervasive. The Cornish are different - and if they are not, they think they are. It is never quite clear why, and it is no good trying to ask them. 'You have to be born and bred in Cornwall to understand our peculiarities,' they reply. Geography must have a lot to do with it. The county's position in the far west has left it isolated throughout history - a part of Britain's rural Celtic periphery, where associations with Liberalism are rooted in long traditions of independence and religious nonconformism. Cornwall's remoteness means that if outsiders see the county at all, it is usually as tourists, carrying away images of picture-postcard villages, craggy coastlines and pasties. To the Cornish, the reality is different. Cornwall, once one of the world's largest tin and copper producers, has seen its mining industry dwindle to nothing. Tourism is now the county's biggest earner but that, too, has been stricken by a combination of recession and the weather. The Cornish resent being included in regional assessments as part of a prosperous south-west. With some of Britain's lowest wage rates and unemployment at more than 13 per cent, they have more in common with Tyneside than Bristol or Cheltenham. The difference, they say, is that people know about Tyneside's problems and are doing something about them. Nobody cares about Cornwall. There is some of the same sense in neighbouring Devon. Unemployment at 10 per cent is not as bad as in Cornwall, and wages are a little higher. However, hoteliers have been hit by the recession, the county's small-business economy has been squeezed and farmers whose incomes have slumped say the government's agricultural policies ignore them in favour of the big cereal producers of East Anglia and the south-east. So is revolution in the air? New Statesman &amp; Society magazine has suggested as much. On the stump in the south-west last month, it said that 'even Torbay, with its retirement homes and golf courses, is being infected by a proto-nationalist resentment with central government'. That might be putting it a bit strongly. Even in Cornwall, the resentment has not led to any resurgence of the proto-nationalist movement. Yet there is something in the air. In the Devon countryside, where in previous elections the Conservatives could have reassured themselves with forests of signs indicating support, they now appear to be lagging seriously behind potatoes and free-range eggs. That might be an unreliable indicator of declining Tory fortunes but it is backed up by conversations with the voters. Go to a village such as Black Dog on the edge of Exmoor (a score of houses, a Methodist church, a village hall and a pub) and you will find a clutch of former Conservative voters on the brink of change. Mr Desmond Reed, a jack of all trades in the local agricultural community, said: 'I've always voted Conservative, but this time I really don't know. I do a lot of shearing for the farmers and they're all saying they'd be better off if the other lot got in - even the big men. We need that. If the farmers do well, everybody does well round here.' In Black Dog, in the marginal constituency of North Devon, the sitting MP is Conservative and the man threatening to take his seat is a Liberal Democrat. As in so much of the west country, Labour barely registers in the equation: it is strictly a two-horse race. This is why the Liberal Democrats are pinning so many hopes on the this region. If they do well anywhere, it has to be here. Party strategists were yesterday talking about winning seven or eight additional seats in the region, if the Labour vote can be squeezed. The trouble is that the size of the Conservative majority in most of the south-west is so vast that no imaginable swing to the Liberal Democrats could eliminate it. The Liberal Democrats' best chance is in the deep south-west, where the sense of alienation is the strongest. Even here, it would be rash to write off the Conservatives. In Devon and Cornwall, an MP's allegiance to his or her region matters at least as much to the voters as the MP's party affiliation, and Conservatives expecting to retain their seats have taken care to establish their credentials as professional mavericks when it comes to defending their constituencies' interests. Realistically the Liberal Democrats' victories are likely to be enumerated on the fingers of one hand. In Cornwall, where they already hold Truro, the only other seat they can be reasonably sure of winning is North Cornwall. Conservative majorities in St Ives and Cornwall South East are simply too big to put the seats within reach and a rare pocket of Labour support has turned Falmouth and Camborne into an unpredictable three-way fight. Next door in Devon, the Liberal Democrats ought to take remote North Devon, once the seat of Mr Jeremy Thorpe, the former Liberal leader. But all the rest of the rural constituencies are rock-solid Tory, with the possible exception of Torbay. Even here it is hard to see all those hoteliers and retired folk from London and the Midlands joining in a proto-nationalist rebellion. As for the rest of the south-west, the rural constituencies right up to Bristol are heavily dominated by the Conservatives and will almost certainly stay that way, with the notable exception of Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown's Yeovil constituency in Somerset. In the cities - Bristol, Plymouth and Exeter - Labour re-emerges as the party likely to gain most from the Conservatives' misfortunes. In all, then, the Liberal Democrats may hope for a surge of support in the south-west, but it is unlikely to translate into more than three or four extra seats. If the west country is on the brink of a revolution, it looks like being a small one: most of the region is set to remain unremittingly blue.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Solicitors lose legal aid battle THE LAW SOCIETY, the solicitors' professional body in England and Wales, yesterday lost the second of its two High Court challenges to government changes to the legal aid scheme. The court ruled that regulations introduced by Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor, reducing eligibility for legal aid were lawful. The cuts, which came into force on April 12, reduce the disposable income limit at which claimants qualify for free legal aid to income support levels and increase the contributions paid by others towards their cases. The society said on the government's figures 37 per cent of households - between 12m and 14m adults - would be affected by the cuts. The society alleged Lord Mackay had acted outside his powers under the Legal Aid Act 1989 as the cuts were contrary to the purpose of legal aid, and that he had failed to consult the society properly before introducing them. But Lord Justice Neill said while it was unfortunate that the cuts had had to be introduced, a substantial proportion of the population would remain eligible for legal aid. Hard and difficult choices had to be made by those responsible for apportioning finite resources between competing public services, he said. The judge also concluded the lord chancellor had been under no duty to consult the society before the cuts were announced, although Lord Mackay had been wrong to argue that the society did not have 'sufficient interest' to bring the challenge. He said: 'The Law Society and their members have unrivalled knowledge and experience of what access to justice means in practice. It is therefore to be hoped that a satisfactory dialogue can be resumed in the near future.'</p>

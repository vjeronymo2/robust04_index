			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Bomb measures 'could cost Pounds 50m' THE COST of protecting the NatWest Tower, Britain's second tallest building, from the worst effects of a terrorist bomb could be between Pounds 25m and Pounds 50m, a study by construction specialists says. Offices would still be seriously damaged if the explosion was large and close enough. Terrorists in Northern Ireland have exploded bombs up to 3,000kgs, three times the size of the explosion which ripped through the tower and damaged other buildings in the City of London two weeks ago. Gardiner &amp; Theobald, chartered surveyors, and Mott MacDonald, consulting engineers, say that to make large office buildings more bomb-resistant - including installing tough ened glass, strengthening window-frames, thickening lower exterior walls and strengthening the buildings' frames - could cost an extra Pounds 50 to Pounds 100 per sq ft. This would almost double reconstruction costs. The groups say they are not necessarily advocating that companies should pay this sort of money for extra protection. Mr Jim Kay, a Gardiner &amp; Theobald director, said: 'They must decide what level of protection they need and can afford.' The firms have produced a guide showing the cost of various options. These range from installing a simple plastic film to protect windows to reinforcing walls. Construction contracts, Page 10</p>

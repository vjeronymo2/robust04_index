			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- A meeting of peace  champions and a photo exhibition were held in Pyongyang on May 6  under the sponsorship of the Korean National Peace Committee on  the occasion of the 45th anniversary of the founding of the  World Peace Council.    Chong Chun-ki, chairman of the Committee for Cultural  Relations with Foreign Countries and chairman of the Korean  National Peace Committee, made a report, which was followed by  speeches.    The reporter and speakers estimated the role and  achievements  of the world peace council in the 45-year long endeavours to  strengthen and develop the struggle of peaceloving people all  over the world and elaborated on the major tasks to promote the  world peace movement and ways for their fulfilment.    They highly appreciated the world peace council for  expressing firm solidarity with the Korean people in their  struggle to achieve the reunification of the country.    They strongly urged that the United States stop its  unjustifiable rackets to put pressure on and stifle the DPRK and  accede to dialogue and negotiation for a fair solution to the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.    Considering it necessary to replace the Armistice Agreement  with a peace one and make a peace arrangement in place of the  present armistice body in order to remove the hostility between  the DPRK and the United States, achieve reconciliation between  them and ensure genuine peace and security on the Korean  peninsula because the Military Armistice Agreement [as received]  has been reduced to a mere sheet of paper and the Korean  Armistice Commission [as received] turned into a nominal  organisation by the unwarrantable acts of the United States,  they expressed full support to the recent proposal of the DPRK  Government concerning this.    An appeal to the peaceloving people of the world was adopted  at the meeting.    It called upon all the people who value world peace and  security to firmly unite as one irrespective of differences in  political views and religious belief and turn out in the  struggle to build an independent and peaceful, new world freed  from domination and subordination, aggression and war.    It said:    After its foundation, the World Peace Council has made a lot  of contributions to achieving national independence and social  progress against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism and  racism, averting war and ensuring a durable peace and security  of the world.    We remember the fact that it expressed full support and  solidarity for the struggle of the Korean people to defend the  freedom and independence of the country against the armed  invasion by the imperialist allied forces and achieve the  independent and peaceful reunification of the divided country.    To resolve the Korean question in a peaceful way is urgent  in  ensuring a durable peace and security in Asia and the Pacific.    We urge the United States to abandon its hostile policy to  stifle Korea, the old policy of the Cold War era, and observe  the principles already agreed on between the DPRK and the U.S.  sides and promptly accede to the proposed DPRK-USA dialogue and  negotiation intended to solve the nuclear issue of the Korean  peninsula in a peaceful and fair way, replace the Korean  armistice agreement with a peace one and make a new peace  arrangement in place of the present armistice body.    We express the conviction that the world peace forces would  continue to extend positive support and solidarity to the Korean  people in their struggle to achieve the reunification of the  country by means of confederacy based on one nation, one state,  two systems and two governments on the three principles of  independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity as  agreed upon by the North and the South of Korea.</p>

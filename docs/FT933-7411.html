			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-taking brings minor losses AFTER A brave start, the UK stock market yesterday followed the more subdued tone evident in other global dealing centres to close slightly easier on the day. Expiry day in London's FT-SE Index traded options and in New York's futures and options markets brought some technical activity but the session was generally one of consolidation. In early dealings, the FT-SE Index moved up by 12.2 on the back of new peaks on Wall Street overnight and continued optimism towards UK interest rate prospects. The edge was taken off equities, however, by initial weakness in government bonds and share prices began to give ground. Losses in gilts ranged to more than  1/4 of a point at the longer end at mid-session but the sector rallied as it digested reported comments on interest rate policies by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice president of the Bundesbank. By the close, long-dated UK bonds were only  1/4 down, although index-linked gilts remained depressed by around of a point. There was little immediate response, however, to disclosure that Britain's non-EC trade deficit had widened sharply to Pounds 778m in July. The Footsie dipped by 8 points in the lead-up to the expiry in the Index Traded Option and the German stock market eased. Buyers then returned, taking the Footsie to the day's best level of 3,077.7, still more than 11 points under the trading peak of the previous session. Interest then waned and, with Wall Street also abandoning its recent peak to shed 10 Dow points in UK hours, the London market fell steadily lower in moderate trade. At the close, the FT-SE Index was down 7.9 at 3,057.6. This week - the first leg of a three-week equity trading account extended to cover the UK summer bank holiday - has seen a gain of 47.5 points or around 1.6 per cent on the Footsie. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, down 3.6 at 3,482.4 yesterday, has gained about 0.8 per cent over the week. Seaq volume dipped to 633.4m shares as profit-taking was largely confined to private investors and securities traders; around 54 per cent of the trade came in non-Footsie stocks. Thursday's 837.2m shares through the Seaq network generated Pounds 1.75bn in retail or customer business, sustaining the increase in volume which has, in turn, encouraged a strong performance from the merchant banking stocks.</p>

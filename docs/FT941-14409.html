			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: BankAmerica held back in California BankAmerica, the California-based banking group, missed out on the earnings advances at other big US banks in the final months of last year as it continued to await economic recovery in its home state. The bank, the second largest in the US ranked by assets, met stock market expectations with fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 496m, or Dollars 1.21 a share, compared with Dollars 486m, or Dollars 1.18, in the preceding three months and Dollars 473m, or Dollars 1.18, in the last quarter of 1992. For the year as a whole, after-tax earnings per share edged down to Dollars 4.76, from Dollars 4.81 last year, on net income up at Dollars 1.95bn from Dollars 1.68bn, in both cases after adjusting for the effects of the acquisition of Security Pacific in 1992. Mr Richard Rosenberg, chairman and chief executive, pointed to continuing economic difficulties in California, where the bank earns an estimated two-thirds of its revenues. He added that there had been encouraging events last year, including a record performance by its wholesale banking side and a record rise by the number of accounts opened on the consumer banking side. BankAmerica reversed the decline in its loan book in the latest period, the first time loans have grown since early in 1992. Loans at the end of last year totalled Dollars 126.4bn, up from Dollars 125.6bn three months earlier. However, the bank's net interest margin declined to 4.66 per cent, from 4.74 per cent in the previous period and 4.98 per cent the year before. As a result, net interest income was lower than a year before. Non-interest rose Dollars 112m to Dollars 1.1bn, due mainly to an Dollars 80m gain from the sale of real estate assets. Like other US banks, BankAmerica saw a continuing improvement in the quality of its assets during the final period, with its provisions to cover loan losses falling to Dollars 150m in the quarter, compared with Dollars 270m a year before. Also, non-accruing assets fell by the end of the year to Dollars 2.9bn, from Dollars 5bn at the end of 1992. These advances were less marked than improvements in credit quality at Wells Fargo, BankAmerica's west coast neighbour, which reported results late on Tuesday. Wells Fargo's loan loss provision fell to Dollars 80m in the final quarter, down from Dollars 300m in the same period in 1992, while the full-year provision dropped to Dollars 550m from Dollars 1.2bn. Wells Fargo's fourth-quarter net income rose to Dollars 190m, or Dollars 3.18 a share, compared with Dollars 58m, or Dollars 83 cents a share, a year before.</p>

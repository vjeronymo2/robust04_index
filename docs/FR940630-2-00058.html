This will allow Sprint to help meet the large demand for direct telecommunications services between the United States and Cuba. Under the guidelines established by the Department of State, Sprint is to submit reports indicating the numbers of circuits activated by facility, on or before June 30, and December 31 of each year, and on the one-year anniversary of this notification in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> June 30, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Troy F.

The Commission has under consideration the above-captioned application filed by Sprint Communications Company L.P. (``Sprint'') requesting authority pursuant to Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, to establish channels of communication between the United States and Cuba for the provision of direct packet data service. The application was placed on the Commission's public notice and no comments were received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Sprint proposes to provide international packet data service between the U.S. and Cuba via the INTELSAT satellite located at 335 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; E.L. using appropriately licensed existing earth station facilities. Specifically, Sprint requests authority to lease from Comsat and operate one 2-Mbps digital satellite circuit between the Orion international Standard A earth station located at Shenandoah, Virginia and the theoretical midpoint of the INTELSAT AOR satellite connecting with matching facilities provided by INTERTEL S.A. (``INTERTEL'') of Cuba. Sprint proposes to connect its operating center in New York, New York, to the Orion earth station using Sprint's own facilities. Sprint states that it has already entered into an operating agreement with INTERTEL for the establishment of direct packet data service between the United States and Cuba. Under the terms of its agreement, INTERTEL and Sprint have agreed to a 50/50 split of a $5.50 per kilosegment and $5.50 per hour accounting rate for packet data traffic. Sprint states this rate is consistent with U.S. policy guidelines. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Sprint states that it will initiate service within one year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Sprint explains that packet data traffic is measured based on a unit known as a ``kilosegment.'' Sprint states that on a typical dial packet data transmission, two kilosegments are transferred per hour. On a typical dedicated packet data transmission, four kilosegments are transferred per hour. Therefore, for a typical dial packet data transmission, the total accounting rate would be approximately $16.50 per hour (27.5&cent; per minute), including $5.50 for the hour of time and $11.00 for the two kilosegments of transmitted packet data. For a typical dedicated packet data transmission, the total accounting rate would be approximately $27.50 per hour (46&cent; per minute), including $5.50 for the hour of time and $22.00 for the four kilosegments of transmitted packet data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Sprint states that the public interest would be served by a grant of its application because it will result in the rapid introduction of new lines of telecommunications between the United States and Cuba. Sprint states that an immediate and large demand exists for direct telecommunications services between the United States and Cuba, and Sprint's proposed service will help meet that demand within the regulatory framework established by the Cuban Democracy Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. In a letter dated July 22, 1993, the U.S. Department of State informed the Commission of the Executive Branch's general policy guidelines for implementation of the telecommunications provisions of the Cuban Democracy Act, which provides that ``telecommunication services between the United States and Cuba shall be permitted.'' <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  Among the policy guidelines are the following requirements: (1) the proposals must have the potential to be operational within a year; (2) settlements must not be more favorable to Cuba than the current 50/50 split of the $1.20 per minute accounting rate; (3) proposals must be limited to equipment and services necessary to deliver a signal to Cuba; (4) proposals must utilize modes of communications already in place between the U.S. and Cuba; and (5) carriers shall report the number of circuits activated by facility on June 30 and December 31 of each year and on the one-year anniversary of the notification by the FCC in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter dated July 22, 1993, from Richard C.

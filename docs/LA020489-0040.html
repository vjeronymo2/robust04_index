			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DE KLERK WILL SUCCEED AILING BOTHA 'IF HE WANTS JOB,' PRETORIA SAYS  </P> <P> Frederik W. de Klerk, the conservative Cabinet minister and new leader of the  ruling National Party, is certain to become South Africa's next president "if  he wants the job," the government's chief spokesman said Friday.  </P> <P> "There is no question about where the power for choosing the next president  will reside. F.W. de Klerk is now the leader of the party," Information  Minister Stoffel van der Merwe said in the government's first specific comment  on the issue of presidential succession.  </P> <P> Van der Merwe, briefing foreign journalists in Cape Town before the opening  session of Parliament, also said President Pieter W. Botha, who suffered a mild  stroke two weeks ago, is "not currently being consulted on running the  day-to-day business of government."  </P> <P> Botha, 73, resigned his leadership of the party Thursday, giving up a  significant portion of the power that he has held in South Africa for the past  decade.  </P> <P> Some analysts believe that Botha, by separating the jobs of party and  government leadership, was signaling his intention to remain as president at  least until his 5-year term expires in September or until the next general  election.  </P> <P> Van der Merwe declined to speculate on Botha's plans but said, "The clear  indication is that President Botha is not going to relinquish his office now."  </P> <P> De Klerk, a leader of the conservative wing of the party, was elected party  leader by a 69-61 vote in a party caucus Thursday, defeating Finance Minister  Barend du Plessis, considered one of the party's more liberal members.  </P> <P> Under the South African constitution, presidents are selected by a system  effectively controlled by the caucus of the ruling party.  </P> <P> De Klerk, like most of Botha's Cabinet ministers, has until now remained in the  shadow of Botha's powerful personality. The 52-year-old education minister has  not revealed his goals for the country, other than to express his support for  Botha's programs.  </P> <P> But given De Klerk's relative conservatism, many political analysts believe  that the gradual and limited reform program begun under Botha would slow  considerably under a De Klerk administration.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Campus Crackdown  </P> <P> De Klerk has cracked down on anti-apartheid protesters at universities by  vowing to withdraw government funds from schools that allow demonstrations. He  also has been among the more vocal critics of white South Africans who hold  talks with the African National Congress, the primary guerrilla group fighting  Pretoria's white minority-led government.  </P> <P> Botha's absence from the opening of Parliament cast a pall over the usual  pageantry of the proceedings, presided over by Acting President Chris Heunis.  Although the president's opening speech has traditionally laid down some of the  government's plans for the year, Heunis delivered a more general address that  highlighted the government's achievements but offered little of its vision for  the future of reform.  </P> <P> "One cannot introduce earth-shattering new reform initiatives" with Botha still  recovering from his illness, Van der Merwe explained. "But reform is going  forward. You can rest assured."  </P> <P> On his doctors' orders, Botha was not allowed to help write or review Heunis'  speech.  </P> <P> Heunis did announce that the government has formally withdrawn its own  controversial amendment to the Group Areas Act that would have toughened  enforcement of the 35-year-old law dividing South Africa into separate living  areas by race.  </P> <P> But he reiterated the government's commitment to racial segregation, saying it  will study "other ways and means of guaranteeing (racially separate) community  life" for those who want it.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a government measure to create, for the first time, some residential  areas where whites and blacks could live as neighbors has become law. Under the  legislation, a "free settlement" board will soon begin studying possible open  areas. The government will retain final power to declare an area open, however.  </P> <P> Because of a severe housing shortage for black South Africans, thousands have  already moved into areas set aside for whites only.  </P> <P> The government has been under increasing pressure from the far-right  Conservative Party to more strictly enforce its residential segregation law as  well as its Separate Amenities Act, which Conservative Party members have used  in several cities to ban blacks from using public facilities such as parks and  meeting halls.  </P></p>

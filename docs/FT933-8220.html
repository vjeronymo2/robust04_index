			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Two distribution disposals at BM THE PROGRAMME of dispos-als and debt reduction continued at BM Group yesterday, as the engineering concern announced the sale of BM Plant and Talbot Diesels, its UK distribution businesses, to a management team. The move is part of BM's plan to shed all or part of its interests in construction equipment distribution worldwide. The group has borrowings in excess of Pounds 100m and has had its banking facilities extended until September 6. While BM will receive only Pounds 850,000 cash from the disposals - and Pounds 200,000 of that is deferred for one year - the borrowings of the two companies, which amounted to Pounds 4.27m at June 30, are being retained by them. So the disposals will knock some Pounds 5m from group debt. The buyer is Halliard, shareholders of which include some of the present directors and managers of BM Plant and Talbot. These include Mr GJ Hall, a director of BM. He will resign that post and will receive no compensation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The joint commission on compliance and inspection is  continuing its work in Geneva. This temporary body was set up  to implement the treaty on reduction of strategic offensive  weapons, START-1 and START-2. Representatives of five powers --  Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and the United States --  belong to the commission. Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan are  to join the treaty as non-nuclear states. [begin recording]    Russian Representative M. Streltsov -- identified by  caption: We have already made a certain amount of  progress. A whole series of agreements and joint statements by  our commission have been signed.    These regulate issues involved in the multilateral  fulfillment of the treaty. We believe that the Ukraine will  accede to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in the very near  future. This will create all conditions necessary to ensure  that the treaty comes into force. [end recording]</p>

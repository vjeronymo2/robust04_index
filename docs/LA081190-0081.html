			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL ADOPTING SOFTER POLICY TOWARD UPRISING;  </P> <P> OCCUPATION: DEATHS OF PALESTINIANS DECLINE SHARPLY AS NEW DEFENSE MINISTER  ARENS SHOWS HE PREFERS THAT THE ARMY USE LESS PROVOCATIVE TACTICS.  </P> <P> Israel's military posture has been strengthened by a new, softer policy toward  the Palestinian uprising, military sources said Friday.  </P> <P> The policy, never publicly announced, was adopted by Moshe Arens after he took  over as minister of defense in mid-June.  </P> <P> It is described as "more carrot than stick," and it has resulted in a sharp  decline in the number of Palestinian deaths attributed to troops patrolling the  occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> "This means we can turn our attention to the real enemy, those Arab nations  full of hate with strong armies arrayed against us," Brig. Gen. Nachman Shai,  the chief military spokesman, told a reporter.  </P> <P> Palestinian casualties are at present about a third of what they were in 1988  and 1989, Israeli officials said.  </P> <P> No senior military officer believes that the intifada, as the uprising is  called in Arabic, is ending, or that Palestinians are any more inclined to  accept the Israeli occupation. But military officials said Friday that the  declining trend in casualties suggests the army can devote more time and energy  to preparing for conventional warfare.  </P> <P> And that, rather than concentrating on anti-uprising tactics, is what is  needed, they said.  </P> <P> "The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) should not train its soldiers to fight against  stone-throwing boys and girls," Gen. Shai said. "They should be trained to  fight a future war."  </P> <P> Israeli army figures show that in July only three Palestinians were killed in  the occupied territories. In June, no deaths were reported as the result of  army action in the volatile Gaza Strip, although in the West Bank eight  Palestinians were shot to death by soldiers. Figures supplied by Palestinian  sources are somewhat higher.  </P> <P> The July casualty figures are the lowest since the intifada began in December,  1987, according to the IDF.  </P> <P> The decline in Palestinian casualties can be attributed in part to the general  slowing down of the uprising. And Palestinian leaders agree that the pace has  slowed.  </P> <P> But IDF sources think the decline in violence is also a direct result of  Defense Minister Arens' policies, which differ sharply from those of his  predecessor, former Gen. Yitzhak Rabin, who ordered Palestinians beaten if they  raised a hand against soldiers.  </P> <P> Many observers had thought that the new, right-wing defense minister would be  even tougher than Rabin in cracking down on the uprising. But as an Arens aide  said, "Our policy in the territories is to hit less and talk more."  </P> <P> Gen. Shai, a veteran war correspondent before taking over as chief IDF  spokesman, said troops are given clear instructions before going on duty in the  occupied territories. No longer, he said, do small units go deep into the Arab  quarters.  </P> <P> "We don't send small, unprotected jeep patrols into heavily populated areas,"  he said. "Small patrols, when surrounded, were faced with three options, to run  away, to hit back, or to shoot."  </P> <P> Those options had led to unnecessary casualties, he said, and added:  </P> <P> "We have instructed our troops to be much more careful in their approach to  Palestinian residents. If we see a hundred people getting together now for a  funeral, a wedding, a parade, we let them alone. We don't interfere. We take it  easy during mourning periods.  </P> <P> "If they raise a Palestinian flag, we don't worry too much. We are trying to  avoid incitement, to avoid provocation, because that just plays into the hands  of those who want violence. Our instructions are to avoid clashes when not  necessary. We don't arrest women."  </P> <P> Shai, 44, was offered the unenviable job of army spokesman, military sources  said, because the government finally realized how tarnished the IDF image had  become, at home and abroad, as the result of pictures and articles dealing with  the beating and shooting of unarmed Palestinian men, women and children.  </P></p>

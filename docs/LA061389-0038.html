			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Former Rep. John W. Jenrette Jr. (D-S.C.), on probation from bribery and  conspiracy convictions in the ABSCAM scandal of the 1970s, was found guilty for  the second time of shoplifting shoes and clothes from a suburban Washington  department store. A Circuit Court jury in Fairfax, Va., found Jenrette guilty  of petty larceny through switching price tags at Marshall's discount department  store in Tyson's Corner on Dec. 7. The jury recommended a $1,000 fine and six  months in jail for each of the two misdemeanor charges. But the fact that  Jenrette was on probation could greatly lengthen that term. Sentencing was set  for Aug. 18. Jenrette had been found guilty on both charges by Fairfax County  Circuit Judge Donald B. McDonough on Feb. 23. He appealed that verdict in an  attempt to bring his case before a jury.  </P></p>

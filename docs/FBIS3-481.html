			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] It has been a day of political confusion in Liberia  today, where the Transitional Council was due to be sworn in  this morning. Last week, the leadership of ULIMO [United  Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] which signed the  Cotonou Peace Accord with the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of  Liberia] and the interim government, was split by a challenge to  Alhaji Koromah. Today's swearing-in ceremony was delayed after  it was reported that the NPFL had made a last-minute change to  its nominee on the council replacing Isaac Musa with Robert  Brice. From Monrovia, Nianate Allison telexed this report.    Liberians today joyously sang national songs and shouted:  The Lone Star forever, Lone Star forever, as the country moved  closer to reunification with the induction into office of the  five-man Transitional Council. The faces of many in the  half-century-old Centennial Hall were brightened when Chief  Justice James Bull administered the oath of office of the  five-member council. The ceremony finally began after nearly  five hours of delay. An official of the outgoing interim  government said later the delay was to clear remaining hurdles.  Council Chairman David Kpomakpor and Phillip Banks are nominees  of the dissolved interim government of Amos Sawyer; while  co-chairman, Isaac Musa, represents the NPFL. ULIMO is  represented by Mohamed Sheriff and (Dexter Tayul).    ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] chairman,  Benin's president Nicephore Soglo, who attended the ceremony,  urged Liberians to unite and work rapidly to achieve the  democratic institutions you have so long desired. He said:  Everyone of you have much to forgive and to forget because that  is the only way peace can come to Liberia.</p>

Along with the signing of a treaty of friendship and  cooperation between the two states, a package of agreements on  cooperation between the military structures of Russia and  Georgia is also expected to be discussed and signed.    Much attention at the talks is to be given to matters  concerning the status of and conditions for the functioning of  Russian border troops.    Expert opinion is that the prospective conclusion of Russo-  Georgian military agreements does not mean the establishment of  any military-political alliance between Russia and Georgia  against Abkhazia.    The interests of both Abkhazia and South Ossetia are to be  taken into account during the discussion of cooperation-related  matters between the two states.    The problem of reaching mutual understanding over the  question of carrying out peacekeeeping operations in Abkhazia  with the use of a peacekeeping force under U.N. auspices will be  one of important aspects of the forthcoming talks.</p>

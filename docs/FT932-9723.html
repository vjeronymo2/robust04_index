			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia seen importing less white sugar RUSSIAN WHITE sugar imports will fall to 950,000 tonnes this year from 1.25m tonnes in 1992, a government advisory group said, Reuter reports from Moscow. The Centre for Economic Research and Forecasting, in a study on the economy, put refined sugar production at 2.5m tonnes in 1993, unchanged from the previous year. The study said the figure included output using raw sugar imports, which it said totalled 2.6m tonnes in 1992. The centre, which draws on various official sources for its data, gave no figure for 1993 raw sugar imports. Russia's state sugar purchasing company has said it expects to import up to 2m tonnes of raw sugar in 1993.</p>

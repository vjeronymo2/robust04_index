			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Markets: So you thought 1992 was bad . . . - Serious Money THE BRITISH government's finances are in a mess. This year, it is expected to run up a deficit of Pounds 37bn; in 1993-94, the prediction is Pounds 44bn. And those are only the Treasury's forecasts. Some economists are predicting that the deficit for 1993-94 could be well over Pounds 50bn. There are two things which governments can do to reduce deficits; cut spending and increase taxes. Both are difficult and unpopular. Some spending programmes (such as social security) increase automatically in a recession; others, such as health, rise slowly but surely because of improved technology and an ageing population. Government ministers are terrier-like in defending their departmental budgets, and the long drawn-out public spending rounds each autumn often result in minimal savings. In any case, spending plans are already set for 1993-94, so the government's only option for reducing the budget deficit in the near term - short of crisis measures - is to raise taxes. The government has made a long-term commitment to reducing the basic rate of income tax, so it would be highly embarrassing if it were to make yet another policy U-turn in this area. The changes expected most widely in next year's Budget are an above-inflation rise in excise duties and an increase in the scope of value-added tax. Such moves would mean that savers' pounds go less far at the supermarket; but, in terms of financial planning, there is little they can do. Where savers can take action is by dealing with the prospect of an increase in direct taxation. It might not come in the next Budget, although there could be an increase in the National Insurance ceiling which would affect those in work. But if government finances deteriorate as much as some economists expect, the chances are that one, or more, of the following will occur: An increase in the top-rate band of 40 per cent. Introduction of a new top rate (above the 40 per cent level) of, say, 50 per cent for high earners. A reduction in the scope of tax shelters, such as higher-rate relief on pensions or even mortgage interest relief. Nobody in government will admit to such a possibility at the moment. But, as we all know, this administration has been forced to backtrack on its promises in the past; financial crises may force it to do so in the future. And Martin Wooller, fixed income director of Fidelity Investments in London, says: 'There is a significant risk of a 1976 IMF-style crisis during 1994.' So, what can savers do? The obvious strategy is to take advantage of the existing tax shelters, which will prove even more valuable if tax rates increase. All of these are well known but worth reconsidering as you digest your mince pies over the holidays: Tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas). The second anniversary is now due and a further Pounds 1,800 can thus be invested. If you have not opened a Tessa at all, shame on you; you are missing the chance to earn tax-free interest. You can invest Pounds 3,000 in the first year and a maximum of Pounds 9,000 over five years. National Savings. Inflation might have dropped to 3 per cent but it could yet return in force in the mid-1990s. The tax-free 3.25 per cent real return (if held for five years) on the 6th issue of index-linked National Savings looks attractive. A maximum Pounds 5,000 can be invested. Index-linked gilts. Interesting for the same reason as given above, but inflation protection is available for longer and there is no upper limit on investment. Much of the return is in the form of tax-free capital gain; but tax is payable on the small (2 or 2.5 per cent) income. Real yields are between 3.5 and 4 per cent on longer issues. Personal equity plans. Not for the totally risk-averse, but equities have outperformed the building societies over the long run, and most experts think they will do so over the short term. A low-cost plan is Gartmore's Index fund, which tracks the All-Share index, has an annual management charge of 0.5 per cent, and is available in Pep form, from WI Carr, for an initial charge of Pounds 30 plus VAT. It might not be top of the performance tables over the next five years, but it certainly will not be bottom. Zero coupon shares of split capital investment trusts. Most investors do not use their annual capital gains tax allowance (Pounds 5,800 in 1992-93). Zero shares pay no income, but are designed to grow steadily in capital value; if you do not use up your CGT allowance, returns are tax-free. Some zeroes are safer than others (all involve some risk) and you need the advice of a good stockbroker in this market. Business expansion schemes. There have been a lot of poor BES vehicles in the past, but some issues are now available with a clearing bank guarantee. These are worth investigating, especially as this loophole will be closed at the end of 1993. A final caveat. No investment should ever be made purely for tax reasons; better to pay tax on your profits than to make no profits at all.</p>

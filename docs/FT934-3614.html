			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Arts: Different ways of going over the top - Television One really enjoyable series can be all it takes to banish boredom with television. To Play The King is currently serving this function and brightening up everything remarkably. Some have complained that it is more far-fetched than the original series, House Of Cards, and accused it of 'going over the top' which is a bit like complaining that The Bill is preoccupied with police procedure. Of course it goes over the top, that is its purpose and its charm. But since it was in House Of Cards that Ian Richardson's diamond-hard schemer of a politician established his habit of delivering Shakespearian asides, and in that same series that he shoved his young mistress off the roof of the House of Commons, it is difficult to sustain the argument that a story which began staid and sober has now become ludicrous. Its strength comes from the fact that, although its comedy is achieved by exaggeration in the manner of a caricature, it is not all that far removed from reality. When you remember such recent stories as the cabinet minister parading before his mistress in Chelsea strip, the princess cavorting topless with her financial advisor, and the prince on the telephone musing on the desirability of being his lady friend's tampon . . . well, parody becomes problematical. As for the po-faced protests that this television drama damages the royal family, the reverse seems true. The king, whose identity cannot be in doubt once you see how Michael Kitchen has captured Charles' nose-stroking mannerism, is just as clearly the hero as Francis Urquhart is the villain. Surely only those with a defective sense of humour or an exaggerated idea of the fragility of the British constitution could take such complaints seriously. It is a splendid romp combining in the modern idiom the healthy ridicule of Rowlandson with the political shenanigans of Trollope. It is difficult to imagine such a series being made by the new ITV. The days of larger than life characters such as Lew Grade and Sidney Bernstein at the helm of the ITV companies have gone. Those men were fascinated by the business of creating programmes, but their successors seem to be obsessed with a programme for creating business. Given that many of these new chaps, unlike the ITV knights of old, actually rose from the ranks of programme makers, this is a little ironic. In British television today there seems to be a fixation on the idea of creating broadcasting companies big enough to compete in the international market place. Everybody is asking 'If LWT bids for Yorkshire, what happens to Tyne Tees?' or 'When Carlton takes over Central what will happen to the share price?' We are even being urged to think about scrapping the licence fee (one of the best bargains in Britain) and turning the BBC over to commercial operation because that would create a world-class player on the broadcasting stage. What nobody bothers to ask is 'What would this concentration on size and commerce mean in programme terms for the British audience?' Presumably the reason they do not ask is because the answer is obvious: programmes would get worse. ITV programmes have already got worse as a result of the Thatcherite licensing revolution, and there is not much doubt that even more Thatcherism would mean even worse programmes. In this context 'worse' is used in the same sense as in the sentence 'Hamburgers and tabloid newspapers though popular are worse than what they replaced'. What we shall probably come to expect from ITV are series such as A Woman's Guide To Adultery with a come-on title and a cast that will attract foreign buyers: Amanda Donohoe, Theresa Russell, even Sean Bean. If you point out that the acting from people who have previously proved themselves more than competent is consistently poor here, and that this suggests weakness in the direction, and you add that the whole thing looks like a 60-minute commercial for Gold Blend, you must expect sneers from the new ITV mandarins. Why all this elitist whining, they will ask, what is wrong with the sort of drama that ordinary people like? And they will quote the ratings at you as proof that everything is all right. Point out that ITV used to make drama such as Jewel In The Crown and The Naked Civil Servant, Brideshead Revisited and Muck And Brass which between them managed to win high ratings and a high degree of respect, and they will smile contemptuously and refer to cloud cuckoo land. The use of the word 'woman's' in a title which refers to sex is no mere flash in the pan. Another of ITV's new series is Hollywood Women which last week showed us 'Glitz And Glamour', and tomorrow promises 'Sex And Success'. Episode 1 proved in one respect to be better than the advance publicity might have suggested: in its second half it offered a re-run of the familiar old plaint about Tinseltown's love of eternal youth. We had another look at the results of plastic surgery so memorably covered previously in programmes such as Whicker's World. In other respects, however, the programme was even worse than expected, notably the hysterical rapidity with which cuts occurred: it appeared to be determined to establish not a 3-minute but a 30-second culture. Sex was also the subject of last week's 40 Minutes on BBC2, an astonishing programme which you might have thought would cause a national furore. After boasting about how many women they had laid (though they used the 'f' word) and in precisely what manner, one male chauvinist pig said to the other 'My woman's going to be faithful when I get married, otherwise I'll get a cleaver and cut off her tits while she's asleep and make her eat them'. Is that vile and disgusting or what? There is one deliberate error in this report, however: it was actually two women boasting about their conquests, and one said to the other 'My man's going to be faithful when I get married, otherwise I'll get a cleaver and cut off his dick while he's asleep and make him eat it'. So that is OK, isn't it? No need for a furore. The same goes for comedian Jo Brand. Hers is the sort of comedy, we are told, which is simply the feminist equivalent of the anti-female material dished out for years by people such as Bernard Manning and Benny Hill. But that is rubbish. Manning and Hill told jokes about mothers-in-law and landladies, but they were about relationships or callings whereas Brand's material is just malice directed at men. It would be considered wholly unacceptable on television if this was Joe Brand and he was directing similar hate-filled stuff ('Men should be allowed to carry shotguns and shoot women when they like') at women. But perhaps the reasons are becoming clear. Three weeks ago on Have I Got News For You Jo Brand told us that she used to work as a nurse in a mental hospital. Two weeks ago in Notes And Queries she made the claim again. Then she repeated it on last week's South Bank Show and reiterated it on this week's. Apparently this is something she sees as deeply significant. Maybe her previous work has given her a very odd view of life and the human race, but the main point remains: if this was a man spitting out such loathing for the opposite sex he would promptly be excluded from television.</p>

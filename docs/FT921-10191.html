			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Appointments: Wellington Names Haynes Gamekeeper turned poacher might be one view of yesterday's decision by Wellington Underwriting Holdings, the Lloyd's agency, to appoint Antony Haynes - a former leader of Lloyd's Names - to be its new chairman. But it's an impression that both parties are anxious to dispel. Haynes has come to prominence at Lloyd's for his forceful leadership of the Association of Lloyd's Members, the organisation which acts as a kind of trades union for nearly markets underwriting. A Name himself since 1964, Haynes has been a bitter critic of the market's establishment. But he believes attitudes have changed at Lloyd's, where a proposed far-reaching reform of the market's business structure was accepted by the Council last month. Haynes played a prominent part in the task force which conducted the review. He recommended the appointment of McKinsey as management consultants, and, as a member of the 14-man team, pressed personally for many of the new rights for Names - such as their freedom to call annual general meetings of syndicates. Certainly, Wellington, which manages nine syndicates with potential premium income of around Pounds 500m, will benefit from Haynes' business experience. Now 61, Haynes has spent most of his working life at Booker, where he is currently chairman of the group's agricultural division. ***** Davies &amp; Newman Holdings, the recently rescued parent company of the Dan Air airline, has appointed John Olsen as its new chief executive. Olsen, 49, is the London-based general manager for Europe and parts of the middle east for Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong airline. He has worked for Cathay for 25 years, about 20 of them in the Far East. His experience lies largely in scheduled services. Dan Air, Europe's 12th largest airline with a strong position at Gatwick, has switched its emphasis from charter to scheduled flights. Olsen replaces Charles Whyte, who was brought in as managing director by David James, a company doctor, himself brought in as chairman and chief executive in the autumn of 1990. James will stay on as non-executive chairman, with his salary falling to a fraction of the Pounds 500,000 fee he has received for 18 months' work. He says there is now a strong possibility that he will become involved in another rescue project.</p>

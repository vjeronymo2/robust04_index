			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Today, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari announced  the creation of a commission of citizens, including some who are  critical of or opposed to the government, to help investigate  the murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate of  the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI]. In a brief  statement made at the Vicente Guerrero Hall of the Los Pinos  residence, the president noted that Mexico wants to know the  truth.    [Begin Salinas recording] At the same time, it is necessary  to avoid a climate of mutual suspicion. Any inquiry is  difficult; it takes time. We cannot, however, accept the  fostering of a climate of doubt. We are determined to open the  investigation so that citizens of the highest professional  quality can participate. [end recording]    The commission will comprise the following people: Carlos  Payan, newsman and LA JORNADA daily editor; (Fernando Gomez  Montt), National Action Party federal deputy and chairman of the  Chamber of Deputies Justice Committee; Leonel Godoy, former  Michoacan State attorney general, former deputy of the Party of  the Democratic Revolution, and special prosecutor in the Obando  and Hill case; lawyer (Agustin Santamarina); and Agustin Basabe,  PRI deputy for Nuevo Leon State and former Colosio adviser. The  president thanked these citizens for their willingness to  participate in the task, which he described as delicate. He  added that the Colosio Riojas family welcomes their  participation.</p>

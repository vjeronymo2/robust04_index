			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In its April 10, 1987 Notice, OHA stated that Subpart V claimants, anticipating filing refund applications for crude oil monies, would generally be required to (1) document the volume of petroleum products they purchased from August 19, 1973 to January 27, 1981; and (2) prove they were injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges. End-users of petroleum products whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry are presumed injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges and therefore need not submit additional proof of injury. End-users need only document the volume of their petroleum purchases in order to be eligible to receive a refund. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> City of Columbus, Georgia,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 16 DOE &para;85,550 (1987).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> B. Refund Claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> We propose that standard DOE procedures, as set forth in the MSRP, govern the distribution of the $2,226,782.70 in crude oil monies obtained from Mt. Airy. We have chosen initially to reserve 20 percent of the fund ($445,357.00) for direct refunds to applicants. We propose that refund applications in the Mt. Airy proceeding be evaluated in exactly the same manner as refund applications submitted in other crude oil proceedings. Applicants generally will be required to document the volume of petroleum products they purchased and prove that they were injured as a result of the alleged violations. We will adopt a presumption that the alleged crude oil overcharges were absorbed rather than passed on, by applicants who were (1) end-users of petroleum products, (2) unrelated to the petroleum industry, and (3) not subject to the regulations promulgated under the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 (EPAA), 15 U.S.C. 751&hyph;760h. In order to receive a refund, end-user applicants need only document the volume of petroleum products they purchased. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Shell,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 17 DOE &para;85,204 (1988). Petroleum retailer, reseller and refiner applicants will be required to submit detailed evidence of injury. They may not rely upon the injury presumptions utilized in some refined product refund cases.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As has been stated in prior Decisions, a crude oil refund applicant will only be required to submit one application for its share of all available crude oil overcharge funds. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., A. Tarricone, Inc.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 15 DOE &para;85,495 (1987). A party that has already submitted a claim in any other crude oil refund proceeding implemented by the DOE need not file another claim. The prior application will be deemed to be filed in all crude oil refund proceedings implemented by DOE. Any applicant who has executed and submitted a valid waiver, pursuant to one of the escrow accounts established by the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement, has waived his right to file an application for Subpart V crude oil refund monies. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Mid-America Dairymen  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Herrington,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 878 F.2d 1448 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App.), 3 Fed. Energy Guidelines &para;26,617 (1989);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> In re: Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 707 F. Supp. 11267 (D. Kan.), 3 Fed. Energy Guidelines &para;26,613 (1987).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current deadline for filing an Application for Refund is June 30, 1994. All crude oil refund claims filed before June 30, 1994, will be paid at the rate of $.0008 per gallon. We anticipate, however, that applicants who filed their claims by June 30, 1988, will receive a supplemental refund payment. We will decide in the future whether applicants that filed applications after that date should receive additional refunds. Applicants may be required to submit additional information to support their claims for future amounts. Notice of any such additional amounts will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> C. Payments to the States and Federal Government  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Under the terms of the MSRP, we propose that the remaining 80 percent of the alleged crude oil violation amounts subject to this Proposed Decision or $1,781,426.00 in principal, plus accrued interest, should be disbursed in equal shares to the states and Federal government for indirect restitution. Refunds to the states will be in proportion to the consumption of petroleum products in each state during the period of price controls. The share or ratio of the funds allocated to each state is contained in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Agreement. When disbursed, these funds will be subject to the same limitations and reporting requirements that apply to any other crude oil funds received by the states in accordance with the Stripper Well Agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It Is Therefore Ordered That:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The $2,226,782.70 refund amount remitted to the Department of Energy by Mt. Airy and its former shareholders pursuant to the Consent Order finalized on January 17, 1991 will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14199 Filed 6&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

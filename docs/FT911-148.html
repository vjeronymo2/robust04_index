			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Money Markets: London rates steady RATES WERE little changed on the London money market yesterday, with three-month sterling interbank continuing to discount a cut of  1/2 point in bank base rates, despite last Friday's strong warning from the Bank of England against an early move. The authorities reinforced this view yesterday by not supplying enough assistance to take out the full underlying shortage on the money market, leaving overnight funds tight at around 12 1/2 per cent. Three-month interbank was quoted at 11 9/16 -11 1/2 per cent, compared with 11 9/16 -11 7/16 previously, and 12-month money was unchanged at 11 1/8 -11 per cent. Short sterling futures traded in a narrow range of 88.81 to 88.87 for June delivery on Liffe. The contract opened lower at 88.85 and closed at the day's low of 88.81, compared with 88.88 on Friday. Day-to-day credit was in more comfortable supply than of late on the cash market. The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 500m, but revised this to Pounds 450m at noon, and to Pounds 400m in the afternoon. Total help of Pounds 201m was provided. The authorities did not operate in the market before lunch, but in the afternoon bought Pounds 121m bills outright, by way of Pounds 1m Treasury bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 120m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent. Late assistance of around Pounds 80m was also provided. Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up of Treasury bills drained Pounds 849m, with the unwinding of repurchase agreements on bills absorbing Pounds 322m, and bank balances below target Pounds 5m. These outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds 50m to liquidity and a fall in the note circulation of Pounds 650m. In Madrid the Bank of Spain left its money market rate unchanged at 13.5 per cent at yesterday's thrice-monthly repurchase tender for central bank certificates. This is the main instrument of Spanish credit policy and was last changed on March 15. In Brussels the Belgian National Bank left its seven day advances rate, the main instrument of monetary policy, unchanged at 8.75 per cent at a tender for credits against government paper and commercial bills. In Frankfurt call money rose to 8.85 from 8.80 per cent as payments for a government bond drained about DM7bn from the money market.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: Japan's Fine-Ceramics Industry To Create New </F> Vision"]    [Text] Japan Fine Ceramics Association (JFCA) is about to  undertake its second-largest project following the long-term  fine-ceramics market forecast it thrashed out in 1988. Its  mission: The creation of a new industry "vision." Behind this  decision is the simmering of fine-ceramics development fever in  recent years, prompted in part by the recession. We think a  fresh, long-range vision is needed, and applaud the industry's  rise to the challenge.    The trouble with the industry's original vision goes back to  1989, when, based on a JFCA forecast, Symposium on Basic  Problems of Fine Ceramics Industry (advisory body to MITI)  predicted the fine-ceramics market would expand to &yen;6  trillion by 2000. Many companies then developed fine ceramics  blindly, and forged their strategies around this rosy forecast  in the absence of other indicators. Now, four years later,  virtually all of these firms have lost sight of the original  vision's aims.    What has changed in only four years? For one thing, the  vision itself was formed during a period of high economic growth  which has since subsided considerably. But probably the biggest  factor was mistaken judgment. Fine-ceramics makers, in pursuing  the materials' excellent properties, were too hasty in assessing  the practical-application possibilities within user industries.    Any new vision must first start with an explanation from  JFCA  regarding why the initial approaches failed. This will require  an elaborate inquiry in which not only materials suppliers, but  also -- from a practical-application standpoint as well --  product makers and component manufacturers should take part.    In conducting the inquiry, a one-by-one examination of  fine-ceramic materials and components in practical use today is  essential for reassessing the industry's true status. The  results can then provide companies with uniform-level targets as  they restructure their development operations.    It is now more than 10 years since the new-materials rage  caught on, and those companies with nothing to show for their  efforts need a healthy dose of determination to survive the  lingering recession. Some in the fields of advanced materials  centered on plastics are drastically restructuring, while others  are withdrawing or forming alliances with others.    A similar trend is taking shape among fine-ceramics makers.  Under the circumstances, the new JFCA vision can present  valuable guidance for companies revamping their strategies. We  look to the vision to provide new ideas to direct them.</p>

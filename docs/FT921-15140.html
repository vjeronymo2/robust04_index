			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Campaigning in earnest THE BEGINNING of 1992 has seen electioneering shift into a higher gear. Implausible Conservative party assertions about Labour's hidden agenda for taxation have clashed with equally unconvincing Labour recipes for economic recovery. Politics as usual, is the electorate's weary response. But politics are not as usual. This huffing and puffing conceals an extraordinary degree of consensus, at least among the front benches of the main parties. The main conflicts are within parties. So much, it would appear, for the constitutional role of general elections. The front benches share a commitment to British membership of the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS. They share at least a rhetorical acceptance of the market economy. Even over wage bargaining, no serious debate is joined. Both parties are reconciled to high unemployment as the remedy for the pay disease. The commitment to the ERM is the fundamental constraint. With sterling below its effective floor yesterday, the government has been brought still closer to politically disastrous interest rate increases. Mr Lamont's agony is Mr Smith's delight. The shared commitment to the ERM allows Mr Smith to welcome membership and deplore its consequences in one happy sound bite. So what issues are the chancellor and his shadow left to fight over? From this week's debate, programmes for recovery, the level of public spending and the structure of taxation will figure large among them. It is here that Mr Lamont, meeting with his cohorts in Chevening this weekend, will have to dream up the election-winning strategy. They will find it hard. As Mr Lamont has admitted, the Treasury's forecast of 2.3 per cent growth between 1991 and 1992 was pie in the sky. The FT's survey of new year forecasts showed growth of 1.7 per cent, but the consensus is now down to growth of 1.4 per cent. This does not appear an election-winning performance. Selective incentives For its part, the Labour party offers some nicely wrapped baubles: a cash- and time-limited fund for investment in small and medium-sized manufacturing companies; enhanced first-year capital allowances for investment in manufacturing and improvements in skills training. But the selective incentives are doubtful in principle and will have little short-term impact. Since a Labour party victory might lead to a sterling crisis, the immediate prospect could well be higher rates of interest and a more feeble recovery. In some remarkably dishonest electioneering, the Labour party has made much of the rise in the share of taxes and social security contributions, from 34 1/2 to 37 3/4 per cent of GDP, between 1978-79 and 1990-91. Since this occurred in spite of a decline in the share of government spending, from 44 to 40 1/2 per cent of GDP, the explanation lies in the huge fiscal deficit bequeathed by the last Labour government. Biggest deficit So when the Conservative party argues that the Labour party has a long wish list for increased public spending, it is absolutely right. But when it says the Labour party will increase the basic rate of taxation by 10p, it is talking through its hat. The Labour party will not increase spending as it might like and will, in practice, try to run the biggest deficit it can get away with. How big a deficit that might be is anyone's guess. But it could be bigger than the 3 per cent of GDP in 1992-93 already indicated by the Treasury in the Autumn Statement (and itself likely to be exceeded). Given the ERM constraint on monetary policy, a greater fiscal boost than that tacitly attempted by Mr Lamont could even be justified. But the UK's external position and past Labour party behaviour would also make such a boost risky. On the structure of taxation, the Conservatives remain dedicated to lowering the basic rate of tax, even though that tax is hardly a disincentive at current rates and accounts for barely more than a quarter of total government receipts. This is a shibboleth, not a policy. Meanwhile, Labour rightly proposes to eliminate the anomalies created by the interaction of national insurance contributions with income tax. But in the process, it will raise taxation for everyone over the national insurance ceiling of Pounds 20,280, as well as increase the top rate of tax to an undesirably high level of 59 per cent. Overall macroeconomic policy may be dictated by forces over which UK politicians have negligible control. But levels of spending and taxation, as well as the structure of taxation itself, remain open to debate. Here is where chancellors and their shadows still have jobs to do. Unfortunately, as Mr Smith observed in the FT this week, serious debate is ruined by two peculiar customs: the presentation of two half-budgets a year, and the Treasury's mania for secrecy. If the election campaign forces the two sides to come a bit cleaner, it will have served at least one valuable function.</p>

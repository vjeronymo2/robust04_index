			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> HORSE OWNERS MOVE AFTER WINNING FIGHT  </P> <P> After fighting Thousand Oaks City Hall for three years to keep Ragtime, a  well-known miniature stallion, Patty and Richard Fairchild have moved from  their rented house on Shady Brook Drive to the city's horse country five miles  away.  </P> <P> "It seems crazy," said Patty Fairchild, who spent $40,000 in legal fees  fighting to keep Ragtime at their tract house.  </P> <P> "We could have rented anywhere. We just ended up here."  </P> <P> She said they looked for a home in all areas of Thousand Oaks and the  surrounding areas, but ended up renting a house on Paige Lane in the city's  horse country.  </P> <P> "The house just seemed to fit the bill," Fairchild said of the three-bedroom  blue-and-white house. And the neighbors are already warming up to the 27-inch  horse.  </P> <P> Ragtime achieved national attention in 1987, when the city ordered the  Fairchilds to remove the tiny horse from their property. Thousand Oaks  officials argued that the horse violated city codes prohibiting such animals  from being kept within 40 feet of residential dwellings.  </P> <P> But in the last year, a Ventura Municipal judge ruled in favor of the  Fairchilds, saying the miniature horse should be considered a domestic pet.

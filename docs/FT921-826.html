			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Arts: The Dark River/The Dance and the Railroad - Theatre/Andrew St George Rodney Ackland (1908-1991) is one of England's forgotten playwrights. He wrote The Dark River under the shadow of war; it was first performed in 1943 with Peggy Ashcroft in the lead. This production is the play's second revival at the Orange Tree, Richmond: fine, acute and absorbing theatre, wonderfully acted and intimately directed. Ackland set the play in 1937. It tells the complicated story of Catherine, a former dancer torn between a comfortable past peopled with familiarities and an edgy new future. She is estranged from her husband, Christopher, and summers at the Thameside house of her former teacher, Ella; she takes with her a blousy friend, Gwen, and is followed there by her new lover, Alan, the official representative of the new future who brings news of Nazism and Guernica. Throughout the course of the summer, the relationships unfold as the war looms. The play stacks the past into unwieldy heaps of baggage that each character carries around: Ella's son had died at Ypres, and when an itinerant stocking salesman calls and turns out to be from the same regiment, she takes him into service; Ella's father, frail and hallucinating, looks back to another past. The river itself, under suburban pressure from bungalows and road houses, flows back to an idyllic bygone age; Ella plays Chaminade, swamped by the noise of overhead planes from a nearby squadron. Ackland's techniques, finely balanced here between farce and tragedy, deliver a straight play with a sense of humour. The play's greatest strength is its emotional knowingness; Ackland made each part substantial by interweaving its concerns with the others, but the plot turns on improbable encounters, telling rather than showing. The dialogue has more 'darlings' and "absolutelys' than a Channel 4 Board meeting, and so the feeling can seem stilted: 'I think it's absolutely divine, but suppose we want somewhere gayer?" The play's central scene, where Catherine, a model of vacillation, tries to break first with Alan and then Christopher, is a thoughtful metaphor for an England quavering on the brink of a future but always ready to relax into the past. Catherine yearns backwards: 'How disappointing summer is . . . I suppose one is really longing for summers in the past.' Ackland has little time for this indulgent nostalgia, while recognising the need in others. Finally, a clock which was stopped at the start of the action is rewound: time moves on. Alan says: 'Once you've stopped going forward, it becomes a sort of death.' Sam Walters' direction is marred by sloppy lighting; the play should be moodier. The acting everywhere has subtlety and tact. With Stephanie Cole, mistress of the downcast eye as Ella, Belinda Lang as the febrile Catherine and Malcolm Sinclair as Alan, the issues of Ackland's sombre text emerge clearly. The Dark River reminds one uncannily of Fitzgerald's coda to Gatsby: 'and so we beat on, boats against the current, ceaselessly born back into the past.' But this remains a play about Englishness, the old world and not the new. On May 10 1869, the tracks of the Central Pacific railroad east from Sacramento connected with the Union Pacific railroad at Promontory Point, Utah, to form the Transcontinental. It was six years in the making, built by immigrant labour, first Irish, and then overwhelmingly Chinese recruited from goldrush California and China. The extraordinary play, The Dance and the Railroad tells the story of two Chinese railroad workers in 1867; it puts spoken dialogue alongside Beijing Opera in a compelling juxtaposition. The Dance comes to The Contact Theatre from Glasgow and Cardiff; it is written by David Hwang (M. Butterfly) and performed by Singapore's Leling Beijing Opera Troupe and the Glasgow based TAG Theatre Company. Alan Lyddiard directs. The result is a strange and beguiling evening's theatre which informs both the intellect and the senses. Behind the two principal actors (Tom Yang and Unku), a drama of dance, mime and colour plays itself out. The stage, divided by black gauzes, opens into a space in which the 10 Beijing Opera players perform in sumptuous costumes. The dialogue, not unlike some of Tom Stoppard's scripted exchanges, is interspersed with interludes of Opera. Beijing Opera itself is a theatre of simplicity governed by complex rules of gesture and voice. These remarkable dancers educate one's attention for detail: the stage is filled and yet one searches for the smallest gesture. The action runs tangential to the railroad narrative, yet enacts parts of it: the struggle between man and the unyielding environment, the need for one's own cultural roots in a foreign land, or the value of stamina, application and discipline in the face of an overwhelming task. The Opera interludes include several stock figures of the genre: Guan Gung the civilian who excels in the martial arts, Madame White Snake, a Goddess made mortal who falls in love with a human. These characters appear while one of the railroad workers reveals the mysteries of the Opera training. ;the novice asks "How long before I can play Guan Gung?' his teacher replies 'How long before a dog can play the violin?'

On January 7, 1991, ESFG's adviser entered into an agreement to sell the Funds' advisory contracts to SunAmerica Asset Management Corp. (``SunAmerica''). On June 14, 1991, shareholders of the respective Funds approved new investment advisory and management agreements between ESFG and SunAmerica whereby SunAmerica became the adviser of the Funds.

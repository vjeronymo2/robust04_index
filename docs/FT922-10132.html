			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Annuities and taxes IF AN election is made not to take any tax free sum, and the whole amount of a personal pension fund is used to buy an annuity on retirement, is there any relief from income tax on a portion of the annuity paid each month? No, the whole of the annuity is taxable (as earned income). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

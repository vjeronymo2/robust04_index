			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Peter Black advances 22% to top Pounds 7m Increasing demand from Marks and Spencer last year fuelled a 22 per cent rise in interim profits at Peter Black, the supplier of footwear, cosmetics and accessories to the UK's most profitable retailer. Reporting pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.01m (Pounds 5.73m) for the six months to December 4, the West Yorkshire-based company said the improvement would create significant opportunities for organic growth. Those opportunities have persuaded the group, which relies on M&amp;S for 65 per cent of its turnover, to commit Pounds 10m to a new plant making personal care products in south Derbyshire. Mr Gordon Black, joint chairman, said the development was justified by a 12 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 68.6m (Pounds 61.1m). 'The strong cash generating capability of the business has enabled the group to maintain its programme of investment in product development, plant and information technology while at the same time eliminating gearing,' he added. Borrowing was down by almost Pounds 4.5m against the second half figure and Mr Black, whose family controls 30 per cent of the equity, said expansion in its three divisions could be financed from reserves. Of those divisions, personal care products accounted for the largest slice of profits, up 23 per cent to Pounds 3.26m (Pounds 2.65m). Improved turnover of Pounds 24m (Pounds 21m) was due partly to buoyant demand for natural health products, including vitamins and herbal remedies sold under its English Grains label. Growing imports of handbags and Italian shoes helped the footwear and accessories division increase pre-tax profits by 26 per cent to Pounds 2.81m (Pounds 2.23m) on turnover up 12 per cent at Pounds 37.2m. The distribution, leisure and retail sector - including factory outlets and the Hornsea Freeport shopping centre - contributed Pounds 948,000 (Pounds 845,000) to profits despite flat turnover of Pounds 7.4m (Pounds 7m). Earnings per share rose to 8.59p (7.05p) and the interim dividend goes up to 1.12p (0.93p). COMMENT Should sales collapse, Peter Black executives claim they could make a profit running courses for would-be M&amp;S suppliers. Certainly making products for the St Michael label has paid rich dividends. Yet the company has reduced potential risks by also signing supply deals with Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway. That strategy, coupled to a flourishing distribution network serving 30 companies, has boosted full year profit forecasts to Pounds 11.5m, giving a p/e of 19. While expensive for investors seeking a quick gain, the shares look a safe bet for long-term growth.</p>

Henan Governor Li Changchun applauded the outflow of the  surplus labor force from underdeveloped rural areas, describing  the results of peasants' job hunting in the following terms:  "Obtaining food, coupons, ideas, and connections and finding  the path to get rich."    Sichuan Governor Xiao Yang called migrant workers China's  third great phenomenon after the contract responsibility system  on a household basis with remuneration linked to output and  township and town enterprises, saying that these workers gave a  hint of what was going on in the labor market. In 1993, 10  million Sichuanese marched out of the basin and sent back to the  province over 10 billion yuan. Labor exports have become one of  the major sources of income for peasants in the province's poor  areas.    Guangdong views the vast inflow of migrant workers with  mixed  feelings. Tens of thousands of migrants are snapping up jobs  that are dirty, physically demanding, and shunned by city  residents, unwittingly accelerating urban development. The many  services they provide for urban residents in their lives and  work have become essential to the cities. However, the vast  influx of migrant populations have increased the pressure on  transportation, urban administration, and the already  insufficient infrastructure. Eighty percent of crimes in  Guangdong involved migrant workers. At the current NPC session,  the Guangdong deputies tabled a motion calling for strengthening  migrant population administration.    Guo Lin, NPC deputy and vice minister of railways in charge  of transportation, called "migrant worker tides" an inevitable  result from the market allocation of labor force. When the  decades-old "grain rationing" and "work-point system" that tied  the peasantry to their land were revoked, peasants could no  longer be content with farming drudgery and the leisure imposed  on them by the farming rhythm that left them "nothing to do for  eight months." They certainly wanted to go out "to get a piece  of the action" and earn money wherever they can.    The swelling "migrant worker" tide had a tremendous impact  on  the railway when it was already running above capacity. During  this spring season, trains carried 3.08 million passengers a  day, 20,000 a day more than the same period last year. With  huge passenger flows packing into crowded cars, trains had to  carry twice the capacity number of passengers. To ease migrant  flows, the Ministry of Railway provided an additional 5,036  contingent trains and cut 10,000 freight trains. Railway  bureaus in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Liuzhou, Zhengzhou, and Chengdu  were forced to use freighters.    The rise of township and town enterprises has enabled 110  million of the 400 million-strong rural labor force to quit  farming. There are still close to 200 million idle laborers,  with 10 million joining their ranks each year. These people  need to eat, make a living, and get rich. And the widening  scissors gap for "agricultural products" and the lowering  comparative advantage of agriculture inevitably set enormous  rural surplus labor in motion. It has been forecast that by the  year 2000, there will be 100 million peasants joining the  "migrant worker" force; that is to say, the "migrant worker"  tide is destined to rumble on for many years to come.    The appearance of migrant workers carries profound  historical  significance and indicates the direction of the times. It  signals China's reform and opening up and changes ushered in by  market economic reforms, and is a by-product of China's  transition from an agricultural country to an industrial one.  As Gu Shengzu, a CPPCC delegate in Beijing for the session,  said: Migrant workers can only be channeled, not blocked.  Because the migration of tens of millions of peasants  represents in fact the choice of tens of billions of peasants  behind them. Such a choice represents an irresistible  historical force. Certain disorder and negative phenomena  arising from the choice should be seen as the price for reforms.    One school of thought holds that the day when the whole  rural  surplus labor force is successfully transferred to  nonagricultural occupations is the day of success for China's  reforms. Though this viewpoint may sound a little too extreme,  it nevertheless states the essential truth. Without a doubt,  once the peasants are freed from the entanglement of the old  system and the constraint of the old order, they will certainly  become a powerful propelling force for China's move toward a  market economy.</p>

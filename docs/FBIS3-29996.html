But the top  government spokesman said a meeting of cabinet ministers to be  held Friday will not reach any conclusion on specific  market-opening measures.    "The cabinet-level meeting will be held to try to map out a  plan as early as possible," Takemura told a news conference.  The meeting, bringing together nine ministers, including the  foreign, finance and international trade ministers, will take  place after a regular cabinet meeting Friday morning, he said.    It will aim to formulate a program to speed up deregulation,  strengthen import and investment promotion steps, revamp  competition policy and improve government procurement processes.    Last week, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and  subcabinet-level officials who represented Japan in trade  negotiations with the U.S. agreed to map out a four-pronged  scheme as soon as possible. The move is intended to stave off  the trade dispute with the U.S., which has been increasing  pressure on Japan to whittle down its lopsided trade surplus  since the collapse of talks on a bilateral trade framework on  February 11.    Meanwhile, Takemura indicated Japan will consider an  extension of planned tax cuts beyond this year after  implementing a sweeping tax system reform.    Under the original plan, the tax cut period is limited to  only this year. This has sparked U.S. criticism that the tax  cut is far from sufficient to stimulate the languishing Japanese  economy.</p>

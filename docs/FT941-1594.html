			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: More O'Ferrall hits Pounds 8m as UK market improves More O'Ferrall, the hoardings and bus shelter advertising company, boosted pre-tax profits for 1993 from Pounds 220,000 to Pounds 7.8m on the back of an improved UK market. Mr Brian Turnbull, finance director, said gains in the UK and Ireland reflected careful control of costs and the group's high level of operational gearing. Operating profits from continuing operations were 16 per cent ahead, from Pounds 7.26m to Pounds 8.4m, on turnover of Pounds 67.6m. Last year's total turnover of Pounds 63.4m contained Pounds 1.83m from the discontinued US operation, which was sold in 1992. Provision of Pounds 4.44m was made for the disposal, but in the event the loss was Pounds 3.69m, allowing Pounds 750,000 to be released to 1993 profits. Operating profits in the UK and Ireland rose from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 5.9m on turnover ahead from Pounds 38.5m to Pounds 43.6m. Mr Russell Gore-Andrews, chairman, said the last quarter of the year had not been as buoyant as expected, suggesting that key drinks advertisers had spent Pounds 9m less than expected in the run-up to Christmas. Following sterling's devaluation at the end of 1992, operating profits in sterling were static in France and ahead in Belgium, which each accounted for 17 per cent of total tunover. However, they were sharply lower in local currencies. Mr Turnbull described the Belgian result as reasonable in spite of the recession. The group had acted early to cut costs in France as the recession worsened, and further cost cutting measures were in progress. In Taiwan, which represents 2 per cent of the group's business, both turnover and operating profits were well ahead. Mr Gore-Andrews said the group was planning to continue to grow the business, and would be exploring the possible opportunities on mainland China. Net interest payable fell from Pounds 1.96m to Pounds 1.39m, capital expenditure was down from Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 4.8m, and gearing fell from 25 per cent to 20 per cent at year-end. Earnings per share were 16.5p, compared with a loss of 4p last time. An unchanged final dividend of 10p is proposed, giving an same-again 13.2p total. COMMENT These results were in line with forecasts in spite of worse-than-expected figures from France and the poor fourth quarter in the UK. The group also did well to retrieve some of the anticipated cost of getting out of the lossmaking operations in the US. Operating margins are around 12 per cent - well below the group's potential. The group is well placed both to take advantage of any European recovery and to spread its wings from Taiwan to China. Pre-tax profits of around Pounds 10m for this year put it on a prospective multiple of 20 - a little high, but still worth a look.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Belgian economy turns the corner The recession in Begium has bottomed out, although the economy remains burdened by a large budget deficit and high unemployment, Mr Alfons Verplaetse, Belgium Cental Bank governor said yesterday, writes Gillian Tett in Brussels. He said the budget deficit, currently 7.2 per cent, remained the central issue facing the government. Belgium's GDP fell 1.3 per cent in 1993. Household savings reached a record 20 per cent of disposable incomes. The recession appeared to have slowed in the last quarter of 1993, but during the year as a whole unemployment rose from 8.2 per cent to 9.4 per cent, with no prospect of a fall in the jobless rate in sight. Inflation rose to 2.8 per cent, up from 2.4 per cent in 1992.</p>

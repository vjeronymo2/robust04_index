			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Huan Jianxin [1360 1696 2450]: ``China Develops </F> New Series of Fiber Optic Communications Devices'']    [Summary] Hangzhou, 25 Apr (KEJI RIBAO wire report) -- The  State 863 Program projects in R&amp;D of optoelectronic devices  and  integration technologies have realized major advances in the  areas of fiber optic communications devices and quantum well  devices. As revealed to this writer today by CAS Academician  Zhou Bingkun, major steps forward have also been taken in  domestic industrialization of these products. Some specific  accomplishments include development of a distributed-feedback  (DFB) laser diode that passed a 100,000-hour lifetime test, is  now being used in a fiber optic project undertaken by a  Chongqing joint venture firm, and has been provided to Bell Labs  [i.e. Bellcore] in the U.S. as well as to laboratories in Italy,  Germany, and elsewhere. In the area of quantum well  optoelectronic devices and integration technologies, a batch of  high-performance devices have been developed, among which a  short-wavelength quantum well low-threshold-current laser diode  meets current international standards. Some of the 863  Program-supported devices are now in the initial stages of  industrialization: for example, a 0.808-micron-wavelength  high-power semiconductor laser has been incorporated into a  10-element phase-locked quantum well laser diode array, 1000  units of which are now being manufactured annually. It is  understood that over 1200 technologists nationwide are engaged  in 863 Program-supported optoelectronics research; over a 3-year  period, they have taken on 110 projects, of which 30 have passed  formal technical appraisal, while at least 10 have received  State patents or Minis try/Commission-level S&amp;T advancement  awards.</p>

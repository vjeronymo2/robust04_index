			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Revenue seeks to protect tax staff whose jobs may be contracted out THE Inland Revenue has become the first government department to state that it is seeking to protect the pay and conditions of staff whose jobs might be contracted out to the private sector. Mr Steve Matheson, the Revenue's director of operations, has written to staff, anxious about the effect on their jobs, to tell them that four prototype 'market testing' schemes involving secretarial staff have been stopped. Under market testing, the first step in the process that leads to contracting out, services provided in-house are tested against the market. Staff are encouraged to bid for the contract on the same basis as the private sector. The Revenue's decision to reorganise market-testing ensures that staff are covered by Tupe - Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) - regulations. These were designed to protect wages and conditions in company mergers. The move follows pressure by the union for tax staff, the Inland Revenue Staff Federation, which last week announced a large majority for industrial action against market testing. Mr Clive Brooke, the general secretary of the IRSF, said the Revenue's decision was a 'victory in a battle but not in the war'. Mr Matheson said in a circular to staff: 'We have decided not to go ahead with the market testing of these four areas. We have to organise the work in such a way as to be as sure as we can that the Tupe regulations will apply.' In some circumstances the Tupe regulations can apply to contracting-out and prevent private companies from cutting the pay or worsening the conditions of civil servants they take on. That could restrict some parts of the big market-testing programme announced by the government in November. Market-testing is this year being extended to 44,000 civil servants and the value of the work being tested has risen from Pounds 25m in 1992 to Pounds 1.5bn in 1993. Next Monday the government is hosting a conference for private companies on how to compete for that work. Until now the government has accepted that the Tupe regulations, inspired by the European Community, do apply in areas where there is clearly a separate undertaking being contracted-out, but says they do not apply in more loosely organised functions such as secretarial work. Each government department can organise market-testing in the way it sees fit and the Inland Revenue's positive attitude to Tupe may not be repeated throughout the civil service. Market testing of secretarial work in the Inland Revenue will still go ahead but instead of being organised in four small schemes, which might not have qualified for Tupe protection, it will be organised throughout the Inland Revenue South West. Mr Matheson argues that, when restructured, secretarial services are more likely to be covered by Tupe. But he also warns that job losses will still be unavoidable.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHERS' REPRESENTATIVES AUTHORIZE STRIKE VOTE  </P> <P> Citywide representatives of Los Angeles' 22,000 union teachers, angered by a  management threat to cut off their paychecks next month, voted unanimously  Wednesday night to authorize a strike vote.  </P> <P> The action, while expected, was a rank-and-file show of unity and an  endorsement of the aggressive bargaining tactics of union leaders, particularly  United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson.  </P> <P> "That bureaucracy must be cut," Johnson told 300 teachers at the union's  headquarters. "It's a fight over (spending) priorities."  </P> <P> Johnson asked for the strike vote after schools Supt. Leonard Britton announced  that he would withhold paychecks, beginning March 3, from teachers who do not  file student grades with the district. As a pressure tactic in a year-old  contract fight, more than 70% of the district's teachers last week refused to  turn in grades to school offices. Instead, students were given their grades  directly on report cards furnished by the union.  </P> <P> Johnson also for the first time told teachers Wednesday night that they should  turn in student grades if the union fails to block the district's pay  withholding plan in court this week. He said the union will apply new,  unspecified pressure tactics and prepare for a strike if grades must be  submitted.  </P> <P> Wednesday's action by the union's House of Representatives begins a two- to  three-week strike vote process that will not be completed until ballots are  distributed and voting takes place at nearly 700 schools. A strike cannot  legally occur and is not expected until the spring. And even then a second  strike vote would be required. Teacher anger was increased with the news  Wednesday that the district will not just withhold teacher pay, but all the  automatic payments normally made on payday, such as union dues, mortgage  payments, insurance premiums or charitable contributions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Officials Disappointed  </P> <P> District officials said they were disappointed by the approval of the strike  vote, because they have made the best offer possible. They said a settlement  can still be reached and noted that negotiations continued Wednesday and were  scheduled to resume today.  </P> <P> The teachers are seeking an 11% raise this year and a 10% raise next year. The  district is offering 20% to 24% over three years, including 8% for the current  school year. Whenever agreement is reached, the raise for this year will be  paid retroactively to last July 1.  </P></p>

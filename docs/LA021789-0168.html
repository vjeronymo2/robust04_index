			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRACY SCHWARTZ SPENT A BUCK ON CAJUN MUSIC AND WAS HOOKED FOREVER  </P> <P> Southern California is not the most likely place to find a passkey into the  world of traditional Cajun music, but life-changing discoveries often happen  under unlikely circumstances.  </P> <P> Cajun music is rooted in rural Louisiana prairie towns that couldn't be more  remote in setting or spirit from the hubbub of a metropolis or a music business  center. But when Tracy Schwartz came through Los Angeles back in the early  1960s as a member of the New Lost City Ramblers, an influential trio of folk  music traditionalists, he had his first profound Cajun encounter.  </P> <P> "At the old Ash Grove (the seminal L.A. folk and blues club), I got an album by  (Cajun musician) Austin Pitre for a dollar," said Schwartz, who will play a  solo show Saturday night at the Shade Tree in Laguna Niguel. "It was the best  dollar I ever spent. It gave me a real good idea of what traditional Cajun  music should sound like."  </P> <P> For Schwartz, who grew up in New Jersey and Connecticut, that album was the  start of a musical love affair from which he has emerged as one of the few  players to have made a mark in Cajun music without having been born into the  French-speaking Cajun culture.  </P> <P> "The sound of the music was what got me first," Schwartz recalled in a recent  phone interview from Fresno, where he had stopped during his annual West Coast  tour. "The songs were in a language other than English, but there was a lot of  country music in there, too. These two things that are almost contradictory  were mixed in Cajun music, and that's what got me."  </P> <P> For Schwartz, 50, those seeming incongruities held unusual interest: Country  and Western was his first musical love, and foreign languages were another  leading passion (he has studied five, including French and Russian, and he  holds a bachelor's degree in German).  </P> <P> Schwartz's next step on the road to being certified as an honorary Cajun (an  award he received last year from the Louisiana-based Cajun-French Music Assn.)  was encountering the music in the flesh at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival. The  festival marked the first time that traditional Cajun music had ever been  played on a prominent, mainstream stage. Schwartz struck up a friendship at the  festival with Dewey Balfa, an expert fiddler who would become one of the most  effective and engaging ambassadors of Cajun music and culture. He also became  Schwartz's coach in things Cajun.  </P> <P> "Tracy was like a child that sees a toy and he grabs for it and he can't reach  it," Balfa said over the phone from his home in Basile, La., where he still  drives a school bus when he isn't performing. But with enough patience, Balfa  said, concluding the analogy, the child finally gets what he is reaching for.  </P> <P> After a decade of running into Balfa on the folk festival circuit, Schwartz's  involvement in Cajun music deepened in 1975, when, at Balfa's invitation, he  visited Louisiana for the first time. Balfa wanted to record a Cajun fiddle  instruction album modeled after the "Learn To Fiddle" instructional LP that  Schwartz had released in 1965. He asked Schwartz to produce the record.  </P> <P> "We did it back-porch style," recording at Balfa's home on equipment borrowed  from the Smithsonian Institution, Schwartz said. Schwartz also took the tape  machine out to area dance halls at Mardi Gras, where he captured Balfa and  other local players for a second album.  </P> <P> In Louisiana, Schwartz said, he learned to appreciate the cultural attitudes  that are an integral part of Cajun music.  </P> <P> "There's a joie de vivre," Schwartz said. "It becomes important (for Cajuns) to  go out on a Saturday night after a week of work, get out there and have a good  time and let loose and have that as an integral part of your life style. It's  kind of like being a child again in a way. It's good, and cathartic, and a lot  of fun."  </P> <P> Schwartz and his son, Peter, who also studied under Balfa, have gone on to  support Balfa on three albums since 1984. "Souvenirs" was a Grammy nominee in  1986 for best traditional folk recording.  </P> <P> Can Schwartz, who also has taught himself to play Cajun accordion, fiddle  Cajun-style as well as the native-born experts? Balfa, noting that he himself  can't play bluegrass as well as a native Kentuckian, said it is probably  impossible for an outsider to completely master a traditional folk style. "But  Tracy's close," he said. "Tracy devoted so much of his time and musical  knowledge to play Cajun music. He does a good job.  </P> <P> "A lot of (Cajun) people thought it was not a culture to be proud of," Balfa  added. "Then to find someone who wants to come down and share in your culture,  your ideas and your customs -- a lot of people appreciate that."  </P> <P> Schwartz had a large stake in folk music before he spent that buck at the Ash  Grove's record counter. As a student at Georgetown University, he had been  caught up in the folk boom of the late 1950s.  </P> <P> "I blundered onto the underground bluegrass scene in Washington," Schwartz  said. "I started going to the hootenannys they were having, and that's where I  met the New Lost City Ramblers."  </P> <P> The trio, formed in 1958, included Mike Seeger, half-brother of Pete Seeger,  and was devoted to preserving old-time Appalachian folk styles. In 1962, after  Schwartz had served a hitch in the Army, the Ramblers asked him to fill a slot  opened by the departure of one of the original members. The group disbanded  after Schwartz had been with it for 17 years. He said the three members still  get together for several reunion concerts each year. As a solo act, the  Vermont-based Schwartz alternates between Cajun and Appalachian folk styles.  </P> <P> Schwartz, who tours about half the year, said his current goal is to make  inroads with a new audience: people confined to nursing homes. Schwartz said  that he has tried to make nursing-home managers aware that good, live music is  available at a modest price, and he hopes to persuade corporations, especially  pharmaceutical concerns, to provide funding to bring musicians into the homes.  </P> <P> "They're selling them drugs and crutches. They could help with something for  their spirit," said Schwartz, whose interest in the cause was spurred by  personal experience with his mother and with one of his sons, a paraplegic who  lives and works now in San Diego.  </P> <P> Traditional folk, "this music of feelings, of real life," as Schwartz puts it,  is a medicine he wants to administer to nursing home patients wherever he  travels. "You have a healing power when you play this music," he said. "It  encourages them, it picks their spirits up. I can see that when I play."  </P> <P> Tracy Schwartz plays Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Shade Tree, 28062D Forbes Road,  Laguna Niguel. Tickets: $10. Reservations are recommended due to limited  seating. Information: (714) 364-5270.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / ICI and Enichem may sell PVC side Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries and Enichem of Italy are considering the flotation of EVC, their 50-50 polyvinyl chloride subsidiary. The move would be yet another step in ICI's strategy of quitting commodity chemicals businesses. Last year ICI sold its fibres business to Du Pont of the US, and its polypropylene capacity to BASF of Germany. EVC is Europe's largest manufacturer of PVC, a plastic widely used in the construction and automotive industries. It has capacity of 1.1m tonnes a year and about 20 per cent of the European market. The potential flotation follows the collapse of a possible management buy-out. Oxychem, a Dallas-based group and a leading US PVC producer, also expressed interest, but its offer was too low. Analysts were yesterday unsure how to value EVC, as little is known about it. Turnover last year was about Pounds 750m. Operating losses were about Pounds 100m, taking into account raw material discounts provided by the parent companies. ICI says the subsidiary is now trading profitably. Merchant bank SG Warburg is advising ICI, while UBS is representing Enichem. The only comparable company is Geon, the Ohio-based PVC manufacturer floated in March last year by BF Goodrich, the speciality chemicals and aerospace group. Geon has a market capitalisation of Dollars 730m (Pounds 480.2m) on sales of about Dollars 950m. However, the recovery of the US PVC cycle is at a more advanced stage than that of Europe. EVC's move into profits is the consequence of a rapid upturn in European PVC prices. These have risen from a low of DM0.95 per kg of pipe-grade plastic during the second quarter last year to DM1.3 per kg, according to Chem Systems, the London-based chemicals consultants. That compares with a peak of DM1.8 per kg in the first quarter of 1989. Prices have risen because of a collapse of imports from about 700,000 tonnes a year in 1992 to a predicted 300,000 tonnes this year. East European imports have fallen because of production problems, and US imports have dropped following buoyant demand in North America and Asia. In Europe, although forecast demand for PVC in Europe is only about 1.5 per cent a year, production increased 6 per cent during the first four months this year, according to Chem Systems. EVC's main competitors are Solvay of Belgium with 905,000 tonnes capacity a year; Elf Atochem of France (705,000 tonnes a year); Vinnolit, a joint-venture between Hoechst and Wacker of Germany (635,000 tonnes a year); and Shell, the Anglo-Dutch group (500,000 tonnes a year).

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> ["Appeal of the President of the Republic of Crimea to the </F> Citizens of the Republic, Citizens' Associations, Trade Union  Organizations, Labor Collectives, and Members of Electoral  Commissions"]    [Text] On 10 March of this year, I issued Edict No. 05/94  "On the Conduct of a Poll of the Citizens of the Republic of  Crimea on 27 March 1994." Its purpose was the creation of a  legal space favorable to the implementation of a preelection  program regarding dual citizenship, Crimea's complete economic  independence, and the practical preparation of important acts  necessary for the successful implementation of reforms. This  determined the essence of the questions submitted for the poll  of citizens of the Republic of Crimea:    1) Are you for the restoration of the provision of the  Constitution of the Republic of Crimea of 6 May 1992 which  determines the regulation of mutual relations between the  Republic of Crimea and Ukraine on the basis of a TREATY and  AGREEMENTS? (Yes/No)    The need for this question is associated with the fact that  the Supreme Council of Ukraine has not made a decision up until  now about whether the law of Ukraine "On Demarcating the Powers  between the Organs of State Authority of Ukraine and the  Republic of Crimea" is in effect or not. Periodically, guided  by political considerations, the Supreme Council of Ukraine  makes attempts to require bringing the Constitution and  legislative acts of the Republic of Crimea immediately into  conformity with the Constitution and legislation of Ukraine.  This makes the conduct of progressive economic reorganizations  in the Crimea extremely difficult and the arrangement of  fruitful relations with foreign partners even more complicated.    2) Are you for the restoration of the provision of the  Constitution of the Republic of Crimea of 6 May 1992 that  proclaimed the RIGHT OF CITIZENS OF THE REPUBLIC OF CRIMEA TO  DUAL CITIZENSHIP? (Yes/No)    With its decree of 24 February 1994 "On the Status of the  Autonomous Republic of Crimea in accordance with the Existing  Constitution and Legislation of Ukraine," the Supreme Council of  Ukraine made an attempt to deprive the Republic of Crimea of its  own citizenship, reducing it simply to a concept of permanent  residence on the peninsula. Naturally, this infringes  considerably on the rights of Crimeans and does not respond to  the aspirations of a majority of them that are directed at  acquiring Russian citizenship as a second citizenship, like that  of the other republics of the former Union. Therefore, it makes  sense to elicit the opinion of citizens of the Crimea on the  question, whose resolution Ukraine is hindering in every way  possible.    3) Are you for conceding the FORCE OF LAWS to the edicts of  the president of the Republic of Crimea on questions that are  temporarily not regulated by legislation of the Republic of  Crimea? (Yes/No)    The lawmaking activity of today's deputy corps has been  rather weak, an insignificant legacy was left, and many key  legal questions remained outside the purview of the Supreme  Soviet of Crimea. After the elections, essentially new deputies  will come to parliament who will acquire at least some  legislative experience after many months. But regardless of  this, and whether the Supreme Soviet adopts the required laws in  a timely way or not, people all the same will have to drink,  eat, clothe themselves, sow, harvest, study, get medical  treatment, and so forth. And so that our impoverished and  wretched life would change, reforms would continue, production  would be normalized, and the lag behind Russia, not to mention  behind countries of the West, would be reduced, it is expedient  for the period until parliament begins to work quickly and  qualitatively to allot to the president the right to issue  appropriate acts on the most pressing questions in the vital  activity of the republic that are not reflected in legislation  in force.    It would seem that everything is clear and understandable.  However, contrary to common sense, the Central Electoral  Commission on elections to the Supreme Soviet of Crimea, with  its decree No. 21/1 of 12 March 1994, expressed a reluctance to  take on the work, and more accurately, the honor of organizing  and conducting a poll of the citizens of the republic that  responds to the despair of Crimeans, which is convincingly  indicated by the results of the presidential elections. What is  more, in paragraph 1 of its decree, the Central Electoral  Commission, headed by V.V. Alsufyev, proposed to the president  of Crimea to bring the provisions of the edict into conformity  with existing legislation, thereby assuming the functions of the  Constitutional Court of the Republic of Crimea. This is an  impermissible excess of the powers granted to the Central  Electoral Commission by Article 14 of the Law "On Elections to  the Supreme Soviet of Crimea."    The conduct of the poll on another day or the creation of  special commissions for the conduct of the poll do not  constitute insurmountable difficulties, but it will require an  additional diversion of numerous people with multibillion costs,  which is not very sensible under conditions of a shortage even  for the payment of pensions and wages. Therefore, the conduct  of the poll simultaneously with the elections of the parliament  of Crimea and the forces of the same electoral commissions would  respond to the greatest degree to the interests of Crimeans --  the expenditures will be reduced essentially to the cost of  printing ballots and distributing them to the polls.    In view of the aforementioned, I appeal to all voters,  citizens' associations, trade union organizations, and labor  collectives that have nominated their own representatives to the  electoral commissions: Hold meetings with the members of the  commissions and give them instructions to support the idea of  conducting a poll on 27 March 1994 with the forces of the  currently operating electoral commissions. And I ask the  members of every electoral commission to accept the decisions at  their meetings concerning the participation of the commissions,  regardless of the objective difficulties associated with this in  the conduct of the poll scheduled for 27 March 1994 of citizens  of the Republic of Crimea, about which the appropriate executive  committees will issue notices.    The source of strength of a president is his unity with the  people. Support the idea of an all-Crimean poll, and the  achievement of our common goals, although not much, will be  closer.    [Signed] President of the Republic of Crimea Yu. Meshkov    15 March 1994    City of Simferopol</p>

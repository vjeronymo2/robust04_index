BRIEFING;  </P> <P> STC NEGOTIATING FUJITSU DEAL  </P> <P> STC PLC, the parent company of Britain's biggest computer maker, today said it  is negotiating the sale of a majority stake in its computer arm to Japan's  leading computer manufacturer, Fujitsu Ltd.  </P> <P> Such a stake in the subsidiary International Computers Ltd., or ICL, would give  Fujitsu a major foothold in Europe ahead of the creation of the single European  market in 1992, while offering ICL security for the future, analysts said.  </P> <P> STC, formerly known as Standard Telephones &amp; Cables, confirmed the  negotiations after Fujitsu President Tadashi Sekizawa said earlier in Tokyo  that his company is considering purchasing an interest in ICL but that "nothing  has been decided yet."  </P> <P> Newspaper reports in Britain and Japan have said Fujitsu would acquire 50% to  60% of ICL's equity for about $1.2 billion.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] After launching a vicious attack this morning  from the direction of Maglaj against positions held by the  Croatian Defense Council [HVO] in the area of Lijesnica and  Cehajic, the Muslim army mounted a combined artillery and  infantry assault in the area of Dolina from the direction of  Zavidovici.    After three hours of ferocious fighting, members of the  (Marko Praljic) battalion managed to disperse the enemy army.  Three Muslim soldiers, including one Iranian mojahid, were  killed on this occasion and their bodies have remained on the  territory controlled by the HVO. A considerable quantity of  arms was captured as well.    At noon the Muslims began an attack in the region of Brezova  Kosa and Krsic from the direction of Zeljezno Polje in the  western sector of the Zepce front. The fighting is still under  way and the defenders are repelling all the aggressor's attacks.    The most difficult situation today is on the Maglaj front.  After repulsing an attempted infantry spearhead into Croat  villages in the Bosna river valley near Maglaj, members of the  Zepce brigade launched a counterattack and succeeded in taking a  very important strategic point from which their firepower can  control access to the Natronka factory where the Muslims have  been manufacturing arms for quite some time now.

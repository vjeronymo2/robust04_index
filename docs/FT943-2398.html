			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / UN threat wins pledge from Bosnian Moslems The United Nations said yesterday it had won a promise of restraint from Bosnia's Moslem leadership after making an unprecedented threat to call down air strikes on government forces in Sarajevo if they continued to fire on the Serbs. The promise was made by Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic, and his military commander, General Rasim Delic, at a meeting with General Sir Michael Rose, the British commander of UN forces in Bosnia. Earlier, Gen Rose said he held government forces responsible for provoking an upsurge in fighting on Sunday, when the Bosnian capital saw its most serious shelling for the past seven months. The general told a Reuter correspondent in Sarajevo that he had warned the government forces they would face Nato air power unless they desisted from their attacks immediately. While Nato made limited air raids on Bosnian Serb positions in April and August, this was the first time it has been suggested that the air power of the alliance could be used against Bosnian government forces. Gen Rose, who has used an adept mixture of brinkmanship and bluster to face down all parties in the conflict, would be straining his personal authority to the limit if he invoked air strikes against the government, which enjoys widespread sympathy among politicians in the west and the Middle East. However, officials at Nato headquarters - who in the past have deplored the UN's caution in using air power against the Serbs - said there was no reason in principle while the air power of the alliance should be directed at one side only. The surge in fighting takes places against a background of increasing friction between the five countries - the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany - which are supposed to be co-operating to establish a peace settlement in Bosnia. Tension between the US on one hand and the all European powers on the other has been mounting ahead of October 15, when the US administration will start the process of lifting the ban on supplying arms to the Bosnian government.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / GE fined for Israeli jet engine scandal GENERAL Electric of the US yesterday pleaded guilty and agreed to pay Dollars 69m (Pounds 36.1m) in fines in a bribery and fraud scandal involving the sale of military jet engines to Israel, Reuter reports from Cincinnati, Ohio. Prosecutors said Dollars 40m was diverted in the largest case of fraud ever under a US government programme to finance sales of military equipment by American companies to foreign governments. The company admitted four counts of conspiracy, money laundering, submitting false claims and failure to make and keep accurate books and records. In June the Pentagon's Defence Logistics Agency suspended GE Aircraft Engines, which is based near Cincinnati, for four days from competing for contracts. GE employees were alleged to have bribed an Israeli air force general to influence his choice of a contractor for military jet engines. GE, the third-largest defence contractor in the US, said it went to the authorities as soon as it became aware of alleged wrongdoing by company employees. The charges arose after Mr Chester Walsh, who was manager of GE's aircraft engine business in Israel from 1984 to 1988, brought the scheme to the government's attention. Mr Walsh filed a civil suit against GE under the Federal False Claims Act, which the Justice Department joined in August after an investigation by the FBI.</p>

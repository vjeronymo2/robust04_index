			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Norway votes to stay out of European Union Norway last night rejected membership of the European Union for the second time in two decades, snubbing the EU's enlargement plans and dealing a stinging political blow to Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister. With 92 per cent of the votes counted in yesterday's referendum, the state NRK television network forecast a win for the anti-EU camp by 52.4 per cent to 47.6 per cent. Mrs Brundtland conceded defeat while Ms Anne Enger Lahnstein, leader of the main opposition Centre party and the leading figure in the No camp, told cheering supporters in Oslo: 'We said yes to Europe, yes to international solidarity, but we said No to the Union.' The No vote followed the country's rejection in an earlier referendum in 1972 of membership of what was then the European Economic Community. It came despite the recent approval of membership by Austria, Finland and Sweden - Norway's fellow European Free Trade Area nations - and means that the EU will expand from 12 to 15 members next year, not 16 as planned. The result was an embarrassing defeat for Mrs Brundtland, who had made winning over the country's Euro-sceptical electorate her central political goal over the past four years. The result belied her confidence that a sharp swing to the Yes side in the final weeks of the campaign, following the Yes vote in neighbouring Sweden, would be enough to win her the day. 'The Norwegian people have spoken and we have said from the beginning that we will respect the advice of the people,' she said. However, Mrs Brundtland repeated her earlier determination to carry on in office with her minority Labour government. Thanks to the splintering of the opposition parties in the Storting (parliament), there is no realistic alternative government to Labour, which remains easily the most popular party in the opinion polls. 'What is important for the government now is to take care of the country's interests through our international co-operation and through our co-operation in western Europe through the EEA,' she said. Norway is a participant in the European Economic Area trade accord with the EU. Norway will, however, stand outside the EU's drive to develop closer economic, political and strategic co-operation which the government had argued was vital for the country's economic and political security. A majority of Norwegians instead backed the No campaign's claim that EU membership would undermine the country's independence and its control over its rich petroleum and other natural resources.</p>

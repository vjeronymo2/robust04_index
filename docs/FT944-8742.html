			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Statistics burden is no greater Sir, Ms Carole Macpherson (Letters, November 15) claims that the Intrastat system for the collection of European Union trade statistics is a greater burden on business than the old system which operated prior to completion of the single market. We do not believe this is the case. Under the old system customs declarations had to be made in respect of each consignment. Most businesses employed agents to submit these declarations. The agents, of course, charged for providing this service. An indication of the scale of the activity is that 7m import and export declarations a year were abolished with the advent of the single market. Under the new system only larger businesses, some 30,000 out of the 150,000 companies engaged in EU trade, have to complete the Intrastat declarations, which are considerably less detailed than the previous import declaration and only have to be submitted once a month. However, most businesses involved in the new system have chosen to complete the Intrastat forms themselves. Ms Macpherson is correct in pointing out that there were start-up costs to be borne by bringing this work in-house. However, the analysis of costs that we conducted, in consultation with business before introduction of the new single market and subsequently revalidated, showed these initial costs rapidly being converted into a continuing annual saving. Finally, we have followed a policy of a 'light touch' on enforcement while the new system has bedded in, but we believe the contribution of those who have made an effort to comply with the new system would be devalued if we were not to pursue the non-compliants, now less than 1 per cent of the total.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Each Class III railroad (including a switching and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminal or other railroad not otherwise classified) shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement mandatory reasonable suspicion testing according to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures listed in paragraph (b) of this section beginning on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1996. Prior to that date, a Class III railroad may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use the procedures described in paragraphs (c) through (e) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) In the case of a railroad commencing operations after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1996, the railroad shall implement mandatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable suspicion testing not later than the expiration of 60  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days from approval by the Administrator of the railroad's random  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) As provided for in subparagraph (a)(1) of this section,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the conduct of alcohol testing under this subpart is governed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart H of this part and Part 40 of Subtitle A of this title.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) As provided for in subparagraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section, and except as provided in paragraph (f), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following conditions apply to breath testing authorized by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Testing devices shall be selected from among those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed on the Conforming Products List of Evidential Breath  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Measurement Devices amended and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from time to time by the National Highway Traffic Safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Each device shall be properly maintained and shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calibrated or verified as to correct calibration by use of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breath alcohol simulator (calibrating unit) listed on the NHTSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conforming Products List of Calibrating Units for Breath Alcohol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Testers (as amended and published) with sufficient frequency to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure the accuracy of the device (within plus or minus .01  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent), but not less frequently than provided in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer's instructions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Tests shall be conducted by a trained and qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator. The operator shall have received training on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operational principles of the particular instrument employed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practical experience in the operation of the device and use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the breath alcohol calibrating unit. A copy of the training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program shall be filed with FRA in conjunction with the filing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by &sect;217.11 of this title.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Tests shall be conducted in accordance with procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified by the manufacturer of the testing device, consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with sound technical judgment, and shall include appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrictions on ambient air temperature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) If an initial test is positive, the employee shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tested again after the expiration of a period of not less than 15  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minutes, in order to confirm that the test has properly measured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the alcohol content of deep lung air.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Because of the inherent limitations of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrumentation, any indicated breath test result of less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> .02 percent shall be deemed a negative test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)(1) In any case where a breath test is intended for use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the railroad disciplinary process and the result is positive,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the employee shall be given the prompt opportunity to provide a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blood sample at an independent medical facility for analysis by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a competent independent laboratory. The railroad shall provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the required transportation to facilitate the blood test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A blood test under this section shall conform to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following standards:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The specimen shall be collected in a medically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable manner by a qualified medical professional or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technician using a non-ethanol swab and shall be deposited into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a single-use sterile vacuum tube containing at least one percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sodium fluoride (and an anticoagulant).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) While the specimen remains in full view of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee, the specimen shall be clearly labeled with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee's name and/or a unique identifying number and shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sealed with a tamperproof seal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The sample shall be handled in accordance with chain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of custody procedures from the point of collection through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis and secure storage at the laboratory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The sample shall be screened for alcohol only by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method reliable at a detection limit of not higher than .02  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent. Any presumptive positive shall be confirmed by gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chromatography with a suitable internal standard. The screening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> run shall include at least 10% quality control samples. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confirmation run shall include ethanol standards (including an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ethanol standard certified against or traceable to a primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard), at least one blank specimen, other appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volatiles (e.g., isopropanol), and at least one control purchased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercially or provided through an external quality control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. Results declared positive on confirmation shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with pre-established criteria for retention time of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> internal and external standards. Blood alcohol concentration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be reported only at values of .02 percent or greater within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the linear portion of the standard curve. Unconfirmed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presumptive positive results and values below .02 percent shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be reported as negative. Any quantitations to the third digit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be rounded downward to two digits (i.e., .238% to .23%).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The remaining portion of any specimen testing positive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be retained in secure frozen storage for at least one year,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the employee shall have the right to request a retest of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specimen at a competent independent laboratory within 60 days of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the date of the laboratory report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Test results shall be reported to the Medical Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Officer who shall review and act upon the results in the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner provided for drug urine testing in Subpart H of this part,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> except that fully quantitated results shall be made available to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the employer representative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If the blood test under this section is reported as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative, the breath test shall be deemed negative for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)(1) Under the circumstances set forth in &sect;219.301, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> railroad may require an employee to participate in a breath  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alcohol screening test solely for the purpose of determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether the conduct of a test meeting the criteria of paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) is indicated. If the screening test is negative within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaning of paragraph (b), the employee shall not be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit to further breath testing under this subpart. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screening test is positive, no consequence shall attach except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the employee may be removed from covered service for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period necessary to conduct a breath test meeting the criteria of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, the conduct of a screening test under paragraph (d)(1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section does not excuse full compliance with paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) of this section with respect to any breath test procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is then undertaken. If a screening test is positive, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following procedures govern:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) An initial breath test shall be conducted meeting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria of paragraph (a) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If that test is positive, a second breath test shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted meeting the criteria of paragraph (a) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The second test meeting the criteria of section (a) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section must be conducted at least 15 minutes after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positive screening test conducted under paragraph (d)(1) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section. However, since a waiting period of 15 minutes is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient to permit the dissipation of any alcohol in the mouth,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirement of paragraph (a)(5) of this section that there be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a period of at least 15 minutes between the two tests meeting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria of paragraph (a) of this section does not apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JOCKEY FINED $1,000; HE LOST TRACK OF HIS RACE  </P> <P> Jockey Jorge Chavez, who says he became confused during a race in which he gave  up a commanding lead, was fined $1,000 by New York Racing and Wagering Board  steward John Joyce for misjudging the distance of a race at Aqueduct.  </P> <P> Chavez was riding Westelm Stables' High Policy in sixth race Sunday, a $50,000,  2 1/4-mile race for 4-year olds and up on the inner track.  </P> <P> The race started at the head of the stretch and required horses to make more  than two circuits of the track, crossing the finish line three times. After  making one trip around the oval, Chavez began whipping his mount and opened a  lead of some 10 to 12 lengths approaching the finish line for the second time.  </P> <P> Apparently under the impression he had won easily, Chavez pulled his mount up  at the wire, while the rest of the field quickly caught up with High Policy. It  was only after surrendering his advantage that Chavez became aware of his  mistake and resumed riding High Policy the rest of the way.  </P> <P> High Policy finished second, beaten four lengths by the favorite, Dual  Elements.  </P> <P> "I was just confused. I thought it was over. I am very sorry. I've never in my  life done something like this. I'm very upset," Chavez said afterward.  </P> <P> It was not the first time that a New York rider erred so embarrassingly.  </P> <P> Jorge Velasquez made a virtually identical mistake during the running of the 2  1/4-mile Display Handicap on the same track in 1985. Velasquez was also fined  $1,000 for his mistake.  </P></p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Names step up campaign for compensation LEADERS of loss-making Names, individuals whose assets support the Lloyd's insurance market, are stepping up their campaign for compensation before a crucial vote this week on the admission of corporate members. A positive result by the 31,607 Names eligible to vote would trigger schemes by securities houses and banks to raise more than Pounds 1bn from institutional and retail investors. But opposition from Names who have borne the brunt of some Pounds 6bn in losses in the past five years could wreck the plans. Fewer than 2,000 Names are expected to attend Wednesday's extraordinary general meeting, but loss-makers, organised into 37 separate action groups, have been collecting proxy votes. Their leaders aim to use their voting power to speed a settlement of more than a dozen legal actions, and have threatened to veto the corporate capital plan if their demands are not met. On paper the dissidents appear to have at least a chance of securing the simple numerical majority needed to win the vote. Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names Association Working Party, has co-ordinated a vigorous campaign among the 17,000 action group members. Some 12,000 of the Lloyd's electorate are not underwriting, and are in the market through their membership of syndicates which have 'open years' (whose accounts cannot be closed because of uncertainty about future claims), or because they resigned less than three years ago. Many of these 'trapped' Names are embittered and seem to represent a natural constituency for the action group campaign. Yet recent experience has indicated that Names tend to be naturally conservative and despite their own problems resist calls for radical action. Names voted by a majority of 2-1 in favour of motions welcoming corporate capital after an earlier EGM during the summer, prompting the dissidents to lament that the loss-makers 'deserved all they got'. A year earlier, Names voted even more emphatically in favour of the Lloyd's Council, the market's governing body. Moreover, the market's management headed by Mr David Rowland, chairman, and Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, has a solid base of support. Some 5,000 working Names, who hold jobs at the market, are certain to vote for the council's plans, as will many of the 9,000 Names represented by the Association of Lloyd's Members. Lloyd's has won over the association by its promises of a settlement later this year via the loss-makers. Earlier this month Mr Neil Shaw, the industrialist who heads the ALM, urged Names not to send proxy votes to action group leaders. Mr Shaw said an independent report showed that the entry of corporate capital would not disadvantage individual Names. Many Names fear that voting down the corporate capital proposals outright would throw the market into chaos, ending hopes of attracting new investment and destroying its ability to fund a settlement. Mr Robert Hiscox, the deputy chairman of Lloyd's, who has worked closely on the corporate capital initiative, predicts that Names will simply lose their business if they reject the council's plans. 'Corporate capital has met underwriting at Lloyd's and likes what it sees,' Mr Hiscox said, pointing to the dozen or more investment trusts being formed by banks and securities houses. He predicts that if Names refuse to accept the plan, underwriters and corporate capital will simply join forces, effectively creating new insurance companies. He added: 'Many of the people who have been dancing together will just get married. There is absolutely no dobut about that.' Names deserted syndicates managed by the Merrett group this year, but Mr Steven Merrett, the group's chairman, seems to have had little difficulty in attracting new corporate investors to back his business. Marsh McLennan, the world's biggest insurance broker, JP Morgan, the investment bank, and Travellers, the US insurance company, are among the group's backers. Mr Rowland and Mr Middleton have said they will resign their positions if they lose the vote. Nor are they likely to look kindly on any move by Names to postpone a decision on Wednesday. With a queue of blue chip financiers seeing a positive vote by Names as a green light for their plans, they can ill afford to prevaricate.</p>

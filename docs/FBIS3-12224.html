			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Maryam M. Shahin] </F>   [Text] Amman--Political and community leaders reacted  vehemently Friday [25 February] to the massacre of over at least  60 Palestinians at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron and called on  Jordanians to observe three days of mourning and calling for an  end to peace negotiations with Israel on all fronts.    "We call on all Jordanians to let black flags fly over their  homes for three days and to abstain from working for a symbolic  1/4 of an hour Saturday in commemoration of the martyrs," read  the announcement distributed by the professional associations  and leftist, pan-Arab and Islamist political parties. The  groups announced that a march would be held Suunday at 14:40  from the professional unions building to the al-Hashimiyah  Square in downtown Amman to mark "the anger in our hearts and  our rejection of the peace process as it stands."    Leaders of political parties, popular unions and  organisations as well as members of Parliament and Palestinian  activists met Friday to declare their outrage at the massacre in  a heated atmosphere which brought tears to the eyes of many and  would-be fistifights on several occasions.    Less than an hour after news of the attack was broadcast.  representatives and members of Jordanian and Palestinian popular  unions and organisations marched from the professional  associations complex in al-Shmaysani to the Red Cross office  asking for international protection for Palestinians living  under Israeli occupation.    Almost simultaneously after the noon prayers demonstrations  broke out in several Palestinian refugee camps in greater Amman  and al- Baq'ah.    In the al-Baq'ah refugee camp, Lower Houser member Muhammad  'Uwaydah and Islamic Action Front representative Muhammad  Abu-Faris joined demonstrators in condemning the attack and  calling for an end to the peace process.    But the IAF was not the only group to call for an obrogation  of the peace process.    Wahid al-Ja'bari, president of the Khalil al-Rahman society,  also known as the Hebron Community Society, called on Palestine  Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to "resign  immediately." There should be an immediate vote of no  confidence for Yasir 'Arafat and anyone involved in the peace  negotiations." Mr. al-Ja'bari told fellow Hebronites gathered at  the society in a massive condolence ceremony for the relatives  of the victims of the massacre.    Mr. al-Ja'bari, a Hebron notable known for his close ties to  the Jordanian government rather than the PLO leadership, said  "all Palestinians should withdraw from the negotiations."    Mr. al-Ja'bari headed rows of Hebronites receiving  condolences from Jordanian government officials, foreign  diplomats as well as political party heads and leaders of  popular organisations, union and professional association heads.    Lower House of Parliament Speaker Tahir al-Masri visited the  society shortly after news of the massacre spread through Amman.  "The speaker gave us his condolences and expressed his outrage  at the massacre." Mr. al-Ja'bari said.    But not all visits by officials to the Khalil al-Rahman  Society were well received. Leading members of the PLO such as  'Abbas Zaki, acting speaker of the Palestine National Council  Salim al-Za'nun and FIDA representative in Amman Salih Ra'fat  were booed and Mr. Ra'fat was physically attacked during his  visit.    The three Palestinian officials were not held welcome  because  they represent the negotiators who are responsible for the  massacre. said one Hebronite. the three were rushed out of the  society under protection.    The attack on Mr. Ra'fat came after Lower House Member  Shaykh  'Abd-al-Mun'im Abu-Zant called for the "liquidation of the PLO  and the establishment of an Islamic leadership for the  Palestinian people."    A member of the Palestine Central Council, Mr. Ra'fat stood  up calling for "national unity in this time of mourning." A  member of the audience subsequently "got up and rushed towards  Mr. Ra'fat attempting to throw him on the ground," one observer  told the Jordan Times.    The attacker was taken away by other members of the audience  and expelled from the main hall of the society.    Nominal head of the IAF 'Abd-al-Rahman Khalifah brought many  members of the audience to tears with an eloquent speech in  which he referred to historic Muslim rights in Hebron and the  "humiliation of the all Muslims on this day."    "As our brethren kneeled at dawn to pray, they becaome  martyrs and we must join them in their jihad to regain the Bayt  al-Maqdis," said Shaykh Khalifah.    "It is our jihad against the "world Zionist conspiracy lead  by U.S. President Bill Clinton," said Mr. Khalifah.    "This proves once and for all that the peace negotiations  are  dead," added head of the IAF Executive Committee Ishaq al-Farhan.    Amman based Hamas officials Ibrahim Ghawshah and political  bureau members Musa Abu-Marzuq addressed audiences in the Khalil  al-Rahman Society and in the professional Associations complex.    But not all Palestinian parties which have operating offices  in Jordan blamed Friday's massacre on the PLO and the  negotiations. The Palestine People's Party, one of the three  party's along with the mainstream Fatah and FIDA to participate  in the peace talks, put the blame for the massacre firmly in the  Israeli camp.    "We hold the Israel government and security forces  responsible for Friday's massacre," said a statement by the  party.    The group called on a halt to negotiations till "settlers  are  disarmed and international protection is provided for  Palestinians under occupation. [no closing quotation marks as  published]    Participants in a meeting held at the professional  Associations complext called for the donation of one day's wages  to the families of persons killed or wounded in the massacre and  urged the organisation of a blood donation drive for the wounded.    The participants, who included representatives of political  and private organisations, also called for the secondment of a  medical delegation to the occupied territories to offer medical  assistance to the wounded and called for discussing the prospect  of bringing to Jordan wounded Palestinians to receive treatment  in Jordan.</p>

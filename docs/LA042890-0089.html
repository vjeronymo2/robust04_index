			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ LOSES BIG LEAD, BUT STILL WINS, 113-96  </P> <P> After being swept by the Golden State Warriors in the first round of the  playoffs last season and winning only five of its final 13 games this season,  the Utah Jazz's playoff opener against the Phoenix Suns Friday night was vital.  </P> <P> The Jazz won it, 113-96, before 12,616 at the Salt Palace, but it wasn't easy.  </P> <P> The Jazz, ahead by 21 points early in the fourth quarter, saw the Suns pull  within seven before putting together a late rally to get its first playoff  victory since the 1988 Western Conference semifinals against the Lakers.  </P> <P> Jazz players were very much aware of the pressure going into this series, the  first meeting between 50-game winners in the first round since 1974.  </P> <P> "Any game is so important to win in a playoff series," said Jazz guard Bobby  Hansen, who scored seven of his 16 points in the fourth quarter. "But after  last year's fiasco, this was especially sweet. It shows we can win in the  playoffs."  </P> <P> They can joke about it now. The atmosphere wouldn't have been so light with a  loss. Walls closing weigh too much.  </P> <P> The Suns have reason to be encouraged despite the loss. They were in the game  most of the way even with little contribution from point guard Kevin Johnson.  </P> <P> Johnson started, but the effects of flu soon wore on him. After nine minutes,  he was done, leaving for good with 8:37 remaining in the second quarter -- one  shot, five assists and three turnovers to his credit.  </P> <P> "He probably should have stayed in the hotel," Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons said.  "He wanted to play, and that's what he tried to do, but he couldn't. The first  couple of times he came out on his own and the last time he came out on me."  </P> <P> Wisely, Utah exploited the situation that left Greg Grant, who averaged 10.1  minutes in 35games during the regular season, in charge of the Phoenix offense.  </P> <P> The Jazz's half-court trap bothered the Suns, producing 16 points on turnovers  in the third quarter and sparking a 20-9 run in the final 6:35. That provided  an 83-67 advantage heading into the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> "We need to make a few adjustments for Sunday," Sun forward Tom Chambers said  of Game 2 in the best-of-five series, for which Johnson is expected to be  healthy. "But if the ball starts dropping, you'll be surprised at how few  adjustments are really needed."  </P> <P> They proved that in the fourth quarter with the Jazz ahead, 89-68, with 10:23  to play. With 5:45 left, after the first of three three-point baskets in the  fourth quarter by Mike McGee, the lead had been whittled to 93-83.  </P> <P> Finally, the Suns, who won three of four meetings from Utah during the season,  pulled to within 103-96, thanks to another three-point basket by McGee, the  former Laker who opened the season in Italy before joining Phoenix in late  March.  </P> <P> It wasn't a very good night for stars.  </P> <P> Utah's Karl Malone made only two of 10 shots in the first half before finishing  eight of 20 for 21 points and 11 rebounds.  </P> <P> Teammate Mark Eaton had three fouls by 6:28 of the second quarter, four as of  11:08 in the third, and played only 10 minutes.  </P> <P> "The game was so important to me that maybe I came out and rushed things at the  start," Malone said, another reminder of what this outing meant to the Jazz.  </P> <P> Chambers started by making three of 11 from the field, a big reason the Suns  shot just 38.1% in the first two quarters and trailed, 58-47, at halftime.  Chambers improved in the second half and ended the night five of 16 for 19  points.  </P> <P> John Stockton, though, played well. Utah's point guard had 17 assists and 16  points, though he made only one of seven shots in the third quarter operating  mostly against the 5-7 Grant.  </P></p>

They discussed the main issues of the Yugoslav crisis and the  situation in former Bosnia-Herzegovina.    President Milosevic stressed that the Serbian side has  complied with the European Union's [EU] demands to provide 33  percent of the territory [of Bosnia-Herzegovina] for the Muslim  republic. He also stressed that the signing of the peace  agreement between the warring sides in the region depends only  on the Muslim leadership in Sarajevo.    The Serb side in the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina  has not waged war for more than seven months now, and the  responsibility for the current armed provocations undoubtedly  lies with the Muslim leadership in Sarajevo. Therefore,  President Milosevic stressed, the threats of bombing the Serb  side are incomprehensible. They encourage the Muslim leadership  to prolong the war and avoid once more the signing of the peace  agreement, which undermines the efforts invested in the peace  process so far.    According to the assessment of the Republic of Serbia, it  would be much more useful for international factors to exert  pressure on the Muslim leadership to accept the peace plan for  former Bosnia-Herzegovina, whereby peace would be given  preference over war.    President Milosevic told Akashi that the Republic of Serbia  will continue helping to establish a just and lasting peace in  former Bosnia-Herzegovina, at the same time working on the  removal of one-sided assessments by international factors which  help the war-mongers among the Muslim leaders hold on to their  illusions that they will achieve their goals through war.    Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic also took part  in the talks.</p>

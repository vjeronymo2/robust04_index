			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Strong improvement at Kemira Kemira, the Finnish state-owned chemicals group, yesterday announced a strong improvement in interim pre-tax profits ahead of the international share issue which it launches next week. Profits before extraordinary items and taxes amounted to FM279m (Dollars 51.7m) in the first eight months, compared with FM153m in the same period in 1993. Cost-cutting, volume increases, and reduced financial expenses more than offset the impact of a stronger markka and low titanium dioxide prices. Kemira, Finland's eighth largest company by sales, will launch its share issue next Monday, the day after the Finnish voters are expected to approve EU membership in a national referendum. The move, part of an initial public offering, will cut state-ownership to as little as 71 per cent from 100 per cent in line with the government's plans to widen ownership in state-owned companies. Up to 35m shares will be offered, with indicative pricing in the range of FM37 to FM44 per share. Proceeds will be used to reduce net debt to FM6.4bn from FM7.9bn and lower gearing to 167 per cent from 321 per cent. The issue is being timed to reflect a cyclical upturn in many of the group's main businesses and its return to profit in 1993 after two years of losses. Kemira expects its 1994 figures to be 'significantly better' than last year when pre-tax profits before extraordinary items amounted to FM101m. Figures in the final four months would reflect higher titanium dioxide prices, it said. A 10 per cent strengthening in the markka reduced sales to FM7.98bn in the first eight months from FM8.18bn. Excluding currency factors, the figure was 4 per cent higher. Operating profit was 15 per cent higher at FM707m while financial expenses dropped to FM428m from FM460m. Kemira Agro, the group's biggest division, saw a 10 per cent drop in sales to FM3.64bn due to lower agrochemicals sales, the transfer of some businesses to the chemicals division, and the stronger markka. The division's operating profits were 25 per cent higher at FM226m. The best performance came from the chemicals division where sales were up 15 per cent and operating profits were 40 per cent higher. The unit benefited from strong demand from the pulp and paper and water treatment sectors. Net income after taxes dropped to FM167m from FM282m and income per share fell to FM2.48 from FM3.69. The fall reflects the change in the company's tax position following the full utilisation of tax losses carried forward in Finland.</p>

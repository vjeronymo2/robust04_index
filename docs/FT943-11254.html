			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Toubon vows to continue his war of words Mr Jacques Toubon, the French culture minister, yesterday vowed to continue his controversial campaign to protect the French language by restricting the use of foreign words despite the opposition of the Constitutional Council. The council, the official body that assesses whether new legislation is valid, this weekend stymied Mr Toubon's attempts at linguistic protectionism by concluding that he was not legally entitled to forbid the public from using certain words or phrases. The council based its decision on the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which dates from the 1789 French Revolution and states that 'The free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of man's most precious rights: each citizen should be able to speak, write and publish freely.' Mr Toubon, whose language campaign was greeted by general scorn earning him the nickname 'Mr Allgood' (English for 'Toubon'), said on French television that the council's ruling was simply 'a technical setback'. 'People may snigger and joke at Parisian dinner parties, but how many ordinary French people actually go to fashionable dinners?' he added. However Mr Toubon has been left with very little room for manoeuvre. Originally he had intended that foreign words should be replaced in all forms of public communication by the Gallic equivalents laid out in a special glossary of 3,000 French words. Following the council's ruling the use of this glossary will be limited to public sector organisations, advertising and broadcast media. The failure to use a suitable French word in public signs, advertisements and official correspondence is punishable with a fine of up to FFr50,000 (Pounds 6,000). But it will be left to the courts to decide whether the use of a foreign word is legally permissible, thereby making it very difficult to apply Mr Toubon's law in practice. The council's decision has been received with relief in France. Scorn for his language law has been only one source of criticism of Mr Toubon, whose 18-month career as arts minister has been clouded by unflattering comparisons with that of his popular Socialist predecessor, Mr Jack Lang. Mr Toubon's proposals, which form part of a general campaign of cultural chauvinism including his anti-Hollywood lobby at last autumn's Gatt negotiations and recent proposals to impose 'French music quotas' on radio stations, were ridiculed in the media. Mr Toubon even faced the ignominy on his recent birthday of hearing the guests at an official ceremony serenade him with a chorus of 'Happy Birthday Mr Allgood'. Le Journal du Dimanche, the popular Sunday paper, cheerfully hailed the council's ruling as 'saying 'OK' to 'travelling', 'corner' and co]'. An editorial in today's edition of Le Monde concluded 'Good sense has triumphed'.</p>

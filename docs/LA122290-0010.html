			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SERIES ON PRESS AND MINORITIES  </P> <P> A recent case (of selective journalism) is the lack of coverage of the Screen  Actors Guild's presentation of the "Annual Career Achievement Award" on Dec. 9  to the prominent black actor Brock Peters. The 70,000 members of SAG honored  Peters for his acting and humanitarian achievements during his lengthy career.  I assume that other stories such as the one about abandoned cats in Oceanside  left little room.  </P> <P> MICHAEL J. HOEVEL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / International Company News: Codan in talks with Baltica CODAN, the Danish insurer controlled by Sun Alliance of the UK, is understood to be in discussion with Baltica, the country's biggest insurer, for the acquisition of all or part of Baltica's insurance operations. Shares in Baltica Holding and Baltica Insurance were suspended on Friday, when the board said that new negotiations for a long-term solution to the group's financial situation were taking place. It is understood that the acquisition by Codan is one of the options under consideration. Analysts estimate the price for Baltica's insurance operations at between DKr6bn and DKr10bn (Dollars 1.6bn). Baltica acquired a DKr3.5bn tax-loss deduction when it bought the former state-controlled life assurance and pension group Statsanstalten (subsequently renamed Danica) from the government three years ago. Large losses, however, have prevented Baltica from making use of the tax-loss deduction, which could be of interest to Codan, the most profitable of the larger Danish insurers. The major shareholders in Baltica Holding are France's Suez group, the Danish ATP national pension fund, the mutual fire insurer Kobstaedernes Almindelige Brandforsikring, and Hafnia, Baltica's domestic rival which suspended payments last August.</p>

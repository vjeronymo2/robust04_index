			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Former Ohio Rep. James V. Stanton dropped out of the contest for the  chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee and endorsed the candidacy of  front runner Ron Brown, a Washington attorney and former aide to the Rev. Jesse  Jackson. This leaves only one other rival to Brown for the party post, former  Oklahoma Rep. James R. Jones. Brown virtually locked up the post when Michigan  Democratic Party Chairman Richard Wiener withdrew and endorsed Brown. Brown and  Wiener were regarded as the two leading contenders for the post, which will be  filled by the national committee on Feb. 10. Paul G. Kirk Jr., party chairman  since 1985, declined to seek another four-year term.  </P></p>

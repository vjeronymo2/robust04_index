			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS;  </P> <P> SLOOP CLOSES IN ON 135-YEAR RECORD  </P> <P> Thursday's Child, a sloop on pace to smash the 135-year New York-San Francisco  sailing record, entered Southern California waters today with not far to go.  </P> <P> The modern three-man, 60-foot racing yacht was seeking to beat the record of 89  days and eight hours for the 14,500-mile journey around treacherous Cape Horn  at the tip of South America. Set in 1854 by the legendary three-masted clipper  ship Flying Cloud, it is the oldest existing speed record.  </P> <P> Thursday's Child reached the latitude of San Diego early today and was on  target to enter San Francisco's Golden Gate on Friday or early Saturday. The  vessel left New York Nov. 23 and has only to reach San Francisco by 2 a.m. on  Feb. 21 to break the record.  </P></p>

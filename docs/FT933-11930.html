			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Motor World improves Profits of Motor World Group, the car parts and accessories retailer floated on the stock market in February, rose from Pounds 956,000 to Pounds 1.46m pre-tax for the half year ended May 2. Sales rose 13 per cent to Pounds 18.7m in spite of a 'difficult economic climate'. On a pro-forma basis profits before tax rose by 12 per cent to Pounds 1.67m (Pounds 1.49m). Reduced interest charges of Pounds 263,000 (Pounds 608,000) reflected the flotation proceeds. Directors said full benefit of lower borrowings would become more apparent in the second half through lower interest costs. Earnings were 12p (22.2p), or 8.1p (7.3p) pro-forma. The interim dividend is 2.3p.</p>

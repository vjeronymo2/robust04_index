			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Price war worries hit Bass A DOWNGRADE and bearish comment from broker Nomura knocked Bass, shares in the brewery group retreating 14 to 548p on heavy turnover of 1.7m. Nomura lopped Pounds 35m from its full-year forecast to Pounds 495m and warned that the brewing industry was on the verge of a damaging price war as the leading protagonists sought to protect market share. Analyst Mr Ron Littleboy believes the cost of such a policy will mean that Bass will have to make further exceptional charges of Pounds 25m above the Pounds 50m already pencilled into most City forecasts. He said: 'Bass is clearly signalling that it will do everything needed to maintain its position in a shrinking drinks market. We have the makings of an extreme price war between the big five, with no one prepared to lose market share.' He added that he expected the volatile situation to last into the medium term, keeping selected brewery shares under pressure, in particular Scottish and Newcastle, off 6 yesterday at 416p. Lucas volatile Shares in aerospace and automotive components group Lucas Industries had a volatile session in heavy turnover of 6.4m, making one of the day's most heavily traded stocks. The shares jumped 10 to 100p early in the day, with the market relieved by a maintained final dividend of 4.9p against earlier fears of a cut, and profits of Pounds 22.5m (Pounds 82.8m) ahead of the predicted figure of Pounds 20m. The market was also pleased with restructuring plans at the company. Lucas said it hoped to report a covered maintained dividend for the current year, although Mr Sandy Morris at County NatWest warned: 'It is going to be another difficult year, mainly due to the weak European car market, so I still think the dividend is at risk.' He predicted full-year profits of Pounds 41.5m. Mr John Goldschmidt at Charterhouse Tilney was 'on balance more optimistic' on the outlook for the company and predicted current-year profits of Pounds 60m. Recent bid speculation surrounding Lucas continued to circulate and some analysts likened their meeting with the company yesterday to a defence meeting. Profit-takers moved in during the afternoon, causing the shares to surrender some earlier gains. They closed 4 up at 94p, on high turnover of 6.4m. Rank reversal Adverse press comment and rumours of further disposals sent Rank Organisation tumbling, although turnover was below average. The press comment reiterated market nervousness over Rank's large debt and brought back whispers of the possibility of a rights issue. There were also strong suggestions that Rank had put its Odeon cinema chain and film distribution company up for sale. Bears in the market described the alleged move as a fire sale brought about by Rank's inability to sell its hotel chain, which has been on the market for several months. Ms Lisa Gordon at County NatWest said: 'This just points to the plight of the company in having to try and sell its way out of debt. The problem for Rank is that there are no buyers.' However, Mr Peter Hilliar at BZW was more supportive of the stock, arguing that there had been no new trading news on Rank and that the bearish sentiment had been overdone. The shares fell 14 to 507p. Shares in defence and motor cars group Vickers tumbled on news that it had lost out on a Dollars 1bn Kuwaiti order for its Challenger 2 tank to General Dynamics of the US. The shares gave up 7 to 83p in early trading on the news and steadied mid-session before again retreating, with turnover reaching 1.2m by the close. The news was not a surprise to the City as reports of the tank's underper-formance in recent trials in the Middle East have been circulating, and have been a factor in underperformance of the stock. Lasmo received a push from consideration of a Hoare Govett re-evaluation. Hoare has published a note arguing for an average sterling exchange rate of Dollars 1.56 next year. The house says that, on that figure, Lasmo would have an asset value of 185p per share and be at a 20 per cent yield premium to the market on a maintained dividend covered by earnings. Lasmo firmed 2 1/2 to 167p. Shares in Kwik Save leapt 19 to 693p on hopeful speculation that the recent interest by Hongkong Land in Trafalgar House might rub off on the supermarket group. Jardine Matheson, which has a 33 per cent stake in Hongkong Land, also has a large share in Dairy Farm, which in turn holds some 25 per cent in Kwik Save. Early talk had Dairy Farm increasing its stake to the allowable limit of 29.9 per cent. Lloyds Bank showed signs of slippage as the market absorbed a sell recommendation from Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken. The house argued that the shares were overvalued and on 'a higher rating than its competitors, which is not justified by its performance. We estimate this overvaluation to be of the order of Pounds 1 a share.' Lloyds closed 4 firmer at 450p. TV group Carlton Communications performed well with the help of a buy recommendation from SG Warburg Securities. Carlton rose 8 to 668p. Interest ahead of interim figures today, and a buy recommendation, saw Mirror Group jump 7 to 65p. There is a broad consensus among financial analysts who predict profits of between Pounds 8m and Pounds 18m. However, there is a general feeling that, because of the lack of credibility surrounding the former publisher, Mr Robert Maxwell, estimates were lower than necessary. Agency Broker James Capel is looking for Pounds 13m and has put the stock firmly back on its buy list. Bathroom supplier Spring Ram saw heavy turnover as one house traded blocks of 3.4m and 4.3m shares at 128p and 129p respectively. The shares eased 3 to 129p on turnover of nearly 9m, the heaviest in the London market. Caution surrounding a health conference in California was said to have contributed to weakness in Wellcome, which fell 9 to 963p. The anti-infectives conference is today expected to discuss prospects for 3TC, an Aids drug being developed for rival Glaxo. Glaxo hopes 3TC will emerge from clinical trials as the first commercially successful alternative to Wellcome's Retrovir. Changes to indices Two new indices in the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices are published in today's FT.

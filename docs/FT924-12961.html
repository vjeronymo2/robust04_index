			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Food and Drink: An Australian alternative OLD BLOCK Shiraz may not be the only wine to be marketed as a bargain alternative to Penfolds Grange, Australia's famously rich red 'first growth', but it will almost certainly be the most successful. It is the brainchild of larger-than-life Bob McLean who was trained first at Reckitt &amp; Colman's South Australian wine operation Orlando (they who siphon off Jacob's Creek), before moving uphill to Petaluma, the archetypal Australian 'boutique' winery now in the throes of a public flotation. In 1988 he bought in to the then moribund Barossa Valley winery St Hallett, determined to make Old Block Shiraz its flagship. Not content with St Hallett's original Old Block, he started buying up every parcel of grapes fromancient Shiraz vine stumps that could be wrested from Penfolds' grasp, so that Old Block may now come from as many as 20 different old Barossa vineyards and counts its production in thousands rather than hundreds of cases. These vines may be anything from 82 to 145 years old (although heaven knows who keeps those vineyard records of 1847), producing almost uneconomically small lots of exceptionally concentrated wines that are aged, separately, in American oak casks just like Grange. The result is a deep, almost porty red of unashamedly broad Barossa characteristics - like a softer, very slightly lighter Grange. The promisingly hefty 1990 vintage is expected in the UK any day now while the exciting 1989 vintage is still in circulation for under Pounds 9 at the Australian Wine Centre, London WC2; Adnams of Southwold; Ben Ellis of Surrey; Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester; and Winecellars of London SW18. The pre-McLean 1987 tastes gorgeous now and suggests that this is a wine that, despite its come-hither appeal in youth, is worth keeping well past its fifth birthday. Other Barossa Shirazes made to the same Grange-like specifications somewhere midway between Hermitage and young port include Charles Melton's Nine Popes (which includes the Grenache grape, like Chateauneuf-du-Pape - geddit?) and Rockford Basket Press, also sold at around Pounds 8 by Adnams of Southwold, as well as Peter Lehmann Shiraz and Penfolds' own bargain imitation of Grange, Kalimna Bin 28, both widely available for well under Pounds 6. The sensational 1986 vintage of Grange sells for just under Pounds 30 a bottle.</p>

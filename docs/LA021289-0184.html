			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STERN SAYS RELATIONSHIP WITH STERLING 'INTERESTING'  </P> <P> In his five years as commissioner of the National Basketball Assn., David Stern  has probably dealt with Donald T. Sterling of the Clippers more than any other  owner, although their time together does not appear to have bred mutual  understanding.  </P> <P> Take, for example, Sterling's recollection of the Clippers' season-opening  party at his Beverly Hills home in November, which Stern attended while on a  West Coast swing that also included presenting the Lakers their championship  rings and attending the first game at Sacramento's new Arco Arena.  </P> <P> "(Stern) likes the celebrities, he likes the music people, he likes the movie  stars," Sterling said in December. "He liked the sponsors and he loved the  media. So it was a wonderful day.  </P> <P> "It was such a wonderful day that when it was over, he called his wife and  said, 'You've got to come over. It's fun. It's not like Miami and it's not like  Philadelphia and it's not like Sacramento.' "  </P> <P> True story?  </P> <P> "Absolutely not," Stern replies without hesitation.  </P> <P> Then he laughs.  </P> <P> "No," he says again. "He's the best. Oh, gosh, Donald."  </P> <P> This isn't the first time Stern has had to contradict a potentially  embarrassing statement by Sterling, either.  </P> <P> "I think he's a fascinating person who is absolutely determined to make the  Clippers a success in Los Angeles," Stern said of Sterling.  </P> <P> But how do Sterling's comments affect his role?  </P> <P> Stern paused.  </P> <P> "He makes it interesting," the commissioner said.

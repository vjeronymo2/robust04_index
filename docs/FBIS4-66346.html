			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pei Jianfeng: ``IBM to Invest in Data Network''] </F>   [Text] International Business Machines (IBM) will invest at  least $100 million in information technology projects in China,  the U.S. computer giant announced yesterday in Beijing. This  will include being the first foreign company to be involved in  the country's top information infrastructure project. ``It is a  major step in relations between IBM and China and will be  beneficial to both sides,'' said IBM Vice-President Robert M.  Stephenson.    The deals come under a memorandum of understanding signed  last Thursday in the U.S. between Big Blue and the Ministry of  Electronics Industry during Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua's  visit.    The first project will set up a joint venture in Beijing  with  Jitong Communications Company, which oversees the Three Golden  Projects, China's information infrastructure plan. The massive  project aims to set up economic information networks across the  country covering banking, customs and inter-governmental  exchanges. The joint venture will produce networking  technologies to support the plan.    In the first phase, it will help design and install regional  communications networks and link them into a national system,  said Robert M. Savage, Chairman of IBM China Company Ltd. He  said IBM will pump several million dollars into the venture,  which will be finalized in 6 weeks. More importantly, the  company will bring in experts from its system integration  divisions in the U.S. and Europe, he said.    IBM has been named as consultant to the project as well as  other technology proposals by the Ministry of Electronics  Industry. Under the memorandum of understanding, IBM will  establish a wholly-owned software development centre in Shanghai  to develop system and application programmes for the domestic  and foreign markets, Stephenson said. It will also set up three  open system networking centres in Beijing, Shanghai and  Guangzhou.    In return, China pledged to use IBM's PowerPC platform as  one  of the major microprocessors in planning the country's future.  PowerPC, a chip jointly developed by IBM, Apple and Motorola,  seeks to break Intel's world monopoly on the computer.</p>

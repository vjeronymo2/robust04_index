			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Smith calls for summer offensive MR JOHN SMITH called on the shadow cabinet yesterday to dedicate the summer recess to exploiting the growing unease among Conservative backbench MPs over the gloomy economic outlook. Chairing the first meeting of his new frontbench team, the Labour leader urged colleagues to use every opportunity to call the government to account for 'sitting on their hands' as unemployment rises. The strategy is clearly intended to play on Tory fears. This week several MPs warned that Mr Norman Lamont's chancellorship might be vulnerable if there was no sign of an upturn by the autumn. Mr Smith also attacked the failure of Mr John Major, the prime minister, to use Britain's presidency of the European Community to seek co-ordinated action on jobs and interest rates with its EC partners. Mr Smith's attack stopped short, however, of pressing for a revaluation of the D-Mark in the EC's exchange rate mechanism - a move which he had hinted during the Labour leadership election might win his backing. Instead, the opposition leader stressed the need to tackle unemployment and the fear of unemployment, which he said was sapping confidence and undermining investment.</p>

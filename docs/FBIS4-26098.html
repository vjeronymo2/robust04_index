			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Sun Yong (1327 0516); Beijing XINHUA Domestic </F> Service in Chinese at 1503 GMT on 16 June transmits a service  message replacing the following item]    [Text] Beijing, 16 Jun (XINHUA) -- A meeting to mark the  70th founding anniversary of the Huangpu [Whampoa] Military  Academy and the 10th anniversary of the Huangpu Military Academy  Alumni Association took place at the Great Hall of the People  this afternoon.    Li Peng, Hu Jintao, Qian Qichen, Zhang Zhen, Qin Jiwei,  Cheng  Siyuan, Li Peiyao, Yang Rudai, Wang Zhaoguo, Ngapoi Ngawang  Jigmei, Sepydin Aza, Hong Xuezhi, Wan Guoquan and others  attended the commemorations, or had their pictures taken with  representatives of the military academy's alumni prior to the  commemorations.    Li Ruihuan addressed the meeting. He began his speech by  extending the CPC Central Committee's warm greetings and sincere  regards to the alumni and to the academy's teachers and cadets  at home and abroad. Li Ruihuan said: Huangpu Military Academy  was founded 70 years ago by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and Chinese  communists represented by Zhou Enlai. Now 70 years have gone by  and the Chinese people led by the CPC and Comrade Mao Zedong  have accomplished the democratic revolution, which Dr. Sun  Yat-sen did not accomplish, and developed this revolution into a  socialist revolution. Achieving our motherland's peaceful  reunification accords with the will of the people, it is what  our nation wants, and it is also a sacred mission for Chinese  people of all nationalities, including our countrymen in Taiwan.  I hope Huangpu alumni on the two sides of the strait will unite  and contribute more to our motherland's reunification and  China's revitalization. (full text of the speech will be  transmitted separately)    Addressing the commemoration, Li Moan, vice president of the  Huangpu Military Academy Alumni Association, said: In the past  we joined the whole nation in fighting the big powers and  eliminating the warlords. Earthshaking changes have now taken  place in our great motherland, and people throughout the country  are advancing triumphantly under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Since its founding 10 years ago, the Huangpu  Military Academy Alumni Association has been making unswerving  efforts to foster the academy's spirit, establish ties with  alumni, promote the motherland's reunification, and to dedicate  itself to revitalizing China. Our association has already  established contacts with nearly 1,000 alumni in Taiwan as well  as alumni in more than 10 countries and regions. When  contacting alumni in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, and overseas  areas, our association has seized every opportunity to expound  the nation's policy toward Taiwan -- a policy characterized by  "peaceful reunification; and one country, two systems." We have  also done many things useful for the introduction of capital,  technology, and proficient personnel; and for promoting the  development of relations and exchanges between the two sides of  the strait.    Zhou Lejun, a Huangpu alumnus from Taiwan, also addressed  the  occasion. He said: The meritorious services which Huangpu  alumni performed during the eastern and northern expeditions and  the War of Resistance Against Japan have gone down in history.  We are pleased to note the exchanges between alumni on the two  sides of the strait today. We should broaden our vision and, as  brothers, we should by no means be engaged in quarrel. We are  absolutely against separation; and even more so are we against  intervention by foreign forces and the obstruction of our great  motherland's reunification. I hope Huangpu alumni will work hard  together so that the great cause of reunification can be  achieved at an early date.    The commemoration meeting was called by the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee.  Ye Xuanping, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee,  chaired the meeting, which was attended by Huangpu alumni at  home and from abroad and people of all walks of life in Beijing  -- more than 500 in total.    In the evening, the CPPCC National Committee and the CPC  Central Committee United Front Department hosted a banquet at  the Great Hall of the People to mark the 70th founding  anniversary of the Huangpu Military Academy and the 10th  anniversary of the Huangpu Military Academy Alumni Association.  Wang Zhaoguo delivered a toast at the banquet.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pak Tae-sok from Beijing] </F>   [Text] Diplomatic sources in Beijing have stated that last  week North Korean President Kim Il-song expressed the wish to  visit the United States. This is a sign of an important change  indicating that North Korea would no longer use the nuclear  program as a nuclear card and that it would concentrate  diplomatic efforts on resolving its economic problems.    The diplomatic sources said that the current North Korean  economic situation is more serious than the nuclear issue, and  that North Korea would therefore accept, in any form, the  comprehensive nuclear inspections [kwangbomwihan haeksachal]  required by the international community during next month in  accordance with the statement issued by president of the UN  Security Council.    They also said that China and North Korea had held meetings  -- official or unofficial -- in New York, Beijing, and Vienna  regarding the nuclear issue and that they had in-depth  discussions to discuss North Korea's economic opening after the  settlement of the nuclear issue.    They predict that Kim Il-song will visit Beijing soon  because  the North Korean leadership, including Kim Il-song, actively  supported China's economic opening during the successive visits  to Pyongyang by members of the Political Bureau of the CPC and  envoys of China's Liberation Army since July last year, and  because Kim Il-song stressed trade development in his New Year's  address.</p>

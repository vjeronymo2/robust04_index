			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (34): Seeker of excellence - Profile: Shanghai International Securities Company MODERN China is the land of the slogan, writes Simon Holberton. Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, is famous for his 'seek truth from facts'. The Shanghai International Securities Company (SISCO) hopes to be famous by putting into practice management guru Tom Peters' slogan 'in search of excellence'. SISCO is one of the largest securities companies in China and dominates the market in Shanghai. Owned by a clutch of pension funds and industrial companies, it produces about half of all the new issues coming to the Shanghai market and is responsible, it claims, for more than 10 per cent of the market's daily turnover. The company has also expanded into Hong Kong where it, and its mainland partners, control two listed companies. Says Mr Xu Qing Xiong, the company's chairman: 'SISCO is two years older than the stock exchange. At first we were dealers in government securities but with the listing of shares our business shifted to the trading of stocks. As the Shanghai exchange has expanded our company has developed very quickly.' Indeed it has. The company's fifth birthday, in May this year, was a time for celebration. In the 1992 calendar year, SISCO's balance sheet - according to mainland accounting standards - had more than quadrupled to Yn2.5bn from Yn600m at the end of the previous year. Profits before tax were Yn73.6m, compared with Yn12. bn This growth has funded SISCO's expansion throughout China and Hong Kong. The company now employs 1,000 and it has 17 branches in Shanghai, 20 branches in other cities across China and further 16 agents. It is waiting for approval to set up another 13 branches. Hong Kong has also become an important base of the company. Mr Xu spent five years in the colony and knows it well. SISCO teamed up with local tycoon Mr Li Ka-shing to acquire Public International (subsequently renamed First Shanghai) earlier this year. It has also bought control of Ong Holdings which it has renamed Shanghai Hong Kong International Securities and will concentrate on securities dealing. Mr Xu says it is important to develop SISCO's business in Hong Kong as well as Shanghai. In China's bifurcated securities market - where mainland investors can only trade A shares and foreign investors only trade B shares - a presence in Hong Kong enables SISCO to participate in both markets, he says.</p>

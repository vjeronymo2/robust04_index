			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / International Company News: Gemex launches big stock issue GRUPO Embotellador de Mexico (Gemex), the biggest bottler of PepsiCo beverages in terms of volume outside the US, is to offer 1.6m shares in a primary offering in Mexico and 2.4m shares in a secondary placement, Reuter reports from Mexico City. The group also plans to issue 1.6m American depositary shares, equivalent to 3.2m shares, and 2.4m global depositary shares, equivalent to 4.8m shares, in international markets. It is estimated that Gemex will raise around 190bn pesos (Dollars 61.3m) through the offering. According to the prospectus, Gemex will apply the proceeds of the offering to either expansion and capital investment or to debt reduction. The prospectus suggested that Gemex might extend the franchises it already holds or enter into joint deals with PepsiCo, although the company stressed there was no guarantee such deals would be struck with the US soft drinks group.</p>

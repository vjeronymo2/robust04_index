			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE SENATE OKS BILL TO SHIELD DRUG MAKERS IN LIABILITY SUITS  </P> <P> The state Senate on Thursday narrowly passed fiercely contested legislation to  exempt pharmaceutical manufacturers from paying punitive damages to a consumer  injured by federally approved medication.  </P> <P> Proponents argued such a shield is necessary to encourage drug makers to invest  in the development of new, life-saving medications without the chilling threat  of having to face "harassing" lawsuits.  </P> <P> Because of lawsuits seeking punitive damages for injuries caused by medications  and medical devices, argued Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia), there are "drugs and  devices not being marketed today, and this is being paid for by lost lives."  </P> <P> But opponents -- supported by Ralph Nader, the Consumers Union, California  Trial Lawyers Assn. and a variety of women's groups -- mounted a heavy attack  against the bill, declaring that the highly profitable pharmaceutical industry,  like other manufacturers, must be responsible for the safety of its products.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Stamps Out' Punitive Relief  </P> <P> Senate opponents of the bill noted that punitive damages in product liability  cases are seldom awarded but do provide a deterrent against the marketing and  sales of unsafe medications. Punitive damages are awarded as a punishment in  lawsuits apart from actual damages.  </P> <P> "This bill stamps out the only form of (punitive) relief that injured, maimed  people have in this society," said Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (Ind.-San Francisco), a  trial attorney.  </P> <P> After a heated consumer vs. manufacturer floor fight, the bill went to an  uncertain future in the Assembly on a 22-12 vote, one more than the simple  majority required in the 40-member Senate. The votes crossed usual ideological  lines, pitting conservative against conservative and liberal against liberal.  </P> <P> The bill was sponsored by the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assn., a generous  source of election campaign contributions to legislators.  </P> <P> Essentially, the legislation would immunize drug and medical device producers  from paying punitive damages for injuries their products cause if the products  have won approval of the federal Food and Drug Administration.  </P> <P> However, drug manufacturers could be liable for punitive damages if it was  demonstrated that they knowingly withheld or misrepresented safety information  submitted to the FDA. In such cases, they still would be liable for  compensatory damages as they are now, including payment for pain and suffering.  </P> <P> Keene, the usually liberal Democratic floor leader and author of the bill,  noted that "risks are associated with new technology" that may save hundreds of  thousands of lives. But he insisted that payment of "excessive" punitive  damages in product liability cases siphons away funds "and prevents the early  marketing of products designed to save lives."  </P> <P> However, liberal Sens. Nicholas C. Petris (D-Oakland) and Bill Lockyer  (D-Hayward) warned against putting great trust in the FDA. They cited a list of  highly publicized cases over the years in which products received FDA approval  but were later determined to have caused deaths or serious injuries.  </P> <P> These included DES, the drug some women took about 30 years ago to prevent  miscarriages; the Dalkon Shield, a women's contraceptive device; Zomax, a  painkiller; Oraflex, an arthritis medication, and ultra-absorbent tampons.  </P> <P> In some cases, Petris said, the manufacturers continued marketing the products  or "unloading" them to Third World countries even after companies notified the  FDA of adverse reactions to the products.  </P> <P> "This industry is being presented as the kindly benefactor of mankind," Petris  boomed out. "That is not true."  </P> <P> Sen. John Doolittle of Rocklin, the Republican caucus chairman who  unflinchingly sides with business on virtually every issue, cast a surprising  "no" vote on the bill, saying that he had an unspecified "personal" reason for  doing so.  </P> <P> "There (are) tremendous, enormous amounts of money in this industry," he told  the Senate. "Sometimes, greed gets the best of people. Punitive damages act as  a disincentive to this type of behavior."  </P></p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Interest rates Bank shares have usefully outperformed the stock market since UK monetary policy was liberated from the ERM. Accordingly it is clearly of concern to investors if the current campaign against wider lending margins - a traditional accompaniment to falling interest rates - is sustained. Bank and building society balance sheets may be in desperate need of repair at the moment, but both types of institution are unusually sensitive to public criticism. Plenty of criticisms can be levelled at the banks at the moment but making excessive profits is surely not one of them. A strong banking system, after all, is a prerequisite for a strong recovery. The idea that lenders should reduce their rates exactly in line with base rates is in any case somewhat simplistic. Admittedly the endowment effect may not be what it was, given the fewer number of interest-free current accounts; the banks will presumably also have anticipated the impact of falling rates on their free capital by offsetting measures such as buying gilts. Nevertheless, as businesses themselves they are entitled to be mindful of their overall return on equity. It could be that pressure to lower some lending rates - such as those on credit cards and unsecured borrowing - is successful. But on one front - competition from building societies - there may be some relief. Mortgage lenders such as the Halifax and Abbey National may appear to have been largely unscathed by recession in the housing market. However with the volume of bad debts expected to jump from Pounds 1.2bn in 1991 to perhaps Pounds 2bn this year, and with the cushion of mortgage guarantee insurance virtually used up, societies are vulnerable to another downward lurch in house prices. They too are anxious to widen margins, just in case.</p>

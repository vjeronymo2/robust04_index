			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Light Rail Systems (6): Revival of interest in North America - Cities that left their old rail systems in situ are now applauded by planners LIGHT RAIL systems are undergoing a revival in north America as many big cities try to battle gridlocked streets and automotive pollution - decades after they tore out their tram lines in favour cars, buses and highways. Los Angeles, Sacramento, Dallas, Austin, Baltimore and Miami are among the US cities in various stages of planning or constructing new light rail systems. This surge of interest in light rail public transport reflects growing congestion in the cities and increasing legislation to limit automobile-related air pollution. Los Angeles, with some of the nation's most congested streets and most polluted air, is spending Dollars 150bn on a 30-year public transportation project. When it is completed, Los Angeles's mass transit rail network will be second only to New York's. The first completed portion of the project - a 'Blue line' light rail service between Long Beach and downtown Los Angeles - has been running for more than a year. The Los Angeles transportation commission says the number of daily riders greatly exceeds its first year forecasts. The commission had expected 10,000 riders a day, but the figure is closer to 35,000. Cities that left their light rail systems in situ are now being applauded by city planners for that decision. The streetcar system in Toronto is considered by many to be a model of how light rail can work effectively as part of an integrated public transportation system. The city's first street car route was inaugurated 120 years ago on Younge Street. The early, horse-drawn streetcars carried 55,000 passengers a day by 1891. During the 1960s, Toronto, like many other north American cities, had a programme to phase out streetcars. Some were eliminated, but the full programme was never implemented and by the early 1970s a decision was made to leave the remaining system in place. According to Mr Ian Kingston, an engineer at the Toronto Transportation Commission (TTC), streetcars have a bigger capacity than buses, making them a preferable means of public transportation on some routes. Speed is also an advantage for streetcars operating on private right-of-ways  -'but speed is more limited on streets with mixed traffic,' he says. Indeed, the main disadvantage of streetcars are their inability to drive around accidents and traffic jams. Advocates of streetcars often point to Portland, Oregon, as a model city. In Portland, streetcars have the right of way on city street. Drivers can over-ride street lights using a mechanical control to change the lights. According to the TTC, about 568,000 passengers travel on Toronto's subway every day, while about 900,000 passengers use surface transportation. The city does not break out the number of tram riders but the TTC runs 260 street cars which can carry up to 208 passengers apiece. About 22 of these cars date to the 1930s and were recently restored by TTC staff. The city hopes that the older, period cars will attract tourists to the system. In Toronto, the streetcar is just one leg of the city's integrated transportation system. There are ten streetcar routes covering 47 miles of route or about 94 miles of track, since each route needs two way tracks. 'In many cases people use the streetcars at the start or end of their trips as they travel to and from the subway,' says a TTC spokesman. The city, which has long abandoned its plans to abolish the system, is now looking at the next generation of streetcars which will have a low floor so that passengers won't have to climb up three steps. Putting in new systems, however, is considerably more difficult than up-grading an existing network. Controversy surrounds virtually any effort in the US to build new public transport systems. The problems begin at the Federal level, with funding for mass transit currently at the centre of a political budget battle. President George Bush's budget proposal would cut funding for surface transportation that was allocated in a recently-passed bill. The proposal is meeting opposition from several public transit authorities. On the local level, new transport systems have become the focus of debate over urban planning and state funding. In Los Angeles, for example, plans for one leg of the city's light rail system became a lightening rod for mounting anti-Japanese sentiments fueled by frustrations over rising unemployment and the trade imbalance between the US and Japan. The city recently scrapped a Dollars 128m contract for driverless cars with Sumitomo of Japan, largely because of US/Japanese trade tensions. And there is also the problem of weaning travellers from their cars. In San Francisco, for example, extra bus, ferry and train services were introduced in the wake of the 1989 earthquake which damaged some of the region's major freeways. But commuters are now back in their cars and public transport services are being scaled down to pre-earthquake levels. Even Los Angeles's successful Blue line does not carry enough passengers to make a serious dent in traffic or pollution. But as Los Angeles and other cities press ahead with their transport plans, light rail systems will become an increasingly important part of public transportation in the US in 1990s.</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Crisis in Moscow haunts the Continent BOURSES subsided yesterday afternoon, following an unfounded claim in Moscow that armed troops had entered the Kremlin, and a distinct lack of enthusiasm for equities on Wall Street, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT shelved interest rate prospects for worries about Russia, and uncertainty about the outcome of talks between Bonn and the regional German states on the financial aspects of a solidarity pact. The DAX index ended 10.26 lower at 1,707.14, still 1.4 per cent higher on the week. Turnover fell from DM7.6bn to DM6.8bn. Among blue chips, VW rose DM3.60 to an official DM292.80 close on news that GM's purchasing chief, Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortura, is joining VW. Mr Lopez, a tough cost-cutter, would likely to help VW improve profit margins, dealers said. VW lost DM5.70 after hours. Daimler dipped on the news of lower 1992 profits, closing at DM623 and ending the afternoon a net DM10.70 down on the day at DM66.50. PARIS struggled throughout the day, the decline accelerating as Wall Street opened. The CAC-40 index closed 23.70 down at 1,965.18 after a high of 1,980 and a low of 1,957, as turnover remained static at FFr2.6bn. In the absence of fresh corporate news, activity was concentrated on the big blue-chip stocks: among financials Suez, leading the actives, dipped FFr5.20 to FFr314.70, Societe Generale FFr6 to FFr638 and Paribas FFr11.10 to FFr416. Credit Lyonnais CI's slipped FFr15 to FFr520 after the chairman estimated that the bank's 1992 results were the worst for 20 years. In the car sector Peugeot lost FFr2 to FFr567, having been a little stronger on Thursday following Renault's better than expected results. Valeo eased FFr10 to FFr785. AMSTERDAM retreated with a fall in the CBS Tendency index of 1.6 to 104.2, down 2.3 per cent on the week. Prices were generally depressed with even ABN Amro losing Fl 1.20 to Fl 53.80 after reporting a satisfactory 9.6 per cent rise in net profit. VNU declined Fl 3.20 to Fl 104.20 after confirming that it was holding talks with another Dutch company over a possible partnership in its printing operations. Commenting on this move, NatWest Securities in London said that while some investors may have been disappointed that VNU had not found an outright buyer for the division, long-term prospects remained positive. MILAN remained weak ahead of Monday's end of the March account with a 6.46 fall in the Comit index to 514.24, down nearly 4 per cent on the week. The construction sector built on Thursday's losses after a parliamentary committee blocked a government decree which would have allowed public works projects, halted because of the current political corruption scandals, to have proceeded. Cogefar Impresit fell L40 to L2,690 and Grasseto lost L550 to L6,400. Sip, the telecommunications group, eased just L2 to L1,654 as investors showed little reaction to its L850bn rights issue. BRUSSELS engaged in profit-taking after a moderately active session with the steel stocks, Arbed and Clabecq, the main centre of attention. The Bel-20 index closed 7.23 lower at 1,238.75, up 1.5 per cent on the week. The Luxembourg-based Arbed closed BFr250, or 8.3 per cent lower at BFr2,750 and Clabecq dropped BFr48, or 12.6 per cent to BFr332. STOCKHOLM was weaker as the country's own political crisis remained unresolved. The Affarsvarlden general index lost 13.5 to 1,012.5, a fall of 1.8 per cent on the week as turnover fell to SKr635m from SKr845m. Volvo lost SKr14 in the B shares to SKr380 after its disappointing results on Thursday. ZURICH tumbled on the Russian news, the SMI index closing 37.2, or 1.7 per cent lower on the day at 2,164.4, a fraction lower on the week. After gains in cyclicals earlier in the week, Brown Boveri was the most active stock of the day, the bearers falling SFr50 to SFr4,020, but Nestle bearers fared worse with a decline of SFr40 to SFr1,130. HELSINKI reacted to Thursday's downgrading of its foreign currency debt rating by S &amp; P with a fall in the HEX index of 14.9 to 1,006.2. Turnover was some FM306m. The bank index lost 2.7 per cent while forestry shares were 2.2 per cent lower. VIENNA fell in line with neighbouring markets and the ATX index closed down 2.50 at 936.23, the lowest level for two weeks. Austrian Airlines put on Sch10 to Sch1,600 on reports of planned closer co-operation with SAS, KLM and Swissair. ISTANBUL rebounded by 1.8 per cent after a two-day fall of 4.7 per cent, the market index closing 102.44 higher at 5,757.02. Traders said that next Wednesday's TL26,500bn of bond maturities were expected to flood Turkish financial markets with cash after two weeks of shortage.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- March 12                                           THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes            Open       10.30      11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1160.62    1159.51    1158.83    1156.80 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1224.39    1223.06    1222.52    1221.13  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1157.06    1151.41    1145.91    1145.86 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1221.20    1216.37    1212.09    1212.44  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Mar 11    Mar 10    Mar 9     Mar 8     Mar 5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1163.60   1167.52   1164.26   1165.04   1159.70 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1232.53   1231.98   1230.72   1229.32   1225.29  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1160.62 ; 200 -  1224.82 Low/day: 100 -  1144.91  200 -  1210.29 .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

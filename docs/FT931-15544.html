			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts ease at long end on funding worries UK GOVERNMENT bonds lost three-quarters of a point at the long end as funding worries dominated the gilt market yesterday. Dealers expect the Bank of England to announce details of a gilt auction shortly, with the 8 1/2 per cent gilt due 2007 emerging as the expected auction stock. The 15-year gilt is already fairly liquid, with about Pounds 3bn of existing stock. However, there is already an overhang of gilts as the Bank of England announced a Pounds 1bn tranche of 7 1/4 per cent stock due 1998 at the end of last month, and dealers estimate between half and a quarter of that has been sold. The market took little cheer from weekend press reports which suggested the government was unlikely to raise taxes in order to cut the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement. 'The gilt market would like to see a hike in taxes to reduce the PSBR', said Mr John Kendall, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds. Economists forecast the Bank of England will have to issue about Pounds 50bn of gilts in 1993-94. The Liffe gilt future, which closed on Friday at 100.20, fell to a low of 99.24 before ending the day at around 99.28. In the cash market, the 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 dropped from 119 7/8 to 119 to yield 8.85 per cent. THE Swedish bond market suffered from a crisis of confidence yesterday. Mr Bengt Dennis, the central bank governor was quoted at the weekend as saying there would be no interest rate cuts in the foreseeable future. Yesterday's budget announcement did little to reassure traders. The 1992-93 budget estimate of close to SKr200bn is widely believed to be over-optimistic. Finally, at yesterday's auction of SKr3bn of 2001 bonds and 1999 bonds, there were insufficient bids to cover the amount of 2001 bonds on offer. Ten-year bond yields rose 14 basis points to 10.27 per cent, as the yield curve steepened further. With a new 16-year bond due to be auctioned on January 26, the market is becoming increasingly nervous, according to Jouni Kokko, an international economist at S. G. Warburg. GERMAN government bonds slid a  1/4 -point on fears that the recent rally had been exaggerated. The bond market has already discounted substantial German rate cuts and traders are becoming rather nervous that, if these interest rate reductions do not start to materialise, there will be little to underpin the market at current levels. However, the poor state of the German economy continues to fuel hopes that the discount rate will be cut soon, following last week's trimming of the German repo rate. THE French bond market suffered from a bout of profit taking, losing a 1/4  point following gains last week. Uncertainty over the currency and the general election in March have undermined confidence in the market following last week's rally, traders said. US Treasury prices posted modest gains across the maturity range yesterday as investors kept a nervous eye on developments in the Middle East. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 5/32 at 101 29/32 , yielding 7.458 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was also slightly firmer, up  3/32 at 100 11/32 , to yield 4.423 per cent. Trading was described as cautious by dealers, with investors apparently encouraged by the market's rebound from last week's heavy losses, but concerned about the crisis in the Middle East, where Iraq continued to challenge the US and its allies. Prices were also constrained by supply issues, with new corporate, municipal and federal government debt weighing heavily on the market.</p>

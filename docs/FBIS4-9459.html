			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 23 April (MTI) -- The Chairman of the  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], Ivan Peto, and the Chairman  of the Federation of Young Democrats [FIDESZ], Viktor Orban,  agree that the current government coalition will be overthrown  following the parliamentary elections in May.    They said the main question of the elections will be whether  the citizens will want to replace the coalition with the  socialist, or with the liberal parties.    Both chairmen have high hopes that the four-party liberal  bloc (SZDSZ, FIDESZ, Entrepreneurs Party, and the Agrarian  Federation) will score good results in the elections. However,  while Orban would, in the interest of an election victory, be  ready to state that the liberal parties would only govern  together, Peto did not consider this justified.    According to the SZDSZ chairman, a government should  definitely be formed to replace the current one following the  elections, as otherwise new elections would have to be  announced, and this would mean that the Hungarian Democratic  Forum-led government would continue to lead the country until  January.    Peto also denied that the SZDSZ is holding any kind of  coalition coordination talks with the Hungarian Socialist Party  [MSZP].    The evaluation of the Socialist Party was one of the main  issues of the remarks made by the two politicians at the  national meeting of liberal groups in Budapest.    Orban again excluded cooperation between the FIDESZ and the  MSZP, partly because, in is view, the change in generation has  not taken place within the MSZP.</p>

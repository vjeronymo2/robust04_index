			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AGOURA HILLS MAN HELD AFTER HIGH-SPEED CHASE  </P> <P> An Agoura Hills man led sheriff's deputies, California Highway Patrol officers  and two police helicopters on a wild, hourlong chase that ended when the man  rammed his car into a patrol car after he had been cornered on a dead-end  street, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said.  </P> <P> Robert Carlton Webb, 29, was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly  weapon -- his car -- on a police officer, reckless driving, drunk driving and  evading arrest, Deputy Dan Cox said Friday. Webb was jailed at the department's  Malibu station in lieu of $8,000 bail.  </P> <P> The chase started about 9 p.m. Thursday near Reyes Adobe Road in Agoura Hills  when deputies spotted a car speeding on the Ventura Freeway at more than 100  m.p.h., Cox said.  </P> <P> For 62 minutes, the car weaved through Agoura Hills, Thousand Oaks, Westlake  Village, Woodland Hills and Calabasas before entering a dead-end road in  Topanga Canyon, police said. Trapped, the driver shifted his car into reverse  and rammed a sheriff's patrol car, damaging the front end.  </P> <P> Webb got out of the car and swung at one of the deputies, Cox said. Webb was  subdued, handcuffed and taken to the sheriff's station in Malibu.  </P></p>

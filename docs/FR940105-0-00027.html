			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In Order No. 636, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Commission created a new operating environment for interstate pipelines and shippers on those pipelines by requiring pipelines to unbundle the sale of gas from the transportation of that gas and by introducing a mechanism permitting shippers to trade unneeded capacity through Electronic Bulletin Boards (EBBs) maintained by the pipelines. Because shippers will now be transporting gas over multiple pipelines, the Commission concluded that the development of uniform standards covering the content of, and methods for accessing, information relating to transportation would improve the efficiency of gas movement across the interstate pipeline grid. To begin the process of developing the needed standards, the Commission directed its staff to convene a series of informal conferences with all facets of the gas industry to consider standards relating to capacity allocation. As a result of these conferences, the industry reached consensus agreements on the information about available capacity that should be included on EBBs and the procedures and protocols for making that information available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Pipeline Service Obligations and Revisions to Regulations Governing Self-Implementing Transportation; and Regulation of Natural Gas Pipelines After Partial Wellhead Decontrol, 57 FR 13267 (Apr. 16, 1992), III FERC Stats. &amp; Regs.

Aug. 13, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is adopting a final rule reflecting the consensus agreements reached by the industry. The rule amends the Commission's open access regulations by requiring pipelines to provide standardized information about the availability of service on their systems. This information will be provided both on the pipelines' EBBs and through files which users can download from the pipelines' computers to their own computers. The rule further requires pipelines to provide this information according to standardized procedures and protocols, which will be maintained in a document entitled ``Standardized Data Sets and Communication Protocols'' that can be obtained at the Commission. Pipelines must implement the requirements of this rule by June 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also recognizes the standards and protocols it is adopting will need to be updated as more experience with capacity release and the transportation environment under Order No. 636 is obtained. The Commission, therefore, is proposing to continue the industry conferences to consider and propose modifications when needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Reporting Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission estimates the public burden for the information requirement under this final rule_including the one-time start-up burden related to pipeline EBBs_will average 6,770 hours per company. The burden estimate includes the time required to review and implement the standards, develop the necessary software, search existing data sources, gather and maintain the data needed, create/validate common and proprietary codes/information and complete and review the information. The information/data elements required to be maintained on pipeline EBBs will be under a new information requirement, FERC&hyph;549(B), Gas Pipeline Rates: Capacity Release Information. The annual burden associated with the new FERC&hyph;549(B) information requirement will be 528,060 hours based on the estimated initial EBB development burden and daily EBB informational updates by an anticipated 78 pipeline respondents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Included in the annual burden estimate are 40,560 hours (520 hours per company) attributable to the creation of common/proprietary codes to identify pipelines and common transaction points. The codification requirements were not part of the burden estimates contained in the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) issued July 29, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the final rule contains new information and EBB requirements, many of which are one-time start-up activities, it is anticipated that FERC&hyph;549(B) burden will be reduced by 2,250 hours per respondent (for a total reduction of 175,500 hours for all respondents) the year following the implementation of the EBB systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Arkla Energy Resources Company and Mississippi River Transmission Corporation state that providing comments on the burden estimate in the NOPR is difficult until final resolution of EBB issues. Interstate Natural Gas Association of American states the burden estimate in the NOPR is reasonable for the items included in the proposed rule, but would be too low if additional items, such as common codes are included. No party has submitted contrary data on a revised burden estimate for the requirements proposed in the NOPR. The only significant change from the NOPR is the requirement to create a common code data base and the Commission has revised its estimate to include the additional burden of this effort. Accordingly, the Commission finds its burden estimates reasonable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons may send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of this information requirement, including suggestions for reductions of the burden, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415, FAX (202) 208&hyph;2425]; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503 [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON  </P> <P> A transient arrested Tuesday for allegedly courting women and then conning them  out of money and property will be arraigned this week, police said.  </P> <P> Nicholas Martinelli, 50, is being held in San Diego County Jail on suspicion of  burglary and grand theft. Bail has been set at $200,000, a jail spokeswoman  said.  </P> <P> Martinelli, also known as Raymond Harry Stone or Richard Stone, was arrested on  Broadway Street in El Cajon by detectives from the San Diego and El Cajon  police departments.  </P> <P> Martinelli allegedly befriended women between 30 and 50 years old and  eventually moved in with them, said San Diego police spokesman Bill Robinson.  He then asked them to wire money -- sometimes as much as $2,500 -- to a false  address in Indiana, where he said his relatives owned property and needed a  loan.  </P> <P> After the women complied, he would allegedly intercept the wire without their  knowledge and steal the money, Robinson said.  </P> <P> Police believe the alleged con-man used this method to dupe at least four East  County women, Robinson said.  </P> <P> San Diego and El Cajon detectives are still searching for other women who may  have been victimized, Robinson said. They also are seeking information about  what appears to be a hotel key recovered from Martinelli.  </P> <P> The key is marked with the number 305 in red plastic, but that number had been  covered by tape with the number 405 written on it, Robinson said. Police  believe the room may be the site of property allegedly stolen by Martinelli.  </P></p>

Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada told a press  conference Japan welcomes the fact that U.S. Congressman William  Richardson was able to meet Suu Kyi as the first nonfamily  member to do so since her house arrest in 1989.    Terada quoted Richardson as saying Suu Kyi expressed a wish  to hold high-level talks with SLORC and that the first secretary  of SLORC also hinted at the possibility of such talks.    "We naturally hope to see the dialogue take place and that  it  will be a step forward for an early solution of problems,  including the release of Aung San Suu Kyi," he said.    But he referred to a press briefing by SLORC on Tuesday in  which it said Suu Kyi will be detained until next year, and said  the Japanese Government would "regret this very much" if such is  the case.    Richardson, a Democrat from New Mexico, met Suu Kyi on  February 14 and 15.    Suu Kyi, leader of the National League for Democracy which  won the national general election in May 1990, has been confined  at her house in Yangon [Rangoon] since July 1989.</p>

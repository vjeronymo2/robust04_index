			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH-DEFINITION TV RACE WON BY MATSUSHITA  </P> <P> Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., the world's largest consumer electronics  firm, announced Thursday that it won the race to market the world's first  high-definition television.  </P> <P> The Osaka-based company, which sells TVs under the Panasonic name, said its  36-inch HDTV would cost 4.5 million yen ($34,900) and go on sale in Japan next  month.  </P> <P> "Realistically, we can't expect to sell very many. You could buy a luxury car  for the same money," a spokesman said.  </P> <P> Matsushita aims for monthly sales of only 50 sets.  </P> <P> The announcement was more of a public relations than a technical coup for  Matsushita. Archrival Sony Corp., Hitachi Ltd., NEC Corp. and other Japanese  firms have all developed HDTV equipment and are selling it to professionals.  </P> <P> The companies have recently unveiled a variety of HDTV consumer products and  prototypes, including screens, videocassette recorders and adapters for  conventional sets.  </P> <P> But no company has sold a stand-alone set combining an HDTV tuner and screen,  the Matsushita spokesman said.  </P> <P> HDTV, which delivers sharper and wider images than conventional TV, is expected  to be one of the most lucrative high-technology products of the next two  decades.  </P> <P> To help raise awareness and stoke demand, the public Japan Broadcasting Corp.  began daily one-hour HDTV broadcasts.  </P></p>

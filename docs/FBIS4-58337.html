			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Hasan Fathi: "Distancing the Palestinians </F> from Proximity to Israel"]    [Text] It appears that the way is being paved for the  final compromise in the Middle East; and efforts are being made  to remove obstacles in the path of peace and tranquillity for  these regimes. Even though it is too early to venture anything  on the final compromise among the regional countries, there is  evidence of conditions being prepared for peace and amity.    For many years Egypt and Jordan have moved away from the  orbit of rivalry and struggle against the Zionists. Lebanon was  forced to oppose Israel, because of its emulation of Syria and  the dynamic activities of Hizballah. Beirut will only play the  tune of opposition to the Zionists for as long as Syria wants it  to, and the duration of its struggle and the military operations  of the Islamic Resistance in southern Lebanon will be governed  by this same logic.    Certain steps are being taken by Beirut and Damascus that  indicate that the way is being paved for normalization of  conditions in a region which had been uncontrollable and  unbridled as regards anti-Zionist activities. From time to  time, it is announced at special junctures that Warren  Christopher is going to visit the Middle East. At the same  time, Jordan has banned Hamas' activities and Yitzhaq Rabin has  assigned two military and foreign policy teams to assess ways  and means for the withdrawal of the Zionist regime's forces from  the Golan Heights.    Certain events are taking place in Lebanon which are in  keeping with the developments in Lebanon and Syria. Orders have  been issued for the arrest and impeachment of 44 Hizballah  members who staged an armed march on Jerusalem Day, and the Army  has begun disarming Palestinian groups in the south.    The Lebanese foreign minister has openly announced that an  international plan is being studied under which the Palestinians  in Lebanon would be relocated to the affluent Arab countries.  Faris Buwayz told the newspaper AL-SHIRA' that the Palestinians  in Egypt, Jordan, and Syria would be given permanent residence  in these countries, but 20 percent of the Palestinians in  Lebanon would return to Palestine, while the remainder would be  transferred to the vast and opulent Arab countries.    The plan unveiled by the Lebanese foreign minister was, in a  way, implemented even in 1982, but in those days there was no  possibility of a compromise and 'Arafat and the PLO had not  adopted the path of peace and friendship. In that year Israel  attacked Lebanon on the pretext of crushing the Palestinian  guerrillas and had advanced up to Beirut. The Zionists embarked  on a massacre of the Palestinians in the camps of Sabra and  Shatila and only withdrew on condition that the Palestinian  guerrillas led by PLO be expelled. It was then that 'Arafat and  his group of Palestinian guerrillas left Lebanon.    The present plan revealed by the Lebanese foreign minister  is  aimed at distancing the Palestinians from the borders of  occupied Palestine. Those Palestinians who reside in Lebanon  are mainly opposed to 'Arafat and are guerrillas who infiltrate  into the occupied territories. They carry out suicide missions;  therefore removing them from the borders of the occupied  territories is tantamount to closing southern Lebanon's borders  to the revolutionary Palestinians.    The reining in of the Hizballah, the expulsion of the  Palestinians in southern Lebanon, the ban on Hamas in Jordan,  the change in the Israeli stance on withdrawal from the Golan  Heights and, ultimately, Christopher's visit to the region and  the resumption of the peace talks, are all factors which  indicate a gradual change in the peace trend. This will be  complete when Damascus gives the green light to the United  States and Israel by announcing its acquiescence to the peace  process. This will sweep out all opposition; and the opponents  to this process will thus be consigned to the blade of the  guillotine. [preceding word in English].</p>

			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Russia and Ukraine fail to agree on Soviet debt RUSSIA and Ukraine have failed to reach an agreement on the former Soviet Union's foreign debt. After a meeting led by their prime ministers in Moscow on Friday the two Slav countries appear further apart then ever. Their failure may jeopardise the recent initiative by G7 leaders to cobble together an aid package to bolster Russian President Boris Yeltsin's beleaguered government. However, Ukrainian officials claimed a breakthrough on energy prices and supply, saying that, for the first time, Russia had agreed 'in principle' to take into account transit fees for goods imported and exported through Ukraine. However, the prime ministers' meeting, promoted as the forum at which the escalating economic conflict between the neighbours would be resolved, did not produce a single specific agreement and was overshadowed by the power struggle being waged a few blocks away in the Russian parliament. Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy prime minister, said he would seek a return to a temporary accord according to which Russia would assume the management of the foreign debt but a final resolution of the division of the debts and assets would be postponed. BAT Industries, the leading British tobacco company, yesterday acquired a majority stake in Ukraine's largest tobacco factories. The Prylucky tobacco factory, 125km east of Kiev, produces nearly a fifth of Ukraine's total cigarette output and is one of the most coveted prizes in the fierce battle between western tobacco companies for a share in the Ukrainian cigarette industry. BAT will control 65 per cent of the new A/T BAT- Prylucky Tobacco Company, and the management and workers of the Prylucky plant will initially hold 35 per cent. This is part of a wider trend in the industry to compensate for declining smoking in the west.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Airline talks The exploratory chat between the UK and US governments over liberalisation of their bilateral aviation agreement produced much tough talk. But given the industry's highly-politicised nature, consumers should not start planning for bargain flights across the Atlantic just yet. In framing its position, the UK government will doubtless listen carefully to the views of British Airways. But BA faces a tricky calculation as to whether it stands to gain more from greater access to the US market than it would lose from higher US penetration at Heathrow. Large concessions from the UK government may also infuriate investors. Many bought shares in BA on the basis of its privatisation prospectus which suggested few changes to the regulatory regime. It would be ironic indeed if BA's American shareholders, who account for more than a quarter of the company's equity, were to sue the UK government for giving US carriers more landing slots at Heathrow.</p>

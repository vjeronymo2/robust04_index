			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Acceptable 'audit' of charities Sir, As a small charity, we do not feel 'under attack' by the new Home Office report on the voluntary sector (Leader, October 13). Any contribution to an evolving understanding of the role and effectiveness of the sector should be welcomed, not least when this has engaged the time, energies and insights of dozens of researchers and hundreds of voluntary organisations. We would, however, caution against at least one aspect of the report. While there should be no objection to the principle of performance assessment, this process should directly voice the views of the intended beneficiaries. The aptly named 'social audit' we recently piloted with the fair trading company Traidcraft offers one way to do this (Accountancy column, August 26). The process engages key constituents who may have no formal, executive authority, but on whose behalf actions are being taken (and money obtained). They set the performance indicators by which the organisation's social or ethical record is audited, with the results published alongside the annual accounts. This, and aspects of the Home Office report, both hopefully contribute to a process which enables the voluntary sector to maintain the standards of innovation, flexible organisation and accountability to which it aspires. Simon Zadek, New Economics Foundation, Universal House, 88-94 Wentworth Street, London E1 7SA</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. PANEL TO REVIEW PLANS FOR DRILLING OFF CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA  </P> <P> The White House, moving forward on a major environmental front, Tuesday  established a task force to review plans to drill for oil off the California  and Florida coasts.  </P> <P> The panel, to be headed by Interior Secretary Manuel J. Lujan, is to "examine  in detail the concerns over adverse impacts" of Lease Sale 91 off Northern  California, Lease Sale 95 off Southern California, and Lease Sale 116 off  southern Florida.  </P> <P> The announcement by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater confirmed that the  panel had been broadened to include the chiefs of the Environmental Protection  Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or their  designees. Their omission from earlier discussions of the task force had  angered environmentalists.  </P> <P> The announcement also served as a rejoinder to critics within the  Administration, who earlier this month accused the White House of moving slowly  on the offshore drilling issue.  </P> <P> The review, promised by President Bush in an address to Congress in January,  represents a significant reconsideration of the Reagan Administration's plans  to broaden the scope of offshore drilling on outer continental shelves.  </P> <P> A leading opponent of offshore drilling, Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey),  welcomed the White House action, saying that he hopes it will mark "the first  step in the development of a sensible policy on this very difficult issue."  </P> <P> Fitzwater made clear, however, that the President remains "committed to  continued outer continental shelf oil and gas development in an environmentally  sound manner.  </P> <P> "The President feels that oil and gas development of America's offshore areas  is necessary to ensure a reliable supply of energy and provide for the nation's  economic and national security," Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> The task force is to report its findings to Bush by Jan. 1, 1990.  </P></p>

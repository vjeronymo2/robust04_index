			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Offshoot sale lifts Tilbury Douglas TILBURY DOUGLAS, the construction group, lifted interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.98m to Pounds 12.8m, with the help of a Pounds 6.78m profit on the sale of a subsidiary. The shares were unchanged at 595p. Mr Michael Bottjer, chief executive, said trading conditions remained difficult in the first half although there were now signs of a slow recovery in the UK. The group is 'avidly' searching for acquisitions, he said, and has net cash of Pounds 14.4m - up from Pounds 4.83m a year earlier and Pounds 6.94m in the 1992 balance sheet - following the sale of Douglas Concrete and Aggregates in May for Pounds 14.7m, which gave a net cash benefit of Pounds 10.8m. Mr Bottjer said work in hand in the construction division was about the same as a year ago, although there had been an increase in the proportion coming from overseas from 3 per cent to 12 per cent. Margins were better in places such as the Middle and Far East than in the UK, he said, and the group aims to increase further the proportion of its overseas work. In the UK, he saw little sign of recovery in mainstream contracting until towards the end of 1994. However, some specialist areas, such as heavy electrical contracting and process engineering were good. Others, such as interior contracting, largely for the big retail groups, and piling and foundation work, both of which had suffered in the first half, were now enjoying a busy period. The group's Scottish housebuilding business had a good first quarter. Although business dropped off in the second quarter, it had revived again since the end of June. Group turnover was down 11 per cent at Pounds 169.3m, with that from continuing operations down a similar percentage at Pounds 166.2m. Pre-interest profits from continuing operations fell 34 per cent to Pounds 3.33m, with Douglas Concrete contributing Pounds 505,000 (Pounds 352,000). Associates made Pounds 248,000 (Pounds 28,000). Interest received rose from Pounds 1.56m to Pounds 1.94m. Earnings per share, boosted by the Douglas Concrete sale, rose from 13.9p to 26.9p. The interim dividend is maintained at 10.5p.</p>

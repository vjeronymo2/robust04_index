			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Xerox settles lawsuit for Dollars 225m Xerox, the US document processing company, is reported to have agreed to a Dollars 225m settlement of an anti-trust lawsuit which alleged that it suppressed competition in the market for high volume copiers. Lawyers for plaintiffs said the company would issue Dollars 225m of certificates which could be used to buy Xerox products. The plaintiffs, who include customers and independent service organisations (ISO), complained that Xerox refused to give the ISOs access to parts and software, allowing the company to overcharge for equipment, parts and service.</p>

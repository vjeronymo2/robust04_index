			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed NN/NB/GA: "Conference on Stability in </F> Europe -- Flavio Cotti Advocates Stability Pact"]    [Excerpts] Paris, 26 May (ATS) -- Federal Counselor Flavio  Cotti expressed his support for a stability pact in Europe on  Thursday [26 May] in Paris. During his address at the  conference on stability in Europe, the head of the Federal  Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAE) also reported that Bern was  willing to contribute to the development of such a pact. He  added that Switzerland was ready to meet any request to that end.    Flavio Cotti was satisfied that the initiative of France and  the European Union did not aim at "introducing new standards and  new regulations on the issues of minorities and borders.  Besides, it initiates a process that will progressively  contribute to the rapprochement of the peoples living on the  continent." [passage omitted]    The federal counselor eventually said that Switzerland was  ready to actively participate in any initiative launched within  the framework of the stability pact. Mr. Cotti told the press  that he was aware that the problems of the minorities in Central  Europe could not be solved overnight.</p>

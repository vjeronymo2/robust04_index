Most heated debates took place at a meeting of the  inter-regional association of independent deputies which was  also attended by deputies who represent some Russian constituent  republics and autonomous entities. The speakers stressed that  independent deputies elected in individual constituencies who  are not bound by any pledges to political parties, blocs and  movements and who realise their responsibility before their  voters, the constitution and Russia believe that "integration  and coordination of efforts are necessary for real work of the  State Duma."    The participants in the meeting discussed ways to reach the  goals set by their joint declaration adopted on January 5. In  the declaration they expressed their determination to build  their activities in the State Duma on the basis of  "parliamentary freedom and responsibility, common sense,  political realism, pragmatism, and respect for opinions and  positions of other factions and groups." They plan to nominate  their own candidate to the post of the chairman of the State  Duma as their first step in this direction.    The deputies called on their colleagues elected in  individual  constituencies to join their efforts for the benefit of all  peoples of Russia.    The commission for the procedural regulations of the State  Duma and the deputy status discussed key questions the solution  of which should ensure the effective work of the parliament.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling The currency markets gave a nasty hint yesterday of what could happen if government support really starts crumbling in the opinion polls. Sterling fell below DM2.87 at one stage, even though the German currency was again lower against the dollar. The risk has resurfaced of a vicious circle with sterling weakening on political worries which are then compounded because of the government's inability to cut interest rates. It matters little that the bogeymen appear to be the white socks brigade in the City rather than foreign investors, who are much less frightened by Labour than they were in the 1970s. The chancellor must be feeling even more boxed in as he puts the final touches to next week's Budget.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Latin America Debt Crisis: IMF's craving for role satisfied  -Ten years ago next month the Latin American debt crisis broke - and threw the world financial system into turmoil. On these pages writers who followed the story for the Financial Times from the outset analyse how the crisis was handled. And they pose the question: Is there life after debt? IT IS an ill wind that blows no one any good. The debt crisis was, indeed, an ill wind: between 1982 and 1990 consumption per head fell at an average annual rate of 0.3 per cent in the World Bank's list of 15 'severely indebted middle-income countries'. Yet the crisis also blew some good. It transformed policy in many indebted countries, mostly for the better, and gave international financial institutions, particularly the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, new tasks. For the World Bank this was hardly necessary: long-term development is task enough. For the IMF, however, the debt crisis was a godsend. Having lost its empire in the collapse of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates in the early 1970s, the IMF had been consistently searching for a role. A series of unpleasant surprises - the twin oil shocks of the 1970s and the debt crisis - gave the institution the role it craved. The Fund became the principal interlocutor on macro-economic policy between the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, on the one hand, and developing countries on the other. It is, however, an agent rather than a principal. The central decisions  - the initial response to the Mexican crisis in the summer of 1982 and then the Baker and subsequent Brady plans - were taken by policy-makers of the G7. But the IMF, assisted by the World Bank, has played a valuable role: giving its seal of approval to policy changes in debtor countries; bringing together creditors and debtors; cajoling creditors; and, in the end, helping to underpin the comprehensive debt reduction packages agreed under the Brady Plan. While the IMF focuses on macro-economic policies, resolution of the debt crisis required more than macroeconomic policy change. In all countries that have resolved their debt problems, structural reform has been essential: reform of institutions, reform of trade policies, and reform of tax systems. This is why the World Bank's view - articulated in the structural adjustment lending that has reached a quarter of total World Bank lending - has been as important as the work of the IMF.</p>

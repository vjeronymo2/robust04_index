			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Company News This Week: A spoonful of cream in Unigate forecasts - Other Companies When Unigate reports annual profits tomorrow, the growth rate is expected to exceed that of arch-rival Northern Foods' modest increase announced last Wednesday. Forecasts for Unigate suggest a rise of about Pounds 10m from the Pounds 97.9m, excluding exceptionals, recorded in 1993. But the gain is more a reflection of Unigate's greater recovery from a lower base and the restructuring of activities it has been pursuing since the arrival of Mr Ross Buckland as chief executive in 1990. Another dividend increase is expected.</p>

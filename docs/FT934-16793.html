			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Brussels tries to calm French audiovisual concerns THE European Commission told France yesterday it would justify with clear and detailed proposals its strategy of including Europe's film and broadcasting industry in the Uruguay Round negotiations on world trade reform. At a meeting of EC foreign ministers in Luxembourg, France, supported by Spain, argued for taking the audiovisual sector out of the negotiations, conducted under the aegis of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Backed by intellectuals across the EC, Paris maintains that Europe's cultural identity would be submerged by US television and films if audiovisual trade were liberalised to an extent which prevented governments from protecting and subsidising national cultural output. Though marked by continuing confrontation between Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's chief trade negotiator, and Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, yesterday's meeting successfully reduced intra-EC tension over the Round's farm trade chapter. France has threatened to veto any world trade accord unless it wins more concessions for its farmers. Almost all discussion centred on other areas of the Round, on which Sir Leon reported 'a certain amount of progress' ahead of the December 15 deadline for conclusion. On steel, services, textiles and aircraft manufacture, ministers were able to feel satisfied either that progress was being made, or that the EC was pursuing a robust and constructive line, in alliance with other Gatt signatories. The Commission also put forward detailed proposals to halve the time it takes to conduct anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations against imports deemed to have an unfair advantage inside the EC. These could take some of the heat out of another French demand that the EC arm itself with a trade defence arsenal at least equivalent to the US '301' laws, which allows Washington to impose unilateral sanctions against partners it considers are breaking the rules. But the sharpest exchanges were over the audiovisual issue and US 'cultural imperialism' - despite the irony that participants and press at the meeting spent much of yesterday watching the events in Moscow unfold through the CNN news channel. Sir Leon has opposed French demands to keep the sector out of the Uruguay Round, arguing that it would prosper more within Gatt rules, so long as 'cultural specificity' allowing some protection were achieved. He promised 'very definite and detailed proposals which would enable us to continue our obligations internationally. . . . and give real protection to the sector'. Mr Juppe said he remained to be convinced, and offered French-speaking Quebec in Canada as an example of why culture had to be kept out of trade agreements.</p>

None of its members have any U.S. production, nor do any of them have U.S. subsidiaries. They organize a cartel for the purpose of raising the price for the product in question. Rather than selling directly into the United States, however, the cartel sells to an intermediary outside the United States, which they know will resell the product in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The jurisdictional analysis would change slightly from the one presented in Example A, because not only is the conduct being challenged entered into by cartelists in a foreign country, but it is also initially implemented through a sale made in a foreign country. Despite the different test, however, the outcome would remain the same. The existence of the intermediary would trigger the application of the FTAIA because the conduct would not involve import commerce within the meaning of the FTAIA and the Agencies would have to determine whether the challenged conduct had ``direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable effects'' on U.S. domestic or import commerce. Furthermore, in keeping with the Supreme Court's admonition in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Summit Health, Ltd. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Pinhas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , 111 S. Ct. 1842, 1847 (1991), the Agencies would focus on the potential harm that would ensue if the conspiracy were successful, not on whether the alleged unlawful conduct itself had the prohibited effect upon interstate or foreign commerce. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Illustrative Example E <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Situation: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Widgets are manufactured in both the United States and various other countries around the world. The non-U.S. manufacturers get together privately outside the United States and agree among themselves to raise prices to specified levels and take measures to restrict imports into their respective countries, but specifically indicate that sales in the United States are not covered, and that each company will be free independently to set its prices for the U.S. market. Over time, however, the cartel members unilaterally begin to sell excess production into the United States as a means by which to stabilize the existing pact. The resulting sales into the United States affect output and price in the United States and U.S. exports are impaired. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  This example is intended to highlight the type of effects on U.S. commerce that can result from a price-fixing agreement that expressly excludes sales in the United States and thus does not involve import commerce within the meaning of the FTAIA. The jurisdictional issue presented, therefore, is whether the consequence of each party's unilateral decision to sell into the United States in order to stabilize the agreement is sufficiently direct and reasonably foreseeable under the FTAIA to satisfy the jurisdictional standard. If the facts showed that certain members of the cartel independently sold in a manner that was not attributable to the agreement, the Agencies would not have jurisdiction to challenge the underlying agreement. <FOOTCITE>53</FOOTCITE>  However, if the facts showed that the cartel anticipated affecting the U.S. market as a necessary and indispensable aspect of the original conspiracy, then the express exclusion of the U.S. market in the price-fixing agreement would be pretextual. In that case, the cartel would be affecting output and price in the United States, and the sales into the United States to alleviate pressure on the cartel would be considered sufficiently direct to satisfy the requirements of the FTAIA. In addition, because the illegal agreement incorporated provisions designed to restrict access to foreign markets and stymied efforts by U.S. firms to export, the facts would support a conclusion that the agreement's restraints had a ``direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect'' on the commerce of U.S. exporters. See infra Sec. 3.133. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 53 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> If the Agencies lack jurisdiction under the FTAIA to challenge the cartel, the facts of this example would nonetheless lend themselves well to cooperative enforcement action among antitrust agencies. Virtually every country with an antitrust law prohibits horizontal cartels and the Agencies would willingly cooperate with foreign authorities taking direct action against the cartel in the countries where the agreement has raised the price of widgets to the extent such cooperation is allowed under U.S. law and any agreement executed pursuant to U.S. law with foreign agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3.133&blank;Jurisdiction in Cases Involving Foreign Export Commerce <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two categories of ``export cases'' fall within the FTAIA's jurisdictional test. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the Agencies may in appropriate cases take enforcement action against anticompetitive conduct, wherever occurring, that restrains U.S. exports, if (1) the conduct has a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect on exports of goods or services from the United States, and (2) the U.S. courts can obtain jurisdiction over the foreign persons or corporations engaged in such conduct. <FOOTCITE>54</FOOTCITE>  As Section 3.2 below explains more fully, if the conduct is unlawful under the importing country's antitrust laws as well, the Agencies are also prepared to work with that country's authorities if they are better situated to remedy the conduct, and if they are prepared to take action against such conduct pursuant to their antitrust laws that will address the U.S. concerns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 54 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See U.S. Department of Justice Press Release dated April 3, 1992 (announcing enforcement policy that would permit the Department to challenge foreign business conduct that harms American exports when the conduct would have violated U.S. antitrust laws if it occurred in the United States). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Second, the Agencies may in appropriate cases take enforcement action against conduct by U.S. exporters that has a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect on trade or commerce within the United States, or on import trade or commerce. This can arise in two principal ways. First, if demand in the United States were inelastic or if sellers not involved in the agreement are unable to increase sales readily, an agreement among U.S. firms regarding the level of their exports that had a substantial share of the relevant market could reduce supply and raise prices in the United States. <FOOTCITE>55</FOOTCITE>  Second, conduct ostensibly export-related could affect the price of products sold or resold in the United States. This kind of effect could occur if, for example, U.S. firms fixed the price of an input used to manufacture a product overseas for ultimate resale in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 55 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> One would need to show more than indirect price effects resulting from legitimate export efforts to support an antitrust challenge.

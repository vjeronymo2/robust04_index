			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lonrho gloom in spite of Pounds 45m sale to Trinity - Recession leaves Liverpool Post group 27% lower LONRHO, the international trading conglomerate, yesterday announced the sale of its Scottish and Universal Newspapers for Pounds 45m to Trinity International Holdings. But the sale was overshadowed by a series of negative factors which pushed Lonrho's shares down 19p to close at 95p, its lowest price since 1985. Although the newspaper sale will be used to chip away at Lonrho's Pounds 1bn debt the market was disappointed that the disposal did not include the larger George Outram, publishers of the Glasgow Herald and Evening Times. The sale of all Lonrho's newspaper titles had been expected to fetch up to Pounds 200m. News that the long-term debt of Lonrho had been accorded a rating three notches below investment grade by Moody's, the US rating agency, also affected the shares. Warburg Securities added to the bad news by publishing a bearish note warning that the underlying businesses were consuming cash, requiring further disposals. At the same time exchange movements were continuing to eat into Lonrho's asset base. There were also fears in the market that Lonrho's Western Platinum mine, located in South Africa where almost a third of the pre-tax profits are generated, would be adversely affected by a 'no' vote in the referendum taking place on political change. Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho's deputy chairman, said the fall in the group's shares made him feel sorry for shareholders but pointed out that several big US institutions were buying. He described the newspaper sale to Trinity as a 'very good deal for Lonrho' which should be seen as part of the group's overall disposal programme. The Scottish papers have a combined circulation of 600,000 and in the year to the September 28 made pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.2m on turnover of Pounds 21.6m. Trinity is raising Pounds 23.6m by way of a 1-for-5 rights issue at 215p compared with yesterday's unchanged share price of 270p. At the same time the group announced a 27 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 18.2m to Pounds 13.3m, for 1991. A final dividend of 5.8p makes 8.4p (8p). Mr David Snedden, Trinity's chief executive, blamed the profit fall on the recession on both sides of the Atlantic. As well as being publishers of the Liverpool Post and Echo, it has weekly newspaper interests in Merseyside, North Wales and North America. See Lex</p>

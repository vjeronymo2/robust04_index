			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Options factor aids gold price rise A TRUCE appeared to have been called yesterday in the battle between holders and granters of gold options. The theatre of operations in this week's conflict had been the area just below Dollars 340 a troy ounce. Above that level many call (buy) options written for the year's end would be 'in the money' - ie, holders would be able to declare them and sell the gold warrants they received at a profit. That began to appear a real possibility in the middle of the week when modest buying in a very thin market helped the price to break out of its recent narrow trading range and reach Dollars 339.05 an ounce at one point. Alarmed options granters were quick to muster their defences, however. Determined selling on Thursday afternoon capped the upsurge and by the end of the day the London bullion market price was back to 338.35. That was enough to persuade the buyers to take a back seat yesterday, and by the close the price was Dollars 337.15 an ounce, down Dollars 1.20 on the day but still Dollars 2.15 up on the week. Traders did not rule out a renewed assault on the Dollars 340 barrier next week, however, although they thought the fact that many operators had closed their books for 1992 might result in this being delayed until the new year. A breach of the resistance level could be followed by a quick rise to Dollars 342 an ounce, or even Dollars 344, as holders declared their buying options and granters were forced to cover, they said. Platinum followed gold's lead until it was trimmed back yesterday. The price reached Dollars 365.50 an ounce on Thursday before slipping to Dollars 363.50, down 25 cents on the week at yesterday afternoon's London fixing. Chartists said platinum prices were consolidating and a challenge of recent highs should occur in due course, with the longer-term objective at Dollars 380 to Dollars 385 an ounce. The main feature at the London Metal Exchange this week was the aluminium market's continued strength in defiance of further big rises in exchange warehouse stocks, which saw the three months delivery price peak on Thursday at Dollars 1,247 a tonne. News of a 17,750-tonne rise in stocks to 1,519,900 tonnes sparked a bout of profit-taking in early trading yesterday, but the market quickly found support and the three months price closed Dollars 1 up on the day at Dollars 1,244.25 a tonne, up Dollars 15.75 on the week. Traders suggested to the Reuter news agency that the stock rise, which followed one of 8,375 tonnes announced on Tuesday, was partly attributable to a sizeable inflow of metal to LME-registered warehouses in the US, where there are signs of economic recovery. The upsurge in zinc stocks was also continued, with the total rising by 17,950 tonnes on the week to 450,125 tonnes. Prices held up well, aided by aluminium's strength, until the abandonment of a squeeze attempt yesterday allowed the three months price to subside Dollars 6 to Dollars 1,068.50 a tonne, down Dollars 10.75 on the week. Robusta coffee prices built cautiously on their recent strength before putting on a spurt yesterday at the London Futures and Options Exchange to close at a 13-month high of Dollars 1,055 a tonne for March delivery, up Dollars 21 on the week. Dealers said some participants, who had been waiting for a dip to buy, appeared to have run out of patience and entered the market early in the day. They added that the next upside objective was for the nearby arabicas price in New York to breach the psychologically-important 80-cents-a-lb mark. That could encourage renewed buying interest among investment fund managers, they suggested. In contrast cocoa futures continued their downtrend, the March position adding Pounds 13 to last week's Pounds 36 decline to test support at about Pounds 657 a tonne. The price drifted to within Pounds 7 of that level before staging a modest recovery and closed yesterday at Pounds 672 a tonne, down Pounds 13 on the week. Dealers said talk of continued high West African arrivals had helped to keep the market under pressure. Oil prices regained some of their lost ground as a consensus began to emerge that the market had bottomed, a view supported in midweek by the president of the Opec. Traders were not looking for a strong recovery, however, until the market saw evidence of actual production cuts by Opec members. The price rise, which was aided by a Nigerian announcement of a 10 per cent production cut, lifted the March crude oil futures price at London's International Petroleum Exchange from Dollars 18.05 a barrel at the end of last week to Dollars 18.64 at Thursday's close. Profit-taking trimmed futures yesterday although the physical oil market remained firm.  ------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close)  ------------------------------------- tonnes Aluminium    +17,750 to 1,519,900 Copper        +5,350 to   337,325 Lead          +3,375 to   212,800 Nickel           +96 to    67,194 Zinc         +10,350 to   450,125 Tin              +30 to    14,710  -------------------------------------</p>

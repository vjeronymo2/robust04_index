			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNDERCOUNTING THE HOMELESS  </P> <P> The people of Los Angeles are to be complimented for their achievements in  homeless services.  </P> <P> I am homeless and the day that I arrived in Los Angeles, I received a room,  food stamps and an opportunity to reciprocate for this assistance through  workfare. While imperfect, I am impressed by the city's innovations and  encourage others to follow suit.  </P> <P> Los Angeles, keep up the good work!  </P> <P> JAMES A.

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / UK Company News: BOC beats expectations with 13% rise to Pounds 80m BOC GROUP, the UK industrial gases and healthcare concern, yesterday reported a 13 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the three months to December 31, thereby beating market expectations. The group nevertheless cautioned that it had 'seen no improvement in any of the key economies in which it operates' and that the Far East, where it has been investing, was now experiencing a downturn in economic growth. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 70.8m to Pounds 80.1m on sales up 9 per cent at Pounds 711.4m. However, after removing the favourable impact of currency movements, the underlying improvement in taxable profits was 9 per cent. Earnings per share rose by 15 per cent to 10.5p. Volumes in the gases division had levelled off but prices and margins remained stable. Operating profits rose from Pounds 67.7m to Pounds 73.4m. In the healthcare division, which was encountering difficulties after expansion in the US, medical equipment continued to experience difficult trading conditions and profits fell. The pharmaceuticals division performed well and the home healthcare business, which was slimmed down in the quarter, was profitable. Profits in this division as a whole rose from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 23.3m. By geographical region, operating profits in the Americas almost doubled to Pounds 20.2m (Pounds 10.5m); in Europe they fell to Pounds 29.4m (Pounds 33.7m); Africa showed a Pounds 1m advance to Pounds 11.7m and Asia/Pacific profits increased to Pounds 18.8m (Pounds 15.9m).</p>

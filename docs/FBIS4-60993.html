			<p>BFN     [Text] In Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], a meeting of the working  groups of the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS on problems  of a settlement of the Karabakh conflict begins today. Speakers  of the parliaments of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Russia and  representatives of Nagornyy Karabakh have begun arriving in  Bishkek. Our commentator on the situation on the eve of the  meeting:    [Correspondent A. Ivanova] The Armenian leadership headed by  President Levon Ter-Petrosyan held consultations today in the  town of Goris with the leadership of Nagornyy Karabakh  [Nagorno-Karabakh]. The details of the conversation are not  being disclosed. According to unofficial information, the sides  discussed the approach to a settlement of the Karabakh conflict  in connection with the meeting planned for 3 May in Bishkek of  heads of parliaments of Armenia and Azerbaijan, with the  participation of representatives of Nagornyy Karabakh.    The initiator of the meeting was the CIS Interparliamentary  Assembly, which has noticeably stepped up its peacemaking  activity in the zone of the Karabakh conflict.    Vladimir Shumeyko, who arrived in Bishkek today, stated that  the talks provide an opportunity to reach agreement on the  question of a settlement of the Karabakh conflict. He considers  the main justification for this to be the fact that Azerbaijan  recognized Nagornyy Karabakh recently as one of the participants  of this conflict. Shumeyko called this a very big leap forward  in the process of the talks on Karabakh.</p>

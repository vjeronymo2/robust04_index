			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / People: Building up Taylor Woodrow Colin Parsons, the new chairman of construction group Taylor Woodrow, has looked elsewhere in his own struggling sector to boost the non-executive content of the board and chosen Sir George Russell, chairman and chief executive of building materials group Marley. It is the first time Taylor Woodrow has lured the chairman of another industrial public company into a non-executive directorship. Sir George joins Charles Hambro, chairman of Hambros, the company's merchant bank, who has been on the board for as long as thirty years, and Sir Kit McMahon, who joined in September 1991, but whose background is financial not industrial. Lord Bellwin, who had been a director since 1985, retired shortly after Parsons arrived. The company, which cut its interim dividend after losing Pounds 16m in the six months to June 30, hopes that Sir George's breadth of experience will help address charges that the board has long been too introspective, as well as complement the skills of Parsons, an accountant who has worked in Canada for 30 years. The appointment comes as part of a thorough reorganisation initiated by Parsons, who arrived at the end of March, and who has been overhauling the board, prompting several departures and simplifying what was previously an opaque hierarchy. While Sir George has been unable to shield Marley from the ravages of recession, analysts credit him with being clear-thinking and unafraid of tough decisions. He is perhaps better known as chairman of the Independent Television Commission, a post he has held since 1991. Taylor Woodrow, which closed its North American construction operation but which still retains large housing interests in the USA, is attracted by Sir George's experience in North America - beginning in 1968 when he worked with Welland Chemical of Canada, before joining Alcan in 1972. He is still a member of the worldwide board of Alcan Aluminium Limited.</p>

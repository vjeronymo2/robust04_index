			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Playing safe with the bank manager - In a nutshell How to get a better deal from their bank manager is a problem which has puzzled many small business owners in recent months. The banks' large provisions on small business lending has led many of them to take a tougher line with customers. The Director's Guide to Getting the best from your Bank* provides no magic formula, opting instead to repeat the common-sense advice that bank managers hate surprises and that keeping your bank manager informed is the best policy. The most valuable sections of this booklet, published jointly by the Institute of Directors and NatWest Bank, describe the additional services that banks can provide in the fields of payroll management and how to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks. Other useful chapters explain credit control and factoring and financial management. *Director Publications, Mountbarrow House, 6-20 Elizabeth Street, London SW1W 9RB. Tel 071 839 1233. 84 pages.

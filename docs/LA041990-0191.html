			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> CITY CONSIDERS DRIVE TO FINANCE STADIUMS  </P> <P> The City Council has voted to hire a fund-raising expert to determine whether  it is possible to raise about $6 million for a planned Cal State Fullerton  sports complex.  </P> <P> The joint project by the city and university is about $2.4 million short of the  $12.5 million needed to build the type of sports facility originally planned,  City Councilman Richard C. Ackerman said.  </P> <P> If the consultant finds that a fund-raising effort would not raise enough  money, the Titan Sports Complex will have to be scaled back to fit the  $10.2-million budget approved by the city and university, said Sal Rinella, Cal  State Fullerton's vice president for administration.  </P> <P> The council hoped that contributions from the community would have paid the  extra $2.4 million needed for the original plan and repaid the city for $3.5  million it contributed to the project last year after a study re-evaluated the  cost of the project.  </P> <P> Originally, the sports complex was estimated to cost about $6.7 million.  </P> <P> If fund-raising is tried, the city and university probably will look for one or  more large donors, Ackerman said.  </P> <P> "Our goal is to get a major donor to name the sports complex after," he said.  "I feel confident we'll be able to raise the additional amount."  </P> <P> The Fullerton council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, voted unanimously to  pay $22,000 to hire the Robert B. Sharp Co. of Santa Ana to find likely donors  and draft a proposal that would be submitted to them.  </P> <P> The city and university's joint building committee are scheduled to meet  Wednesday morning to make up a list of items that could be cut from the project  if necessary, Rinella said. The list will be submitted to university President  Jewel Plummer Cobb for her approval.  </P> <P> Possibilities include cutting back on concession booths, restrooms and a press  box.  </P> <P> Construction of the Titan Sports Complex is scheduled to begin this summer and  be finished in early 1992. Plans call for a 10,000-seat stadium for football  and soccer, a 1,500-seat baseball stadium, a running track, 12 tennis courts  and various service buildings. TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

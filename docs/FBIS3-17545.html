			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Naryshkin] </F>   [Text] Zagreb, 25 Mar -- Today, a contingent of 100 Russian  paratroops arrived at the Croatian capital's airport from  Ryazan, accompanied by a back-up group. On Saturday [26 March],  it will be transferred to Sarajevo on two UN peacekeepers'  aircraft to reinforce the Russian element of the "blue helmets."    The back-up group includes a representative of the Russian  Federation president, senior officers of the General Staff of  Russia's Armed Forces, and of the airborne forces and diplomats.  As Major General Nikolay Stasko, the head of the group and  deputy commander of the Russian Federation airborne forces, told  an ITAR-TASS correspondent, its mission includes settling issues  linked to the status and tasks of the Russian peacekeeping  contingent in Sarajevo. The fact was, he explained, that the UN  Secretariat had yet to grant the Russian unit the status of a  fully-fledged battalion of peacekeeping forces and was using it  as a reserve element. The Russian soldiers and diplomats intend  to discuss this matter with General Michael Rose, the commander  of UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The airborne company that arrived includes soldiers of 10  nationalities and various religious persuasions. They include a  Muslim platoon that is to serve in the Serbian sector of  Sarajevo.</p>

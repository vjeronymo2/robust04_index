			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Letter: France can bank on it Sir, I was surprised to read that Chiddingfold no longer has any bank branches ('The battle for Midland', May 1). Venansault, in Vendee/France, with the same size population as Chiddingfold and situated six miles from its county town, has two thriving sub-branches of the Credit Mutuel and Credit Agricole. The Credit Agricole agence is open all morning Tuesday to Saturday (closed Sunday and Monday). It is staffed by two men equipped with two computer terminals who have been there for years and know all their customers not only by name but often by account number and personal circumstances. And there are even chairs for queueing customers. Are these reasons why Credit Agricole is the largest bank in France and one of the leading banks worldwide?

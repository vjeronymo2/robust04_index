			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 10 KYODO -- The ruling coalition on  Monday [10 January] brushed aside opposition resistance and  readied itself to take a vote on a package of four political  reform bills at a House of Councillors plenary session on  January 19 and enact them into law.    One day before the plenary session, the upper house's  special  committee will vote on the bills, officials said.    The schedule was fixed after the second chamber's special  committee voted Monday to set the date of a public hearing on  the bills at January 17.    Officials said a vote can be taken at any time if a public  hearing is called.    Public hearings are mandatory for budgets and revenue bills  to become law. Hearings are necessary for other bills which  parties consider important.    The ruling and opposition parties have agreed to require  public hearings for the passage of the political reform bills,  which call for introducing single-seat constituencies combined  with proportional representation for House of Representatives  general elections and imposing stricter controls on political  funding.    The bills cleared the lower house in mid-November.    At Monday's session of the special committee, a ruling  legislator entered a motion to set the date for the public  hearing.    Committee Chairman Shoji Motooka called a vote, drawing  angry  protests from members of two opposition parties, the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] and the Japanese Communist Party [JCP]  legislators.    Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic  Party  (SDP), the biggest party in the seven-party coalition, told a  meeting of coalition leaders Monday, "we should not accept any  proposals to put off the final vote until after January 19."    Upper house deliberations on political reform bills have  stalled by opposition resistance.    Coalition leaders also decided not to bargain with the LDP  over possible modifications unless it pledges to cooperate with  the coalition in enacting the bills by the deadline of January  29, the sources said.    Meanwhile, Man Sasaki, chairman of the LDP's Diet Affairs  Committee, threatened to table a no-confidence motion against  Motooka for calling the vote on the public hearing without the  consent of the opposition camp.    "It is an unprecedented parliamentary tactic to call a vote  at the very moment the ruling coalition and opposition are still  consulting on the upcoming parliamentary agenda," Sasaki said.    The government-proposed electoral bill calls for replacing  the current 511-seat lower chamber with a 500-seat mixture of  274 single-seat constituencies and 226 proportional  representation seats.    The LDP has been demanding that the number of single-seat  constituencies be increased from the proposed 274. It has also  urged the coalition to ease curbs on a proposed ban on donations  from business corporations to individual politicians.    Political analysts said the ruling coalition fears the  package of four bills might be killed at a final vote, if more  than a dozen SDP legislators voted against them, along with  legislators of the Niin Club, a five-member parliamentary group  in the upper house.    The LDP, JCP, and Niin Club has a combined parliamentary  strength of 114 in the upper house, while the ruling coalition  has 131. There are also six independents.</p>

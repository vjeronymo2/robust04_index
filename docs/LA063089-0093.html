			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> South African officials in New York have expressed outrage over the new  cops-and-robbers film "Lethal Weapon II," which they perceive as showing  Pretorian consular officials as "drug-smuggling, sadistic thugs." Paul Bryant,  vice-consul for the Republic of South Africa in New York, charged that the film  is part of a Hollywood trend trying to promote "the villainization of South  Africa in films. . . . In the film industry, all of a sudden Cuba and the  Soviet Union are the good boys. Now they cast around for another country as a  villain, and they've picked us," he said. Warner Bros. vice president Rob  Friedman responded that the movie was not an all-encompassing denunciation of  South African consular activity. "It happens to be fictional. . . . 'Lethal  Weapon II' is not a documentary." The film stars Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as  wise-cracking Los Angeles detectives, and the principal villain is a South  African diplomat. It opens next Friday. ALEENE MACMINN  </P></p>

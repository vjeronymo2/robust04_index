			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vusie Ginindza] </F>   [Excerpts] Minister for Health, Dr. Derek von Wissel on  Thursday night gave the Senate a horrifying picture of the AIDS  situation and its impact on the immediate future of the country.    He said government will never cope with the scourge in as  far  as concerns treatment of AIDS patients and provision of hospital  facilities. [sentence as received]    To cope, he said, government will have to build a hospital  in  every six months and be able to provide between 400 to 500 beds  every year.    "That is taking into consideration that each patient will be  in hospital for 20 days," he said.    He said the present nurses-to-patient ratio stands at 1 to  600 and there is only E[emalangeni]1 million this year to be  used in the prevention of AIDS, after having been increased from  E300,000 last year.    He told senators that in the next two years, people will be  dying in large numbers as long as they don't change their  behaviour.    As a result, he said, there would be 40,000 orphans and  helpless old people who would be left stranded as bread-winners,  as people in the sexually active range, would have died.    Dr. von Wissel was replying to several questions from  Senators during the debate on the vote of the Ministry of Health.    Senators wanted to know the cause of the disease, its impact  and if there were any plans to counter its effects.    The minister said sexual promiscuity is the largest  contributing factor to the epidemic. He said children are  becoming sexually active "much too much early" as between 15 to  18 years.    To emphasise this view, the minister informed the House that  one out of 10 women who are treated for maternity problems in  hospitals, is a child who attempted or committed a back-street  abortion.    He said 75 percent of 16 year olds are sexually active, half  of whom have got more than one partner at a time and have sex,  at least, more than two times a month. [passage omitted]    Presently, he said, 22 percent of the population are HIV  positive (have the virus that eventually develops into AIDS).    "One in every five in the country has the HIV virus. In  certain areas, out of three women, one has it."    The minister said AIDS should not be stigmatized. "It's just  like cancer or any other disease that we have since learnt to  live with. So people should stop thinking of it as a dirty  disease."</p>

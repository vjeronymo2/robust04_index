The Partnership was organized in 1984 as a limited partnership under New York state Law. It has not been registered under the Act in reliance upon section 3(c)(1) of the Act, and the Partnership interests have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 in reliance upon section 4(2) thereof. The general partners of the Partnership, Messrs. Stephen Ely, Colin C. Ferenbach, and Denis M. Turko (the ``General Partners''), have exclusive control over the management and business of the Partnership. The General Partners have maintained an investment in the Partnership not less that 1% of the net assets of the Partnership, and are allocated net income, gains, and losses of the Partnership in proportion to their respective investments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Fund is the initial series of The Haven Capital Management Trust, a business trust formed under the laws of Delaware on March 17, 1994. The Fund, an open-end management investment company, filed a notification of registration under the Act on Form N&hyph;8A and a registration statement under the Act and the Securities Act on Form N&hyph;1A on March 18, 1994. The registration statement has not yet been declared effective, and no offering of shares has commenced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Adviser is the investment adviser to the Partnership and will be the investment adviser to the Fund. PFPC, Inc. and Provident Distributors, Inc., which are not affiliated with any of the applicants, will act as the Fund's administrator and principal underwriter, respectively. The Fund does not currently intend to enlist the assistance of other broker-dealers to market shares and there is no intention to advertise the Fund in newspapers or other media. Neither the Adviser nor Provident intends to solicit widespread public interest in the Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants propose that, prior to offering the shares to the public, the Fund will exchange shares for the assets of the Partnership, less funds required to pay the liabilities of the Partnership. Thereafter, the Partnership will dissolve and distribute the shares it received to its partners  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , including the General Partners. Partners of the Partnership will constitute all of the holders of shares, except for shares representing seed capital contributed to the Fund by the Adviser pursuant to section 14(a) of the Act. The Fund was designed as a successor investment vehicle to the Partnership, with investment objectives and policies substantially the same as those of the Partnership. The same persons who selected the investments for the Partnership will select them for the Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Fund intends to adopt a plan of distribution pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1 under the Act. Under the rule 12b&hyph;1 plan, the Fund may spend no more than 0.25% of its average daily net assets for sales activities including compensation paid to Provident and the printing and mailing of prospectuses and sales literature. The Fund will comply with rules regarding distribution expenses adopted by the National Association of Securities Dealers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The proposed exchange will be effected pursuant to an agreement and plan of exchange (the ``Plan'') to be approved by the limited partners of the Partnership. Under the Plan, the portfolio securities of the Partnership will be acquired at their independent ``current market price,'' as defined in rule 17a&hyph;7 under the Act. The Fund will not acquire securities that, in the opinion of the Adviser, are overvalued or would result in a violation of the Fund's investment objectives, policies, or restrictions. It is not expected that the Partnership will hold any such securities. Any remaining securities will be liquidated by the partnership for cash and these proceeds distributed  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to the partners of the Partnership. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

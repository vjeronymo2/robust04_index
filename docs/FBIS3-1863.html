In recent years, various provinces and cities have set up  their own foreign exchange swap centers. However, the scope of  operation of all these swap centers has been confined to local  transactions, thus resulting in a separation between different  areas and hindering the rational redistribution of foreign  exchange resources. This being the case, the central bank can  hardly carry out macroscopic regulation and control of the  separated foreign exchange markets with a view to stabilizing  foreign exchange rates.    One of the measures stemming from the reform of the foreign  exchange management system that was initiated this year is to  build an inter-bank foreign exchange transaction market. In the  unified foreign exchange transaction market that is to be put  into operation this March, those banks authorized as foreign  exchange dealers will be qualified to conduct transactions.  Offers from these banks will be entered into a computer, their  bids will be processed in a centralized manner, and the  transaction center will act as a go- between to accomplish  transactions based on the principle of each transaction going to  the one who has offered the highest price and who has come  first. The People's Bank of China is to announce the reference  exchange rate of renminbi to the U.S. dollar every business day  according the previous day's closing transaction rate on the  foreign exchange market. The renminbi's exchange rate for other  major foreign currencies will be calculated based on this  reference rate. All other authorized foreign exchange dealer  banks are to conduct foreign exchange transactions on their own  within a fixed floating foreign exchange rate range pegged to  this reference rate. Foreign-funded enterprises can sell their  foreign exchange balances through authorized foreign exchange  dealer banks on the foreign exchange market.    For the time being, only the above-mentioned five cities  will  be included in the unified transaction network. After the  system has been initiated, another 20 cities will join it sooner  or later and will gradually adopt the universally accepted price  enquiry and quoting practice for foreign exchange transactions.  The central bank will be ready to intervene in the market at  any time to maintain a supply-demand balance and to stabilize  foreign exchange rates on the market by buying or selling  foreign exchange. The spot exchange rate for the dollar at  present is approximately $1 to 8.7 yuan, and it is expected that  the renminbi exchange rate will remain stable in the first half  of the year.</p>

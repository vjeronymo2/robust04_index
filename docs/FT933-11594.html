			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / 2,000 killed in Sumatra, says report INDONESIAN troops have killed an estimated 2,000 civilians in their attempts in recent years to crush a Moslem separatist rebellion in the Aceh area of northern Sumatra, Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, says in a report published today. Most of the victims were ordinary people with no involvement in the armed opposition movement called Aceh Merdeka, Amnesty says, and some were children or very old. 'Some of those killed were publicly executed,' the organisation says. 'Others were 'mysteriously killed,' the corpses left in public places - beside a main road, in fields and plantations - apparently as a warning to others not to join or support the rebels.' Amnesty says Aceh Merdeka members, many of whom were trained in Libya in the late 1980s, have also committed human rights abuses. It says the officially-sanctioned murder of civilians has declined since early 1991, but rejects claims that life in Aceh has returned to normal.</p>

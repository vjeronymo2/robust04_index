			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA ASSAILS BRITISH HONG KONG OFFER  </P> <P> China denounced as "unacceptable" Saturday a British law granting passports and  the right of abode in Britain to 50,000 key Hong Kong Chinese families and said  it will not recognize the "erroneous action."  </P> <P> China's vow of non-recognition appeared designed to undermine a key aim of the  British Nationality Act, passed by the Parliament last week as a safety valve  to give some key Hong Kong residents the confidence to stay in the territory  after the colony reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.  </P> <P> Beijing accused Britain of having "gone so far as to break its solemn  commitment" to the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration outlining the British  colony's July 1, 1997, handover to China. It threatened unspecified measures in  retaliation.  </P> <P> The Nationality Act promises British passports and right of abode in Britain to  50,000 leaders in Hong Kong business, government and cultural circles, allowing  them to emigrate if Hong Kong's stability deteriorates as the Chinese takeover  nears.  </P> <P> British lawmakers, worried about a huge influx of Hong Kong Chinese, clearly  had hoped British citizenship would keep program participants in Hong Kong  beyond 1997.  </P></p>

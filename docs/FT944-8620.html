			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures moved lower, but there was little real sense of direction to the session and trading volume was low, writes Jeffrey Brown. The FT-SE 100 December contract was standing at 3,136 when pit trading came to an end, down 16 points, eroding some of the advance of 79 points recorded over the previous three days. At this level the premium to the cash market was 9 points, while the fair value premium was just above 7 points. Trading was mostly uneventful. Two-way business was thin at best and dealing sizes narrowed sharply. Contracts dealt tailed off steeply from the high levels of the previous two sessions. Volume was 10,522 contracts, but more than 3,000 of these were pushed through in the final 30 minutes of official trading. Some 16,000 lots were traded on Wednesday, while Tuesday's number came close to 20,000. The fitful nature of the day was reflected in a trading arc of 40 points, with the December contract fluctuating between a low of 3,125 and a best of 3,165. Traded option volume also declined, moving down from Wednesday's 56,430 contracts to 30,506. FTSE and Euro FT-SE trading accounted for less than 20,000 lots. HSBC was the most active stock option with a modest 800 lots, followed by Barclays and Vodafone.</p>

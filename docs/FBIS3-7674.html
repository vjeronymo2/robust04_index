			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Bank of Thailand revised its estimate of  domestic economic growth for this year from 7.9 per cent to 8  per cent, a slight increase driven by an acceleration of the  economy over the last two months of 1993 and the first quarter  of this year.    It also revised Thailand's economic growth tally for 1993  upwards, from 7.5 per cent to 7.8 per cent. This revision was  based on data provided by the National Economic and Social  Development Board.    Economic acceleration in the last two months of 1993 had led  the central bank's economists to miscalculate the growth figure  by 0.1 percentage point.    Following extensive discussions with the central bank,  International Monetary Fund officials expressed confidence that  the Thai economy has a strong potential to grow robustly for a  long time yet.    In the medium term (over the next three to five years),  economic growth is expected to remain between seven and eight  per cent. Current account deficits will be capped at five per  cent of the gross domestic product before the end of the 7th  National Economic and Social Development Plan in 1996.    "It is this year that the central bank will be actively  intervening in the money market. We have gradually loosened our  monetary policy since the middle of last year. We'll be taking  a cautious stance now to keep inflation, imports and current  account deficits under control," said Dr. Chaiyawat Phibunsawat,  the Assistant Governor of the central bank. "This will help  stabilize economic expansion in the medium term and over the  long haul."    The bank's preliminary report of the IMF, however, shows its  concern over supplies and the country's ability to manufacture  enough to meet its domestic demand. Most industries have revved  up their production to full capacity already and skilled labor  is scarce. While the global economic recovery is expected to  lead to higher consumption and investment levels, it might also  trigger overspending. With inadequate supplies of materials for  industry, inflationary pressure here will heighten, imports will  surge and the current account deficit will widen.    "These three indices are of particular concern this year,  more so than last year. The IMF suggested that spending must be  kept at an appropriate level, checked by fiscal discipline,"  Chaiyawat said. The government has recorded a fiscal surplus for  seven consecutive years now and is likely to set a balanced  budget for fiscal 1995 as well. In fiscal 1994, the government  agreed to run a deficit to stimulate demand in the provinces.    Although the central bank has been trying to keep credit and  money supply growth at an appropriate level, it will face an  increasingly uphill task in staying on top of the rapid changes  in the capital inflows affecting monetary policy. Following a  recent round of discussions with IMF officials, the central bank  agreed to target economic growth of 8 per cent for this year,  inflation at 4.2 percent against 3.3 percent last year and the  current account deficit at 5.4 percent of the GDP.    In international trade, exports are projected to surge 14.6  percent this year to 1,507 billion baht, against import growth  of 13.8 percent to 1,301 billion baht -- resulting in a trade  deficit to around 244 billion baht. The current account deficit  will reach 189 billion baht, equivalent to 5.4 percent of the  GDP. Net capital inflow will fall slightly from last year's 294  billion baht to 271 billion baht this year. Cash surplus will  also drop slightly, from 98.8 billion baht to 1994's 82 billion  baht.    On the fiscal side, the 1994 budget will post a 44.7 billion  baht surplus, compared to 69 billion baht in the 1993 budget.  This is equivalent to 1.3 percent of the GDP. On the monetary  side, credit in the commercial banking system is expected to  surge by 21.7 percent, compared to an 19.6 percent growth in  deposits. The balance will be filled by foreign capital.</p>

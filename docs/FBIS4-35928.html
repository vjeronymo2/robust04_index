			<p>BFN   <F P=106> Statement issued by a "responsible source at the Defense </F> Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Yemen" to the YEMENI NEWS  AGENCY, Aden]    [Text] Within the framework of the flagrant, adventurist  challenge to the UN Security Council resolution issued on 2  June, which stipulated an immediate cease-fire, the ruling  military regime in Sanaa, under the leadership of the  bloodshedder 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, today continued its  barbarous, hostile acts against residential quarters, peaceful  villages, and vital economic installations. Some residential  quarters in the capital, Aden, were subjected to strikes this  evening by surface-to-surface missiles. Shrapnel from these  missiles, which were intercepted by our air defenses, fell on  some residential quarters and hit innocent citizens.    Today, in another arena, crushing battles took place between  our forces and hostile forces on all fronts. Our forces managed  to halt the advance of the enemy forces, after inflicting heavy  human and material losses on them, which we shall report on in  subsequent communiques. Our forces, led by the fighters of the  liberation war, continue to cleanse villages and towns of the  filth of the forces of the al-Ahmar gang which tried to spread  corruption in those areas, looting the citizens and violating  their honor. The Armed Forces, supported by the masses of the  people, are resisting -- with rare courage and legendary bravery  -- the barbarous and brutal forces, for the 45th consecutive  day. They have unlimited confidence that the ruling military  regime in Sanaa will take its last breath in the next few hours,  and will have to drink from the cup of defeat and disgrace.    God is great, God is great, victory is near.</p>

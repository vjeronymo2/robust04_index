			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: BASF slumps 50% to DM238m BASF, the German chemicals group, is heading for a further profits fall this year after a 41 per cent slump to DM1.24bn (Dollars 781m) last time. Pre-tax earnings in the first quarter slumped 50 per cent to DM238m, the company said in an interim report yesterday. Orders on hand at the parent company at the end of March were 14 per cent lower than a year earlier, Mr Jurgen Strube, chairman, told the annual meeting. 'We are no longer counting on being able to reach last year's profits level,' he added. In 1992 the parent provided 90 per cent of group pre-tax earnings. BASF's progress report, following news earlier this week that Hoechst's first-quarter earnings were down 28 per cent and profits at Bayer had fallen 21 per cent, compounded the gloomy mood in the German chemicals sector. Its figures confirmed the dramatic effect of cost-cutting reforms in the German health service and the domestic recession, which have exacerbated difficulties in international markets caused by over-capacity, low prices and setbacks in agricultural markets. 'Incoming orders and orders on hand are stagnating at a comparatively low level. There is no sign of a fundamental change for the rest of the year,' the interim report said. Approval of new investment projects was lower than last year, although spending was continuing as planned on building up plant in Antwerp and Schwarzheide in eastern Germany, and the extension of a natural gas pipeline. Total capital spending was down almost 7 per cent in the quarter. Group sales fell 7 per cent to DM11bn while domestic turnover at the German parent dropped 20 per cent. The company, which shed 4,600 workers in the 12 months to the end of March, reported satisfactory developments in speciality and fine chemicals, and said it had increased deliveries of polypropylene in Europe and of technical plastics in north America. Parts of its plastics and fibres businesses had suffered considerable turnover falls, and prices were still unsatisfactory. Paints had been hit by the sharp decline in the European automotive industry, and the troubled recording tapes business was still making losses, although within the group's range of expectations. Pre-tax profits at Bayer, the German chemicals company, fell 21.2 per cent during the first three months. This was incorrectly reported in a headline in yesterday's Financial Times.</p>

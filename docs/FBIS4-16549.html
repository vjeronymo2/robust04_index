			<p>BFN     [Text] As Interfax has learned from Russia's Foreign  Ministry, the Russian President's Special Envoy, Deputy Foreign  Minister Vitaliy Churkin arrived in Sarajevo on Saturday to help  end hostilities and reconcile Serbs and Moslems in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In the words of a senior Russian diplomat, the negotiations  have been quite tough, although the sides have revealed some  encouraging signs.    Nonetheless, in his opinion, the achievement of an agreement  within the next two-three days is hardly possible for political,  military, and technical reasons. An accord must fix a  disengagement line between the Serbs and the Moslems, a line  which in their view, could be a frontier for a long time. The  negotiators have been bargaining for virtually each mile of the  mountain terrain. This does not portend a quick completion of  the negotiating process, the diplomat said.    However, he did not rule out that an accord could be signed  already next week.</p>

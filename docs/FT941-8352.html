			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Too many genes Never have I felt so glad to return to London as I did last weekend. Good old England; praise God for Naffshire. How snug things seemed. Comforting. Familiar. A government of tired incompetents lecturing an electorate of (mainly) idiots on how to comport themselves. Another Tory scandal. Decrepitude. Banality. I am a surprisingly simple soul: always highly amiable, a boon in office or home. But I was in such a depressed state when I returned from Delhi last weekend that I almost fell to the ground at Heathrow and kissed Naffshire's sod, so pleased was I to be back. I had not been to India before. I was there only briefly. But I was outraged by what I saw - filth, pollution and poverty on a scale hard to stomach; people milling wretchedly; the degradation of humanity on an eye-popping scale. I had to keep rubbing my eyes, for India seemed a parody of a country, so unreal, so far off-course, that I felt I had strayed into a time-kink from the middle of the next century, when population pressures will be exacting a dreadful price for our inability to control our breeding. By coincidence I was reading, while in Delhi, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World Revisited. It was published in 1959, as Huxley's second opinion on the phantasmagoric prophesies contained in his novel, Brave New World, written in 1931. I would guess that for every 1,000 who have read Brave New World, only a handful have read Brave New World Revisited. You should try it, especially if you have just handed a small boy, only five or six years old, one of India's Untouchables, a few rupees in a Delhi street and have watched his scabbed little face light up with a smile of disbelief. Huxley was much exercised by over-population. This was not the space age but the age of over-population. In the Brave New World of his fable, he wrote, the problem of human numbers in relation to natural resources had been effectively solved. But in the real world the problem was 'becoming graver and more formidable with every passing year. It is against this grim biological background that all the political, economic, cultural and psychological dramas of our time are being played out.' That quote is from the first chapter of Brave New World Revisited. It is in the second chapter that Huxley really let rip, and he did so by venturing into areas that are simply not discussed today. In his Brave New World, he said, eugenics and dysgenics were practised systematically: Betas, Alphas and even Alpha-pluses out of one set of laboratory bottles; biologically inferior, almost sub-human, creatures from another set. In the real world, we did nothing systematic about our breeding. 'But in our random and unregulated way we are not only over-populating our planet, we are also, it would seem, making sure that these greater numbers shall be of biologically poorer quality . . . Under the conditions now prevailing, every advance in medicine will tend to be offset by a corresponding advance in the survival rates of individuals cursed by some genetic insufficiency.' Result: no improvement, or perhaps a deterioration, in average health standards, and perhaps a decline in average intelligence. Going further, Huxley quoted a Dr WH Sheldon as claiming that it was 'the fashion in some academic circles to assure students that the alarm over differential birth-rates is unfounded; that these problems are merely economic, or merely educational, or merely religious, or merely cultural or something . . . This is Pollyanna optimism. Reproductive delinquency is biological and basic.' What chilled me especially as I stared through the windows of my tourist coach in Delhi was Huxley's conclusion. 'What,' he asked, 'about the congenitally insufficient organisms, whom our medicine and our social services now preserve so that they may propagate their kind? . . . the wholesale transmission to our descendants of the results of unfavourable mutations, and the progressive contamination of the genetic pool from which members of our species will have to draw, (is) obviously bad.' Huxley didn't have any answers. But at least he asked the questions. Where have those questions gone? Why have they been purged? Why the great silence? I believe I know the answer. I think we have grown afraid. The thing that is frightening us most is the sight of our own teeming shadows.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Major may be ready to accept resignation of Mates MR JOHN MAJOR'S pointed refusal to offer public backing for Mr Michael Mates reinforced the impression last night that the prime minister is now ready to accept the resignation of his embattled Northern Ireland minister. Mr Major is understood to have talked to Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, about the 'mood of the party' on the issue of Mr Mates's links with Mr Asil Nadir and on reports that the Conservatives received funding from companies associated with the fugitive businessman. With few Conservative backbenchers prepared to support Mr Mates in public or in private, the feeling was growing at Westminster that the minister's future may be settled when the powerful 1922 executive of Tory backbench MPs meets on Thursday, if it has not been settled before. Labour will use a full-length Commons debate on Tory finances today to keep the pressure on by claiming the revelations so far are just the tip of the iceberg. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said it was not enough simply to throw Mr Mates to the wolves. However, associates of the prime minister dismissed suggestions that Mr Mates had threatened to reveal damaging information about the collapse of Mr Nadir's Polly Peck empire. Mr Mates - who on several occasions passed to the attorney-general allegations that the UK security services had conspired against Mr Nadir - was said to accept now that the charges were without foundation. Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, tried last night to turn the attack on Labour, saying the real issue on party funding was Labour and the trade unions. 'We will return any money we have received which is proven to be stolen,' he said. 'Will Labour promise the same if the tens of thousands of pounds John Smith admits they received from Robert Maxwell prove to be stolen?' However, Sir Bernard Ingham, Lady Thatcher's former chief press officer, urged Mr Major to 'lance the boil' and sack Mr Mates. The Tory party should also pay back Mr Nadir's donations. Mr Mates was rebuked by Mr Major earlier this month after he admitted sending a watch to Mr Nadir bearing the inscription: 'Don't let the buggers get you down'. That inscription was said to reflect Mr Mates's initial concern that Mr Nadir's charges had some basis in truth. Mr Major, at the EC summit in Copenhagen, yesterday again refused to comment on the rising tide of speculation at Westminster that Mr Mates will soon quit. Mr Major's silence was seen as a signal that although reluctant to sack Mr Mates he will not resist his resignation. He was said to regard as a second 'mistake' Mr Mates's acceptance of the loan of a car from Mr Nadir's public relations advisers. Mr Mates did receive a vote of confidence from Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, who said his departmental colleague was 'doing an excellent job' and he 'very much' hoped he would continue to do it. Tories have 'very strict' record of donations, Page 9</p>

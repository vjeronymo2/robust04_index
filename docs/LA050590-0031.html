Yes, if I paid 500  bucks to see Mike Tyson's rematch with Buster Douglas and one did not fight,  I'd want my money back. Same as if I bought Prince or Madonna or Sinatra  tickets, or Michael Crawford in "Phantom of the Opera."  </P> <P> But the people in Portland got what they paid for -- same as I got in reading  your article.  </P> <P> RIC MANDELL, Torrance  </P></p>

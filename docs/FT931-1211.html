			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cambior plans Arizona copper development CAMBIOR, A medium sized Canadian gold producer, plans to invest CDollars 82m (Pounds 44m) to develop a low-grade Arizona copper deposit with potential annual output of 30,000 tonnes for 10 years starting in 1995. It will use the heap-leaching method to extract copper from the open-pit properties' ore. Reserves are estimated at 100m tonnes of oxide ore averaging 0.45 per cent copper a tonne. Operating cost will be about 58 US cents a lb. Cambior expects to raise its gold output by 80 per cent to well over 600,000 troy ounces this year with the opening of its Omi mine in Guyana.</p>

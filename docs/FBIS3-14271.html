			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tripoli, al-Rabia'a [March] 24 (JAMAHIRIYA NEWS  AGENCY) -- In a proposal presented to the United Nations, the  United States called for Japan and Germany to be permanent  members of the Security Council.    The Cable News Network, CNN, said that the American  ambassador to the United Nations presented this in the form of a  proposal.    The international affairs editor commented saying: At a time  when we have been saying that the time has long become overdue  for a review and reorganising of the United Nations on a new  basis where all nations would have an equal role in it and would  serve to extract it from the quagmire it has fallen into as a  result of the hegemony of the Western countries over it. These  Western countries transformed the United Nations into an  instrument to repress other nations.    Thus, by changing the United Nations along these lines, as  proposed repeatedly by the leader of the revolution, is a matter  which concerns all those countries represented in the United  Nations given that the Security Council is the council of all  the nations. Consequently, any change made to the council is the  prerogative of all the nations it represents. Such changes  should be put to these nations for discussion and so they can  give their opinion.    The editor said that the inclusion of Germany and Japan in  the Security Council was not decided by the member countries of  the United Nations, they didn't discuss it nor did they make any  decision and they shouldn't be forced into accepting any  decision they weren't involved in making. The editor said that  this trend which involves opening the door to permanent  membership in the Security Council and granting the right of  veto solely to the powerful industrialised nations indicates a  move towards crushing the less powerful nations which sufferred  greatly from the monopoly the powerful nations have over the  right of veto, a sitution they continue to suffer from.  Therefore, there has to be a reassessment of the right of veto  itself so that decision making will be in the hands of the  General Assembly of the United Nations, that is, in the hands of  all the members of this organisation.    China had rejected any change to be made to the Security  Council without being put to the General Assembly of the United  Nations so they can give their approval.    The editor said that all the talk underway about allowing  Japan and Germany to become permanent members of the Security  Council, where the spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry  stated, in January, that China sees that a re-structuring of the  Security Council and the inclusion of Japan and Germany as  permanent members, could never meet with the approval of the  less powerful nations and that such a matter should be put to  all the member countries of the General Assembly of the United  Nations before any new member is allowed to join the Security  Council.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Good news is bad for shares: Why London stocks are less than buoyant For the average investor in UK shares, the last couple of weeks have been one long bungee jump. The FT-SE 100 Index has been bouncing up and down, recording a rise or fall of more than 25 points on six out of the last eight trading days. Over the course of the year, the trend has been more down than up; the Footsie is now about 15 per cent down from its peak in February. By the standards of the past 30 years, it is still arguable whether this is a fully-fledged bear market, or merely a correction within a longer bull run. Since 1965, there have been nine occasions when the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share index has fallen, peak to trough, by more than 20 per cent, with the long drawn-out decline of 1972-74 being the worst example. This year's fall has yet to reach such proportions. But there is a danger that it might. What may puzzle the small investor is the background to the current gyrations. The UK economy is looking remarkably healthy; growth is set to top 3 per cent this year, underlying inflation is low at 2.3 per cent, unemployment is falling and the trade deficit is narrowing. In such conditions, investors might reason, share markets should be rejoicing, not lamenting. Furthermore, the most common explanation for the declines in world bond and equity markets this year is the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates to slow the US economy. But if the US is the problem, how come Wall Street is just 4 or 5 per cent off its all-time high, when the Footsie is around 15 per cent off its peak? The answer to these riddles lies partly in events in 1993 and partly in what markets fear for 1995 and beyond. Last year was an annus mirabilis for financial markets. In the UK, medium-term gilts returned around 23 per cent and equities 27 per cent. Market buoyancy resulted from a fall in interest rates round the world that persuaded investors to switch from cash into bonds and equities. US investors, in particular, were putting money overseas, with many using money borrowed at historically low interest rates. The bubble burst in February 1994 when the Federal Reserve made its first upward move in interest rates. Although the change was small - from 3 per cent to 3.25 per cent - it caused a much larger shift in investor sentiment worldwide. If the Fed was tightening monetary policy, investors reasoned, maybe inflation was going to be a problem in the US. Furthermore, signs of growing economic recovery in Europe made investors worry about inflation and less confident about further declines in European interest rates. The rise in commodity prices added to the worldwide surge in inflation expectations. Those US investors who were speculating with borrowed money quickly tried to cash in their bond holdings to cut their losses. Bond prices fell sharply and stock markets suffered from the knock-on effect. The UK suffered more than most from the switch. According to Yamaichi International (Europe), 10-year UK gilts yielded 0.47 of a percentage point more than US Treasuries at the start of the year and 0.74 of a percentage point more than German bunds. Those spreads have since widened to 1.11 percentage points and 1.27 percentage points respectively. If inflation is set to return around the globe, investors fear that its level will be higher in the UK, because of the country's past record. 'People have been deeply ingrained with the view that it is always right to be pessimistic about the UK,' says Mr Bob Semple, head of economics and strategy at NatWest Markets. February's cut of a quarter of a percentage point in UK base rates, which came just four days after the Fed increased US rates, may have reinforced the impression that the UK was soft on inflation, and raised doubts about the strength of the UK's monetary regime. 'It is clear that the Bank of England had its arm twisted to agree to a rate cut in February,' says Mr Semple. Since that February cut in rates, the pace of UK economic growth has picked up, prompting the chancellor to agree to a rise of half a percentage point in base rates in September, to head off inflationary pressures. But the markets have yet to be convinced that the UK authorities are in control, and remain pessimistic about the outlook for base rates. Futures markets indicate that traders expect base rates to reach around 6.7 per cent by year end, and nearly 9 per cent by the end of 1995. So although economic growth, by boosting corporate earnings, ought to be good for the equity market, its benefits have been overshadowed by the rise in inflationary expectations, which have led to higher bond yields. For the international investor, the news has been even worse. Sterling's decline this year means that, in US dollar terms, the UK market has underperformed every major European stock market except France. Is the poor performance of the UK equity market set to continue? This year's declines have removed some of the signs that shares were overvalued. The historic price-earnings ratio on the All-Share - the measure used by analysts to compare share prices to corporate profits - has dropped from a heady 25.8 in February to around 17.5 today. The dividend yield on the All-Share is a fraction over 4 per cent, below its long-term average, but well above the 2.8 per cent reached at the height of the bull market in 1987. Furthermore, dividends offer a positive real return (they are higher than inflation) - a situation that has existed only rarely in the last 20 years. The yield ratio, a measure that relates the income return from long-term gilts to that from equities, is around 2.21, close to its average since 1976. According to Mr Ian Harnett, chief economist of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull Securities, this can give investors some comfort since the last three severe market downturns have occurred when the yield ratio was over 2.5. However, for the UK market to recover, it needs to circumvent three obstacles. The first is the danger that inflation may accelerate, and the trade position may deteriorate, just as it has in so many previous UK economic cycles. The result will be sharply higher base rates and bond yields - more bad news for share prices. The second danger is that the government had already acted too hastily in raising interest rates, especially in view of the tax increases to come. The consequence is that economic growth, and corporate earnings, will slow in 1995. The final risk lies across the Atlantic. The UK stock market has fallen farther than that of the US, but many feel it is Wall Street and not London which is the anomaly. If further Fed tightening and a change of sentiment among US private investors causes a sharp fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average this autumn, UK investors could be due for another bungee jump.</p>

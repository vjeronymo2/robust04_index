This opinion was expressed by Economics  Minister Guenter Rexrodt, of the Free Democratic Party of  Germany [FDP], at the beginning of the forum on safeguarding  Germany as a business and investment location, which was  sponsored by his ministry.    For the first time in decades, taboos are being challenged,  intellectual inflexibility is easing, and bureaucratic  ossification in industry and trade is being tackled. The main  task is to get the discrepancy between costs and output under  control and to improve the conditions for excellence in the  spheres of education, science, technology, and development and  their translation into successful products.    Apart from that, individual responsibility in the social  sphere must increase and "work, which is abundant," must "lead  to lasting employment." The struggle against unemployment is  the government's most important goal. There are no patent  prescriptions, "we must embark upon the stony path of structural  renewal."    Uwe Jens, economic-policy spokesman for the Social  Democratic  Party of Germany [SPD] Bundestag group, however argued that  "show events cannot replace competent economic policy." The  repeated attacks against the foundations of the social market  economy by the FDP and its economics minister are only intended  to conceal the years of deficiencies regarding the strengthening  of the growth forces and the economy's competitive strength.    Horst Koehler, the head of the Savings Banks Association,  pleaded for a tax system that is more appropriate to promote  hard work and the "purification" of state administration. The  FRG will no longer be a net exporter of capital for an extended  period of time. Hence, the confidence that was gained in 40  years has to be "carefully cultivated."    The Federation of German Trade Unions [DGB] proposed a  "five-path strategy." The "solid starting position" of German  enterprises, for example in environmental, energy, and  communications technology, as well as microelectronics or  biotechnology must be further developed with the help of an  "innovation impetus." In addition, the country needs an  education and qualification offensive and employment initiative  in terms of economic, industrial, and regional policy.    Active labor market policy must replace the financing of  unemployment through the financing of socially sensible work.  As for wage policy, the system of independent wage talks must  be preserved, and area wage agreements must be geared toward  modernizing branches and regions.</p>

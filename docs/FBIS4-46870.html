			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yevheniya Romaniv: "A :`White Crow' in a </F> Black Business: An Economic Commentary"]    [Text] The wave of auctions in Lvov has crashed against the  reinforced-concrete parapet of prices. Facilities being  privatized cost more than a billion coupons, and this could make  not only work collectives insolvent, but also newly appeared  businessmen and entrepreneurs. Some of these fat moneybags with  dubious credentials have begun to fear that the appropriate  organs really will insist upon declarations regarding their  incomes--something which the police chief has already threatened.    But here's an unprecedented occurrence, which is included  neither in this scheme nor in our understanding of business. One  private firm withdrew its application to participate in a recent  auction because the required packet of suitable documents...  does not provide for the submission of a declaration regarding  income. Just what is all this about?    Teodor Dyakiv, the general director of this firm--which is  named Formula--has interpreted the motives for his action as  follows: "If the people's patience snaps, business will be  ruined; it will not be explained that some of us are conducting  it honestly, and all of us will be completely wiped off the face  of the earth. We have to bear this in mind if we wish to  preserve and safeguard our own business affairs. The situation  in Ukraine's business nowadays is such that it allows  questionably obtained money (shadow capital) and illegally  acquired foreign currency to be used for the purpose of buying  facilities to be privatized. And, as a result of this,  mafia-type groups are able to legalize their own capital, and  foreign firms can buy our properties at prices that are as low  as one-hundredth the amounts required from Ukrainian buyers."    The fact that privatization in Lvov has started down an  illegal, criminal, anti-Ukrainian, and antistate path is no  secret for its organizers. At a recent seminar on the topic of  market reforms Mr. Pakholyuk, the former head of this city's  Communal Property Fund, openly declared that the legalization of  stolen money was being allowed, and predatory foreign capital  was being brought into Ukraine during the course of  privatization. This unprincipled attitude runs through  practically every briefing in the city administration when  matters come up regarding the auctions, privatization, municipal  problems, or the budget. The treasury needs money, and the  mayor's office views the sale of certain nonresidential  facilities as a source of it. Nor do they look too closely at  those persons or firms who pay more for a hotel, barber shop, or  store. But what will be the political consequences of such an  approach? What will be the reaction of the population to this  kind of privatization? Can a so-called middle class of  property-owners--the foundation of economic stability--be  created by following such a path?    None of this coincides at all with Mr. Dyakiv's plans to  begin a national business in Ukraine--one which would not reduce  the people to rags, but rather help to raise their standard of  living. For--sooner or later--we will have to eradicate the  mafia from Lvov, before it has eradicated us. The only  surprising thing is that the process of small-scale  privatization--which would be more suitably termed grabbing--is  being carried out under the monitoring controls of the IFC  [International Finance Corporation]--an independent member of  the World Bank that is working together with 101 of the world's  countries. In order to understand what kind of a goal this  corporation has set for itself, all we have to do is become  acquainted with an interview that Roberta Feldman--an IFC  expert--granted to the newspaper DILO. She openly stated that  consultants for privatization projects are recruited and  selected for the corporation based on the following three  criteria: "knowledge of the country's language, a fundamental  knowledge of economics, and the desire to live in the country  concerned. Experience in small-scale privatization is not a  mandatory requirement inasmuch as very few people have such  experience." And so these are the consultants! All they have to  be is an unemployed economist in the world, and they can come to  someone else's country and teach the people there something  about which they themselves have not the slightest idea! No  wonder we have such lamentable results with regard to our market  reforms.    Nor did Ms. Feldman conceal the fact that the program  entitled "Small-Scale Privatization in Ukraine" is a  high-priority item for the corporation, as well as for the  American Government, which is compensating the IFC for more than  half of its total expenditures on this project. It would be  naive to expect the United States to throw away a packet of  "greenbacks" for the sake of helping the prosperity of Ukrainian  business. Where the interests of Dyakiv's entrepreneurs and  those of Genshaft [as transliterated] clash, for example, Mr.  Teodor Dyakiv can hardly expect aid from the American  Government. Therefore he is knocking on Ukrainian doors for the  time being by way of acknowledging his subordination to the  local authorities. Also lying on the desks of many persons in  high municipal and oblast-level posts are numerous statements of  his and "notes of protest" against the methods of small-scale  privatization, which--in fact--constitute the great grabbing in  Lvov. Mr. Teodor Dyakiv considers that such a document on the  privatization of communal property as "A Declaration on the  Distribution of the Statute Fund Among Its Founders"  unconditionally permits private firms to buy up real estate at  reduced prices on the accounts of other--as a rule--foreign  firms. The authors of a packet of these documents (including  some from the IFC)--to Mr. Dyakiv's way of thinking--do not know  either the principles of the financial functioning of  enterprises with various different forms of property ownership,  or the actual possibilities of the tax inspectorates within the  bounds of their jurisdiction. Therefore, he has proposed that  the participants in an auction submit a "Declaration on the  Origin of Capital," which would include a paragraph to the  effect that the results of a buying-and-selling transaction can  be revoked by a court if the winner at an auction has concealed  the actual origin of his funds. Teodor Dyakiv considers that  competitors will make sure that attention is drawn to the  revelation of such facts. In his opinion this endeavor will  lower the astronomical prices on the facilities being  privatized, increase the real chances of buyers' associations,  and weaken the justifiable opposition to these auctions on the  part of the population. But the most important thing is that it  will impel business toward playing the game honestly.    Mr. Dyakiv has his own plan for carrying out small-scale  privatization. He is proposing that an appraisal be made of the  value of each particular facility, based on a 100-point scale.  Potential participants in an auction would have to have an  independent auditing firm verify the legality of their income  and the absence of unregistered foreign capital. Provisions are  made for according certain measures of relief and assistance to  workers' collectives for the purpose of buying property. As to  the integrity of real estate nowadays, his proposal would see  that facilities located within certain buildings are to be  resold as private property together with the land plots on which  they are situated. And for those persons interested in locating  their businesses there it is proposed to introduce a "leasing  certificate"--a security for restricting the right of property  ownership. However, this certificate would also guarantee the  return to the owner of expenditures (for example, those spent on  repairs) by way of selling the certificate in case its owner  should decide to terminate his business at that location. After  a certain length of time the "leasing certificate" would be  exchanged for a document of ownership, whereas the leasing  payment would be replaced by a tax on the real estate involved.    All these provisions--in the firm opinion of this Ukrainian  entrepreneur--would return business to a place within the  framework of the law. They would also attract a wider circle of  buyers to privatization, as well as making the latter genuine,  accessible, and suitable for a market economy.    Well now, we can only rejoice that some white crows will be  appearing in our business, which--in the imagination of the  masses--is black.</p>

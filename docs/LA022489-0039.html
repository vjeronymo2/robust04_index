			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> JAPANESE PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA OF LOS ANGELES  </P> <P> The Japanese Philharmonic Orchestra of Los Angeles traditionally offers theme  programs. Thus, Wednesday night's annual Dorothy Chandler Pavilion appearance  constituted a "Goodwill Concert between U.S.-Japan."  </P> <P> Conductor Akira Kikukawa paired Japanese violinist Yoshio Unno and American  cellist Nathaniel Rosen in Brahms' Double Concerto. The Violin Concerto No.1  (1963) by Yuzo Toyama got a hearing, but no American music turned up.  </P> <P> Inconsistency ruled the evening. The orchestra produced fine moments  side-by-side with bizarre harmonic and ensemble contretemps. A slow, rather  logy go at Liszt's "Les Preludes," for example, found the brass in firm fettle,  winds capable and cellos united in pitch-true songfulness.  </P> <P> But even if the high strings had agreed in intonation, the whole would still  have fallen short of the sum of its parts. Staggered attacks prevailed, each  section playing well enough with itself, but often in unbidden syncopation with  the others.  </P> <P> Unno's impressive pyrotechnics and warm lyricism carried Toyama's concerto. The  work begins with a difficult extended solo which commanded rapt attention.  Thereafter, the composer waffles wanly between Oriental and Occidental  modalities, and his orchestral requirements (especially of rhythmic intricacy)  eluded this group persistently.  </P> <P> Unno and Rosen (he of the big, burnished tone) served up a rousing Brahms  Double Concerto, reveling in its polyphony and sculpting all those echoing  "anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better" phrases with eloquent urgency. Welcome  orchestral accuracy materialized here, too, adding to the glow.  </P> <P> To open, Kikukawa led a messy but heartfelt reading of Ravel's "Pavane pour une  infante defunte," in memory of Emperor Hirohito.BRUCE BURROUGHS  </P></p>

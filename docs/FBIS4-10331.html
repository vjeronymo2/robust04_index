			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Government Minister Danilo Parinello to the </F> Congress of the Republic in Guatemala City on 8 April; broadcast  in progress -- recorded]    [Text] ...my endeavors at the Government Ministry during  this difficult time, in an attempt to maintain the democratic  process which, with the help of many Guatemalans -- as I have  already said -- we initiated more than 10 years ago.    I cannot say anything more than we are still consolidating  the organization of the Government Ministry which I head and its  many departments. Working with me is Deputy Government Minister  (?Erwin Quesada) who was sworn in just 48 hours ago. I am not  trying to make excuses or rationalizations; I am just pointing  out the facts.    I am grateful, therefore, to the honorable Congress of the  Republic for this opportunity to explain to the Guatemalan  community how we are dealing with these problems that are  fostering anxiety, and, moreover, to inform the people of the  mechanisms through which the ministry will establish increased  security in the short-term, restore the people's confidence and  safety, allow them to live their lives normally, and counteract  the people's lack of confidence in those officials who have  failed to do their jobs.    1. After 17 straight days of continuous work or 12 working  days, the Government Ministry's employees have assessed the  country's security situation as critical. I repeat, the  situation is critical, because it affects all sectors equally.  It is critical because many cases of individual and collective  violence are being reported throughout Guatemalan territory for  a variety of reasons. This violence completely undermines the  legal framework that is the foundation of the de jure state.    If you carefully examine these circumstances, you will  discover two relevant facts -- a shortage of funds and a lack of  justice because of the strike by certain members of the  bureaucracy who work for the security services. You will also  notice there is a shortage of equipment primarily due to a lack  of maintenance, and you will also see that the population is  rightfully demanding an end to social confrontation and  violence, while calling for true security that will improve life  in Guatemala.    2. The Government Ministry, charged with providing internal  security, has an insufficient budget, which has not been made  effective for reasons already mentioned. The ministry's  personnel are working hard but without proper training. Their  morale has become weakened and jaded as the result of the  distorted way in which some groups continue to deal with the  value of general principles of human rights. A great deal of  equipment has proved to be inadequate and obsolete.    Please let me read the assessment made by myself and Col.  Merida -- the other deputy minister who assumed office 17 days  ago and who is with me today. This basic assessment made within  the past few days, as I said, should show you what, in fact, the  National Police are, and what they should be. Again, this is  not the Government Ministry's sole concern, but something which,  as I said a short while ago, can be viewed as a touchstone for  the ministry. If the police force works -- in other words, if  there is security -- the people tend to forget that the  Government Ministry performs many other functions. Therefore, I  will refer specifically to the current state of affairs within  the National Police.    Following a detailed review of all procedures, functions,  members, equipment, and support, we wish to report on the  current status of the National Police.    A. Organization. The current organization of the National  Police includes a number of departments and agencies that are  broken down as follows:    Directorate. The General Directorate is in charge of  outlining policies and delegating responsibilities to all of the  National Police's administrative agencies. This includes the  director general and all of the organization's personnel.    Currently, the Directorate is headed by Salvador Figueroa,  an  experienced lawyer. It is necessary to give you this  explanation, because even historically the government minister  is believed to be a [words indistinct] minister. You must  remember, however, that procedures, instructions, reports, and  [words indistinct] must be directed to the National Police  Directorate. Of course, there is a deputy director, who is in  charge of implementing all guidelines issued by the director.  This position is held by Armando Orellana Flor, a systems  engineer. The inspector general is the third in command. He is  in charge of controlling and ensuring that the deputy director's  guidelines are met. The person in charge of this is Inspector  General Roberto Marroquin Rivas, a professional soldier. It is  also necessary to point out that the police have a Joint  Operations Center that is in charge of coordinating the  activities of all agencies. It has a headquarters, a statistics  section, a communications section, and a section.... [recording  ends in mid-sentence]</p>

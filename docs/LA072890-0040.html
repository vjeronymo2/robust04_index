			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PASSERS-BY PULL WOMAN FROM BURNING VEHICLE  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol on Friday credited several passers-by with saving  the life of a woman whose car rear-ended a truck and was engulfed in flames on  the Golden State Freeway near Castaic.  </P> <P> The passers-by left their cars on the freeway and quickly pulled Lisa Webb from  her burning Volkswagen "beetle" after the 8:30 p.m. accident Thursday.  </P> <P> CHP Officer A.J. Torres said Webb, 27, of Bakersfield suffered second- and  third-degree burns over 30% of her body and was in serious condition Friday at  Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia.  </P> <P> Torres said Webb is being investigated for driving drunk but had not been  arrested because of her injuries.  </P> <P> Webb was driving south at a high rate of speed on the freeway's downslope near  Castaic when she passed a slow-moving car and crashed into the back of a  tractor-trailer going about 40 m.p.h., Torres said.  </P> <P> The Volkswagen became caught under the rear of the trailer and was dragged 900  feet until the truck driver, Kenneth Angel, 28, of Whittier could pull to the  shoulder. Angel was not injured.  </P> <P> "The dragging caused sparks which caught the Volkswagen on fire," Torres said.  </P> <P> At least four passers-by ran to the burning car, authorities said. They were  identified at the scene as Rick Howton of Santee and Christopher Margulas, Lisa  Davis and Anthony Dohrman, all of Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> "Passers-by saw what happened, stopped and pulled her out of the burning  vehicle," Torres said. "Judging by the injuries she had, they probably saved  her."  </P> <P> Webb was flown by helicopter to the hospital. None of her rescuers were  injured, the CHP said.  </P></p>

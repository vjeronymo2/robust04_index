			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> FOREST FIRE PERILS 1,600 HOMES  </P> <P> A fast-moving forest fire threatened up to 1,600 homes in Northern California  today, and a state of emergency was declared for the county where fires have  blackened parts of Yosemite National Park.  </P> <P> "The situation in some of these areas may get worse before it gets better,"  Gov. George Deukmejian said when he declared the state of emergency for  Mariposa County late Monday.  </P> <P> Of the 14 major fires in the state, the biggest was the Campbell Complex that  had burned about 114,000 acres in Tehama County.  </P> <P> But the top priority for firefighters was a smaller Tehama County fire, the  Finley Lake fire east of Red Bluff, that at one point threatened as many as 400  homes in Manton, 200 in Mineral, and an additional 1,000 in the general area.  It had burned 17,500 acres, officials said.  </P></p>

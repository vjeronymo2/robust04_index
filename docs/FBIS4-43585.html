			<p>BFN     [Text] Helsinki, June 20 (AFP) -- Finnish Aid Minister  Toimi Kankaanniemi submitted his resignation Monday [20 June] to  President Martti Ahtisaari after differences of opinion over  Finland's European Union [EU] membership.    Prime Minister Esko Aho earlier Monday denied Kankaanniemi  the right to vote against the government during a ballot to name  representatives to sign the country's EU membership agreement  this weekend in Corfu.    Kankaanniemi was the Christian Party's only representative  in  the government. It is not yet known whether the party will now  leave the government or whether a new minister will be named.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Sidorov: "Moscow Against Air Strikes on </F> Bosnia"]    [Text] It is in Russia's interest for Serbia-Montenegro to  be as strong as possible and for the problems involved in  settling the conflict in the former Yugoslavia to be resolved  peacefully. So said Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma  International Affairs Committee, in conversation with  journalists after the first parliamentary hearings, held at the  end of last week, on a priority area of Russian foreign policy  -- Yugoslavia.    V. Lukin made it clear that the West's stance on the former  Yugoslavia does not conform in all respects with Russia's  interests in the Balkan region. Sergey Lavrov, Russian  Federation deputy minister of foreign affairs, made the same  point when addressing deputies. He emphasized that Russia does  not support the idea of air strikes against Bosnian Serb  positions, as proposed by NATO, and has never ever advocated  such methods for resolving the Yugoslav conflict. He reminded  people that the UN resolutions permitting coercive measures  against any side in the Yugoslav conflict contain tough  restrictions. Such measures are possible in the event of an  attack on humanitarian aid convoys, violations of the "closed  skies" regime by the sides' military aircraft, or the creation  of obstacles to the activities of the UN peacemaking forces. As  the Russian diplomat pointed out, the NATO leadership's recent  statements of readiness to make strikes against Serbian  positions have not contributed to the process of negotiations on  the former Yugoslavia. He reaffirmed the immutability of  Russia's position on a Yugoslav settlement, which is aimed at a  peaceful solution.    While rating the direction of the Russian Foreign Ministry's  activities at present as "correct" on the whole, Chairman Lukin  recalled that the Foreign Ministry had made a serious mistake by  supporting sanctions against the former Yugoslavia last spring.  In the opinion of a number of observers, the State Duma is  faced with the need to make a clearer assessment of Russian  interests in the former Yugoslavia and to elaborate, jointly  with the Foreign Ministry, ways of acting that really can result  in the unblocking of the Yugoslav conflict. The activation of  Russia's policy in the Balkans is becoming increasingly urgent  in view of the fact that the West's leadership has virtually led  the peace process into an impasse. Moreover, there is a real  danger that the military conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina will  escalate to an all-Balkan scale.    The idea was voiced in the parliamentary lobby that the time  has come for serious consultations both with Western partners  and with the most influential Islamic states on the coordination  of interests and the implementation of a more realistic policy  in respect of the Balkans by a particular group of states.  Obviously an alternative does exist to a very dangerous  escalation of the conflict and to extremism in Bosnia. It lies  in support for those Bosnian leaders, including Muslims, who  enjoy the people's support and who have proved the sincerity of  their desire for peace.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LAX DUNE SITE IS NO PEBBLE BEACH  </P> <P> The Times story (July 16) about the 302-acre remnant of the El Segundo Dunes  west of Los Angeles International Airport was excellent, but it didn't go far  enough.  </P> <P> First, most of the area proposed by LAX for a golf course is incredibly noisy  and not necessarily a safe place for outdoor recreation. Heavily loaded 747s  barely make it over the dunes during takeoff, and their roaring jet engines  come close to being intolerable. Hundreds of airplane parts have been picked up  in the area, which should indicate to any reasonable person that there are more  things to watch out for on a crowded golf course than high-flying balls.  </P> <P> Second, it should be thought-provoking that the scientist who performed the  biological survey of the dunes for the Department of Airports (LAX was required  to do it by the state Coastal Commission) is the one who is recommending the  preservation of a larger section of the dunes.  </P> <P> Dr. Rudolf Mattoni's discoveries throughout most of the remnant obviously show  there is much more to preserve and restore than LAX has been willing to  consider. Indeed, there are species of insects and plants found no place else  in the world that he believes may be more endangered than the El Segundo Blue  Butterfly.  </P> <P> Third, Councilwoman Ruth Galanter's proposal to protect more of the dunes and  split the golf course into two parts is not only sensible but farsighted.  Department of Airports officials, including the Board of Airport commissioners,  have heard similar suggestions for years, but they have opposed them.  </P> <P> About 40 acres on the LAX Northside Development property, east of the dunes,  was an old, unused Nike site owned by the federal government. It was turned  over to the airport some time ago for the token sum of $1. Since the Department  of Airports will make a handsome profit no matter how the land is used, I can't  think of a more appropriate location for a continuation of the proposed golf  course.  </P> <P> An open recreation area under falling objects and in 100 decibels of noise can  hardly be compared to Pebble Beach, but that's the way the airport sees it.  Golfers deserve a safer, less-frightening place to play their games -- a place  off to the side rather than directly beneath the takeoff pattern of the biggest  commercial jets.  </P> <P> The ecosystem of the fragile dunes is irreplaceable and in need of restoration.  The more we can preserve of this one-of-a-kind area, the better chance it has  to survive.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Galanter is on the right track.  </P> <P> SALLIE DAVISON  </P> <P> Playa del Rey  </P></p>

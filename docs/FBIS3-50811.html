			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roger Suarez] </F>   [Text] The Conservative Popular Alliance (APC) of Dr.  Miriam Arguello and the Nicaraguan Democratic Movement (MDN)  have issued their respective communiques outlining their  official positions on participation in the National Assembly and  support for constitutional amendments. The APC's latest  communique, which appeared today in a paid advertisement, stated  that its deputies will fully join the Assembly sessions "to  support any constitutional amendment bill that entails profound  and substantial changes."    The MDN, APC, and UDC were expelled from the National  Opposition Union [UNO] for failing to support the plan for a  political movement to demand to hold elections for a constituent  assembly. The MDN stated in a communique dated 30 December that  "it is not possible to continue using the same strategy used in  1993, and that active participation in the National Assembly is  necessary to keep the electoral pledge it made to the people of  Nicaragua."    "We regret that the partisan and personal interests of some  parties within UNO wish to ignore the 1990 mandate of the people  and call for the election of a constituent assembly to change  the government, something that is not mentioned in any UNO  document," the MDN indicated. The MDN feels that summoning a  constituent assembly is not viable, "let alone changing the  current government."    The APC, in turn, stated that the country's need to make  substantial changes in its legal system prompted it to  participate in the National Assembly. "It is essential that we  approve laws to definitively settle all disputes that place  obstacles in the path toward an adequate climate of confidence  for investments, such as the solution to the ownership problem,"  the APC communique noted.    Another reason the conservatives headed by Miriam Arguello  and Francisco Anzoategui gave for returning to the National  Assembly was that the dispute that has lasted over a year in the  Assembly prevented the approval of legitimate laws. In  congressional circles, Arguello's appointment as chairwoman of  the commission in charge of studying and issuing a report on the  constitutional amendments is taken for granted.    The APC board of directors stated in its communique that it  has decided to maintain relations with parties, institutions,  and trade groups that wish to make a positive effort to find the  path toward solving the nation's problems. The board members  affirmed they will maintain the party's independence regarding  their positions and decisions in line with their principles and  programs.    The expulsion of the UDC, APC, and MDN from the UNO ranks  and  the announcement of marches in favor of the constituent assembly  are creating internal friction in parties such as the PSD  [Social Democratic Party]. During a meeting of the PSD National  Executive Center [CEN] yesterday, there was a heated debate  about the party's official position to support the summons to a  constituent assembly.    The Social Democratic Women's Front today harshly criticized  PSD Secretary General Alfredo Cesar, accusing him of taking the  party to extremist stances. The social democratic women issued  a communique asking that a general assembly be held to hold new  general elections to replace or confirm the current CEN and to  consider the PSD's participation or exclusion from UNO.</p>

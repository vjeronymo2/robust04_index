			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DELAY EXPECTED IN AUTO POLICY PRICING SYSTEM;  </P> <P> INSURANCE: COMMISSIONER ROXANI GILLESPIE'S GOAL ON NEW REGULATIONS WAS THE END  OF NOVEMBER. ADVISERS SAY THEY NEED MORE TIME TO ANALYZE DATA.  </P> <P> Doubts arose Tuesday over whether Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie can  meet her goal of promulgating new regulations for the pricing of auto insurance  by the end of this month.  </P> <P> One of the members of a three-member panel appointed by Gillespie to seek  compromise solutions for implementing provisions of Proposition 103 said it may  take to the end of January to analyze data needed to make her decision.  </P> <P> The consumer member of the panel of actuarial experts said that while insurers  have become cooperative in providing computerized data on which to base a new  pricing system, there must be enough time to fully evaluate its effects.  </P> <P> Otherwise, said J. Robert Hunter, head of the National Insurance Consumer  Organization, there could be unpleasant surprises for millions of policyholders  when the principles of the new system are put into practice.  </P> <P> Proposition 103 implementation has been plagued by months of delays, but Hunter  said the actuaries are reluctant to rush just to meet the latest deadline and  want complete computer analysis of their proposed rate-setting formula before  finally recommending it.  </P> <P> Proposition 103 states that a driver's safety record, the number of miles  driven annually and the number of years of driving experience should be the  most important factors in setting insurance rates instead of the home address  of the driver, as has been the case.  </P> <P> But Gillespie has stated repeatedly that such a change could result in premium  increases for 70% of the state's 18 million drivers and decreases for only the  30% concentrated in the most heavily congested urban areas. For months, she has  delayed promulgating regulations while she sought a compromise interpretation  of Proposition 103 that would minimize price adjustments.  </P> <P> Finally, the commissioner, under pressure to act, set a goal of doing so within  30 days of the Oct. 30 start of comprehensive Proposition 103 implementation  hearings and named the actuarial team of experts to help her.  </P> <P> In the meantime, representatives of a coalition of minority and low-income  groups have been insisting in testimony at the hearings that the present system  of neighborhood-based pricing has resulted in racial and class discrimination  and that Proposition 103's pricing provision should be interpreted as literally  as possible, even if some policyholders get rate increases.  </P> <P> The insurance companies first called last summer for retention of  neighborhood-based pricing, no matter what Proposition 103 said, but since then  most have bowed to the initiative and agreed to accept some revision in their  pricing methods.  </P> <P> Hunter on Tuesday said he was supported in delaying a decision by the two other  panel members -- Michael Miller representing the insurers, and Deputy State  Insurance Commissioner Ray Bacon, a top deputy to Gillespie. Miller and Bacon  could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Hunter did not say what kind of compromise pricing solution the actuaries are  contemplating. He lauded Allstate, State Farm and the Insurance Services  Organization, the insurers that have been providing pricing information to the  actuarial team, for their help.  </P> <P> Gillespie's special counsel for the implementation of Proposition 103, Karl  Rubinstein, responded to Hunter's remarks by saying that while Gillespie is  eager to proceed, she may prudently decide to wait if all the information is  not in.  </P> <P> In another insurance development, the staff of Gillespie's state Department of  Insurance formally recommended that a request by insurers to raise  assigned-risk auto rates by a statewide average of 112.3% be rejected.  </P> <P> The staff said such an increase could result in many drivers, unable to afford  insurance, illegally becoming uninsured. The staff members said the companies  that run the assigned-risk system -- under which drivers who cannot buy auto  coverage in the regular market are assigned to various companies in proportion  to their share of the business -- should propose less costly reforms.  </P> <P> The staff recommendation is subject to approval by Gillespie, who has not taken  a position.  </P></p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Measured response to Sinn Fein expected The government was last night preparing a deadpan response to the latest attempt by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political arm, to secure clarification of the Downing Street Declaration. Mr John Major met senior ministers including Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, to consider draft comments understood to do no more than restate existing policy. The government is expected to publish its commentary, along with Sinn Fein's questions, today or tomorrow. The government has come under pressure from unionists and some Conservative backbenchers not to say anything that might be interpreted as opening negotiations with republican leaders. Ministerial aides have been playing down expectations at Westminster, pointing out that many of the questions raised matters that could be resolved only in talks between Ulster's constitutional parties. As the cycle of violence in the province continued with the shootings of two workmen in north Belfast, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, seemed to pave the way for a negative response from republicans. 'There has been growing concern among many nationalists that the British government may squander yet another opportunity to advance the peace process,' he said. Yesterday's killings by loyalist gunmen brought to 28 the total of murders this year in Northern Ireland.</p>

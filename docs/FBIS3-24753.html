			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The British minister of state for foreign and  commonwealth affairs and overseas development, Baroness Lynda  Chalker, said today that the government will assist Malawi to  rehabilitate areas holding Mozambican refugees after they have  been voluntarily repatriated. Baroness Chalker was speaking  after visiting (Pawanyi) refugee camp in Mwanza. She said  Britain was pleased to be involved in the care of the Mozambican  refugees through, among other things, the provision of materials  for use in the camps.    Earlier, the national coordinator for refugees in Malawi,  Mr.  (Alfred Ntara), said that since the signing of the peace accord  between the Mozambican Government and the Renamo movement,  345,000 Mozambicans have freely gone back home. Mr. (Ntara)  however said there was need to rehabilitate the refugee-holding  areas because of the wanton cutting down of trees which has  taken place in these areas.    There were nearly 1.6 million Mozambican refugees in Malawi  before the signing the Mozambican peace accord.    And speaking in Lilongwe at the official hangover of the  Lilongwe-Salima road to the Malawi Government, Baroness Chalker  explained that an effective road network was vital to the  country's development. She said that the 15 million pounds  which her government provided for reconstructing the road was  the largest aid package to Malawi in recent years and calls for  proper utilization and maintenance of the road.    In his remark at the ceremony, the minister of works,  Honorable Jodder Kanjere, expressed gratitude for the support  the British Government renders to the Malawi Government. Hon.  Kanjere said it was the wish of the Malawi Government that the  cordial relations between Malawi and Britain should continue in  all spheres of development in the country. He said that the  road will boost Malawi's tourism industry as it is the main link  between the east and the west. The construction of the 78.4 km  road began in 1990 and ended in September last year. The road  was constructed at a total cost of 62 million kwacha.    Baroness Chalker has since left the country at the end of a  three-day visit to Malawi. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1625 GMT on 20 June carries a 10-minute "Details"  program which features an interview with Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev by correspondent Vera Kuznetsova.    Asked whether Russia's position at the Partnership for Peace  talks has weakened with regard to NATO, and whether this is the  reason why he is rushing off to Brussels, Kozyrev replies:    "What rush? There is no rush. To begin with, most other  states have already signed, only a few remain. We are trailing  right at the back of this process. But I don't think that this  has happened because we have been asleep or idle all this time.  Simply we have our own difficulties. It is one thing if a  small poodle tries to walk through these gates, but quite  another matter when an elephant like Russia tries to do the same  thing.    "No one is rushing us, and we are in absolutely no hurry,  but  we are not falling behind either. We have no such objectives.  We have a completely different objective, purely and simply  pragmatic. We believe that when NATO came to understand our  logic, and when we were able to work out the documents, such as  the framework -- well, that was not real work, but still, we  had to weigh up, consider, and discuss everything. So, when we  worked out this protocol, we then signed it when we were ready.    "Is it right that everyone is offered the same document?  Some people here believe that we should not sign such a  document because, they say, mighty Russia should not sign just  like other states. Well, I don't even know which is more  prevalent here, ignorance or cheap arrogance. If we talk about  the practical reason, well, then the situation is somewhat  different. I had to have an urgent meeting with the U.S.  secretary of state on an absolutely unrelated matter, namely  Korea. We are such a huge country, and this is obviously  acknowledged in this protocol. Eastern politics are as close to  us as those of the West, because Korea is also near abroad for  us, if you want. When one goes to Vladivostok, it becomes clear  that if something happens on the Korean peninsula, bomb blasts  will be heard there as well."    After a comment by program presenter Sergey Dorenko to the  effect that Russia's present position with regard to NATO could  equally be interpreted as a weakening of a formerly militant and  harsh stance, or as a great diplomatic victory, Kozyrev  concludes:    "There will be no economic G-8 summit this time, and I must  say that we were ready for this. However, half of the entire  agenda is already meant to include eight countries. I must say  that after two years of Russia's existence in its new capacity,  that is not a bad result."</p>

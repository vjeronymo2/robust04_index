			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Pay shows sign of rising trend Signs that pay is starting to climb during the recovery appear in earnings surveys published today. They show that the trend of decreasing salary rises for managers appears to have ended and may already have been reversed. Managers' pay did not rise as much last year as in 1992, but remained well ahead of inflation and pay rises for other employees. Managers' earnings rose 4.5 per cent in the year to January, the fourth successive year in which they have recorded smaller increases than the previous year, says the Institute of Management's annual survey of more than 20,000 managers. It says directors' pay rises fell back slightly from 6.5 per cent to 6.1 per cent last year. The value of managers' and director's bonuses, measured as a percentage of earnings, has increased in the past year to 13.9 per cent although it remains below the 1988 level of 16.3 per cent. The gross earnings of managers, including allowances, rose 2 per cent last year and directors took home more than 3 per cent extra. But their earnings would have to leap by at least 7 per cent in the coming year to avoid any cut in take-home pay resulting from this month's rises in tax and National Insurance contributions. Other indications of an upturn in the rate of executive salary increases have emerged in a report by Sedgwick Noble Lowndes, the pay and benefit consultants. It records a marginal rise in the median base salary award. 'This is the first indication we have seen for several years of a rise in executive pay awards,' said Mr Andy Christie, the company's remuneration consulting director. 'It is too early to predict an upward swing in 1994, but we believe the figures may be evidence at least of an end to the downward trend that began four years ago.' The reports of management pay increases coincide with a series of above-inflation wage agreements recorded by Incomes Data Services, the pay analyst, in a report published today. Burton Group has awarded 32,300 retail staff and managers merit rises of up to 5 per cent and has switched staff in 18 stores to higher pay grades in response to labour market pressures. Mr Roger Young, director of the Institute of Management, urged managers and directors not to complain too loudly about this month' higher taxes. He said: 'Managers and directors are still receiving better pay rises than the rest of the workforce.' They might think the percentage is small, but when compared to those who have had to take a pay freeze or who have lost their jobs, they have done very well.'

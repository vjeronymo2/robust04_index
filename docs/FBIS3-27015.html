			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Despite Festival, Savings Soar"] </F>   [Text] Bank deposits have risen dramatically across the  country since the beginning of this year, despite the  traditional shopping spree during the New Year and Spring  Festival holidays, according to official sources.    By the end of January, personal savings in domestic banks  hit  a total of 1,480 billion yuan ($172.1 billion), an increase of  some 3.7 billion yuan ($426 million) over December.    Of the total, fixed time deposits accounted for some 70 per  cent, which enhanced the lending strength of the country's banks  for the national economy.    Analysts say the savings increase indicates that the  country's high interest-rate policy still poses significant  attraction for people to keep their savings in the banks, thus  easing inflationary pressure on the domestic market.    "In an effort to encourage deposits, the bank saving  interest  rate is at its highest since China launched economic reform in  1978," said Zhou Rongfang, an official with the Interest Rate  Department of the People's Bank of China, the central bank.    In January, the Industrial and Commercial Bank, a leading  savings bank, saw individual savings in its Beijing, Tianjin and  Shanghai branches increase almost 2.2 billion yuan ($255  million) from the previous month.    Li Lan, a bank official, said that the corporate bonds and  shares in the securities exchanges have not yet become  attractive enough to draw money away from bank savings.    Ordinary Chinese still believe the best way to protect their  savings from devaluation is to rely on the bank saving interest  rates, which now stand at an annual rate of 10.98 per cent for  one-year fixed deposits," he explained.    Many Beijing depositors say that they knew little about the  shares listed in the stock exchange, and were unwilling to take  the risk of investing their lifetime savings in them.    "We are counting on our bank savings to support our  children's education and the opportunity of buying an  apartment--the biggest item on the spending list of most Chinese  consumers," said Xiao Wang, who, along with his wife, work for a  foreign-funded firm in Beijing.    Zhang Qingshou, Vice-President of the Industrial and  Commercial Bank, said his bank will carefully use its saving  deposits, which are the source for more than half of its bank  loans, to ensure a sound implementation of its lending plan this  year.    This year, more than 60 per cent of the bank's loans are  expected to support the country's industrial enterprises, and  the rest will be earmarked for commercial loans, Zhang said.    Prompted by the strong backing of bank loans and the buoyant  domestic market, the country's industrial enterprises also saw  their output grow 33.2 per cent in January over the same period  last year.    A constant rate of production, said an official with the  State Statistics Bureau, was, to some extent, driven by  improvement in product sales.    The bureau's figures show China's retail sales reached 119.2  billion yuan ($13.8 billion) last month, an increase of 22 per  cent from the same month last year.</p>

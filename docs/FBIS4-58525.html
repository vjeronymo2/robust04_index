			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Information Minister Michel </F> Samahah by unidentified reporter on 4 May, following "the  signing of the Israeli-PLO agreement"; place not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Samahah] Having seen what has taken place in Cairo  this morning, I would like to say that in spite of attempts to  embellish things, we have witnessed an agreement of concession  and the relinquishment of the Palestinian people's rights and  Palestinian land. The cause has been put aside. At the signing  ceremony this morning, Mr. 'Arafat gave up even the title the  Arabs have granted to the president of the state of Palestine.  I believe Israel continues to follow an arrogant and sly path.  This sustains the hatred that cannot coexist with peace and  under whose canopy peace cannot flourish. Peace can only  survive in an atmosphere of justice, and the recovery of rights.  Rights cannot be regained while Jerusalem remains besieged by  an agreement and while the Palestinian people have not even  regained their basic rights. I believe this is more of an  arrangement between dealers than an agreement between two  countries, or between a country and a people whose rights are  being regained.    [Unidentified correspondent] Your Excellency Minister  Samahah, this is on the national level, on the Palestinian  level. Why this apprehension by the Lebanese authorities, by  the Lebanese Government toward this agreement?    [Samahah] Because I view this agreement as being the final  Gaza-Jericho agreement. After it was signed today, it is no  longer Gaza-Jericho First. Thus, rights have been squandered,  and an unjust basis for peace has been established. We fear for  the peace process following this signing and believe the peace  course is full of mines.    [Correspondent] On the Lebanese level, what impact will this  agreement have on the Lebanese arena, that is, with respect to  the issue of resettlement, and the issue of the presence of the  Palestinian refugees in Lebanon?    [Samahah] If the Israeli leaders or Mr. 'Arafat believe that  through such an agreement they will legalize resettlement, they  will be ignoring the Palestinian people's rights, which we did  not give up and which we want to maintain unharmed. We want to  maintain these rights completely, in terms of the right to  repatriation, the restoration of rights and land, and the right  to citizenship on Palestinian land. Second, in the preamble of  our Constituttion, we have reiterated our rejection of  resettlement. The Lebanese are unanimous on this principle.  The rejection of resettlement is not motivated by a  regionalist, or chauvinist approach, but by our concern about  Palestinian rights in Palestine and about our rights as Lebanese  on our land and concerning our sovereignty.    [Correspondent] Minister Samahah, do you believe the  conclusion of this agreement will complicate the other tracks,  the tracks between Lebanon and Israel, and between Syria and  Israel, or will it facilitate these tracks?    [Samahah] This agreement has given us an example of the kind  of agreements by which Israel seeks to convert the countries  around it into suburbs. We reject this. Therefore, we reject  this unfair agreement. On the basis of what was agreed this  morning, the agreement cannot be a comprehensive one. I believe  the negotiations will be more complicated than some tend to  believe. The future will tell.    [Correspondent] Your Excellency Michel Samahah, thank you  for  this interview.</p>

The aim of the survey was to gain an insight into business concerns as the economy prepares to move out of recession, which, with uncertainty about future economic policy caused by the election, has forced companies to pay the highest attention to raising efficiency and cutting overheads. The emphasis on costs and cash, mentioned by more than nine out of 10 companies in the sample, gives the impression, Coopers said, 'that whilst little can be done to affect external factors, management is looking at controlling internal factors to compensate for this'.</p>

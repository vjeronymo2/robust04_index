			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH STUMPS FOR GOP IN VIRGINIA, N.J.  </P> <P> President Bush, stumping today for underdog GOP candidates for governor in  Virginia and New Jersey, talked of everything but abortion, the lightning-rod  issue in those and other off-year contests.  </P> <P> In a pair of campaign appearances for Republican J. Marshall Coleman, who  trails Democrat Douglas Wilder -- who would be the nation's first elected black  governor -- Bush sounded themes familiar from his own presidential campaign.  </P> <P> He said Coleman would be the state's best hope in dealing with crime, drugs,  taxation, environment, education and a strong military. He even dusted off an  issue that mired his 1988 campaign in controversy -- prison parole procedures.  </P> <P> But even as the President campaigned on those issues, the divisive abortion  question promised to figure in voters' calculations at the polls on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Bush's visit came a day after an anti-abortion group accused four TV stations  of refusing to air its pro-Coleman ads. Also on Thursday, Wilder was confronted  by angry hecklers who called him a "baby killer" for his pro-choice stand on  abortion.  </P> <P> The abortion question also figured as an issue in the New Jersey governor's  contest. Bush was heading there later today to try to boost Republican Rep. Jim  Courter's long odds against Democratic Rep. James J. Florio.  </P> <P> In Richmond, Bush called Coleman "the right man to lead Virginia in the battle  against drug abuse. The war on drugs isn't a war of words. Anyone can talk  tough -- but talking tough doesn't keep dealers off the street."  </P> <P> In a speech in Norfolk, Bush said Coleman "understands that the Old Dominion  doesn't need old ideas -- like the liberal creed which blames everyone except  the criminal."  </P> <P> "He wants the end of a hit-or-miss parole system that lets hardened drug  dealers prey on society," Bush said.  </P></p>

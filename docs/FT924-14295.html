			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Markets: Financial services in the jungle - Serious Money A JUNGLE of wild beasts and tangled growth: this is not the Amazon or even your neighbour's back garden but the financial services sector according to a survey published this week by Mintel, the market research group. The paper, entitled Customer Service in Personal Finance, used the analogy to describe the development of the financial services industry. Banks and building societies, for example, are expanding into non-traditional areas, sometimes in a manner detrimental to the core service they are meant to provide. Nowadays, few banks and building societies are there simply to give you an account for your savings or a loan to buy a house. Instead, they have become tied agents for insurance companies and the commission earned from the sale of insurance and pensions is becoming an increasingly important part of their business. Last year, for example, Nationwide earned Pounds 125.5m in commission from the sale of products such as endowment mortgages, house contents insurance and pensions. These products are enthusiastically promoted. Most people will have received plenty of junk mail from their bank or building society advertising a new health insurance product or a pension. Some, such as Midland, invite their wealthier customers to see the bank's financial adviser. Yet the banks and building societies apparently find it too expensive to write to their customers to let them know of a new account when it replaces the one they are in. While banks spend more of their time behaving like investment product salesmen, investment houses are behaving more like banks in one area. But they are at least making things simpler for the customer rather than selling a more elaborate product. This week, Fidelity Investments has made changes to its cash fund which will make it very similar to a high interest savings account. Even the populist name under which it is being marketed - Easy Access Cash Account - is indistinguishable from those of a bank or building society savings account. But the account offers taxpayers a significantly higher interest rate than is available on most instant-access accounts because it is invested in money-market instruments - short-term deposits of large banks. Money market rates change daily but are usually around those of base rates, now 9 per cent. Yesterday, for example, the fund was paying 9.3 per cent gross on Pounds 1,000, which is 1 to 2 points higher than what is on offer from most deposit takers. The change that Fidelity has introduced is to seek approval from the regulatory authorities to rebase the price of units in the fund to Pounds 1, with the unit price remaining a stable Pounds 1. This is made possible because there is no bid-offer spread on a cash trust - just one price for the units. So, instead of the investor having to work out what his units are worth, Fidelity will add income in units of Pounds 1 every month. Income will still accumulate on a daily basis but in a separate account. The change will make it easily apparent to investors how much they have in their account. If you hold 8,514.6 units, you know that you have Pounds 8,514.60. The annual management charge is 0.5 per cent on the account but this is deducted before the gross yield is paid out. Withdrawing your money from the fund is similar to operating a postal account. Customers are provided with withdrawal slips and cheques are sent three or four days later. A telegraphic transfer facility is also available. Another distinguishing feature of the Cash Fund is that it is the only cash unit trust for which a chequebook is issued. You need to have a minimum of Pounds 5,000 in the account to get the chequebook and a Bank of Scotland Gold Mastercard. There is a drawback - the minimum sum for which you can write a cheque is Pounds 250, but you can use this to pay off bills or large purchases. However, there is no facility for standing orders or direct debits. This, taken with the chequebook restrictions means it cannot be a substitute for a current account but it is a highly attractive alternative to a building society high interest account. Non-taxpayers may, nonetheless, find it easier to stick with their bank or building society. These accounts have the advantage over cash unit trusts of paying income gross without the need to reclaim tax. Cash unit trusts may not pay income gross, although the investor can reclaim tax in the usual manner. The cash fund is covered by the Investors' Compensation Scheme, under which the first Pounds 30,000 of an investment can be refunded, followed by 90 per cent of the next Pounds 20,000. This is better than building society compensation which is limited to 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000. Simplifying the fund's pricing will make it more accessible and that must be welcome in the tangled growth of the financial services jungle.</p>

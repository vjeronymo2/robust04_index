			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Window of opportunity HAVING WON a decisive victory in the cold war, the western powers seem determined to lose the peace. Instead of co-operating, they indulge in bitter conflicts over trade policy. Instead of exploiting a once in a generation opportunity for reconstruction of the erstwhile Soviet Union, they procrastinate. The west can, and should, do better. Today's meeting in Washington on humanitarian aid for the states of the former Soviet Union and this weekend's meeting of the group of seven leading industrial countries in New York are where to start. Mr Mikhail Gorbachev left behind a country reduced to social, political and economic rubble. This may have been necessary if reform were ever to be attempted. But the long-predicted hyperinflationary collapse is now under way. The resultant crisis has given democratic reformers an opportunity, but no more than a brief one. Should they fail, far uglier forces lie in wait. This thought alone should goad the west into action. It is not merely that a stable, democratic and market-oriented Commonwealth of Independent States is devoutly to be wished. It is that the alternative is horrible. The west must help give both the citizens and the armed forces a stake in the future. Otherwise, it might find itself confronting nuclear-armed conflict within and uncontrolled nuclear proliferation without. Freeing prices True, the government installed by Mr Boris Yeltsin is open to criticism for its headlong rush to price liberalisation, especially when it controlled neither the Russian central bank nor the budget. But it had to start somewhere. Price liberalisation has at least broken the log jam, just as it did in Poland in the summer of 1989. But, unlike in Poland, there is no Solidarity government waiting in the wings. The reforming government is the one now in office. The west should help make its reform work rather than carp at its incompleteness. Set against that objective, the agenda of the conference in Washington is too limited. Humanitarian assistance is necessary, but is not sufficient. Experience in eastern Europe shows that stabilisation and price liberalisation can fill the shops with food. But pouring food aid onto a hyperinflation is like emptying a bucket of water onto a desert. Radical reform What is needed is a sufficiently radical reform to shift the economy from a collapsed centrally planned economy into a market economy, however halting and infirm. The main elements of such a minimum bang are price liberalisation, monetary and fiscal stabilisation and privatisation. The request for western aid to help stabilise the rouble must be granted not several months from now, when membership of the International Monetary Fund has been agreed, but now. Equally important will be technical assistance for the energy sector, food distribution and the creation of workable fiscal and monetary systems. Meanwhile, Russia and the other leading successor states must move to privatise retail and wholesale trade, transport and agriculture as quickly as possible. None of this is fundamentally different from what has been needed in eastern and central Europe. But in the case of the former Soviet Union, its huge, impoverished and embittered armed forces justify an exceptional form of assistance: direct budgetary support. While the economy is being stabilised and a new fiscal system put in place, the west should meet a substantial part of the budgetary costs of the armed forces. It can kill two birds with one stone by demanding radical nuclear disarmament in return. The most powerful criticism of generous government-to-government aid is that it strengthens the state against the people. For once that is its justification. The reforming governments need to be strengthened above all against a reactionary bureaucratic and military class. At last the west has real reformers to help. So if the G7 does not decide this weekend to substitute decisive action for vague words of support, it will deserve to be renamed the seven dwarfs.</p>

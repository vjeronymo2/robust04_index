Wildlife subject to this notice is subject to detention, refusal of clearance or seizure, and forfeiture if imported into the United States. Violators may also be subject to criminal or civil prosecution. On April 21, 1994, the CITES Secretariat issued Notification to the Parties No. 800 urging the Parties to suspend imports of certain animal species from the following twelve countries: Argentina, Azerbaijan, China, India, Indonesia, Latvia, Lithuania, Peru, Republic of Moldova, Togo, Ukraine, and the United Republic of Tanzania. This notification was based on a decision made by the CITES Standing Committee during meeting held in March, 1994, which asked CITES Party countries to suspend imports in certain animal species from the affected countries. This action was required by CITES Resolution Conference 8.9, adopted at the Eighth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties in Kyoto, Japan, in 1992, which established a procedure for developing remedial actions and implementing them through import suspensions, if voluntary compliance by exporting countries is not satisfactory. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This notice is effective on December 7, 1994.

Article IV, paragraph 3 goes on to require that exports of Appendix II species be limited in any way necessary to ensure that the population level of a species is consistent with that species' role in its ecosystem and that the population level of that species be maintained well above the level where it might qualify for inclusion in Appendix I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Over the past decade, CITES parties have become increasingly concerned that certain Appendix II species are subject to particularly high volumes of trade without sufficient biological data for Scientific Authorities to make the necessary judgments that exports are not detrimental to the species, as required by Article IV. In 1983, CITES parties adopted a resolution at the Fourth Conference of the Parties in Gaborone, Botswana, acknowledging that many parties are not effectively implementing Article IV and thus risk losing the benefits of continued availability of these resources. This resolution, Conf. 4.7, established a project to identify Appendix II species involved in significant levels of international trade, and to develop and negotiate with exporting and importing countries whatever measures were necessary to bring trade down to levels consistent with Article IV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1987, at the Sixth Conference of the Parties in Ottawa, Canada, parties charged the newly established CITES Animals Committee with the task of establishing a list of Appendix II species being significantly affected by trade, reviewing all available information, and formulating remedial measures for these species. The CITES Secretariat coordinated or contracted for studies to develop lists of mammal, bird, and reptile species and collect relevant information about these species, in cooperation with the IUCN World Conservation Union. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) cooperated with and provided financial support for a number of these studies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tashkent, June 6 (YONHAP) -- U.N. Security Council  sanctions against North Korea over its suspected nuclear arms  program would be substantial and phased, a senior South Korean  Government official said Sunday.    The official, accompanying President Kim Yong-sam on his  state visit to Uzbekistan, said the Security Council would begin  discussing sanctions Monday.    "Sanctions the U.N. Security Council will apparently impose  would be so substantial as to cause pain to Pyongyang and would  be enforced on a phased basis," he said.    The official said he saw no problems stopping the Security  Council from imposing sanctions since Russian President Boris  Yeltsin promised to support sanctions and China, too, is deeply  concerned about North Korea's arbitrary replacement of fuel rods.    As to the reason for phased sanctions, he said it is because  the North Koreans still have a chance to ensure the transparency  of their past nuclear activities.    "Though nuclear fuel rods have been replaced, North Korea is  still able to ensure its nuclear transparency through special  IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) inspections or in  other ways dictated by the IAEA," the official said.    North Korea, he added, has yet to reprocess the spent fuel  rods taken from the country's 5-megawatt atomic reactor.    Meanwhile, the official said no particular military  movements  by North Korea have been detected although Pyongyang is  repeating its existing policy in a barrage of statements in  connection with the international move toward sanctions.</p>

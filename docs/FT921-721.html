			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Syria to buy Chinese nuclear reactors SYRIA'S parliament has approved draft agreements for the purchase of two small nuclear reactors from China, the Lebanese newspaper Al Hayat reported yesterday. Damascus promised to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty during a recent visit by Mr Hans Blix, director of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In exchange for its compliance, Syria will be allowed to operate a 24 megawatt Chinese-made research reactor under IAEA supervision, according to Al Hayat. Syria also announced this week it had established diplomatic relations with the Moslem former Soviet Republics of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan during a tour of central Asian republics by Mr Farouk Al-Sharaa, the Syrian foreign minister. Mr Al-Sharaa will also visit Armenia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine. He is accompanied by officials from the ministries of planning, economy, agriculture, information, culture and energy. Syria has a substantial Armenian population and established diplomatic relations with Armenia this month. Before the break-up of the Soviet Union, Moscow was Syria's principal arms supplier and a leading trade partner. Syria's diplomatic initiative may be an attempt to restore military and commercial exchanges with the independent republics.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Poland announces IMF pact POLAND has reached conditional agreement with the International Monetary Fund to regain access to IMF loans, the finance minister, Mr Andrzej Olechowski, said yesterday, AP reports from Washington. Mr Olechowski said the IMF agreed that the Dollars 4.5bn deficit in the budget the Polish government plans to submit to parliament this month was 'a necessary one'. He said the projected deficit would meet the IMF demand that it not exceed 5 per cent of the gross domestic product. During a 36-hour visit to the US, Mr Olechowski met with officials at the IMF, the World Bank, as well as with the US treasury secretary, Mr Nicholas Brady. He told a news conference at the Polish embassy that if the proposed budget is approved, Poland would gain access to Dollars 1.5bn in IMF loans. He said he also discussed a Dollars 1bn commitment from the World Bank. Another Dollars 1bn will be sought from other countries. Asked if he expected additional financial assistance from the US, he replied, 'We remain confident we could always count on some support.' Mr Olechowski said the IMF 'will be assisting us in seeking additional foreign financing'. Poland was declared out of compliance with IMF guidelines last summer. Mr Olechowski went on to say that an IMF task force will visit Poland next month. He said he expected the budget to be submitted to parliament on March 23 and that the debate should take one or two months. The government of the prime minister, Mr Jan Olszewski, has sought to back away from the strict market reforms he blames for rising unemployment and economic decline.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISCAL PICTURE FOR MUSIC CENTER IS BRIGHTER  </P> <P> The situation at the Music Center of Los Angeles County is very different from  OCPAC, in part because it is a very different organization, a complex but  well-established interlocking of the resident performing companies, the Music  Center and the Music Center Operating Company.  </P> <P> Economic indicators may be down, but the Music Center -- the public-private  partnership that serves the resident Music Center companies as an umbrella  fund-raiser -- is launching a long-range plan that proposes a 15% increase in  fund raising for 1991.  </P> <P> "We're concerned -- no question -- about the (economic) environment," said  Esther Wachtell, president of the Music Center. She reports that the demand for  the services of the resident companies -- the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Center  Theatre Group, Los Angeles Music Center Opera, the Los Angeles Master Chorale  and the Joffrey Ballet LA/NY -- and the Music Center Education Division has  risen 20% in 1990.  </P> <P> "We plan very far in advance," Wachtell said. "Over a year ago, we developed a  strategic plan, which went into effect in July." This plan mandated a goal of  $17.6 million for 1991.  </P> <P> "It's very early -- this is preparation time for us -- but from what we can  gather, we are right on target," Wachtell said.  </P> <P> From that money comes the budget for the Music Center itself, and large  contributions to the resident companies, such as $4.4 million to the Los  Angeles Philharmonic for the 1988-89 season, or the cash infusions to the  Joffrey Ballet. Although the resident companies receive government support, the  Music Center funds are entirely from the private sector.  </P> <P> The Music Center also does not book or produce presentations, so it cannot lose  money at the box office. The resident companies present other performing  groups, and the Music Center Operating Company books the facilities for the  times -- basically only a few weeks in the summer -- when the resident  companies are not using them.  </P> <P> The Operating Company, which is charged with the maintenance of the facilities,  is supported in part through the county of Los Angeles, but mainly through  rents that the resident companies pay.  </P> <P> The resident companies naturally find themselves in varying conditions.  Philharmonic subscriptions are up and the company is moving ahead with  ambitious plans, as is the Music Center Opera, which recently announced the  $1-million donors to its Angel fund-raising program. Subscriptions are down  slightly for the Master Chorale, with a lame duck music director and no  successor named, and the financial woes of the Joffrey Ballet have been much  reported  </P> <P> The Center Theatre Group has been buoyed by an infusion of cash from its tenant  at the Ahmanson Theatre, "The Phantom of the Opera." The rental necessitated  moving the Ahmanson play series to the Doolittle Theatre in Hollywood, where  it's reported to be running at a break-even level; the books for the CTG's  other half, the Mark Taper Forum, have recently shown a slight surplus.

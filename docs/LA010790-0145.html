			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TASTE MAKERS  </P> <P> In the Dec. 24 article "The Eighties Taste Makers," Calendar writer Lawrence  Christon selected Eddie Murphy and Roseanne Barr to represent comedy. These  choices seem to relate to Christon's reference to "seething mean-spiritedness"  in his Page 3 article in the same issue, "Putting the '80s Behind Us."  </P> <P> Barr has announced that she will stop male-bashing in her stand-up routines.  Murphy, however, has carried his old-fashioned female-bashing from the verbal  to the physical in his misogynic movie fantasy, "Harlem Nights."  </P> <P> The Murphy item in "Taste Makers" states that "his stardom had nothing to do  with the small range of his acting." If Mr. Christon had wished to mention  comedians who are also talented actors, he could have chosen Oscar nominees  Robin Williams and Whoopi Goldberg or Steve Martin. Robin and Whoopi also  deserve credit for their humanitarian efforts.  </P> <P> BOB FARLEY  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

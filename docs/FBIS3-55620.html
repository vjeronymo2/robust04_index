			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As BELAPAN has learned at the National Bank of  Belarus [NBB], there are two principal discrepancies between  Belarus and the Russian Federation as to the unification of  monetary systems of the two countries. The first one concerns  currency exchange rates. Belarus insists that NBB's bills be  exchanged for Russian rubles at the one to one rate. Russia  demands that the rate be one Russian ruble to three Belarusian  ones. Another controversy is that whereas Belarus demands that  Russia's internal prices for energy sources be extended to  Belarus, representatives of the Russian Government do not agree  with this. The Russian Ministries of Finance and Economy  present a particularly uncompromising position. Yet another  meeting of Russian and Belarusian Government delegations is to  be held in January, at which attempts to solve the problems are  to be made. The visit last week to Moscow by a Belarusian  delegation resulted, as is known, in signing another declaration  on intentions to unify the monetary-credit systems of Belarus  and Russia.</p>

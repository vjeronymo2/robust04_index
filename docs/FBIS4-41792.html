			<p>BFN     [Text] The first constituent congress of the renewed  Communist Party of Georgia was held on Saturday in Tbilisi.    While opening the congress, retired general Panteleimon  Georgadze, leader of the party, declared that the aims of the  communists "remain unchanged -- creation of a free equal society  and protection of the interests of the working people. We want  to return achievements of socialism," he stressed.    While addressing the congress, Filipp Makharadze, veteran of  Georgia' Communist Party and former director of Lenin's museum  in Georgia, died just on the rostrum. However, this tragic  incident has not interrupted the congress.    A representative of the Armenian communists who attended the  congress declared that it "is a death worthy of a communist."</p>

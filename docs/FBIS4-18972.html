			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Serdar Turgut: "A U.S. State Department Obstacle </F> Before Ciller"]    [Text] The U.S. State Department has opposed the  possibility of President Clinton meeting Prime Minister Tansu  Ciller when she visits the United States to hold talks with the  IMF and World Bank officials next week. A high-level U.S. State  Department memorandum to the White House said: "Considering the  political and economic developments in Turkey, President  Clinton's receiving Prime Minister Tansu Ciller twice within a  short time may convey the wrong message to Turkey. The meeting  may encourage particular expectations by the Turkish Government,  expectations that cannot be fulfilled. Considering that the  United States will be unable to fulfill those expectations, a  difficult period may emerge in U.S.-Turkish relations."    The emergence of such a view in the U.S. Administration only  a few days before Ciller's visit has surprised experienced  diplomatic circles in Washington. They have said that the  difference of opinion shows the unease in the U.S.  Administration over Ciller's visit.    A source close to the U.S. Administration's departments  concerned with Turkey has said: "The U.S. State Department is  worried about the Ciller government's future. It has not said  so but it is worried. We know that particular reports have been  drawn up within the U.S. Administration predicting that the  Ciller government will not survive long. So the U.S. State  Department is worried that President Clinton's meeting with  Prime Minister Ciller may convey the wrong message to Turkey."    In addition to the U.S. State Department, Clinton's closest  advisers have also opposed his meeting with Ciller. Only  Jenonne Walker, who is responsible for Turkish affairs on the  U.S. National Security Council, favored the meeting. Walker  reportedly supported the meeting because Tansu Ciller is a woman.    Reportedly, President Clinton may agree to meet Ciller  briefly in New York so as not to disappoint her.    The U.S. Administration is convinced that Ciller wants to  meet Clinton to ask him to support her government in removing  the economic crisis in Turkey. But Clinton can provide no  tangible aid to Ankara because the U.S. budget does not even  have one dollar to spare for an additional aid package to Turkey.</p>

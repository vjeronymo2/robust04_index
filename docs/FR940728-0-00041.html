			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1982 we set the special handling fee at $120. 47 FR 19254 (May 4, 1982). In 1984 we raised the fee to $200 to reflect the actual cost of the service. 49 FR 39741 (Oct. 10, 1984). In 1985, we established the special handling procedures for import statements and documents. 50 FR 46206 (Nov. 6, 1985). In 1991 we reviewed our special handling procedure, but did not increase fees. 56 FR 37528 (August 7, 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have not adjusted special handling fees for almost ten years. Our analysis indicates that to recover actual costs the new fee should be $330. The conditions under which a request for special handling is approved will not change. We are also raising the fee for special handling of mask work claims, which have not changed since 1985, 50 FR 26719 (June 28, 1985), as amended at 56 FR 59886 (Nov. 26, 1991), from $200 to $330.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Full-Term Storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Service Provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Copyright Code mandates storage for the full copyright term of copies or phonorecords of unpublished registered works. It does not specify how long we should retain deposits for published works. Retention is more important in the case of unpublished works because our copy or phonorecord may be the only one in existence. Our policy for published works is to retain deposit copies or phonorecords not selected by the Library for its collections for at least five years from the date of registration; if possible, we retain copies of visual arts works for at least ten years or longer. In addition, we offer optional full-term storage service for those who register published works and want to assure that the deposits will be retained in our custody for the full term of copyright.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Fees for Full-Term Storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Congress authorized a fee for full-term storage in 17 U.S.C. 704(e). Our current charge for full-term storage of published copyright deposits is $135. 52 FR 28821 (Aug. 4, 1987). Our recent analysis of the costs of this service reveals that the actual cost is much higher. Our new regulations increase the charge to $270 for full-term storage of published deposits. We will continue to provide full-term storage of unpublished deposits without a fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Expedited Certifications and Documents Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Services Provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Users may request an additional certificate of registration, or copies of the copyright deposit, the copyright application, correspondence, and other copyright related documents. Frequently the requester needs these services on an expedited basis for compelling business or litigation reasons. The Certifications and Documents Section expedites these services when sufficient reason is provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Justification of Increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fees for these expedited services were established after the revision of the Copyright Code in 1978 and have never been increased. Our new interim regulations increase the fees for expedited services performed by the Certifications &amp; Documents Section to reflect actual costs and expenses. Actual costs for these services include the staff time necessary to travel to and search off-site storage facilities; in contrast, non-expedited requests are mailed to off-site division offices where regular staff can search for the requested material. All of these expedited service fees are surcharges that will be added to the regular charge for the service provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Expedited Additional Certificates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fee for providing an expedited additional certificate, performing a search for a document that is ``in-process'' (where the recordation process has not been completed), or certifying or furnishing a copy of a document has been $18 per hour for almost ten years. These new regulations will raise the rate to $50 per hour.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Copy of Deposit or File Under Copyright Office Control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fee for providing an expedited copy of a copyright deposit stored off-site in a Copyright Office storage facility, or for furnishing a copy of a correspondence file stored either on-site or off-site, has been $18 per hour. The new fee will be $70 for the first hour spent in providing the copy and $50 for each additional hour. The first hour is more costly because it reflects time expended by several staff members. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Copy of Deposit or File Not Under Our Control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Expedited provision of a copy of a deposit or correspondence file stored off-site at a Federal Records Center, a more remote site not under the control of the Copyright Office, has also been $18 per hour. It is being increased to $135 for the first hour and $50 for each additional hour. This service costs more to provide because support services are more numerous and time-consuming and must also cover the cost of returning the deposit or correspondence file to the Federal Records Center.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Reference and Bibliographic Searches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Services Provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Copyright owners and users frequently need to get information on registrations, renewals, and transfers and other documents relating to copyright. Our records on these copyright related facts are public and are available for public inspection. A researcher can either come to the Office during regular business hours and perform a free search (with assistance from Copyright Office staff) or the researcher can have someone else perform the search. Several organizations provide such services for a fee. In addition, the post-1978 records of the Copyright Office (and the bibliographic records of the Library of Congress) are available on-line via the Internet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Reference and Bibliography Section of the Copyright Office will perform an expedited search of these public records for a fee when there is a compelling reason to do so. The Reference and Bibliography Section regularly performs searches of Office records at the statutory rate of $20 for each hour or fraction of an hour consumed. Before January 3, 1991, that section performed approved expedited searches for the statutory $10 hourly fee plus an additional charge of $20 per hour for the expedited service with a two hour minimum charge (a $60 minimum). Since then, the statutory fee has been $20 per hour, bringing the minimum to $80.00. Under the new fee schedule the charge for approved expedited searches is $100 for the first hour and $50 for each additional hour plus the $20 statutory fee for each hour.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Piotr Adamowicz: "Offended `Solidarity' </F> Threatens"]    [Text] If in the immediate future the government does not  implement the demands of Solidarity, the trade union will  organize strikes. The National Committee [KK], which held a  session on Wednesday [16 February] in Gdansk, negatively  evaluated the prime minister's reply to the proposal to meet  with Chairman Marian Krzaklewski.    "It seems that the prime minister does not want to hold this  meeting at all," said KK Spokesman Piotr Zak regarding Pawlak's  letter. In reply to the proposal submitted by Krzaklewski, the  prime minister stated that "it is a bad tradition to transfer  any conflict to the central level," and he pointed to the  negotiations that are going on in the Labor Ministry. He  suggested that, during those talks, Solidarity should try to  discuss its tasks. The meeting between the prime minister and  the chairman should be held at a later date. Krzaklewski did  not conceal his disappointment over the contents of Pawlak's  letter. It was unofficially recalled that last fall the  Solidarity chairman was favorably impressed by Pawlak, and he  counted on his help. Observers recall at the same time that, in  the past, Krzaklewski relied very heavily on the help of Prime  Minister Suchocka; the disappointment turned into enmity that  ended up in conflict.    According to Krzklewski and the KK, only strong and  permanent  pressure on the government will force it to implement the trade  union's demands. By the middle of March, the government should  submit credible guarantees of performing the following tasks:  limiting energy price increases, giving property to the people,  passing a law on collective agreements, respecting the principle  of representation for employee and employer organizations,  changing fiscal policy, and departing from the principle of  centrally regulated wages. Solidarity also demands that the  "Pact on Enterprise" be implemented; it wants corrections to the  budget that would make it possible to perform the  above-mentioned tasks. A strike headquarters has been set up  that will decide the time and form of strikes in the regions and  branches. Solidarity authorities will rely, among others  things, on the secretariats of the Steel Works Industry,  Transport, Mining and Energy, as well as Communications. The  union is setting up a strike fund; the Solidarity authorities  propose that each member pay half of his day's earning, which  would yield as much as 112 billion zlotys [Z].    The resignation of KK Deputy Chairman Leszek Szewc, who was  the head of the election staff, was not accepted. The union did  not receive financial compensation for the introduction of nine  legislators to the Senate. It is a sum of Z1.3 billion. The  Solidarity election committee did not publish its financial  report on the campaign in time. The union's authorities  appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court over the decision  of the Finance Ministry. However, they unofficially admit that  they do not expect a verdict favorable to Solidarity.</p>

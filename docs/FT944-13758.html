			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: JJB chief to net Pounds 13.5m from stock market debut Mr David Whelan, chairman of JJB Sports, the retailing group due to come to the market next month, will make around Pounds 13.5m from the flotation. JJB, which Mr Whelan founded in 1971, is the UK's largest independent sports retailer, operating 115 branches. The float will involve the issue of some 30m new shares and the placing of about 35 per cent, which should raise approximately Pounds 22m, Pounds 8.5m of which will be new money. Mr Whelan and his family interests will retain 63.4 per cent. According to the pathfinder prospectus published yesterday, the board is forecasting operating profits on continuing operations for the year ending January 31 1995 of not less than Pounds 6.5m. Last year the group achieved Pounds 4.71m on turnover of Pounds 41.2m. For the six months to July 31, profits were Pounds 2.54m on turnover of Pounds 24.8m. Historic earnings per share for the year to January 31 1993 were 12.4p. JJB - which has a key-man insurance policy on Mr Whelan worth Pounds 1m - will use the cash injection to pay for its recent move to new premises and look for acquisitive opportunities in the sports retailing market. Mr Whelan said he would use the proceeds of the sale to invest in other areas of the stock market. Remuneration for Mr Whelan and his five fellow directors will amount to a basic salary of Pounds 50,000 each plus 0.5 per cent of profits before tax. Impact day, when the shares will be priced, is scheduled for November 11, with dealings beginning one week later.</p>

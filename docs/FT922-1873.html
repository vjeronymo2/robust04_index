			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / The Maxwells: Lecturer rues his expensive mistake JUST HOURS before his arrest yesterday Larry Trachtenberg was musing on the events over the past decade which carried the 38-year-old American from a lecture hall at the London School of Economics to the dock at Bow Street magistrate's court, alongside Kevin and Ian Maxwell. 'It was an expensive mistake,' he said, referring to the last in a series of career changes which saw the former lecturer in international relations at LSE rise to a sensitive financial position at the heart of Robert Maxwell's empire. Just how expensive will depend on the outcome of the conspiracy to defraud and theft charges which he now faces. But it was already clear before his arrest that the scandal was taking its toll. The enforced idleness at home while waiting for the police and SFO investigation to unfold grated on a man who had spent much of the past seven years involved in the heady atmosphere of City deal-making. The speed with which some former close friends and business associates distanced themselves has also taken its toll. 'It's as if you're carrying around the stench of a dead cat,' he said. Mr Trachtenberg's rise and fall is a classic story of the City in the 1980s. In 1985, Mr Trachtenberg, a computer buff, founded Global Analysis Systems (GAS) with fellow American and Oxford academic, Mr Andrew Smith, and a British partner who eventually dropped out. The original intention of providing high quality on-line analysis of international economic and political developments never really caught on. But it was exactly the type of new media venture which caught the eye of Robert Maxwell, who bought the company in 1987 He was also intrigued by a bevy of new financial products, such as an early global tracker fund, which Mr Smith was keen to develop. The spin-off of the financial products of GAS into London &amp; Bishopsgate International (LBI), a fund management company and financial tool of the Maxwells, was not altogether welcome, at least from Mr Trachtenberg's present perspective. 'I was dragged into the City', he says. But his own transformation from an essentially administrative role to that of a financial operative was quick, though press reports suggesting he was a driving force in the Maxwells' labyrinthine financial dealings are discounted by former colleagues and employees.</p>

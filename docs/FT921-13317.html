			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Nickel rallied from earlier lows on the LME yesterday. Cash prices closed ahead, while three-month metal ended Dollars 65 down at Dollars 7,747.50 a tonne. Dealers said the lower trend reflected a technical downside correction to an overbought market. News that LME warehouse stocks rose by 432 tonnes to 15,252 tonnes, the highest since September 1984, and expectations that ample Russian metal is being stored off-warrant in Europe, indicate that little has changed in fundamentals. LME copper stocks fell sharply because of Chinese shipments. Expectations of further short-term inventory declines helped to cushion the pressure on the market, which has also been overbought, dealers said. Dollar prices closed little changed. Lead prices generally remained under pressure from the effect of the presence of trade selling orders overhanging the market on any move towards Dollars 530 a tonne for three-month metal. London cocoa prices retreated in thin trade, mostly on currency factors, dealers said. Stronger sterling against the dollar, coupled with trade selling, put the market under pressure, despite talk that Ivorian arrivals were between 23,000 and 28,000 tonnes this week and starting to taper off as expected.</p>

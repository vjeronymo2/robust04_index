"I strongly hope the U.S. Government will take sensible  action based on a sensible judgment," the premier said at a  session of the House of Councillors special panel on political  reform. He made the comment in reply to a question by Hidehisa  Otsuji of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party.    Hosokawa also said the Japanese Government will be closely  watching U.S. moves on the matter, in lieu of contemplating  countermeasures to the potential revival of the Super 301 trade  law. Super 301, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1988, gives the  government the right to retaliate against countries which the  U.S. deems to be engaging in unfair trade practices.    U.S. media reports have speculated that the measure might be  revived for use against Japan following the collapse of  bilateral trade "framework" talks and as a result of  Washington's discontent over Tokyo's alleged failure to grant  sufficient access for U.S. firms to its telecommunications  market.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura also called on  the  U.S. to take a cautious stand over the handling of the lapsed  Super 301, reiterating that Japan has already decided to  voluntarily devise a package of measures to further open its  markets, to be announced by the end of March. "The Japanese  Government started making efforts to break a stalemate quickly  and voluntarily," the top government spokesman told a news  conference, adding that Washington should take such moves by  Tokyo into account.    Meanwhile, a government source on Thursday morning said  Tokyo  would file a complaint to the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT) if the U.S. moves to impose sanctions on Japan over  the spat on access to the Japanese cellular phone market.    Saying the revival of Super 301 has already been discounted,  the source revealed the Japanese Government is considering  taking the case to the GATT in accordance with international  rules in order to settle what it perceives as unilateral  sanctions.</p>

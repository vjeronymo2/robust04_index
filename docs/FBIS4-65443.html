			<p>BFN     [Text] Heidelberg (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl said  he is confident that the outstanding economic and social  problems in eastern Germany can be resolved. The most important  thing now is "to live in the spirit of common solidarity", Kohl  said today at the opening of the new offices of a German  research center in Heidelberg. Then one will have the strength,  "to successfully get through the second great beginning for the  second great stage of our republic."    The chancellor reiterated that spring brings with it a "new  upswing in Germany." Order books are filling up again. Kohl  pointed out that economic research institutes are expecting  growth of 1.5 percent in Germany this year and show the carping  critics that they are wrong.    The chancellor urged progress instead of stalling with  regard  to structural changes in the interest of Germany's future as a  business and investment location. "A rethink instead of a  redistribution" is necessary.</p>

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Wine: A world of bargains for every palate - A wine buying strategy for 1992 NATURE seems to be helping Brussels break down Europe's trade barriers. Last year's frost-shrunken harvest in western France, especially of white wines, has had all sorts of interesting side-effects on a hard-pressed industry. Smallholders in the Loire who depend on the disposal of their white grapes or wine for their annual income are probably suffering most. Some of France's larger co-operatives and commercial merchants have been looking, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, over the Pyrenees for white wine to flush through their idle bottling lines. This has led to a change of emphasis for the Midi's militant vine-growing tendency - from anti-Italian to anti-Spanish - and the odd spot of bother in Carcassonne for northbound wine tankers. Safeway has been saving money by using bottling facilities of the Plaimont co-ops in Gascony on its own-label white Spanish Penedes (Pounds 2.69). Some of the larger Loire companies are offering white La Mancha - through gritted teeth - on the principle that at least there is no shortage of this dry Spanish white, unlike the local Vouvray or Muscadet. CHEAPER WHITES Most of the dry Spanish white available in the UK, especially that labelled La Mancha, is very good value, the produce of the handful of large companies which have invested sufficiently in modern winemaking technology. There may be little real character in the wine but for Pounds 2.49 from Sainsbury's, for example, it delivers an extraordinary degree of vibrant fresh fruitiness  -just the thing for those who used to buy Vin de Pays des Cotes de Gascogne which is in short supply. A little further up the price scale, forget the elastic-edged Muscadet region but seek out finds from the highways and byways of what is loosely termed 'regional France.' Just as we had all finally been convinced that white bordeaux was a jolly good thing - sulphur, under-ripe Sauvignon and dirty wood all things of the past - the frosts decimated the 1991 crop. If you are a fan, it is worth snapping up the best 1988s that remain and the fine 1990s. Oddbins and Thresher/Wine Rack have a better selection than most. EVERYDAY RED The shortfall (and less-than-thrilling quality) of 1991 red bordeaux matters less at the bottom end of the market which is still awash with jolly good wine made in 1990 and 1989. Even at the lowly level of AC Bordeaux, on sale here for around Pounds 3 a bottle, there is much pleasure to be had - indeed there is a great deal of sense in buying these, generic commune wines and petits chateaux clarets from the super-ripe 1989 and 1990 vintages to drink now, although traditional merchants would rather sell their stocks of tough 1988s first. The high street chains and supermarkets offer best range and value at this modest level. Also good value, at under Pounds 4 a bottle, are many of the southern Vins de Pays from unfamiliar and parochial Pays. Quality of these was excellent in 1989, 1990 and even 1991. For full-bodied reds under Pounds 5 look to the Cotes-du-Rhone 1989 and 1990. Oddbins has a clutch. NEW WORLD Those looking for a wine to mark 1991 will either have to wait until the port vintage is declared (as it undoubtedly will be) in 1993 or look to California where the signs are that quality was exceptional for reds - at least as good as 1987 and possibly as good as 1974. The California wine industry is shaky and competition from Chile has pushed down the price of Cabernet grapes, so in the medium-term California wine should seem less outrageously priced - surely? Australia continues to offer keen prices and is tackling the need to offer an array of styles. Some of my favourites are the subtlest Chardonnays which meet Old World classics head on but at about half the price, such as Bannockburn (Oddbins), Dromana Estate and Mountadam (Haughton Fine Wines of Nantwich), Leeuwin Estate (Domaine Direct, London WC1) and Seville Estate (Raeburn of Edinburgh). GRAND WINE Last year's vintage yielded precious little to offer futures in this spring. Will the wine trade survive a year without an en primeur campaign to keep the cash flowing? Expect to see extensive discounting of fine wine (Laytons of London NW1 cut its prices on selected 1989 red and white bordeaux as long ago as November) and sales of larger-than-usual bin ends. This is a good time to stock up on the exceptional claret decade just past: 1987, 1985 and 1983 for current drinking; 1989, 1988, 1986 and 1982 for future pleasure. It will probably be many years before we see another run of great sweet wine vintages half as good as 1988, 1989 and 1990. Buy Sauternes and mid-Loire wines for the long term; Alsace, Jurancon and Monbazillac for the medium term and fine German wines at all ripeness levels for current and future thrills. Rhone 1989s and 1990s from the best estates are far more likely to disappear from the market than to disappoint, and Chateauneuf-du-Pape has to be the world's most user-friendly full red. Prices of most burgundies still look like obscene relics of the inflated 1980s but serious collectors will want to buy 1990 reds and 1989 whites from the top domaines. The Beaune merchants' cellars are reputedly piled high with unsold stock; can no one negotiate a deal? For now, Mercurey, Givry and Rully offer best value by far. AUCTIONS Falling prices in the saleroom are all very well, except that they keep potential stock out of it. There are bargains to be had at Christie's and Sotheby's in 1985 and 1986 clarets, vintage port and such fine German wine as come under the hammer - at prices that we will never see again - but be wary of bottles which have crossed the Atlantic twice.</p>

			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> CLEANUP EQUIPMENT REQUIRED FOR PETS  </P> <P> Within several months, most of the county's dog and cat owners who walk their  pets will have to carry equipment to clean up after them.  </P> <P> The regulation, approved by the County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, takes  effect on Aug. 9 for residents of unincorporated areas.  </P> <P> Three or four months later, the same rule will also apply to most other county  residents, said Kathy Jenks, director of the Animal Regulation Department.  </P> <P> "Only Oxnard and Santa Paula will be exempt, because they have their own animal  control departments," Jenks said. She said it will take several months to issue  warnings to residents of cities served by her agency.  </P> <P> Under the ordinance, owners of dogs or cats may be cited if they fail to carry  containers and fail to clean up after their animals. Jenks said it will be up  to the courts to set penalties for those convicted.  </P> <P> The supervisors also voted to allow dog owners to walk their pets at Silver  Strand and Hollywood beaches near Oxnard in the evening and early morning.  </P> <P> Leashed pets will be allowed on these county beaches between 5 p.m. and 9 a.m.  beginning Aug. 9. Owners will be required to carry cleanup equipment when they  walk their dogs on the beach, Jenks said. JACK SEARLES  </P></p>

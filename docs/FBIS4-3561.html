			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Acting Premier Zhu  Rongji and visiting Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak  agreed here today that the two sides will work to find new ways  and means for cooperation and push Sino-Egyptian relations  forward to a new period of development on the basis of mutual  respect, equality and mutual benefit.    In a 30-minute meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse,  where Mubarak is staying, Zhu conveyed greetings from Chinese  Premier Li Peng, who is on a tour of five Asian countries.    Zhu praised Egypt for its successes in pressing forward with  economic reform and improving the people's living conditions  under the guiding principle of peace, stability and development.    "We admire President Mubarak and the Egyptian Government for  following a policy of independence and non-alignment and  actively seeking a political solution to the Middle East issue,"  said the Chinese leader.    He continued that under the care of President Mubarak and  Chinese leaders, China-Egypt relations have enjoyed sustained  and steady development. The two countries have had very good  coordination and cooperation in bilateral political and economic  relations as well as in handling international issues.    Zhu expressed the conviction that Mubarak's current visit  will add a new page to Sino-Egyptian relations.    He also expressed the hope that China and Egypt will have  more effective collaboration, open up new channels for economic  cooperation, supply each with what the other needs and seek  common development.    Stronger Sino-Egyptian ties are in accord with the two  people's interests and beneficial to world peace and stability,  he added.    Zhu also briefed the president on China's economic situation  and its progress in building a socialist market economy.    Mubarak noted that Egypt and China are faced with the same  tasks of developing the national economy and improving the  people's living conditions.    With regard to each other's reform programs, Mubarak said  that both countries have the problem in properly handling the  relationship between development and stability.    He also expressed satisfaction with the sustained growth of  Egypt-China relations and with ever-deepening political and  economic cooperation.    Noting that all his five previous visits to China have  helped  push forward bilateral ties, Mubarak expressed the hope that in  the years to come, top leaders of Egypt and China will  frequently meet to exchange views, coordinate the two countries'  positions and push Sino-Egyptian cooperation to new depth and  width.    After the meeting, Zhu hosted a luncheon in honor of Mubarak  and visiting Egyptian officials.</p>

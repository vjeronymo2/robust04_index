			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Hopes of rate cut fade after jump in earnings Unemployment and the under-lying inflation rate in the UK fell last month but a first-quarter jump in average earnings looked set to keep UK monetary policy on hold for the time being. Official figures showing a seasonally adjusted 36,800 fall in unemployment, to 2.68m in April, and an unexpected drop in the underlying rate of retail price inflation, to 2.3 per cent last month from 2.4 per cent in March, pointed to continued low inflationary growth in spite of April's tax rises. However, underlying average earnings growth was an annual 4 per cent in March. An upwards revision in earnings growth for January and February, by 0.25 percentage points to 3.75 per cent, added to concerns about future inflation even though the acceleration largely reflected bonuses and overtime payments. The publication yesterday of the official minutes of the March 30 monetary meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, suggested that conditions do not exist at present for a change in bank base rates from 5.25 per cent. They agreed that a further rate cut depended on activity weakening and inflationary pressures staying subdued. Speaking on BBC Radio 4 yesterday, Mr Clarke said the recovery had to 'get stronger before every man and woman feels that the country really is showing signs of prosperity and they're more secure in their own jobs'. Yesterday, the Department of Employment announced a clutch of statistics pointing to growing activity in the economy. The number of unemployed claiming benefit as a proportion of the labour force fell to a provisional seasonally-adjusted 9.5 per cent on April 14 from 9.7 per cent the month before and 10.4 per cent in April last year. Fewer people became unemployed in April than in any month since October 1990. Vacancies at Jobcentres increased by 5,300 in April to 145,900, while long-term unemployment fell. Figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that this upturn in activity had yet to affect retail price inflation. Although the 'headline' all-items retail prices index rose by 2.6 per cent in the year to April compared with 2.3 per cent in the year to March, this largely reflected higher taxes. The 1.2 per cent rise in the index to 144.2 in April from 142.5 in March was the biggest monthly increase for two years, but last month's tax changes accounted for about three quarters of the rise. At 2.3 per cent in April, underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, was at its lowest level for a generation. The growth of average earnings prompted more alarm. Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, called for a 'firm check' to be kept on pay settlements so that non-inflationary growth could feed through into falls in unemployment and new jobs.

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Atlas jumps by 35% to Pounds 1.86m Atlas Converting Equipment, the manufacturer of slitting and rewinding machinery, improved pre-tax profits 35 per cent in the half year to June 30, from Pounds 1.38m to Pounds 1.86m, on turnover virtually unchanged at Pounds 19.3m. Mr Christopher Rogers, chairman, said continuing difficult trading conditions had again resulted in low margins, with 'no immediate prospect' of improvement. However, improved results at General Vacuum helped offset lower margins elsewhere. He added that the order book in all divisions led the company to expect an increase in output and profits for the second half. A 7p interim dividend is maintained on earnings per share of 11.86p (10.01p).</p>

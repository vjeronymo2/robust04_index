			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> C. Fee Determination: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The annual rental fee shall be determined by appraisal and other sound business management principles. (36 CFR 251.57(a)). The fee shall be 5 percent of the appraised fair market fee simple value of the lot for recreation residence use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fees will be predicated on an appraisal of the lot as a base value, and that value will be adjusted in following years by utilizing the percent of change in the Implicit Price Deflator-Gross National Product (IPD&hyph;GNP) index as of the previous June 30. A fee from a prior year will be adjusted upward or downward, as the case may be, by the percentage change in the IPD&hyph;GNP, except that the maximum annual fee adjustment shall be 10 percent when the IPD&hyph;GNP index exceeds 10 percent in any one year with the amount in excess of 10 percent carried forward to the next succeeding year where the IPD&hyph;GNP index is less than 10 percent. The base rate from which the fee is adjusted will be changed with each new appraisal of the lot, at least every 20 years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. If the holder has received notification that a new permit will not be issued following expiration of this permit, the annual fee in the tenth year will be taken as the base, and the fee each year during the last 10-year period will be one-tenth of the base multiplied by the number of years then remaining on the permit. If a new term permit should later be issued, the holder shall pay the United States the total amount of fees forgone, for the most recent 10-year period in which the holder has been advised that a new permit will not be issued. This amount may be paid in equal annual installments over a 10-year period in addition to those fees for existing permits. Such amounts owing will run with the property and will be charged to any subsequent purchaser of the improvements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. Initial Fee: The initial fee may be based on an approved Forest Service appraisal existing at the time of this permit, with the present day value calculated by applying the IPD&hyph;GNP index to the intervening years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. Payment Schedule: Based on the criteria stated herein, the initial payment is set at $* <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  per year and the fee is due and payable annually on * <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (insert date). Payments will be credited on the date received by the designated collection officer or deposit location. If the due date(s) for any of the above payments or fee calculation statements fall on a nonworkday, the charges shall not apply until the close of business of the next workday. Any payments not received within 30 days of the due date shall be delinquent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F. Interest and Penalties: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A fee owed the United States which is delinquent will be assessed interest based on the most current rate prescribed by the United States Department of Treasury Financial Manual (TFM&hyph;6&hyph;8020). Interest shall accrue on the delinquent fee from the date the fee payment was due and shall remain fixed during the duration of the indebtedness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. In addition to interest, certain processing, handling, and administrative costs will be assessed on delinquent accounts and added to the amounts due. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. A penalty of 6 percent per year shall be assessed on any indebtedness owing for more than 90 days. This penalty charge will not be calculated until the 91st day of delinquency, but shall accrue from the date that the debt became delinquent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. When a delinquent account is partially paid or made in installments, amounts received shall be applied first to outstanding penalty and administrative cost charges, second to accrued interest, and third to outstanding principal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G. Nonpayment Constitutes Breach: Failure of the holder to make the annual payment, penalty, interest, or any other charges when due shall be grounds for termination of this authorization. However, no permit will be terminated for nonpayment of any monies owed the United States unless payment of such monies is more than 90 days in arrears. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> H. Applicable Law: Delinquent fees and other charges shall be subject to all the rights and remedies afforded the United States pursuant to federal law and implementing regulations. (31 U.S.C. 3711  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> VII.

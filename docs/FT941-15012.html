			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Heseltine to review local authorities' powers Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday announced a 'far-reaching' review of local authorities' enforcement functions, after complaints by business that many responsibilities were duplicated. The move was welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry. But it could clash with the review of local government structure in England being conducted by Sir John Banham for the Department of the Environment. Sir John's Local Government Commission has been asked by Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, to find ways to create all-purpose unitary authorities to replace the two-tier system of district and county councils. Mr Gummer has also recommended that the new authorities should not be very large or remote. However, the DTI's review now appears to be re-examining this advice. Mr Heseltine's review will examine ways to minimise the costs to business and the enforcers in such areas as building and planning control, trading standards, environmental health, food safety and health and safety. The DTI said: 'Concern has been expressed by business, including through the Deregulation Task Forces, about the burdens placed upon them by the number of different inspectors and enforcers who visit them in unco-ordinated ways on similar subjects.' The CBI said: 'We welcome this announcement delightedly. It echoes many of the concerns we have expressed about duplication. We are concerned that there should be consistency and not fragmentation of regulatory authorities. 'A lot will depend on what emerges from the Local Government Commission, but fragmentation has been recommended in Wales.' The Labour-led Association of County Councils said: 'This is going to complicate matters for the local government review. We argued before the Banham review started that the issue of enforcement functions should have been sorted out first.' In the Welsh local government reorganisation, trading standards officers are trying to ensure that trading standards are covered by three large authorities, although Wales will be split into 21 councils. Each council would nominate members for the authority covering its area. The DTI body will include officials from interested departments and representatives of local authority associations. It must report within 90 days.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: US insurers warn on weak state of economy TWO of the largest US composite insurers yesterday renewed warnings about the depressed state of the domestic property market and the impact of this on the sector, although both pointed to the benefits of earlier cost-cutting measures on underlying operations. Travelers, the Hartford-based multi-line insurer, unveiled an after-tax profit of Dollars 317.8m for the year, against its loss of Dollars 178.4m in the previous 12 months. The improvement stemmed from a turnround on the realised investment gain/loss front. In 1990, Travelers made a Dollars 650m pre-tax addition to reserves to cover bad debts on real estate investments and mortgage loans, causing it to register a net realised investment loss of Dollars 566m. Last year, there was a net realised investment gain of Dollars 1m, plus a further Dollars 10.4m tax credit - although the company did add a further Dollars 103m pre-tax to reserves due to the real estate situation, of which Dollars 56m fell in the final quarter. Commenting on the figures, Travelers warned 'weakness in the economy continues to delay any meaningful improvement in the real estate markets', but it claimed to have established 'substantial reserves in anticipation of the environment we foresee'. At Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, net profits fell from Dollars 614m in 1990 to Dollars 505m last year. Again, the difference is largely explained by investment gains/losses and the depressed state of the property market. Its shares rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 45 3/4 . Aetna's 1991 figures are scored after net realised capital losses of Dollars 186m - which included a Dollars 357m after-tax addition to reserves for potential mortgage loan and real estate write-downs. In 1990, net realised capital losses were Dollars 82m, with a Dollars 163m addition to reserves for property-related investments.</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Thinking Machines files for Chapter 11 after shedding jobs Thinking Machines, the company that pioneered the use of massively parallel processing (MPP) technology to build high performance supercomputers, has filed for court protection under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. The Massachusetts company announced it has made about one-third of its 425 employees redundant and plans to reorganise, 'to support the company's existing customer base and aggressively market its technology through licences to other companies'. Founded in 1983, Thinking Machines originated the idea of massively parallel computing; linking thousands of inexpensive microprocessor chips to build a powerful supercomputer. The approach, which involves breaking down big computing problems into millions of discrete elements and solving them simultaneously, has transformed supercomputing technology. 'Together with our customers, we have opened a new frontier in computing. I am sad we have not been able to turn our technical successes into financial success,' said Mr Danny Hillis, co-founder and chief scientist at Thinking Machines. Like other companies in the supercomputer market, Thinking Machines has been hard hit by cuts in US defence spending. Competition from larger companies, in particular IBM and Intel, has also taken its toll. Thinking Machines is not alone among MPP companies in facing financial problems. Cray Computer, a spin-off from Cray Research, has yet to sell a computer and has acknowledged that it faces a cash crisis. Kendall Square Research is also struggling after an accounting debacle in which it overstated sales. Earlier this month the company laid off 80 people.</p>

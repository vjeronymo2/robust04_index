			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Bank supervisor calls for tougher futures regulation A LEADING international bank supervisor has called for separately capitalised subsidiaries of securities houses which trade financial derivatives such as swaps and options to be brought under regulatory control in the US. Mr Brian Quinn, executive director of the Bank of England, said he could see no justification for derivatives subsidiaries of US banks and securities houses not to be covered by consolidated supervision of the parent. Mr Quinn made his call in a speech in which he warned of potential risks to the stability of the financial system from the rapid growth in the Dollars 4,500bn market in over-the-counter derivatives traded by banks and securities firms. Mr Quinn, who was speaking at a seminar organised in Washington by the G30 group of banks and financial institutions, criticised part of a recent derivatives study sponsored by G30 as 'somewhat complacent' over systemic risk. Mr Quinn's caution was supported by other supervisors. Mr William McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank said that it appeared that credit risk was not yet fully reflected in the pricing of derivatives. Separately, Mr Eugene Ludwig, the US comptroller of the currency and administrator of 3,500 nationally chartered banks, called for the creation of a task force to examine banks' derivatives activities. Mr Ludwig said in a speech to the International Institute of Bankers that national banks involved in derivatives should adopt 'no surprises' techniques of risk management that were 'made concrete in systems and controls'. Mr Quinn's call for derivatives units to be regulated follows the establishment of such units by Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers. Under US law, they are not subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr Quinn said that the section of the G30 report on systemic risk 'struck me as somewhat complacent' and the rapid growth of derivatives could be leading to credit risk problems similar to less developed country debt. He said the growth of banks seeking to enter the market could outstrip the number of traders expert enough to handle derivatives. If so, 'there can only be trouble ahead. Derivatives trading is for grown-ups,' he said. He said the G30 report's assertion that market participants should judge for themselves whether to deal with unregulated units 'certainly makes one stop and blink'. Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of JP Morgan and the leader of the G30 study said the study had concentrated most on other aspects of risk, but added that on systemic risk 'if several people thought it was complacent, it probably was'.</p>

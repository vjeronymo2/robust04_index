			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Election 92: Editors try to fend off party pressure THE CALL to Mr Michael Brunson, the political editor of Independent Television News, from a Labour spokesman was very precise. Mr Brunson said a representative of Mr Roy Hattersley, the Labour deputy leader, told him: 'We didn't like that shot.' As broadcasters prepare for a bitterly-fought election campaign, editors are setting out guidelines to help combat pressure from political parties. The Labour complaint, said Mr Brunson, was about a shot used in a news bulletin from a Labour pre-election press conference. The camera had started focusing on Mr Neil Kinnock, the party leader, but moved rapidly to dwell on Mr Hattersley apparently interrupting Mr Kinnock. After a press conference had been filmed, Mr Brunson insisted, ITN was 'not going to doctor the shots' in response to pressure. Another call to ITN was from Mr Shaun Woodward, Conservative party communications chief. He called on February 22 to express surprise that Mr John Major's speech in Glasgow in defence of the union had been pushed into second place on ITN's running order behind the latest developments in Stephanie Slater kidnapping case. Mr Brunson recognised there were 'pressure merchants' and lobbyists and they were only doing their jobs. He added: 'While we listen to them, we are perfectly robust in our dealings with them.' In recent weeks there were signs of a rising number of telephone calls to broadcasters, some of which were merely informal moans. Mr Stewart Purvis, ITN editor-in-chief, has ruled that any substantive complaints should be submitted to him. He would investigate and respond only if they were made in writing. BBC journalists were last night warned to steer clear of controversy during the campaign by Mr John Birt, the deputy director-general. He urged them to report opinion polls 'calmly and unsensationally' and pledged to support staff who may be subject to 'undue or improper pressure'. Mr Tony Hall, the BBC's director of news and current affairs at the BBC, has instructed his editors to keep a daily log of calls received from political parties. Programme editors prefer to deal with the calls themselves, but Mr Hall said he would take action if attempted interference hindered editors doing their jobs. Observer, Page 16</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Vatican-Jordan ties The Vatican established diplomatic relations with Jordan yesterday in its latest move to bolster ties with the Arab world to counterbalance its recent recognition of Israel, Reuter reports from Vatican City. The new relations will also make it easier for Pope John Paul to visit holy sites of the Old and New Testaments before the year 2000. The move, less than three months after the Vatican announced it was stepping up official ties with Palestinians, was also expected to give the Holy See a greater chance of influencing the Middle East peace process.</p>

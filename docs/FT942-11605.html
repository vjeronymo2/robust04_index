			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / London boroughs still on knife-edge: As the campaign closes, several results are far too close to call Breakthroughs by Labour and the Liberal Democrats in London seem a real possibility in today's local government elections. In several boroughs, opponents to the Conservatives have abandoned the usual pre-election cageyness and predict victories. London politics remain more dominated by local issues than virtually any other area of the UK, and several boroughs will not follow the national swing. According to Mr Tony Travers, head of the Greater London group at the London School of Economics, there will be a series of two-party battles, with the impact of the Liberal Democrats, who seem certain to improve on their 15 per cent share of the vote in the last elections four years ago, making a number of elections hard to call. Conservative boroughs will attract the most attention. Statistically the most 'winnable' for Labour are Hillingdon - already won by Labour in a by-election - Enfield, Brent and Ealing. But the Conservatives in Ealing say that the former Labour council's 65 per cent rate rise in 1986 is still frequently volunteered on the doorsteps. They are confident they will keep control. In Tory-controlled Brent the contest will also be very close. Conservative Central Office has repeatedly depicted Tory Brent as a highly efficient council with a low poll tax, in much the same way that Wandsworth and Westminster were portrayed in the 1990 campaign. Mr Leslie Winters, one of the Tory campaign organisers, predicted a 6-seat Conservative majority, up from the current three. But Mr Paul Daisley, Brent's Labour leader, said his party is well ahead in the 5 or 6 marginal wards that they need to win control. In marginal Kingston the Liberal Democrats are the greatest threat, and Mr John Tilley, the Liberal Democrat leader on the council, predicts his party will have an overall majority of at least 2 seats. 'The big surprise was that the Tory vote turned out to be non-existent,' he said. Another band of seats in outer London boroughs will require a greater swing. In Croydon Labour has fought hard to engineer a Tory defeat. Croydon is the biggest London borough by population, Labour needs a handful of votes in the right wards to win control from the Conservatives for the first time. Neither party was confident of victory yesterday. Mr Jeff Dixon, Labour's energetic campaign director, said: 'I'm cautious. It's not easy to believe that 120 years of Tory rule in Croydon could now come to an end.' Sir Peter Bowness, the Tory leader, said the Tory vote was holding in the right wards, but believed that the turnout would be decisive. 'It's vital we get our people out,' he said. 'People must remember it's about who controls this borough.' In Harrow, the Liberal Democrats are the opposition and hope to pull off an extraordinary coup. The Tories have a 10-seat majority, but Mr Ralph Bancroft, Liberal Democrat campaign manager, believes his party could get outright control if it wins seats in 3 crucial Tory wards, where there a large number of 'don't knows'. Mr Donald Abbot, the Tory leader, admits that the Liberals have an 'outside chance' of taking control, but still claims his party has won through. His campaign has emphatically distanced itself from government policy. In Bexley, Labour believes it has a chance of outright victory. Mr Leonard Newton, the Conservative leader, admitted that it had been difficult to persuade voters to consider local rather than national issues and said: 'I'm fairly confident that if we don't keep control then we'll still be the largest party.' Elsewhere, Waltham Forest, Lambeth and Southwark feature strenuous Liberal Democrat campaigns against allegedly 'loony left' Labour councils. Gains of seats, but not of overall councils, seem likely. Tower Hamlets sees another battle between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, complicated by the presence of the far-right British National Party, which won its first ever by-election success in September. Canvassers for the main parties admit there is still substantial BNP support on the Isle of Dogs, scene of the by-election victory. According to Mr Travers, defeats in a further six boroughs would be impossible for the Conservatives to explain away - Bromley, Barnet, Redbridge, Wandsworth, Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea. Labour are carefully circumspect about their chances in Wandsworth and Westminster - the 'flagships' of four years ago when the poll tax dominated other issues. The two boroughs still have the lowest council tax figures in London and Labour campaigners seem pessimistic that this financial obstacle can be overcome.</p>

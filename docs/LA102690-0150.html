			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRESSED TO INGEST;  </P> <P> STREET SCENE: AS DINING BECOMES FOCUS OF L.A. NIGHT LIFE, RESTAURANTS  INCREASINGLY SET THE TONE -- DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY -- FOR WHAT THEIR  TREND-MINDED PATRONS WEAR.  </P> <P> Food and fashion, fashion and food. In Los Angeles the two are as synonymous as  automobiles and smog.  </P> <P> People have always dressed for a night on the town.  </P> <P> But as traditional forms of entertainment like movies, theater and dancing  become increasingly cost prohibitive, spending the evening at dinner has  evolved into a new form of L.A. night life.  </P> <P> And Angelenos are treating these eateries as the nightclubs of the 1990s, often  dressing to suit the environment.  </P> <P> At Beverly Hills-based Bice, for instance, the streamline moderne decor of the  restaurant evokes an evening aboard a luxury cruise liner. And the patrons  dress accordingly.  </P> <P> "They look like the just stepped off the Queen Mary," said one bar patron when  asked to describe the crowd.  </P> <P> Across town at Border Grill in Santa Monica, dressing for margaritaville  includes pretty petite floral dresses, bright blazers, short skirts and, in  some cases, spiked hair.  </P> <P> "It's trendy, hip and young," offers one customer. "On a scale of one to 10,  it's an eight. But ask me again when I've had another margarita."  </P> <P> By comparison, the atmosphere and attitude at Chaya Venice, located off Main  Street in Venice, is weird, funky and a little yuppie.  </P> <P> At quick glance, Chaya Venice appears to be the ladies-who-lunch crowd. But a  regular at the recently opened restaurant more accurately describes the  clientele as "celebrity wanna-bes who work in boutiques."  </P> <P> At Atlas Bar &amp; Grill, owner Mario Tamayo cultivates the more avant-garde  restaurant patron.  </P> <P> Live jazz and Caribbean-inspired food entice one to dress up in everything from  short, floral backless dresses and casual jeans to gold lame cocktail dresses  and tailored Italian suits.  </P> <P> "You come to Atlas to be seen," says one bar customer.  </P> <P> "That's what it's all about. It's what we live for."  </P> <P> Indeed.  </P></p>

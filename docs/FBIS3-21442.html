Upreti: "Khurana Government Has Many </F> Handicaps"]    [Text] After over 100 years since Mughal rule ended, the  Bharatiya Janata Party's [BJP] first empire in Delhi shows an  ironic resemblance to the reign of the last Mughal King who had  the high-sounding title of Badshah without any effective power.    BJP chieftain Madan Lal Khurana is finding it hard to have  his say in the affairs of the capital city under the dominant  presence of the Congress under Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao. With a  truncated statehood under his arm, the Chief Minister's  announcements are evoking amusing responses from his Congress  rivals.    His recent threat to cut off water to VIPs [very important  persons], including Union ministers, in the wake of a water  crisis in Delhi, illustrates the queer status of Delhi's Chief  Minister. The dispute on the sharing of Yamuna waters between  Haryana and Delhi has been used by the Haryana Chief Minister to  bully the newly-stalled BJP Government in Delhi.    The decision of Mr. Bhajan Lal to stop water supply to the  Haiderpur water treatment plant in Delhi despite last month's  agreement had placed Mr. Khurana at the mercy of Prime Minister  P.V. Narasimha Rao, who in all such cases happens to be the  final arbitrator. The Haryana Government's action had reduced  the daily supply of water to the capital by 25 mgd [million  gallons per day], severely affecting parts of the city.  Notwithstanding Central assurance, the Haryana Chief Minister  has kept cocking a snook at his counterpart in Delhi.    Well aware of the Delhi Government's status vis-a-vis other  State Governments, the Congress leaders were only too amused  with Mr. Khurana's threat to cut off water supply to VIP areas,  prompting Delhi Congress Pradesh Committee chief H.K.L. Bhagat  to describe the threat as "childish."    The toothless Khurana Government, which was elected by an  overwhelming mandate last year, finds itself caught in a cleft.  The limited powers of the 70-member Delhi State Assembly would  not permit the BJP to implement the promises it had made to its  supporters in the capital and yet it remains vulnerable to their  criticism for its apparent non-performance.    The constitution of the Assembly excludes it from having any  jursidiction over land and land use, law and order and allows  full Central control over financial matters. Subjects related to  the land are of vital importance in relation to the planned  development of the metropolis but the powers of making any  change in the status quo in land relations are  largely vested in the Union Urban Housing and Development  Ministry.    Similarly, in the case of surface transport, law and order  and other major subjects, the Central Government still occupies  the driver's seat and retains the relevant powers which would be  required by the BJP Government to bring about any meaningful  improvement in the lot of about 93 lakh inhabitants of Delhi.    The megacity, which has the highest suspended pollution in  the world and is virtually crammed with over 30 lakhs vehicles,  requires major legislative changes to streamline the vehicular  traffic and restrict the rising rate of pollution. The  short-lived populist moves in the past, including that of Ms.  Maneka Gandhi, former Union Environment Minister, to check  vehicular pollution had evoked more ire than applause from  Delhites.    The political power attained by the BJP has, so far, allowed  it to implement only those key promises which were also bandied  about by its rival political parties, including the Congress.  The regularisation of 600 jhuggi-jhopri clusters  which existed before March 1993, has, thus, come on the top of  BJP's agenda and is likely to find a smooth passage in the  Assembly.    Apart from taking small steps towards the development of  Delhi which includes making roads better by removing  encroachments, improving streetlights and cleaning right the  abysmally bad lavatories, the Khurana Government has made its  first major political move to book the culprits of the November  1984, Sikh riots in Delhi. The nine-member panel constituted by  the BJP Government has recently indicted over 70 persons,  including Congress leaders like Sajjan Kumar and Mr. Bhagat.    The panel with Mr. Justice (Retd) R.S. Narula at its head  has  accused the Home Ministry of not responding to the CBI's  [Central Bureau of Investigation] application to file a  charge-sheet against Mr. Sajjan Kumar since 1992. However, the  recommendations of the panel, which had Lt-Gen. (Retd) Jasgit  Singh Aurura and academician, Dr. Mahip Singh, as its members,  are unlikely to carry much weight with the Central Government.  It may be noted that even the recommendations of the  Jain-Aggarwal Committee, which was appointed by the Union  Government itself, have not been implemented.    The twin status of Delhi has all the elements which could  create more complications than resolve them. The partial status  of statehood and overlapping jurisdiction of Centre and State is  sure to stoke the fires of political controversy in the coming  months.    The Delhi State BJP currently busy in the selection of the  candidates for the municipal elections will, however, have  relatively more freedom to function in the local body if it  manages to get as big a majority as it did in the Assembly  elections.    A pitched battle is on the cards for the municipal elections  as Mr. Bhagat, the Congress supremo in Delhi, is making a last  ditch effort to re-establish himself and gain the political  ground which he had lost in the Assembly elections.</p>

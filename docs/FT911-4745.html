			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Technology: Getting the best out of IT How do you cut the costs of running your computer operations without jeopardising the long-term efficiency of your business? As the recession continues to dog companies of every size, consultants and academics have devised their own formulae for getting the best out of IT at the least cost. 'Cancel the purchase of any more PCs and make better use of the ones you already have,' is at the top of the list compiled by Martin Healey, of Technology Concepts, in Cwmbran. 'Fifty per cent of PCs are not used to capacity. Healey points out that the costs of just supporting PCs is Dollars 2,000 (Pounds 1,100) per user per year. Rationalise your storage media, says Joe Wilson, sales director for PA Consulting. Companies with several levels of disc back-up should question whether they are really necessary. Do not duplicate information in a number of places - on a central database and on locally-held files, for example. And if programs are out of date get rid of them. Check that cache memory and discs are only used to store information which employees need to use quickly. Put all archive data on less expensive tape or other long-term storage media. Question whether you really need that processor upgrade. 'You can almost guarantee that it can be put off,' says Wilson. Healey also recommends focusing on the business function when introducing new systems. If the task is not central to the business strategy, then delay implementing new systems. If a new system is needed - to exploit a new business opportunity - go for a cheap and simple system, says Wilson. 'There are often desk-top solutions these days which can do the job. It's worth looking at PCs even as just a short-term solution - to see if it works out.' Most consultants also point to outsourcing, or facilities management to introduce a mechanism for the control of spending (see main story). To pin costs of new systems down more accurately Healey says you should calculate the cost of the complete system, not just the cost of computers. Training, for example, can prove an expensive cost. Streamline the software you have. Spending some cash to convert the software to run on a compiler can cut the costs of maintaining the software quite drastically.</p>

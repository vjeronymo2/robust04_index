			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, April 28--The Information and  Broadcasting Minister, Mr K.P. Singh Deo, today said foreign  newspapers would not be allowed entry into India till the  Cabinet had examined the issue in all its implications, reports  UNI.    Replying to a two-day debate in the Rajya Sabha on the  working of his Ministry, Mr Singh Deo said the final decision  would have to be taken by the Cabinet as his Ministry alone was  not competent to decide the issue.    He said the Government's current stand was based on a  Cabinet  decision of 1955 which had disfavoured the entry of foreign  newspapers.    The Jawaharlal Nehru Cabinet had taken the decision  following  the recommendation of the first Press Commission which had  studied the issue of ownership of newspapers.    It had recommended against permitting Indian editions of  foreign newspapers even with Indian equity participation. He  informed the House that the issue had been debated in the  country and there were some court cases.    Mr Singh Deo said the study to be conducted by the Centre of  Media Studies would be completed in eight months at a cost of Rs  one million [rupees]. At the same time, students of the Film and  Television Institute of India were also making their own studies  into this matter as a part of their course.    He said Doordarshan's own coverage would increase vastly  with  the launch in 1995 of INSAT-2B, which would be devoted totally  to telecommunications and information including radio and  television.    He said there were reports that there would be 118 foreign  networks beaming into India very soon and so the Ministry had  written to the owners of the foreign channels and also to Indian  missions abroad to apprise them of the country's point of view.    Talking on the expansion of Doordarshan, he said the Metro  channel was being received terrestrially in Delhi, Bombay,  Calcutta, Madras, Hyderabad and Lucknow. In the second phase,  this will be received terrestrially in all State capitals and  two mega cities, and all other cities in the third phase.    Mr Singh Deo announced that the Supreme Court had vacated  the  stay imposed by Delhi High Court on the scheme for private  producer participation in the satellite channels. However, the  apex court had ruled that any scheme drawn up by Doordarshan  will have to be shown to it.    He said the Government would draw up an appropriate scheme  for participation of private producers since Doordarshan alone  could not produce the programmes to fill the 14,400 hours of  telecast time available per year.</p>

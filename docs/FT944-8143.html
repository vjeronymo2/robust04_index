			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Exam results improving, league tables show The number of pupils gaining five good passes in GCSE exams has increased by more than 5 per cent for the second year running, according to government league tables of school performance published today. However, a Financial Times analysis showed, also for the second year running, a strong correlation between poor GCSE pass rates and social deprivation. The Isles of Scilly, the least deprived area of the country according to government indices, was first in the tables for the third year, while Southwark, an inner London borough, had the worst results for the second time. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, said the results of the exams, taken by most 16-year-olds in England and Wales, showed the success of the government's league tables, first published in 1992. 'This is the foundation of a national treasure trove of information.' She said the percentage of pupils gaining five or more GCSEs at a grade C (equivalent to an old O-level pass) or better rose from 38.3 per cent in 1992, when the tables were first published, to 41.1 per cent last year and 43.4 per cent this year. Mr David Blunkett, shadow education secretary, claimed to have 'leap-frogged the Tories' with a pledge for a future Labour government to publish even more information. He promised to 'highlight schools which are showing real improvements year-on-year in exam results', and to develop tables which showed 'how much added value a school has achieved for a pupil' between their entry to secondary school and their final exams. Teachers' unions remained critical. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: 'They show what anyone with any sense would expect - exam results reflect social background.' A number of local authorities criticised the government's calculations of truancy levels in primary and secondary schools. Manchester, which tops the secondary school truancy table, claimed the figures excluded about 11,000 pupils from a total of 60,000. In one Manchester school, the figures suggested that 30 per cent of pupils were playing truant at any one time. Kensington and Chelsea, placed second behind Manchester in the truancy table, said the government's calculation of the level of truancy among its secondary school pupils was exaggerated by nearly a quarter. The authority said that one of its schools had made an error when filing its return and that Department for Education officials had refused to alter it. However the department said local authorities had been given the opportunity to check their schools' submissions. League tables, Pages 14-16 Tabs on truancy, Page 19 Editorial Comment, Page 23</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOURCES OF NATIVE PLANTS AROUND THE SOUTHLAND  </P> <P> Those who know California's native plants also know that fall is the best time  to plant them, so it is not too surprising that most of the special sales of  native plants -- by botanic gardens and other groups -- occur during the autumn  months. (Natives are hard to find at general nurseries because they look  terrible in containers). Here are some sales coming up:  </P> <P> Fullerton: Every weekend from now through mid-December, the Fullerton Arboretum  will be having their weekend plant sales, which among other things, will  feature drought-tolerant plants and California natives from the Tree-of-Life  Nursery. They also offer to special order any plant you are looking for. Hours  are from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturdays and 1 to 4 p.m. Sundays. The arboretum is  located at the northeast corner of the California State University campus, on  Associated Road, in Fullerton.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara: Santa Barbara Botanic Garden's fall sale is Oct. 21, from 12:30  to 2:30 p.m., and will feature drought-tolerant plants from all of the world,  but especially California natives, including the beautiful but hard to find  bulbs, perennials and iris. The botanic garden is on 1212 Mission Canyon Road  in Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Claremont: Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden holds its annual plant sale Nov. 4,  from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. They will also have other drought-resistant Mediterranean  plants as well as natives. You can even purchase three endangered California  species, which the botanic garden is propagating. A booklet on their care comes  with each plant. The entrance to the garden is at 1500 North College Ave. in  Claremont.  </P> <P> San Fernando Valley: The Theodore Payne Foundation will hold its fall plant  sale on Nov. 4, from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. It is located at 10459 Tuxford St.,  Sun Valley.  </P> <P> Santa Monica Mountains: The Santa Monica Chapter of the California Native Plant  Society, will hold (rain or shine) a special sale of native plants on Nov. 18  and 19, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., at Calamigos Ranch, on Mulholland Highway, 500  yards west of Kanan-Dume Road, in the Santa Monica Mountains.  </P></p>

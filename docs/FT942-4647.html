			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Sharp rise in output increases hopes of recovery The Tory party was given a boost ahead of today's European elections as sharp rises in industrial production and factory output in April raised hopes that the UK recovery was gaining strength. Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, said the production figures were 'the best news on the economy so far this year. Growth is stronger and spread wider'. His upbeat assessment, which was echoed yesterday by the Treasury's monthly monetary report, suggests that the recent downward trend in UK interest rates has ended. The report was issued as Mr Clarke met Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, for their monthly monetary talks. Although the details of the meeting are not released for six weeks, the Treasury report, coupled with the production figures, left most City analysts convinced that the authorities are unlikely to change the base rates from their present level of 5 1/4 per cent. UK money markets currently assume that the Bank will raise interest rates to about 6 per cent by the end of the year as stronger growth fuels inflationary pressures. However, the Treasury report hinted that the chancellor was unlikely to endorse any attempt by the Bank to push rates up in the short term. Although the report does not provide policy prescriptions, it noted that inflation was at its lowest level in April since 1967. It also pointed out that in spite of the recent rise in average earnings, wage settlements remained broadly unchanged. The report's upbeat presentation of the UK recovery suggested little need for a fiscal stimulus in spite of recent tax rises. 'The latest monthly indicators (are) consistent with continuing recovery.' April's figures for industrial production and manufacturing output appeared to underline the strength of the UK economic recovery. Seasonally adjusted, the indicators showed month-on-month rises of 1.6 per cent and 1.1 per cent respectively. That was well above market expectations, which had centred on a rise of about 0.5 per cent for production and output. While the figures were boosted by some one-off factors, such as a fuel output, there were signs of strength in such key industries as engineering. April's oil and gas output passed the previous monthly record, set in May 1987. Analysts were encouraged by the breakdown of the figures, showing production of investment goods growing faster than that of consumer goods. In the past, consumer-led UK recoveries have quickly led to balance-of-payment constraints. Output beats hopes, Page 13</p>

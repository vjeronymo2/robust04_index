			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement: Sinn Fein delays full response Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, signalled yesterday that the Major-Reynolds declaration has sparked off an internal debate within the Republican movement which may take some days to resolve. After the party had held a meeting of its leading officials and councillors at its Belfast offices, it refrained from either supporting or rejecting the declaration outright. The only public comment on the statement came after the meeting from Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, the party's Northern Ireland chairman. He said that the party would 'study in depth' the joint declaration, and compare it with the previous joint proposals of Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein. Mr McLaughlin added: 'Already the general reaction among many nationalists is one of disappointment. This is especially so because of the heightening of expectations in the lead-up to the prime ministerial meeting.' However, reactions within the nationalist community appear to be mixed. This partly explains why Sinn Fein yesterday failed to come out with a more detailed response. Mr Seamus Mallon, the deputy leader of the SDLP, which 12 weeks ago launched its initiative with Sinn Fein, said: 'The declaration is very significant indeed. I would ask those in Sinn Fein and the IRA to read this document very, very carefully indeed. 'If they do then they would recognise there are changes of a pretty substantial nature. On self-determination, if that had been agreed in the 1921 Treaty . . . it could have actually prevented the civil war that followed and the 25 years of violence we have had now.' Mr Brendan Mulgrew, a political researcher working for Mr Joe Hendron, the SDLP MP for West Belfast, said the declaration would put the IRA's sincerity to the test. He said: 'They have said they want peace to come to Northern Ireland. This offers them the best way of getting out of the violence.' Mr Pat Magarth, editor of the nationalist Derry Journal, said: 'This is a compromise which the IRA may find difficult to reject although it has the capacity to go on fighting for another 25 years.'</p>

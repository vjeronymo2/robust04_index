			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Internal Affairs Deputy Minister Zbigniew </F> Sobotka by Aleksander Frydrychowski; place and date not given:  "Promotion Means Joint Responsibility"]    [Excerpt] [Frydrychowicz] First of all congratulations on  your appointment. What will you deal with in the ministry?    [Sobotka] I do not know the specific scope of my powers yet.  They are supposed to be defined at a joint session of the  leadership of the ministry, after Minister Milczanowski returns  to Warsaw -- that is, next week.    I know from earlier decisions that my duties will include  contacts with the parliament, legislation, and perhaps issues  related to the budget of the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MSW].  What else -- we will see.    [Frydrychowicz] You are the first deputy minister of  internal affairs appointed on the basis of the coalition's  "system." I remember Minister Milczanowski saying that he would  like to appoint a competent person to this post. You are not a  lawyer; you never worked in the ministry. What, then, are your  qualifications?    [Sobotka] I was quite familiar with the ministry when I was  a deputy -- it is my third term in office. I now, as well as  previously, work in the Sejm Administration and on the Internal  Affairs Committee. All the problems of MSW are focussed.    I was also a member of the Political Advisory Committee of  the minister of internal affairs.    Important is also the fact that I served in the MSW Vistula  Units.    The problems that I will tackle at the ministry will not be  of a strictly legal nature; my experience will certainly come in  handy in the ministry. I suppose that this is what Minister  Milczanowski took into consideration when he chose me as a  candidate for the post of deputy minister.    [Frydrychowicz] What will your tasks be in the ministry --  as a person sent there by the coalition, or, actually, by only  one part of it?    [Sobotka] I certainly have not come to MSW to watch over the  ministry's head, which various people, unfavorably disposed  toward me, have been trying to imply for some time. The scope  of MSW activities is regulated by law. I will simply be one of  Minister Milczanowski's deputies.    Thus, I have not come to the ministry with special demands;  I  have come here to jointly steer it. The point is not to shape a  separate policy of the ministry, but to participate in managing  it and to bear joint responsibility for the fulfillment of tasks.    [Frydrychowicz] Mass media stresses the fact that you were a  member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Polish  United Workers' Party [PZPR]. Will this experience be an  obstacle for you in the fulfillment of the present function?    [Sobotka] It will certainly not be an obstacle. There is  nothing that I should be ashamed of in that period. The fact  that in the final period of the functioning of PZPR I was a  member of its leadership only enriched my experience in  management. The fact that I participated in the work of the  "round table," that is, in the activities that made it possible  for Poles to reach agreement, is also quite significant.    I suppose that I have often proved that I can quietly  discuss  the most difficult problems and resolve them. Therefore, I  treat my experience gained in PZPR and later in its leadership  as useful in my fulfillment of the present state functions.  [passage omitted]</p>

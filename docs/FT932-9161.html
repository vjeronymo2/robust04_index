			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Properties advance Property shares surged on news from Land Securities that its net asset value (nav) was well ahead of market forecasts. However, property specialists cautioned against taking this as a signal for the rest of the sector, warning that the recovery in the commercial property market could prove highly selective. Land Securities added 6 at 551p, while British Land advanced 14 to 282p, Hammerson 'A' 6 to 306p and MEPC 12 to 418p. Land's surprise nav  - 504p per share against 555p a year earlier and a market forecast of around 490p  - was achieved through an improvement in its central London office yields. But analysts said this was restricted to selected well-located properties and that part of the market remained heavily overlet. Mr Marc Gilbard at NatWest Securities said that yesterday's strong performance across the sector has been a knee-jerk reaction and that investors should concentrate on companies  - such as Land Securities  - which are aiming to improve cash flow. 'What Lands has to do is to justify its new rating by strengthening its cash flow, with a rights issue enabling it to buy more quality properties,' he said.</p>

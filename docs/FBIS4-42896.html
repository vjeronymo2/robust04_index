			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Antoon Wouters: "Belgium Thwarting European </F> Packaging Directive Today"]    [Excerpts] Belgium does not agree with the amendment by the  European Parliament (EP) to the European Directive for packaging  and packaging waste, and will oppose the directive. This was  announced by Federal Environment Minister Jacques Santkin in  Luxemburg yesterday. The issue will be discussed at the  European Environment Council today. Germany, the Netherlands,  and Denmark are also rejecting the directive. Santkin took the  decision at the request of Flemish Environment Minister Norbert  De Batselier, and after a verbal dispute at the interministerial  foreign policy conference.    According to Santkin, the changes made by the EP to the  directive, disturb the balance which was reached at the end of  1993 between environmental protection and the safeguarding of  the internal market. This compromise was reached thanks to the  European Union's Belgian presidency. As a result of the  directive's blocking, the Commission and the Environment  Ministers will have to find a new compromise with the EP.  [passage omitted]    De Batselier and Santkin fear that the amendment could  jeopardize the Belgian ecological tax on disposable packagings.  [passage omitted]</p>

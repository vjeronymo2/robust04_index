			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Petronas PETRONAS, Malaysia's state oil company, may bid for the Philippines state-owned Petron Corporation, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur. 'We see a lot of synergy in what we're doing and what they're doing. We have a lot experience we can share with Petron,' the company said. Last month the Philippines government announced plans to sell 60 per cent of Petron to private investors. Of the equity to be privatised, 40 per cent was to be sold before the end of the year to a partner who would give Petron access to crude supplies and improve its technological and financial capability, the government said.</p>

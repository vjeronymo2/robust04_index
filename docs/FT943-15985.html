			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome finds US support US buying was the motor behind a sharp rise in the price of Wellcome, and some dealers suggested that the pharmaceuticals group was only the most publicised of a number of UK stocks attracting US attention recently. 'The US led the market down, and now that they are worried about their own interest rates they could be ready to put money back in,' said one senior international marketmaker. Dealers said US buyers of Wellcome were active in the London markets for American Depositary Receipts and underlying shares as well as the New York ADRs. The interest was fuelled by chart-based analysts at BNP Securities seeing the stock bounce to 700p if a short term resistance at 618p is cleared. The shares rose 16 to 608p but the volume of 7.9m was flattered by the second half of a tax-related bed and breakfast deal - 6.8m shares dealt at 560p. SmithKline Beecham's position as the most heavily traded stock in London (26m dealt) was also indicative of bed and breakfast dealing.</p>

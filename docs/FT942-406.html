			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Arjo Wiggins Papermakers are smiling again. Prices and volumes for many paper grades are rising nicely with a wave of stock replenishment being succeeded by a pick-up in underlying demand. Eucalyptus pulp prices have risen by more than 50 per cent since the fourth quarter of 1993. The Swedish manufacturer, MoDo, yesterday pushed prices higher on several grades. Given the huge operational gearing in paper companies, such rises rapidly translate into surging profits. But just as life eases for paper manufacturers, their share prices are starting to soften. Arjo Wiggins Appleton, for example, has underperformed the FT-SE All-Share by 7 per cent over the past three months having outperformed by 46 per cent over the previous year. The market had already anticipated much of the good news. Besides, concerns are now focusing on what type of paper cycle it will be this time. Arjo Wiggins Appleton has worked to depress the cyclicality of its earnings in the hope they will be rated more highly at the next peak. The group's exposure to higher value added papers, its merchanting arm and geographical spread all promise a higher quality of earnings. But as commodity producers accumulate cash, they can be relied on to over-invest in new capacity. They would perhaps do better to buy each other and thus consolidate an unhealthily fragmented industry. Takeover talk would then be another reason for pushing paper shares higher.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Survey of Cheshire (3): It's attractive, and not so far - Why companies are relocating to the county CHESHIRE has done well in drawing in new industry because it has one of the best combinations of the various factors involved in attracting foreign investment and British company relocations. Parts of the county were designated assisted areas by the British government and qualified for aid from the European Community. Communications are excellent. Labour is skilled and available. Land, factories and offices are cheap, The quality of life is considered good, with nice houses in pretty villages to live in and a lack of congestion in the main towns. Mr David Collins, economic development officer at Cheshire County Council, says that the county has become the fourth most popular choice of UK locations after Scotland, Wales and the south-east, notably Kent. In the past decade 400 companies have relocated or set up in Cheshire including 200 foreign ones. YKK, the zip manufacturer, is thought to have been the first major wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary when it was set up in 1972. A more recent arrival is Sokkisha UK, which was established in 1987. A subsidiary of Sokkisha of Japan, it manufactures high technology equipment from builders' levels to satellite receivers and surveyors' software. It is moving into a purpose-built 12,000 sq ft building on the 87-acre Crewe business park. It will employ 20 people and chose the site after a long search for an alternative to its current base in Crawley in Sussex. For capital intensive companies the subsidy has been important. Runcorn and Warrington were melded into one new town in 1981. Apart from the government money poured into infrastructure, the two towns were run by one New Town corporation with planning powers and some of Runcorn qualified as part of the Merseyside development area and thus was eligible for regional aid. However, the New Town corporation came to an end in 1989, and the planning powers were transferred to the relevant local authorities. Chester and part of the north of the county around Halton (including Runcorn) and Ellesmere Port still qualify for development assistance on a reduced scale. The other attractions have increasingly become important. Principal among them is the good communications network. The county has the M56 and the M62 running through in a east-west direction and the M6 in a north-south one. Around 15m people live within an hour's drive of the point where the M6 crosses the M62. Mr Michael Aster, whose US company, Aster Publishing, set up its European headquarters in Chester in 1984, says: 'I suppose one of the main attractions is that you can be anywhere in three hours, in Scotland or in London. Communications are very good. Also, you have Manchester airport just 20 minutes away.' Manchester is now the country's third largest airport after London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports. It has gateway status, which means over 40 airlines operate direct scheduled services to the US and Europe. There is little of the congestion which has become a feature of both Gatwick and Heathrow. As well as good communications, Cheshire has factories and offices available at competitive prices. B1 office/light industrial space typically costs Pounds 11-13 a sq ft in Chester, although it can be as little as Pounds 8 a sq ft. This compares with Pounds 15-18 a sq ft in Manchester. All eight districts in the county have business parks of one kind or another, either science parks or warehouse/distribution centres. Warrington's marketing strategy has been based on good communications. It claims that the motorways put it at the very centre of Britain. In the interstices of the motorways, modern quality business space has been built like the Birchwood science park, the Gemini science park and Winwick Quay. The county council and the new town corporation have made more than 500 acres available for industrial and commercial development in recent years. The older business parks such as Birchwood and Gemini are virtually full. One of the latest additions is the 153-acre Chester business park. This is largely made up of B1 light industrial/office premises. The availability of these modern quality buildings close to an attractive medieval town means the county has been able to attract service companies and thus diversify its economy. Chester Park is about half full at the moment. Lettings were going well until the recession. The county council's economic development unit says there is a lot of interest, but it is not translating into definite lettings in the harsh economic climate. Probably the best-known financial service company to establish itself in the county is Marks and Spencer Financial Services, which used to be called St Michael Financial Services. The company set up in Chester in 1984 when the company wanted to expand its pilot credit card scheme in Scotland. Chester was chosen partly because it was a development area and Marks and Spencer received a grant to help build its offices. The company, which deals with financial services including credit cards, unit trusts and marketing, employs 567 people on a full-time or part-time basis. Mr Brian Hudspith, of Marks and Spencer, says: 'The company is very happy with Chester. We have had no problems in finding the appropriate staff.' Elsewhere, the Department of Employment has relocated people to Cheshire and now employs 900 people at its centre in Runcorn. Mr Aster, whose company publishes pharmaceutical magazines and other scientific journals, says that the availability of good staff at reasonable salaries is also an attraction. 'Apart from clerical staff, which is available, we are looking for people who have graduated from one of the many educational institutions around here. Typically they would have moved off to London and now want to come back here because of quality of life available.' He continues: 'I would say salaries are between 10 to 20 per cent lower than London, but then so are costs. Chester is a very pleasant place in which to live.'</p>

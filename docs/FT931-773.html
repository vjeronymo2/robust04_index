			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Private View: A tussle with the sphinx of City Hall THE SPHINX of City Hall was living up to his reputation. Tall, powerfully-built and belying his 75 years, Tom Bradley, mayor of Los Angeles, sat stiffly upright in the ersatz luxury of a hotel suite and impassively rebutted all criticism of his megalopolis. What else could he do? Bradley was in London this week at the start of a European tour, taking in Frankfurt, Paris and Milan, to promote his city as a tourist and investment haven barely a year after its reputation - and large parts of its fabric - were shattered by riots described as the worst in American history. Mayor Bradley has other compelling reasons for his taciturnity. Chief of them is that the four white police officers accused of beating a black driver, Rodney King, are back on trial in a federal court. It was their unexpected acquittal in a state hearing last April that touched off the inner city mayhem. Also, Bradley has discovered the political danger of talking out of school. On a similar trip to Tokyo a few years ago he was reported as saying that 'drive-by' shootings occurred in a limited area of the city and involved mainly black or Hispanic gangs. A remark obviously designed to reassure potential tourists was unfairly translated by a political rival back home to mean Bradley was indifferent to bereavements in black and Latino families. But, more than this, Bradley's identification with the city he has led for a record five terms - he is standing down at the end of June after 20 years - means that every wound it suffers leaves a scar on his own reputation. For, despite the gloom cast over his final year by riot, recession and deficit, Bradley believes his mayoralty - the inward investment, the Pacific links, the 1984 Olympic Games, the new metro system, the after-school education scheme - has been a great success. Even the most sober visitors to Los Angeles, however, are now asking whether the sprawling city of 4m people in a county of 9m is too big to govern. Is it? I asked him. 'No, not by any means,' he said. 'It's a big city, second largest in America. It has many problems, but I think that the richness of the diversity of the city is what makes it special. We are the most ethnically diverse city in the whole world. That offers both a challenge and an opportunity . . . a challenge for people to live together, work together, side by side in peace and harmony. That's been one of our great achievements over the last 20 years I have been mayor.' He might have been quoting a City Hall hand-out. Los Angeles does not fit the common European perception of American cities as moribund ghettoes surrounded by affluent suburbs, he said. It is more diverse than that. Nor does he accept that 'ethnic diversity' can turn out to be a euphemism for warring ghettos and no-go areas. 'The ethnic communities may be separated in part,' he said, 'but you find people of different racial backgrounds in every section of the city, not in conflict, not in disharmony.' What about the sheer pressure of immigrant numbers? Is that something you can cope with? The mayor laughed indulgently. 'From the beginning of our country, we have had large numbers of immigrants who have come in. Immigrants are not the problem.' But unemployment, budget cuts and poor housing had combined to leave people feeling angry, not at other racial or religious groups, but at society as a whole, Most accounts support Bradley's view that last year's explosion was not racial in character, unlike the Watts riots of 1965. The mayor described it as the work of people 'striking out' in an opportunist fashion against any convenient target. The fact that immigrant Korean storekeepers took the brunt of the destruction had 'no special rationale.' So does Los Angeles have a race problem? I asked. 'Not just because of the size of the city. There are people in parts of the city who, because of poor education or lack of jobs, do suffer economically. 'I came from conditions of severe poverty and the city offered an opportunity to me. Based upon the quality of the education I received, I was able to advance, I was able to achieve, I was able to take advantage of the opportunities offered.' Although Bradley has been criticised for being too close to the white business community - and four years ago repaid some private earnings after admitting to unwise financial dealings - his own background gives him every reason to sympathise with the struggling poor and to extol the American Dream. 'The thing that made a difference in my life was good education,' he said, 'a spirit of determination, the confidence and belief in myself and my abilities . . . an uncompromising determination to achieve according to my capabilities.' The second of five children born to sharecroppers in Calvert, Texas (just 20 miles from Waco, where a siege of armed religious zealots continues), Thomas Bradley was taken to Los Angeles by his parents at the age of seven. He graduated from the University of California, then Southwestern University law school and joined the Los Angeles Police Department, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant. His promotion blocked, he resigned in 1961 and practised law until entering politics as one of the city's 15 powerful councillors. It was in the police force that his feud began with Daryl Gates, the former police chief whose maverick rule of the LAPD - a force glamourised in countless films and TV programmes - was exposed after the Rodney King affair by a Bradley-appointed commission. This was led by another local lawyer, Warren Christopher, now President Clinton's secretary of state. But when I suggested that if there was one thing wrong with Los Angeles, it was the police - that they were too few for the job and had acted (according to some residents) like gangsters themselves, Bradley was angry. 'Absolutely untrue. The overwhelming majority of the police officers are professional in their conduct, their training and their performance. Some - and I would say a very small number of them - are engaged in excessive use of force, in discourtesy toward people. But to call them gangsters is an insult. Anybody who says that simply doesn't have the foggiest notion what the city is like or what the police are like.' Until that moment, I had felt rather like Brer Rabbit swiping at the tar-baby and succeeding only in getting his paws stuck. Mayor Bradley, like a confident but cautious boxer in the middle of the ring, would not take a single step back - but nor would he come forward. Except on the subject of education. Perhaps seeing his own career as an example, Bradley returned time and again to the need for education to give inner-city youths some prospect of work, some sense of belonging. He turned down flat my suggestion that the city's own constitution (a weak mayor and strong council) might need reform; but he was prepared to criticise the educational system in the US generally for failing the young, and the Reagan and Bush administrations for withdrawing federal support from cities over the past 12 years. Californians are still the richest people in the US, despite suffering more than most from recession and defence industry cuts. But they have also been reducing their own taxes for years through a series of state referenda. When I suggested that the better-off citizenry did not pay nearly enough tax, Bradley was short: 'I'm not going to get into that argument. What is enough?' I persisted. Are we talking about two societies, the rich on their surfboards having a great time and the wretched people in the inner city who, once in a while, break loose and burn the place down? 'You're trying to get an answer in 15 minutes that takes sociologists a lifetime of study. I'm not going to try to give you some simplistic answer to very detailed and complex problems.' He resisted, likewise, my invitation to identify the chief task of the successor who will be elected mayor next month. 'Every candidate has lived there for years. They know, or should know, the problems and the opportunities. It's not my responsibility to try to help them to find what their programme should be.' Still, I said, after 20 years you might be entitled to express a view, however tactfully you put it. 'Except that I don't do that. I don't engage in advice to candidates.' You have managed a big city for as long as anyone on earth, I said. 'And very successfully,' Bradley put in. So you must have some wisdom to purvey to the rest of us - the millions of us - who live in cities. 'I don't think you can compare one city like London with Los Angeles and try to find a simplistic slogan that would be the answer to the problems of all the cities of the world,' he replied. When he steps down, Tom Bradley is to join a Los Angeles law firm. I asked him what he would be doing for them. 'Soliciting clients.' At 75, I said, don't you want to sit down and put your feet up? 'No,' he smiled, but without enthusiasm. 'I wouldn't think of that.'</p>

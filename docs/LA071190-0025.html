			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BURBANK EXTENDS AIRPORT LAND-USE CURBS FOR 2 YEARS  </P> <P> The Burbank City Council on Tuesday extended for nearly two years development  restrictions on land around Burbank Airport, part of a plan to convert the area  to cleaner industries.  </P> <P> By a unanimous vote, the council extended an interim development control  ordinance passed in May to buy time for city planners to make permanent zoning  changes and formulate a general plan for the 1,000-acre area, stretching  roughly from the airport to the Golden State Freeway between Empire Avenue and  Cohasset Street.  </P> <P> The ordinance affects nearly all of the 300 acres to be vacated by Lockheed  Corp., which announced in May that it will pull much of its operation out of  Burbank by the mid-1990s. The departure of other firms that are dependent on  the aerospace giant for business may make even more land available.  </P> <P> City planners view the available land as an opportunity to re-create the  northwestern corner of Burbank, which has been dominated by Lockheed since  World War II.  </P> <P> Although many speakers at Tuesday night's council meeting supported the goal of  attracting cleaner industries, they urged a speedier decision on permanent  planning changes.  </P> <P> Council members originally approved the ordinance on May 29 for 45 days. At the  end of that time, they were required to extend it, amend it or discontinue it.  Tuesday's vote extended the ordinance to June, 1992, but requires a second  review and vote by the council within six months.  </P> <P> Many residents and businesses -- including Lockheed itself -- have criticized  the ordinance because it may frighten new firms out of locating in the area.  </P> <P> The ordinance requires new projects in the area to go through the planned  development process, which includes hearings before the planning board and the  City Council.  </P> <P> That way, city officials can manage development in the area while they create  formal controls. Without the planned development process, projects inconsistent  with the city's plans theoretically could have slipped through, Community  Development Director Bill Kelly said.  </P> <P> In response to tougher state and federal environmental laws, Burbank officials  hope to phase out polluting heavy industries. Tentative plans call for a  commercial center with retail outlets concentrated along the Golden State  Freeway.  </P> <P> Lockheed spokesman Ross B. Hopkins said Tuesday that the ordinance "sends the  wrong signal to the business community. It says Burbank is not interested in  creating jobs and bringing revenue to the city."  </P></p>

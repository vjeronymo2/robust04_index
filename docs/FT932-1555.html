			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Observer: BT3 - the end Roll on July 14 when the third and final sale of BT shares will bring to an end the appalling TV adverts for the offer featuring the bumbling Inspector Morose played by comedian Mel Smith. Dreamt up by advertising agency WCRS, the BT3 campaign is (for anyone fortunate enough to have missed it thus far) a weak parody of Thames TV's Inspector Morse series, based on Colin Dexter's opera-loving detective. Actually, Observer can put viewers out of their misery even sooner by revealing how the whole thing ends. The mystery share-buyer turns out to be none other than John Thaw, the actor who plays Inspector Morse in 'real life'. The showdown is in the south of France, scene of Thaw's poorly-received appearance in another TV series, Peter Mayle's A Year in Provence. Do hope this little bit of inside information doesn't result in the BT3 issue staging an equally spectacular flop.</p>

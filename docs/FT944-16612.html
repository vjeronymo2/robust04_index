			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries forge ahead as rate rise fears recede US Treasury bonds forged ahead yesterday as fears of an immediate increase in short-term interest rates dissipated. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/2 higher at 95 27/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.856 per cent and the two-year note was  1/16 better at 99 27/32 , to yield 6.601 per cent. Bonds opened with solid gains and advanced steadily until late afternoon, when prices receded from their best levels of the day. The positive tone in part reflected technical conditions created by the extreme bearishness that had preceded Friday's mild employment data. With yesterday's activity, the tentative upturn which had begun at the end of last week turned into a fully-fledged rally, though trading volume was not heavy. The extra impetus came from a report in The New York Times which further dispelled concern among traders that the Federal Reserve would lift rates at the end of this week. The story quoted unnamed Fed officials as saying it would need to see more data before deciding when to tighten policy again. The suggestion was that policy makers would probably wait until their next meeting on November 15 before considering a move. Such signals gave the market a little breathing ahead of the barrage of important economic figures to be released later in the week. Traders were already setting up positions in anticipation of Thursday's reading on September producer prices, which were expected to show a slight 0.1 per cent gain. Friday will bring news of inflation on the consumer level. The consensus forecast projected a 0.2 per cent gain during the month. There was an undercurrent of unease yesterday that the market was becoming too confident. Some traders said prices could tumble if the figures on the current level of inflation came in stronger than expected, or if Friday's industrial production data suggested price pressures were building in the economy. European government bond markets took their cue from the US yesterday, and adopted a generally firmer tone. However, there was little trading ahead of key data due tomorrow from the US and the German election on Sunday. German bunds drifted, lifting slightly during the course of the day. Mr Christoph Anhamm at UBS in Frankfurt said: 'It is a futures-driven market.' He believes there may be a rally on Monday, after the result of the German election on Sunday, which he expects Chancellor Helmut Kohl to win. He pointed out that the yield on the benchmark 10-year bund fell by 21 basis points after the election in 1983, and by around 12 basis points after the election in 1990. He believes there is scope for the 10-year yield to fall by 15 to 20 basis points on Monday. The December bund future was around 89.40 in late trading, up 0.34 points on the day. UK gilts rose slightly, following German bunds. Volumes were thin however, before today's important data on UK retail prices, employment and earnings. Mr Robert Thomas at NatWest Markets said gilts had taken their tone from bunds and if bunds were to rise on Monday after the German election result, gilts would be likely to rise in their wake. He said: 'Bunds seem to have come to the conclusion that Chancellor Kohl will win, and I would say that was likely. However there is enough uncertainty around for the market to go up on Monday morning if Kohl wins.' The December gilt future on Liffe rose  3/32 on the day to 100 21/32 in late trading. The yield spread over bunds widened slightly to around 130 basis points in late trading. The Pounds 650m of stock issued yesterday by the Bank of England was sold around market prices. The stock was in three tranches: Pounds 250m of 6 per cent due 1999, Pounds 250m of 8 per cent due 2009, and Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked due 2024. The Italian market bucked the European trend to register a fall on domestic news. Mr Andre de Silva of PaineWebber said the sell-off was sparked by reports that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, was to be directly investigated and that discussions on cutting the budget deficit by reducing pension provisions had been suspended. He said: 'This reflects the high risk attached to Italian assets.'</p>

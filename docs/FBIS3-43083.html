In familiarizing readers with its content, we will allow  ourselves some comments in passing. After the breakup of the  Union, as the situation in Russia became more acute, the West  was faced with the threat of a catastrophe associated with the  brain drain, and with it also new technologies in the field of  the means of mass annihilation. Even more than in the past there  was a strengthened fear of the proliferation of nuclear weapons,  especially their appearance in countries with an unpredictable  policy. This circumstance aroused Western analysts to concern  themselves with work on the matter of aid to Russian scientists.    The pursued objective was not only to retain control over  nuclear weapons, but also to take advantage for themselves of  the rich scientific potential of Russian scientists, attracting  them to joint development work by extending financial support  along the lines of both international funds and national  corporations, funds and societies having adequate financial and  scientific resources.    A concise prehistory of this is as follows. James Baker, the  former American Secretary of State, in September 1992 conveyed  to B. N. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, the  information that the United States was ready to make its  contribution to the saving of Russian science. He promised to  seek $25 million for these purposes which it was proposed be  distributed among scientists engaged in the military field. This  initiative received official support in Russia. Subsequently the  European Community joined this initiative, promising to allocate  an additional $19 million. In turn, Japan obligated itself to  add $17 million for this very same purpose.    George Bush, president of the United States, assumed that in  cooperative work it would be possible to maintain the scientific  capabilities of Russia. He laid great hopes on the International  Science and Technology Center, which was to award its first  grant not later than May 1992. Sixteen months have elapsed, but  this international center has not allocated a single penny for  these purposes.    The Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation in every way  possible has held onto the possibility of such cooperation. Both  the supporters and opponents of this idea in its ranks have  become very active. The first have striven not to lose their  positions in the field of the fundamental sciences where our  scientists have been traditionally strong. The second have found  such an alliance to be humiliating, on the one hand, and on the  other hand they have expressed the fear that such a policy will  favor the leakage of secret information.    However, each of the well-developed countries has sought to  extract the maximum advantage for itself and has been in no  hurry to allocate money to the Russians. Negotiations at the top  frequently end with assurances of readiness for cooperation, but  the times for allocating sums are constantly violated. The  selectivity of interests also has exerted an influence. For  example, the Americans have been primarily attracted by space  research. They have promised Russia that $100 million will be  released for use on the Mir space station and the right to  conclude contracts for the launch of commercial satellites.  However, our country has received only $34 million of the $250  million promised through all channels.    Long months have passed on different kinds of agreements and  understandings. As a result, the process of implementing the  project has assumed a drawn-out character, has begun to develop  on a noncentralized basis (it always was centralized in the  former USSR when the agreeing side was either the CPSU Central  Committee or the USSR Academy of Sciences and different  ministries), e.g. through individual private funds. One of the  first who succeeded in overcoming the bureaucracy was the  billionaire G. Soros, who set aside $100 million for Russian  science. But it was found that just money was not enough. It was  first necessary to establish a banking and accounting system, a  control system, a system for expert evaluation of projects and  purposeful selection of organizations and specific individuals  whose activity would command the respect of American specialists  and appeal to their interests.    Months also were spent on this and meanwhile a considerable  percentage of the promising scientists had already emigrated  from Russia. Just at the Nuclear Research Institute imeni  Kurchatov 20 of the 54 scientists of the Plasma Theory Section  have departed for the West, and as far as can be determined,  they have no intention of returning. Scientists are unsettled  with respect to their status as researchers and their material  rewards.    Some foreign funds would like to avoid high taxes in their  own countries and therefore are not adverse to investing sums  for beneficial purposes, such as the subsidization of Russian  science. However, it is not so easy to accomplish this. In the  Russian Federation private individuals do not have the right to  receive hard currency from abroad.    No one is fully confident that the allocated sums will reach  the intended recipients because they pass through several  bureaucratic levels (customs, bank, institution where the  specialist works). It is not always possible to set up the base  necessary for research in place. Sending the money on is  complicated by high taxes.    The Americans have become convinced that the Russian side is  misusing the aid sent. For example, Russian individuals in many  cases travel to the United States who have nothing to do with  those programs for which the sums were allocated. This  circumstance prompted our American colleagues to put this work  under their control. In December 1992 the Russian Federation was  visited by a group of scientists from the United States for  on-the-spot familiarization with the most promising scientific  centers. Without special difficulty they determined 22 research  groups meriting special attention, 21 of which were immediately  included in a plan for the funding of scientific work. A grant  in the sum of $5,000 annually was set aside for the scientists  of each group and one scientific association received $30,000  from the Human Genome fund. The money will be sent directly to  those doing the work.    Plans call for increasing the number of grants, the amount  of  which varies from $10 to $100 thousand, under two-year  scientific programs. Difficulties arise with respect to expert  evaluation of the applications submitted for receiving such  grants. Plans call for involving the leading scientists of the  United States, Western Europe and Japan in this work.  Cooperation with Western colleagues in the science field is not  limited solely to funding. It is not less important to exchange  scientific information [publications, holding of scientific  conferences and such. In this connection the authors of  publications mention the slowness in the finalization of exit  visas, which results in the disruption of foreign missions of  Russian scientists.]    The table accompanying this article, published in the  mentioned journal, is of interest. We duplicate it in full.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Who's Helping the Russians                                                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Initiative        |Promised (million-|Delivered (1992- 1|Status            |  |                  |s of dollars)     |993)              |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Soros (ISF)       |100               |20                |10,000 $500 grant-|  |                  |                  |                  |s to be awarded t-|  |                  |                  |                  |his fall          |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |ISTC              |74                |0                 |Awaiting approval |  |                  |                  |                  |by Russian parlia-|  |                  |                  |                  |ment, outlook unc-|  |                  |                  |                  |ertain            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |G.

The others are either in the  organizational phase or have already depleted their resources.  Those organizations which do not publicize their intentions but  make a contribution to supporting the development of Russian  science arouse a definite sympathy.    A long procedure is involved in receiving grants. And this  is  entirely to be expected. In the West they are not accustomed to  throwing money to the winds. For us it was typical to receive  subsidies from the state and not always was attention given to  the results of our own research. In many cases the subsidies  were used by science and education officials to make trips to  different countries, where at government expense they satisfied  their personal curiosity and also pursued more mercantile  objectives. Unfortunately, this also is no rarity today. The  birthmarks of socialism do not go away rapidly.    And so it goes that foreign colleagues invite you to  international congresses, you try to formalize travel documents,  but the real possibility for departure is in the hands of  completely other people -- either ministerial workers or  officials at institutions of higher education who have  accomplished little in science and who are completely unknown in  the West. It happens that a scientist is invited to work at the  WHO and a person goes who is closer to the administrative  circles of the Ministry of Health or a scientific research  institute. It appears that in our system for evaluating the  intellectual capabilities of a specialist, his social and  juridical defensibility, we will not very soon put our house in  order in this respect. That is why there is the fear that the  system of grants is being used by ``go-getters.''    The system of grants may possibly seem to some to be  humiliating. But under the conditions of negligence of science,  education and public health in our country it would be incorrect  to ignore it. Otherwise we risk falling completely behind in our  own development, losing traditions and priorities in science.  Science as a part of culture is international. A scientist has a  motherland, but science does not. Its results belong to all  mankind.</p>

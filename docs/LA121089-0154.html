			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIVISION II;  </P> <P> SANTA BARBARA, MUIR CO-CHAMPS AFTER 7-7 TIE  </P> <P> Without the luxury of an overtime in the Southern Section Division II finals,  Santa Barbara and Muir had to settle for a 7-7 tie before an overflow crowd of  10,000 Saturday night at the La Playa Stadium in Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> What the teams lacked in scoring they made up for in turnovers. They combined  for seven in the second half alone.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara had advanced to the finals by defeating Canyon Country Canyon,  28-27, in a controversial overtime game last week, while Pasadena Muir defeated  No. 1 seeded Thousand Oaks, 9-3, also in overtime.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara got off to a good start when wide receiver Simon Banks took the  opening kickoff to his 40-yard line, one defender away from a touchdown, but  came up empty-handed when kicker George Rios missed a field goal attempt from  the 31-yard line.  </P> <P> The Dons' second possession was much more rewarding as they opened the scoring  late in the first quarter on a fourth-and-two play. Poncho Renteria capped the  five-play, 50-yard drive with a 26-yard pass to Banks.  </P> <P> Muir struck back on a 79-yard punt return by senior defensive back Stefan  Crutchfield with 7:45 to go in the second quarter.  </P> <P> "We expected a low-scoring game coming in," Santa Barbara Coach Manuel Garcia  said.  </P> <P> In the second half it was the Dons' turn to deal with a lack of offense as they  failed to capitalize on several opportunities. Fortunately for the Dons, the  Mustangs couldn't capitalize either.  </P> <P> Muir's second possession of the third quarter ended when Banks picked off a  Renteria pass on his own 45. On their next possession, the Mustangs drove to  the the Dons' 25 before Don defensive back Robby Blakeney recovered running  back Sam Williford's fumble.  </P> <P> The Dons' defense saved the game again in the fourth quarter, when Bryan Stiles  intercepted a pass in the end zone.  </P> <P> However, the Mustangs struck back immediately when defensive back Demitrius  Martin picked off a Renteria pass, only the second interception Renteria had  thrown this year.  </P> <P> The turnovers continued two plays later when Santa Barbara nose guard George  Amezcua hit Andre Devizen as he took a handoff from quarterback Sedric Thomas,  forcing a fumble. Renteria then threw his second interception of the game and  the third of the season, giving the Mustangs the ball back with 36 seconds to  play.  </P> <P> Thomas managed to move the Mustangs to the Dons' 20 with a 33-yard pass to  Martin, but then he was intercepted by Don defensive back Greg Araujo.  </P> <P> However, Santa Barbara was unable to get a final play off.  </P></p>

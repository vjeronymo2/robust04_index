			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Asda Property halved to Pounds 1.58m Depressed residential sales, with lower volume and reduced margins, contributed to pre-tax profits being halved from Pounds 3.02m to Pounds 1.58m at Asda Property Holdings in the first half of 1992. Turnover, which fell to Pounds 19.2m (Pounds 21.7m), mainly comprised Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 14.7m) in income from sales of trading properties and a 10 per cent increase in gross rental income to Pounds 7.12m (Pounds 6.49m). Mr Emanuel Davidson, chairman, said the nature of the company's business would change materially following the disposal of most of its tenanted residential portfolio to the Bradford Property Trust in July. The Pounds 36m proceeds were used to reduce net borrowings. Earnings per share worked through at 1.2p (3.4p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 0.65p.</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Prudential to double venture capital funds Prudential Corporation, the financial services and life insurance company, yesterday announced that it was to more than double the funds earmarked for venture capital investment to Pounds 500m. The new allocation is a tiny proportion of the Pounds 60bn the Prudential holds under management, but could provide a substantial boost to the total funds available for investment in smaller companies as they emerge from recession. Mr Paul Brooks, head of Prudential Venture Managers, said: 'This probably puts us in the number one slot for cash available for investment in smaller companies. The Pru is saying we are open for business.' He said he expected the Pounds 500m would be spent over the next three to five years, and most would go towards management buy-outs in the UK. This year Venture Managers has only invested about Pounds 50m in new funds in capital venture. Prudential currently has Pounds 210m of venture capital invested at cost, mostly injected over the past six years. It realised Pounds 110m from Pounds 40m invested at cost in the year to date. Mr Brooks said the money would be diverted from the proceeds of investments across Prudential and would not be at the expense of any other single activity. He said his only target was to outperform returns on the FT-A All-Share index. Venture Managers invests in companies capitalised within the Pounds 10m to Pounds 500m range, with most in the Pounds 20m to Pounds 150m range. It does not generally deal with start-ups, or with the insurance or property sectors.</p>

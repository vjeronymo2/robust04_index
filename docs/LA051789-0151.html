			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SEARLE WINS SUIT ON COPPER IUD  </P> <P> A federal jury today rejected a woman's claims that she was injured by an  intrauterine copper contraceptive made by G. D. Searle &amp; Co. -- the 15th  such victory for the Chicago pharmaceuticals maker in 19 prosecutions.  </P> <P> The jury in U.S. District Judge Rya Zobel's court concluded that the Cu-7  device was not responsible for any alleged injury of the plaintiff, Cindy  Nickerson. The jury also found in favor of the other defendant, Ortho  Pharmaceuticals, manufacturer of the Lippes Loop intrauterine contraceptive.  </P> <P> Three years ago, Searle discontinued its IUD business in the United States,  citing what it called difficulty in getting product liability insurance and the  cost of defending against suits.  </P></p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / CrossRail decision defended by MP The Conservative chairman of the four-man committee of MPs which turned down proposals for the Pounds 2bn London CrossRail proposal yesterday launched a defence of its surprise decision. Mr Tony Marlow said the main factors in the committee's thinking were the decline in commuter travel since the line was planned in 1989, and competing transport developments elsewhere in London such as the Jubilee Line. 'We were there for 30 detailed, meticulous days, cross-examining the promoters more thoroughly than any previous committee had done,' Mr Marlow said. 'I started out well disposed. It is an exciting, imaginative scheme but we did listen to the detailed evidence.' The committee concluded that no private-sector company would be willing to take the risk of financing the pro-ject. Mr Marlow doubted that the government would be able to ask the committee to reconsider its verdict as had been suggested by the Labour party. This would require the government to show that the committee had acted outside the procedural rules or that there had been a material change in its circumstances. In a separate development, one expert close to the project said that in spite of the political support for rescuing the project, transport officials were secretly pleased it had been rejected. The economic case for building CrossRail was 'farcical', he said, and would require traffic growth during the next 15 years equivalent to the high rates achieved for only 18 months during the 1980s boom to justify building it.</p>

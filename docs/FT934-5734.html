			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / E German state government quits: Saxony-Anhalt ministers resign after disclosure that they overpaid themselves Mr Werner Munch, the prime minister of the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt, yesterday offered the resignation of his entire government following official disclosures that west German members of his cabinet had paid themselves too much. He said that ministers would remain in office as a caretaker administration until new elections can be held. The resignation of the conservative-led Christian Democratic Union government, which is in coalition with the liberal Free Democrats, represents another blow to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose own federal government in Bonn comprises a similar coalition. Last week he was forced to accept the withdrawal of Mr Steffen Heitmann, the justice minister of Saxony, as candidate for the presidency. He had been Mr Kohl's chosen candidate for the post. It is also a setback for the other established political parties. All of their ratings among east Germans have plummeted following a series of corruption scandals in western Germany, as well as disenchantment with the status quo because of high unemployment in the five eastern states. Mr Munch, a former member of the European Parliament and university lecturer, told a news conference in Magdeburg, the state's capital, that neither he nor other ministers had received 'at any time illegal payments. . . This resignation can only be explained as a step to prevent further damage to our families, our state and our governing bodies.' The state audit office in Saxony-Anhalt reported at the weekend that the west German politicians who had moved to the state as ministers after unification had together overpaid themselves by as much as DM900,000 (Pounds 357,000) since they took up their posts in mid-1991. It added that the ministers, including Mr Munch, had inflated their salaries with excessive entertainment allowances, which had swelled their income by DM200,000 in the past two years. Officials in Saxony-Anhalt said last night that, by offering the resignations now, the CDU and the FDP might be trying to limit the damage in time for federal and state elections which will be held next year. Next Sunday's local government elections in the eastern state of Brandenburg, headed by the Social Democrats, are likely to provide reliable indications about the mood among east Germans. The west German cabinet ministers named for excessive payments also include Mr Horst Rehburger, the Free Democrat economics minister, regarded as responsible for attracting private investment into the region; Mr Hartmut Perschau, interior minister; and Mr Werner Schreiber, social affairs minister.

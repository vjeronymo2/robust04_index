			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of North American Business Locations (5): Unseen players for big stakes - Barbara Harrison examines the role of relocation advisers Site selection consultants are often the unseen players in the big stakes game of relocation. So, who are they? A few decades or so ago, site selection was a relatively narrow affair that included assessing real estate prices and the pros and cons of various locations in terms of roads, electricity, local wage rates, airport access, and other critical factors. These assessments were often handled inside a company. But outside consultants were increasingly brought in as the selection process became more competitive among US cities and states offering incentives to attract investors. Advisers, as outsiders, were considered more objective about the alternatives. Today, site consulting has mushroomed into a significant business. Although no public estimates exist on total fees earned or even the total amount of investment handled, site consultants say the business is lucrative and point to the entry of the big six accountancy firms as evidence of fat fees. The two leading traditional firms specialising in site consultancy are Chicago-based PHH Fantus and New York-based Moran, Stahl &amp; Boyer (MS&amp;B). The big six accountancy firms have more recently joined the fray, in particular Deloitte &amp; Touche, Andersen Consulting, Price Waterhouse, and Ernst &amp; Young. Several large engineering firms, notably California-based Fluor Daniel which handled Mercedes' move to Alabama, also offer site consulting services. And there is a plethora of small shops, specialising in particular areas. The levels of business among firms varies widely. The annual number of assignments for an industry leader such as Fantus, which handled BMW's move to South Carolina, is more than 100, almost all of which come from blue-chip companies, while a small shop might handle two or three deals a year. But Fantus and Moran, Stahl &amp; Boyer have been fighting some increasing hot competition in the past few years, especially from the big six. Ernst &amp; Young only formally constituted its site selection unit two years ago and it is already handling 20 to 30 assignments a year, according to Barry Barovick, director of corporate real estate consulting for Ernst &amp; Young. Deloitte &amp; Touche decided it could build a separate practice around site selection about three years ago. With two top consultants poached from Fantus, Mark Klender and Philip Schneider, it has one of the stronger fully dedicated site selection teams at the big six. The strength of the big six entering this segment of consulting work is that they have a substantial client base as well as a depth of expertise in such areas as tax, management consulting and real estate that other relocation firms may not have. Similarly, engineering firms such as Fluor Daniel have wide experience in the actual implementation - the engineering and construction - of plant relocations, particularly for manufacturing. Fluor has been providing advice on siting since 1974. William Dorsey, director of Fluor's Siting and Consulting Services Group, located in Greenville, South Carolina, explains: 'We site about Dollars 2bn worth of investment a year and about a quarter of that is European firms coming to the US.' Smaller consultants may provide a narrower range of services, but their business is built more directly on personal relationships and trust. Wesley DeVoto, for example, operates as a 'finder' for British companies interested in US - and particularly south-eastern US - investments. Mr DeVoto is more oriented to mergers and acquisitions by British companies wishing to have a US presence than green field site selection. But his Atlanta-based five-man shop is a successful niche participant. The upshot of the increasing competition is that Moran, Stahl &amp; Boyer, acquired in 1990 by financial services giant Prudential, and Fantus, a division of the PHH Corp, are undergoing a restructure to act more like the management consulting firms with which they are competing. Moran, Stahl &amp; Boyer, which produces annual studies on favourite business cities for Fortune magazine, now is focused on location feasibility and selection, while the implementation of the move, such as housing for employees, is carried out by its sister company, Prudential Resource Management, according to Charles Galloway, executive vice-president of MS&amp;B. Fantus will now have three separate segments, one for private sector companies in North America and Europe, one for the public sector (advising on economic development for locations that want to attract investors) and an international unit that will focus on the Pacific Rim. The consultants all nonetheless say that business is booming. After the lean and uncertain years at the start of the 1990s, US companies are once again making capital investments. And, they say, international business is pouring in as more companies seek to strategically position themselves to compete in the North American market.</p>

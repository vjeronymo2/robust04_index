Under the accord, the parties will conduct a joint  examination of the main units of the plant and put them into  operation, after taking additional measures to ensure its safe  functioning. They will also train operational and technical  maintenance personnel for the plant.    Russia will deliver nuclear fuel to the station, help the  plant operators and assist in setting up Armenian bodies of  control over nuclear materials and the nuclear power engineering  network.    For its part, Armenia will introduce the rules and standards  now in use at the Russian nuclear power plants and take steps to  secure physical safety of the plant.    Under the agreement, Armenia pledges not to use the nuclear  and non-nuclear materials received from Russia, as well as the  nuclear and non-nuclear materials, installations and equipment  created on their basis for producing nuclear weapons and other  nuclear explosives or for attaining any military objectives.    Specialists and their families will be granted the right of  free travel to Armenia. Tax and duty exemption will be granted  for required goods brought into Armenia for the purpose of  restarting the moth-balled nuclear power plant.    Armenian Prime-Minister Grant Bagratyan believes that the  accord signed between the two countries marks a great step  towards meeting Armenia's energy needs, which have been  accumulating since the power station was moth-balled in the wake  of the 1988 disastrous earthquake.</p>

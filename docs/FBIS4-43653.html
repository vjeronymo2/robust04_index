			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Peter Almond: "RAF Grounds Jets in Dispute Over </F> Civilian Repairs"]    [Text] Front-line Tornado F3 fighters and new Harrier GR7  jump jets have been taken out of service by RAF [Royal Air  Force] engineers; the Tornados because of alleged inadequate  standards of repair by a civilian contractor and the Harriers  because of construction faults.    Work on 18 Tornados and the entire fleet of more than 50  Harriers is seen by the RAF as examples of what can go wrong  when work is contracted to civilian companies .    "It looks likely that we will have to cut out the fuselage  centre sections of the older Tornado F2's and fit them into the  F3's," said an RAF official. "But it may take several years,  and these aeroplanes may never fly again. No RAF engineer would  do what they did."    It was alleged that hundreds of rivet-like fasteners were  found to have been ripped out by inappropriate tools, damaging  the pre-stressed metal skins of the aircraft. They were  returned without comment to RAF fighter squadrons, where the  condition was noticed by junior RAF engineers.    The RAF says there is a vital need for the Service to have  an  independent engineering capability.    Next month, however, the Ministry of Defence [MoD] is  expected to announce the loss of about 4,000 RAF engineering  jobs, the largest single area to be affected by the new Defence  Costs Study. The study aims to reduce the defence budget by  contracting more support work to cheaper civilians.    RAF officials are worried that the cuts will drastically  erode the Service's engineering ability, cut repair standards,  lose its military reinforcement capability -- and could even  cost aircrew lives.    The most serious evidence of what can go wrong are 16 of the  18 Tornado F3's which, a year after they were allegedly damaged  while being modified by Airwork Limited of Bournemouth, still  await repair at RAF St Athan, Glamorgan, as the Ministry of  Defence and the company argue about an estimated 30 million  pound repair bill. A court case is expected.    Airwork had won a 7 million pound contract to modify the  airframes, undercutting British Aerospace [BAe], which had won  an earlier F3 contract, by a substantial amount.    The company has since been taken over by Short Bros of  Belfast, with the exception of the Tornado contract, which stays  with Bricom, now known as Securiam which was Airwork's parent  company, according to a Shorts spokesman.    Although 38 of Airwork's 40 MoD contracts have been done  satisfactorily, according to Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Defence  Procurement Minister, the company has been placed on an MoD  contractors "special attention" list.    This "reduces the chance of Airwork being awarded future MoD  contracts," Mr Aitken wrote to Mr Rhodri Morgan, Labour MP for  Cardiff West, last month.    The Tornados are needed to be flyable in reserve,  particularly as 24 Tornado F3's are to be leased to the Italian  Air Force next year.    Perhaps more importantly for the engineers at RAF St Athan,  however, is the many thousands of hours' work they have had to  do on all the new Harrier GR5's and GR7's.    After one aircraft caught fire and crashed in Denmark in  1991, and another landed on fire at RAF Wittering, RAF engineers  found a basic design problem with the Harrier's wiring.    American-made Kapton wiring is used in almost all civilian  airliners, but carbon arc tracking in wiring bundles in new  U.S.-designed Harriers prompted the U.S. Marine Corps to replace  the wiring with something else.    That was not done, however, for the British-made Harrier  GR5's and GR7's. Following the fires, RAF officials faulted  poor wiring standards by British Aerospace, while BAe said it  merely followed RAF specifications.    The result, however, is that in a rolling programme every  Harrier -- some with only 10 hours flying on them -- has had to  be returned to BAe and to RAF St Athan to have the wiring  replaced. Each aircraft has required about 4,000 hours of work.    Within months, however the Harriers were brought back to St  Athan, some after operations over northern Iraq, to have their  tail sections strengthened because of stress caused by engine  nozzles. This fault could not have been anticipated.    The work, still going on, has involved about another 4,000  hours.    For the RAF, the problems of such highly sophisticated  aircraft require the highest standards of engineering care and  that is why there are 17,885 engineering tradesmen in the  newly-formed RAF Logistics Command.    "There is a view that Third Line maintenance (major repair)  is a luxury," said Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Alcock, head of  Logistics Command, who concedes that housing costs and school  fees help make RAF engineers 20 per cent more expensive than  equally-qualified civilians.    "But we have an ability to understand and repair all our own  technology. We are an intelligent customer that manufacturers  and civilian engineering companies can't easily fool."</p>

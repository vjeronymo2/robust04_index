			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THINK OVER SURGERY  </P> <P> Question: I mentioned to my family doctor that I was thinking of having some  cosmetic surgery done, and he said I should think about it for a while first.  If I can afford the operation and I want to look better than I now do, what is  there to think about?  </P> <P> Answer: Any plastic surgeon you may eventually see will probably offer similar  advice. The success or failure of a cosmetic procedure often depends upon the  patient's expectations. No matter how successful the operation from an  objective point of view, it will be unsuccessful from the patient's standpoint  if more was expected.  </P> <P> For example, a person who undergoes a face-lift operation has the right to  expect to look more youthful; that's the purpose of the procedure. But a  50-year-old woman will not look the same as she did when she was 30. Moreover,  there are factors outside the surgeon's control that can affect the results.  Poor health and cigarette smoking, for example, may make for a poor outcome  regardless of the surgeon's skill.  </P> <P>  Neil Solomon is the author of "Sick &amp; Tired of Being Sick &amp; Tired,"  Wynwood Press.

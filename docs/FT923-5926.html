			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: Wharf gains 12% for first half WHARF (Holdings), the flagship listing of the empire founded by the late Sir Yue-kong Pao, announced a HKDollars 900.8m (USDollars 116m) net profit for the first half of 1992. The company has changed its year-end from March, and the results represent a 12 per cent increase on the six months to September 1991. The company also signed letters of intent yesterday for a Yn10bn (USDollars 1.83bn) infrastructure project which will transform the city of Wuhan in the industrial heartland of China. It includes a containerisation terminal, air cargo retransportation centre, modernised and expanded rail links and power supply, and substantial property development. Wharf's interim results held few surprises. Increased earnings came primarily from a 10 per cent boost in rental income from its Harbour City development, and container terminal operator Modern Terminals also showed strong growth. But 1992 will be a year of consolidation for the group, before a substantial increase in the size of its property portfolio comes through in 1993. Wharf is operating a property rental portfolio of 7m square feet. Within two years, this will more than double, with the Times Square and Gateway Towers developments in Hong Kong and Lane Crawford Place in Singapore due to be completed by the end of 1994. There was an extraordinary profit of HKDollars 57m from the sale of long-term investments. The directors recommended an interim dividend of 16.5 cents, up from 14.5 cents in 1991.</p>

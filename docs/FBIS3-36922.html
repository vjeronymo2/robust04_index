			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Here are some reactions about the  situation. Oleg Poptsov, the chairman of the All-Russian  Television and Radio Company:    [Begin Poptsov recording] I believe that this action cannot  be seen as antistate or without logic. It is an apolitical  action. When [Finance Minister] Dubinin says that someone  should take political action but that he has nothing to do with  it, I have to say that such a strange stance by the Finance  Ministry of a state called Russia begins to puzzle me somewhat.  We have to insure one thing, namely that when those people  sitting in high office give their word, they use their  professionalism, their authority, and their responsibility to  keep that word. If you cannot give the money, give the freedom  instead, but once you have given the freedom do not complain and  do not claim to be governing the state. In other words, having  renounced your obligations to finance television and radio, you  have to renounce your right to govern both of them. Then other  forces will govern them -- not the government and not the  president. [end recording]    [Announcer] Igor Golembiovskiy, the editor in chief of the  IZVESTIYA newspaper.    [Begin Golembiovskiy recording] The danger has arisen of a  situation in which Russia television and radio could fall  silent. In our paper we have called this situation a national  disgrace. It is a simply ludicrous situation. Both the  television and radio, at any rate those channels in question,  are state ones. Thus the state bears full responsibility for  their work. I do not think there is a country anywhere in the  world that would deliberately take the path of severing all  links with society, and this fact is evidence of the collapse of  our government and the state.

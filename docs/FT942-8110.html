			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Books: Rocking the Eton boat - James Hughes-Onslow reviews a controversial history of the school ETON RENEWED: A HISTORY FROM 1860 TO THE PRESENT DAY by Tim Card John Murray Pounds 22.95, 338 pages This book will be read for all the wrong reasons after recent disclosures that the former headmaster Anthony Chenevix-Trench was a drunk and a sadist fond of beating his boys. Before the flogging furore, however, Lord Carrington wrote in the Old Etonian Review, without mentioning Chenevix-Trench: 'This is a book which all Old Etonians will thoroughly enjoy. It is evocative, informative, and scholarly, and full of good stories.' Tim Card, now Vice Provost, has been at Eton as a boy and a beak since he was 12 (except for five years at Cambridge and the Army). He has not let the side down, although he has sailed rather close to the wind on homosexuality. He has written this book as an insider putting the record straight, rather than as a propagandist trying to convey an image to the outside world. There are a lot of Eton terms, such as Oppidans, scugs, tugs, burries and wet and dry bobs, which most of us haven't heard since we left the school. There is no attempt to provide an artificial gloss. Subjects are tackled dutifully and with care - Card knows that there are thousands of Old Etonians with elephantine memories (and many published memoirs) waiting to pick him up if he gets anything wrong. Malcolm Muggeridge once complained that Etonians never forget where they went to school. Probably the most striking thing about Eton for an outsider is the degree of autonomy enjoyed by the boys. In the late 19th century, long after the Duke of Wellington's alleged remarks about the playing fields of Eton, all sporting activities were organised by the boys themselves. A Master in College (housemaster to the 70 scholars) was rebuked by his senior boys for unwarranted interference. Members of Pop, who had the power to cane boys or fine them, and restrain them if there was a riot, elected each other without reference to the beaks. Even in the 1960s the Captain of Boats had the power to sack the master in charge of coaching the Eight - Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the Commons select committee on defence, was Captain of Boats in those days and, for some of us, he was a more imposing figure then than he is now. If boys are less powerful now it is partly because the headmaster has succeeded in clawing back responsibility each time the boys have abused their authority; and partly because the boys are under so much academic pressure that they do not want these extra duties. It is unfortunate for Chenevix-Trench that he presided over the decline of fagging and flogging, which are now seen as barbaric practices. Bernard Fergusson, writing in the 1930s, treats them, with no hint of an apology, as initiations into the roughness of normal life. Trench's mistake was to remove the sadistic ritual behind flogging, with a praeposter and a college porter to assist in the bare-bottomed assault with a birch. Instead he caned boys privately, lessening the ordeal but, without the witnesses, increasing the speculation about his own motives. Trench's other mistake was that he distrusted housemasters, wondering whether he could communicate with Etonians through '25 robber barons' as he called them. This attitude undermined the authority of housemasters and in some cases, anarchy prevailed. When he arrived in 1964, Chenevix-Trench was a breath of fresh air. For 50 years the school had not progressed at all. There had been years of stagnation under Robert Birley and Claude Elliott - both of them formidable schoolmasters in their different ways but deeply conservative figures, only interested in stemming the tide against a ghastly modern world. The Chenevix-Trench chapter is headed 'Upheaval' - and an upheaval was what was needed. It was unfortunate that for all his many talents he did not have the ability to communicate with Eton house-masters, an eccentric, unworldly group of men who favoured humiliation as a means of control. Card acknowledges that there is a recurring debate about whether Etonians should continue to wear the tails, striped trousers and stiff collars which were fashionable two centuries ago. Boys and masters usually agree that it is a pity to tamper with tradition. No one seems to ask whether it is a good idea for boys to spend their formative years strolling around town looking slightly ridiculous, like superior beings from a lost era. Whether an Eton education (present cost Pounds 12,000 a year after tax) is going to be an advantage or a hindrance in the 21st century is not addressed by Card. Too many Etonians still go into non-productive employment in the Army and the City (perhaps defence cuts and Lloyd's will put that right) rather than industry, science, medicine or the creative arts. The last Tory leadership contest, in which a Fellow of Eton and a former Captain of the School was beaten by a south London boy who left school with no O levels, might suggest that today, even in Tory politics, an Eton background is seen as a handicap.</p>

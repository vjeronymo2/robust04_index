			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This afternoon Alain Juppe and Francois Leotard held  a joint news conference in Paris. France is officially  demanding a NATO meeting so that a clear ultimatum can be given  to all the belligerents. Olivier Lerner reports:    [Lerner] Looking haggard, the result no doubt of a sleepless  night, Francois Leotard and Alain Juppe wanted to make the day a  landmark. It is a turning point, they each said in turn, after  first recalling some basic figures.    [Leotard] At present, I stress at present, it is not  possible to determine the origin of the firing. Moreover, this  underlines the extreme difficulty of handling this crisis by  military means, if this were necessary. But we will all agree  that it is the siege itself that is the cause of all these  deaths. Today, we have reached a death toll of about 10,000 in  Sarajevo.    [Lerner] So how is the seige of Sarajevo to be ended? France  wants to give an ultimatum to the forces there. The word  ultimatum is a strong one, but it has finally been uttered,  because we would be ashamed if a similar massacre were to happen  again, says Alain Juppe:    [Juppe] First, the siege of Sarajevo must be lifted, this  means that Serb forces must pull back to a distance making the  renewed shelling of the town physically impossible. Second,  with a view to lifting this siege, heavy weapons held by Serbs  and Bosnians within a range of 30 km around the town must be  brought together and put under UN Protection Force control.    [Lerner] If these two demands are not fulfilled, would it be  necessary to resort to the famous air strikes?    [Juppe] Air strikes, which are of course the subject of a  lot of comment, are not in themselves, or by themselves, a  response. They are, and remain, a tool for making reason heard.  We have never abandoned the idea of them, and even less so  today than yesterday.    [Lerner] For the moment, no NATO council meeting on Bosnia  has been called. So will Mssrs Leotard and Juppe have been  preaching into a void? We will know very soon the impact of  their ultimatum, which can be expected to be endorsed by NATO.</p>

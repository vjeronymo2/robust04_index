			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / EC seeks to avert trade war: Prime minister and Delors urge farm negotiators to settle dispute MR JOHN MAJOR and Mr Jacques Delors joined forces yesterday in an effort to avert a damaging global trade war. After an emergency meeting at Downing Street, the prime minister and European Commission president called for US and EC farm trade negotiators to 're-engage without delay' to settle a long-standing oilseeds dispute. Negotiations to settle the dispute - which is at the heart of a wider US-EC row over Europe's farm subsidy regime - have for two years blocked progress towards a comprehensive world trade reform package that could stimulate an additional Dollars 200bn (Pounds 129bn) a year in international trade. Talks collapsed in Chicago on Tuesday as farm ministers from both countries sought a last-ditch settlement ahead of President Bush's election defeat. The US swiftly announced that it would slap 200 per cent tariffs on European white wine exports and other farm products worth Dollars 300m if the dispute were not settled in 30 days. These sanctions are seen as an opening salvo in what could escalate into a tit-for-tat trade war. A second 'hit-list', including industrial items like tyres, paper, ceramics and furniture, has been drawn up. In a further effort to defuse tension, EC trade ministers meeting in Brocket Hall, north-east of London, are understood to have agreed not to respond to US sanctions with any counter-retaliation list of US farm exports. Senior UK officials also said they did not expect the EC Council of Ministers, which is due to meet on Monday, to take any decision on counter-retaliation. Mr Major held a 20-minute telephone conversation with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany in which both agreed on the urgent need to complete a Gatt deal. German reluctance to put pressure on France, where opposition to a deal is greatest, is thought to have contributed to the present crisis. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has also been in close touch with his EC opposite numbers in what is clearly a drive by the UK presidency to maximise support for an accord and raise the pressure on Mr Delors and the French government. Mr Delors' talks with Mr Major were seen as a significant effort to calm a storm stirred on Thursday by the angry withdrawal of Mr Ray MacSharry, EC farm commissioner, from negotiations. In a letter to Mr Delors on his return from the Chicago negotiations, Mr MacSharry accused the EC president of trying to undermine his negotiating efforts, and of 'betrayal of trust'. EC officials tried yesterday to make light of Mr MacSharry's withdrawal, insisting that negotiations could continue without him. It was suggested that Mr Frans Andriessen, the external affairs commissioner responsible for the wider Uruguay Round trade negotiations, would take over Mr MacSharry's role. Some officials also say that compromise on farm trade will only be possible when negotiators with a wider brief take over. Challenged about his clash with Mr Delors, Mr MacSharry yesterday insisted that 'there are always differences in any negotiating team'. 'As far as I'm concerned my only interest in this is that we do get a Gatt agreement . . . everybody must make every effort day and night to bring it about. 'I think the deal can be signed up in five minutes,' the former Irish government minister said. 'I wasn't, then or now, prepared to go any further than we were in Chicago . . . it is now a matter for the United States to accept what is in my view a reasonable deal,' he added. Contradicting Mr MacSharry's claim, Mr Ed Madigan, US farm secretary, said a 'substantial gap still remains between where we are and where we must be' if settlement is to be reached. As EC-wide efforts were under way to get talks back on course, Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, called an emergency meeting next Tuesday of the 108-country Trade Negotiations Committee that supervises the Uruguay Round. A Gatt statement said countries wanted to discuss 'the very grave situation that has arisen in the round, and to consider what action can be taken to alleviate it'.

			<p>SUMMARY                                  President Boris Yeltsin continues to face serious opposition from  certain regions in his efforts to define a division of central  and local authority.  Several republics failed to approve the  federal constitution in the 12 December referendum and have since  taken fresh steps toward enacting republic constitutions that  claim greater powers for local authorities.  In the case of  Tatarstan, Moscow has dealt with the conflict by signing a  bilateral treaty after prolonged negotiations, but it is not yet  clear if Moscow is willing to conclude such treaties with other  republics.                              END SUMMARY      Rejection of the federal constitution by voters in several  republics in the 12 December referendum and recent moves to  approve republic constitutions that assert regional authority in  ways incompatible with the Federation constitution demonstrate  that the republics' constitutional conflict with Moscow remains a  serious issue:      -- The Tuvan republic held a referendum to approve the republic's  constitution on 12 December, the same day as the referendum on  the federal constitution.  While the Tuvan constitution, approved  by 53.9 percent of the voters in the referendum, formally  acknowledges the republic to be part of the Russian Federation  (Ostankino TV, 27 October 1993), it also "envisages the right to  self-determination" (ITAR-TASS, 16 December 1993).  It provides  for a 32-member republic parliament, the Supreme Hural, whose  membership was also elected on 12 December. The republic's  constitution gives parliament authority to decide "problems of  war and peace, borders," and to suspend Russian Federation  legislative acts which "go beyond the powers envisaged by the  constitution of the Russian Federation, the federal treaty or  other agreements" (ITAR-TASS, 16 December 1993).  Only 30.5  percent of Tuvan voters approved the federal constitution on 12  December.      -- The constitution of the republic of Bashkortostan, adopted on  24 December 1993 by 206 out of 227 republic Supreme Soviet  deputies (Segodnya, 28 December 1993; Sovetskaya Rossiya, 25  December 1993), claims precedence over the federal constitution,  at least in some provisions.  The Bashkortostan constitution  provides that the republic will voluntarily yield to Moscow  certain powers pertaining to interstate relations under terms of  an as yet to be negotiated treaty with the Russian Federation but  retain authority over its judicial system and prosecutor's  office, independent foreign economic and foreign policy affairs,  and entrance into interstate associations (Nezavisimaya Gazeta,  28 December 1993).  The republic's constitution also asserts "the  land, its contents, natural wealth, and other natural resources  on its territory" to be "the property of its multinational  people" (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 25 December 1993).  Fifty-three  percent of the Bashkortostan electorate voted against the federal  constitution in the 12 December referendum (Nezavisimaya Gazeta,  16 December).      -- Tatarstan also rejected the federal constitution on 12  December as fewer than fourteen percent of the republic's  electorate participated in the referendum (Izvestiya, 14 December  1993).  In November 1992, the republic Supreme Soviet approved a  republic constitution that states that Tatarstan's laws "take  precedence throughout its territory, unless they conflict with  international commitments of the republic," and that the republic  constitution "is an act of the highest legal force of direct  effect" and declares the republic a "sovereign state" and  "subject of international law" (Sovetskaya Tatariya, 13 December  1992).  The constitution associates the republic with the Russian  Federation only within the parameters of a bilateral treaty that  divides Federation and republic authority (see box) (Interfax, 6  November 1992).      Moscow is also engaged in a constitutional conflict with  Sverdlovsk oblast over the oblast's bid to claim republic status.  Under the leadership of former oblast Governor Eduard Rossel,  residents of the Sverdlovsk region are seeking formal recognition  for the Urals republic, favored by 83 percent of voters (with a  55 percent voter turnout) in a 25 April 1993 non-binding  referendum (Interfax, 1 July 1993) and proclaimed by a decision  of the oblast soviet (Izvestiya, 3 July 1993).  Despite being  fired by Yeltsin for backing the move to claim republic status,  Rossel was given a vote of confidence as 61.87 percent of the  Sverdlovsk Oblast electorate endorsed him for a seat in the  Federation Council (Interfax, 13 December 1993).  Rossel has  succeeded in getting a debate on approval of the constitution of  the Urals Republic on the Federation Council's agenda (Izvestiya,  10 February).  Claiming that the establishment of the Urals  Republic and adoption of its constitution were made "in full  conformity" with the federal constitution, Rossel asserted he is  "ready" to appeal to the Constitutional Court to approve the  republic constitution (ITAR-TASS, 17 January).      Tatarstan Negotiations      Moscow's response to the conflict with Tatarstan has been to  engage in protracted negotiations with the republic, talks which  have ended in mutual agreement on a treaty.  Culminating three  years of negotiations with Kazan, Moscow's future relations with  the republic will be based on the bilateral "Treaty on the Mutual  Delegation of Authority and Terms of Reference," signed on 15  February by Yeltsin and Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaymiyev  (ITAR-TASS, 15 February) (See Box).      The Moscow-Kazan bilateral treaty is supplemented by twelve  intergovernmental agreements.  According to Kommersant-Daily, the  agreements concern oil production, ownership matters, defense  industries, customs, transportation of oil products,  environmental cooperation, education, the budget, banking system,  foreign economic activity, crime, and military organization (5  February).     Treaty as a Model      Since the signing of the Russia-Tatarstan bilateral treaty,  Yeltsin and Shakhray have hailed the treaty as a "precedent" for  negotiating similar agreements with other components:      -- Following the treaty signing, Yeltsin stressed that "treaties  of this kind are, basically, the sole constitutional way of  removing contradictions between the Russian Federation  constitution and republic constitutions in a civilized way,  without twisting anyone's arm" (ITAR-TASS, 15 February).      -- Shakhray was quoted as saying that "there is a legal and  economic possibility of the conclusion of treaties similar to  that with Tataria with each component of the Russian Federation,"  based on "Article 11 of the Constitution . . . clause 3 of which  says that the terms of reference shall be delineated "by this  constitution and the Federal and other treaties" (Segodnya, 25  February).  According to a 15 February Interfax report, Shakhray  would like to see Federal Assembly adoption of a law on power-  sharing as a way of regulating the process.      Detractors characterize the Russia-Tatarstan treaty as a threat  to federalism, saying it will complicate future center-regional  relations and unacceptably weaken the center:      -- Sergey Baburin, State Duma deputy and leader of the  unregistered "Russian Way" faction, viewed the treaty as a threat  to federalism and submitted a Duma proposal "On Guarantees of the  Federal System and Provision for Territorial Integrity of the  Russian Federation On Account of the Signing of the Treaty with  Tatarstan," which apparently failed for lack of votes.  Explaining his proposal, Baburin was quoted as saying that "for  the first time the state signed a treaty with a part of itself"  and that the treaty presents "a great danger because it means the  state's transition to a confederative system" (Interfax, 16  February).      -- In a 16 February article, Segodnya commentator Vladimir Todres  suggested that pursuing separate treaties for each region would  produce gridlock and confusion.  He wrote, "Russia has a further  87 regions, not counting Chechnya.  The question "If the Tatars  can do it, why can't we?" is quite natural.  Why should the other  regional leaders swallow this treaty in silence?"      Other Republics      While Moscow and Kazan were putting the finishing touches on the  treaty, Moscow still appeared to be pressing the other republics  to revise their constitutions, remaining noncommital on a  willingness to conclude other treaties.      In the case of at least one republic, Bashkortostan, Moscow  appears to have opened negotiations on a set of agreements  similar to those it signed with Tatarstan.  According to republic  Prime Minister Anatoliy Kopsov, the signing of the treaty with  Tatarstan "gave the latest impetus" to the resumption of talks  between Moscow and Bashkortostan.  He said that the negotiators  were working on a treaty and a package of bilateral economic,  social, and cultural agreements, some of which are "practically  ready for signing" (Interfax, 17 March).  Moscow officials have  not been observed to comment on these negotiations.      Before the Moscow-Kazan treaty signing, Moscow urged  constitutional reform in a unilateral effort to rein in the  regions.  Members of the Council of Heads of Administrations  under President Yeltsin had reportedly advised the formation of a  commission that would bring the constitutions of republics "in  line" with the federal constitution.  The Council cited "a number  of norms" in which component constitutions "contradict" the  federation's.  Nikolay Medvedev, head of the presidential  Administration's Directorate for Work with the Territories,  placed "special emphasis" on twelve republics that still have  "old" constitutions (See Note 1), and five newly established  republics, Adygey, Altai, Ingushetia, Karachayevo-Cherkessia, and  Khakassiya, which do not yet have their own constitutions  (Interfax, 6 January; Russian Television, 6 January).      (Note 1)  To illustrate his point, Medvedev reportedly cited the  republic of Mordovia, which "by its constitution is still a  soviet socialist republic" (Interfax, 6 January).  The Mordovian  SSR has since been renamed the Republic of Mordovia (Ostankino  TV, 26 January).      Republics' Response      To date, only a few republics have signaled willingness to amend  their draft constitutions in response to Moscow's objections and  the criticism from the Council of Heads of Administrations:      -- In its 11 January issue, Izvestiya reported that the  Kabardino-Balkar Republic's parliament approved a package of  proposals from republic President Valeriy Kokov to "alter" and  "supplement" the republic constitution so that it complies with  the federal constitution.      -- According to a 19 February Nezavisimaya Gazeta article, the  Komi Republic constitution "corresponds" with the federal  constitution.  Adopted on 17 February by a majority vote of the  republic Supreme Soviet, the republic constitution proclaims Komi  as a sovereign formation within the Russian Federation (Radio  Rossii, 17 February).  According to Russian TV, even before its  adoption the draft constitution for the Komi Republic was  recognized as an attempt to incorporate "the principles of  territorial sovereignty on the basis of Russian federalism" (24  January).      -- In a 27 February referendum, 97.6 percent of voters approved  the constitution of Ingushetia, which declares the republic a  "democratic, rule-of-law state, part of the Russian Federation on  a treaty basis" (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 2 March).  Employees of the  republic Justice Ministry had underscored the need to put the  Ingush constitution in line with the federal constitution before  the scheduled referendum (ITAR-TASS, 23 January).  Ingushetia's  conciliatory response may be linked to the federation  government's mediating role in an Ingush-North Ossetian  territorial dispute as an attempt to gain the federation  government's favor.      -- The republic of Buryatia reportedly passed a new constitution  that appears to follow the model set by Tatarstan.  Having  received a unanimous vote of confidence by the republic Supreme  Soviet, Buryatia's constitution reportedly states that the  republic is a "sovereign, democratic, law-governed state within  the Russian Federation," and that its relations with Moscow will  be "built on a constitutional, treaty-based foundation"  (Ostankino TV, 22 February).      -- According to republic Supreme Soviet First Deputy Chairman  Bagaudin Akhmedov, the new constitution of Dagestan calls for  "the building of a single, sovereign, democratic state within the  Russian Federation (Segodnya, 1 March).     Implications      Despite Yeltsin's and Shakhray's endorsements of the Moscow-Kazan  bilateral treaty as a model, it is not clear that Moscow is  actually prepared to conclude similar treaties with the other  republics.  Although Shakhray has reemerged as a player in  nationality affairs after a period of relative eclipse, his  position within the government remains clouded, somewhat diluting  the value of his endorsement.  The other republics, probably  viewing the treaty as a success for Kazan, will likely press  Moscow to give them a similar deal.   Box                       The Moscow-Kazan Treaty:                         Who won? Who lost?      Officials have made conflicting statements on the specifics on  the bilateral treaty, but media reportage suggests that both  Russia and Tatarstan made concessions in the treaty's final  draft:      -- Although Tatarstan may now "take part in international  relations and foreign economic activity" (ITAR-TASS, 15 February)  and--according to republic President Mintimer Shaymiyev--the  treaty "recognizes the right to self-determination . . . and  defense of sovereignty" (ITAR-TASS, 16 February), the words  sovereign state" and "subject of international law" were  reportedly removed from the treaty draft (Krasnaya Zvezda, 17  February).      -- The treaty reportedly gives Tatarstan "exclusive" ownership  and use of the land on its territory and its contents, and all  property (ITAR-TASS, 16 February).      -- According to a 17 February Krasnaya Zvezda article, Tatarstan  reportedly had to abandon its plans to establish a "single-  channel" taxation system in favor of the "general federal  scheme."      -- Although Shaymiyev has reportedly described the outcome of the  negotiations as "a change in [Tatarstan's] status . . . within  Russia" (Krasnaya Zvezda, 17 February), Minister of Nationality  Affairs and Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray has countered that  the treaty "provides neither for upgrading nor for downgrading  the status of Tatarstan" (Interfax, 18 February).      Shaymiyev stated that the Moscow-Kazan treaty will not have to be  ratified, as the federal and Tatarstan constitutions only require  parliamentary ratification of international treaties (Kazanskiye  Vedomosti, 22 February).

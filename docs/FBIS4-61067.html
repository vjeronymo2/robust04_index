			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 2 May (ITAR-TASS) -- The Russian Pacific  Fleet is not conducting maneuvers and is not taking part in any  exercises. This was how the Russian Navy's press center  commented on reports by the foreign mass media about Pacific  Fleet vessels taking part "in wide-scale maneuvers in the region  of the South Kurils." It is alleged that Russia's surface  fleet, in conjunction with ground and border troops, is working  on the task of seizing foreign territories there.    It was explained to the ITAR-TASS correspondent at the  Navy's  main headquarters that the Red Banner Pacific Fleet is at  present engaged in its usual training according to the schedule  approved by the Russian Federation Defense Ministry. Seven of  the fleet's warships are being used in the "Putina" operation  aimed at protecting the nation's natural wealth, including in  the region of the South Kurils. The fleet's participation in  joint actions with border guards and the air force to protect  the state border and to curb mass poaching which is detrimental  to Russia has not been concealed. It was specifically reported  in both the Russian and foreign mass media.    In the view of specialists of the Navy's main headquarters,  the situation in the Far East is rather difficult. However, in  their words, it is not a case of our fleet being "aggressive,"  but rather of the rapidly changing situation. Pacific Fleet  warships and forces of the Russian Border Troops are stepping up  their efforts [to increase] the effectiveness of the "Putina"  operation. This is not to the liking of those who in recent  years have grown accustomed to making brazen use of marine  resources which by rights belong exclusively to Russia. Naval  seamen claim that this explains the appearance of material  misinforming the world public.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev has arrived in  Ankara. Aliyev, who arrived in the capital at a time when  Russia is forging its new policy on the Caucasus, is trying to  reestablish trust between his country and Turkey.    [Begin Metin Corabatir recording] Aliyev landed at Ankara's  Esenboga Airport this morning to eliminate Turkish apprehensions  of the Azerbaijan Administration that emerged after the removal  of Elchibey as president, and to reestablish Turkey in the  balance of power against increasing Russian demands.    That Aliyev gave importance to this visit was obvious from  the very large delegation he brought with him. The delegation  was made up of his daughter, six ministers, the leader of  Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, numerous officials,  intellectuals, and artists. Two planes were needed to transport  them.    Diplomatic sources noted that Russia, which failed to  prevent  Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze's visit to Turkey last  month, also tried to prevent Aliyev's visit.    Acting in line with the new protocol, President Demirel, who  was prime minister when Aliyev was the leader of Nakhichevan and  from whom Aliyev received great support, did not wait for the  formal reception in the afternoon at the Cankaya presidential  palace and instead went to Esenboga to welcome his Azerbaijani  guest.    The official talks, which the two sides headed by Demirel  and  Aliyev started, basically aim at renewing trust.    During the welcoming ceremony Demirel said that Turkey will  always support Azerbaijan.    Russia's latest proposals on the Karabakh problem are at the  top of the agenda to be discussed at the talks. Oil  prospecting, transportation, and the sale of military equipment  are also to be discussed at the Turkish-Azerbaijani talks.    During the talks Turkey will convey its wish to Aliyev that  the democratic process in Azerbaijan not be disrupted. [end  recording]</p>

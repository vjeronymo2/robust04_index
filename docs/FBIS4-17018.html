			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Mukhtar Ganiyev from </F> Tashkent, including recorded remarks by Uzbek President Islam  Karimov; from the "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] We have received a report from Tashkent today on the  visit to the Uzbek capital by Chinese State Council Chairman Li  Peng.    [Ganiyev] Superpowers should not take upon themselves to  resolve all of the world's problems, PRC State Council Prime  Minister Li Peng said yesterday at a meeting with the parliament  and public of Uzbekistan. No matter what model of development  that states take, they have equal rights in the world community.  This was the main idea in his speech that was heard here as  part of the program.    The official Chinese delegation familiarized themselves with  the operation of the Chkalov aviation production association in  Tashkent this morning. I will remind you that besides buying  Uzbekistan's traditional goods, China also purchases IL-76  transport aircraft here. The Republic has dozens of joint  enterprises with China, the goods from, which are in great  demand. When acquainting himself with what is a unique  enterprise for this region, the head of the Chinese Government  expressed the hope -- during his short interview especially for  our program -- that the visit will open up new prospects for  cooperation between China and Uzbekistan.    [Karimov] The visit by the prime minister of the Chinese  People's Republic is not only of political significance to us,  but of economic significance as well. First and foremost, it is  of economic importance because we have so many unused reserves  when it comes to economic cooperation that it can be seen at a  glance.</p>

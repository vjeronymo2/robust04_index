			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Letter: Whose choice in Sunday trading argument? Sir, Allow me to take issue with your editorial on Sunday trading (May 7). The Home Office study showed that total deregulation of Sunday trading would probably, and eventually, save the average consumer 50p a week. Not to be sneezed at. However, this would be achieved by accelerating the closure of tens of thousands of small shops. (Small business managers cannot cope constantly with a seven-day working week, nor afford to hire substitute management for one day a week). Hence retail spending is concentrated in fewer outlets, prices fall and jobs go. From the consumer's point of view, the advantages of Sunday trading are extra choice of shopping time as well as lower prices in the long term. The disadvantages are less choice of outlet and less proximity of outlet - the consumer may often have to travel further for the small purchase if small chops close. For the disadvantaged consumer there is little benefit. Based on recent Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys data, if local shops closed down, those groups saying they would be 'inconvenienced a lot' include almost 40 per cent of those over 75, 50 per cent of lone parent households and 37 per cent of those without cars. One dimension of the Sunday trading debate is consumer choice. The issue is which consumer and which choice.

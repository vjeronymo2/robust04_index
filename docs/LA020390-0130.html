			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DELAY SOUGHT IN DEMAND FOR REAGAN DIARIES  </P> <P> The Justice Department, seeking to avoid a "constitutional confrontation,"  asked a federal judge late Friday to delay the deadline for former President  Ronald Reagan to turn over parts of his diaries dealing with the Iran-Contra  scandal.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene had ordered Reagan to turn over by Monday  portions of his personal diaries to lawyers for John M. Poindexter, who was  Reagan's national security adviser when the scandal broke in November, 1986.  </P> <P> Poindexter faces five felony charges and is scheduled to go on trial Feb. 20.  </P> <P> In its motion, the Justice Department asked for more time to develop a  "stipulation" of facts with independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh that could  eliminate the need to introduce sensitive national security information in  court. At the same time, the department said attempts to agree on a stipulation  had collapsed.  </P> <P> Asking for more time to conduct negotiations, the government said: "We firmly  believe that such an order is likely to obviate any need for the diary entries  to be disclosed. The court will thereby avoid a possible constitutional  confrontation and the serious potential for delay such a confrontation would  cause."  </P> <P> Reagan has resisted attempts to require him to turn over documents or to  testify at the trial of Poindexter, who told congressional investigators that  he kept Reagan in the dark about many parts of the secret deals to aid the  Nicaragua Contras. But Poindexter plans to argue that his actions in the  scandal were authorized by Reagan.  </P></p>

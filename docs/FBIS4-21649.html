			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Nuclear Program -- Are Our Hands Tied, or Will </F> They Being Broken?"]    [Text] World-renowned Pakistani scientist Dr. Abdul Qadeer  Khan says his hands have been tied. If he utters even one word,  explanations are sought from higher authorities, fearing that  the word may be misinterpreted and our aid may be stopped.  Pakistan's nuclear program began as a reaction to India's  nuclear explosion and to guarantee our security. The world  knows that our program is solely for peaceful purposes, because  Pakistan has no aggressive designs. On the other hand, India  has fought three wars with Pakistan, and by dismembering  Pakistan in 1971 it proved that it finds Pakistan's existence  unacceptable. Following the fall of East Pakistan, India is  looking for the opportunity to grab what remains of Pakistan.    India's other neighbors are also tired of this. The Maldives  and Sri Lanka have already been the victims of its aggression  and Bhutan has been blockaded economically. Except for Pakistan  and China, India's neighboring countries are not in a position  to challenge it. That is why India's nuclear program has a  direct bearing on Pakistan. India, having been defeated by  China in 1962, is unable to indulge in confrontation with China.  That is why it has adopted a reconciliatory path to settle its  border dispute with China. There has been no change in its  designs against Pakistan, however. Even now Indian leaders are  threatening a limited war with Pakistan.    There are disputes between Pakistan and India over Kashmir  and Siachen. India has still not accepted Pakistan's existence  wholeheartedly. If India were not entangled in its own domestic  problems, and if it was not afraid of Pakistan's nuclear  program, it would probably have attacked Pakistan by now. It  would have been very difficult for Pakistan to face Indian  aggression with conventional weapons. India has increased its  defense budget by 20 percent this year. Its Army is four times  bigger than ours and there is no comparison between India and  Pakistan in the naval field following the expansion of India's  Navy. In air defense, too, India's capability is double than  that of Pakistan, even though we are not weak in this field.  During his term of office, General Mirza Aslam Beg disclosed  that Pakistan is capable of fighting a war with India for up to  32 days. Knowledgeable sources say that this capability has  decreased rather than increased with the passage of time.    The only thing left for Pakistan is the nuclear deterrent,  which guarantees its security and protection, but the valiant  United States is dead against it. In addition to Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto, former Army Chief Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg admitted  that Pakistan's nuclear program was capped in 1990, but the  valiant United States is still not satisfied. Washington  suspects that Pakistan has made further advances in this field  despite capping its program; that is why it is insisting on  inspection of the installations instead of securing assurances  from the president or the prime minister. Nuclear inspections  lead to the destruction of nuclear capability, which was shown  in the case of Iraq. Ms. Davis, the U.S. under secretary of  state, said this recently while testifying before a House of  Representatives committee. Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary  of state, is coming to Pakistan in the first week of April to  demand the same thing.    The opposition has alleged that the present government has  knuckled under to U.S. pressure on the nuclear program and that  after having frozen the program, it will now agree to dismantle  it. The statement by Kahuta Plant hero Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan  hints that his hands have been tied and he is not in a position  to make any further advances. Nevertheless, a vain feeling  remains that we can make use of the capability we have acquired  thus far at any time. It is essential that the government or  some institution responsible for national security inform the  nation as to whether or not it is true that the hands of the  nuclear scientists have only been tied and are not going to be  broken according to U.S. wishes. This is essential, because if  we are deprived of this capability India will attack us  immediately in the absence of any deterrent, and the lollipop  [preceding word in English] that the United States wants to give  us will not help in any way.    Pakistan learned a lesson from its friendship with the  United  States in 1965 and 1971, when Washington imposed restrictions on  the purchase of spares, rendering our arms and aircraft  unusable. Even the U.S. demand of a one-time inspection of our  nuclear installations is unacceptable, because if we accept this  demand ingenuously we will be subjected to the same treatment  Iraq received. The inspection will mean nothing short of the  destruction of our capability. Forgoing our nuclear program for  the sake of U.S. aid -- given in the form of loans with interest  at the cost of our honor and security -- will be an utterly  foolish act. Nations do not exist merely to fill their  stomachs. Their foremost priority is to walk shoulder to  shoulder with other nations with honor and dignity. By  receiving a loan with interest that Washington offers us in the  name of military and economic aid, we may be able to overcome  our present difficulties, which are not real but are the  creation of the major powers and our hostile neighbor. On the  other hand, it will completely ruin our honor and fame as a  daring, dynamic, and principled nation which both India and the  United States fear. We must keep in mind where the secret of  our strength and honor lies, because if we are deprived of it,  the F-16's and the World Bank and IMF loans will serve no  purpose. If we have to accept the hegemony of the Hindus and  live under their domination, then why did we struggle for the  establishment of Pakistan? It is the government's  responsibility to remove all doubts and suspicions that have  been created by Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan's statement.</p>

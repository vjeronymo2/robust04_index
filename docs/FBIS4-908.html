			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Casimir Oye-Mba has clarified his  stand following criticisms that his new government is too large.  Casimir Oye-Mba appointed 38 persons to this government [words  indistinct] because those who think this government is too large  are the very same people who felt that some of the country's  nine provinces were underrepresented.    Regarding the refusal of two appointees to join the  government, the Gabonese prime minister stressed that such  refusals are normal in a system that has renounced the one-party  system and which guarantees freedom of action and expression.  Listen to Casimir Oye- Mba interviewed by Jean Valere  Mbinamanza:    [Begin recording] [Oye-Mba] Your question assumes people are  bound to the rules of the one-party system. Previously, people  were not consulted before being asked to join the government.  They heard on the radio that they were made ministers. In the  same way, they heard on the radio that they ceased to be  ministers. People did not resign, or if they did there was  little discussion about it. Gabonese must know that we are now  in a pluralist system. If someone is asked to join the  government, he is free to accept or refuse.    [Mbinamanza] What we do not understand very well in this  case  which has already marked the beginning of this government from  which much is expected, is that these persons were supposed to  have been consulted first and then to have later declined the  offer to join the government.    [Oye-Mba] This can be attributed to the behavior of  politicians!    [Mbinamanza] In that case do you feel somehow trapped?    [Oye-Mba] Not at all! I am not bothered. I am prime  minister today and as long as I remain so, I will continue to do  my work with those who are willing. Tomorrow, when I cease to  be prime minister I will do something else and someone else will  come to continue. [end recording]    I recall that former Minister of State Jean-Francois  Ntoutoume and Jean-Pierre Bayena, two of the 38 persons called  upon to join the new Gabonese Government, declined this offer  with the argument that there was nothing coherent in the  portfolios they were offered.    Finally, Casimir Oye-Mba said he would ask for a vote of  confidence by the National Assembly at the right time and that  he did not fear in any way a vote of no confidence.</p>

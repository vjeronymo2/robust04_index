			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Technology: Consultant's critique - Software at Work Code books conventionally hide information. The Memex Information Engine uses them to retrieve it. In the system, every word in a document can be reduced to a code of between one and three characters. If the average word has six letters there is a compression of about 3:1. This reduces the space required to store the information. When looking for specific words in the database, the search program examines the code book for each document. If the words do not appear at all in a document there is no need to look at the full text. This speeds things up. Huffman encoding, a more advanced version of this idea, has been around for decades. Nearly every leading data compression utility uses some variant of it. Memex has spotted how encoding can be used to real advantage in searching - the heart of document management. Traditional document management systems use indexes. Important words - 'keywords' are identified and these are stored like labels to aid future searches. Often this is done manually and it is error prone. The Memex system searches more effectively because all the words in a document act as keywords. A simple example was a hunt for a car used in a crime. The Holmes database produced 40 suspects. Trace turned up a further two that had been missed. Trace has allowed Central Scotland Police to integrate information from a wide range of sources. The Police National Computer cannot search for car registrations when one letter is known. Trace can, by searching a dump of car details taken from the PNC. Data from many sources can be combined to extend the searches. I liked the graphical front end, especially the integration of voice and video. Memex seemed to have spent time getting close to the police and tailoring the system to their needs. Everyone appeared to like the system and said it would help them do their job better. The author is a consultant at Software Design and Construction, of Milton Keynes</p>

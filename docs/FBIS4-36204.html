			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ajoy Base: "Stronger Than Ever"] </F>   [Text] Mr P V Narasimha Rao is perhaps the first Prime  Minister of this country to approach the fourth year of his  five-year term in office looking actully stronger than he did  when he first assumed power.    The outcome of the recent round of by-elections spread  across  the country may or may not be wholly reflectvie of the popular  mood, but it has certainly served to further boost Mr Narasimha  Rao's position. Even if one were to view the Congress victories  in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal pradesh, Punjab, Orissa  and Andhra Pradesh as individual aberrations, there surely must  be some lesson to be drawn from the fact that out of 18  parliamentary and assembly seats which went to the hustings, the  ruling party won as many as 10 while its two main national  opponents, BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] and Janata Dal, managed  respectively two and none.    This relative supremacy of the Congress; under Mr Narasimha  Rao's leadership over political rivals is all the more  creditworthy in the light of the party's performance in bypolls  under past Prime Ministers in mid-term. Both Mrs Indira Gandhi  and her son and successor looked distinctly vulnerable after  their honeymoon period with the electoral had worn off and  invariably tended to lose bypolls: And as for non-Congress Prime  Minister of yore, none of them even managed to last at the  Centre long enough the middle of their full term in office.    There are other crucial differences between Mr Narasimha Rao  and his predecessors in the Prime Minister's chair. The  pupularity graphs of leaders like Mrs Indira Gandhi and Rajiv  Gandhi and even those of Mr Morarji Desai and Mr V P Singh  tended to follow an uniform pattern. They rose dramatically  when these Prime Ministers first assumed power and then started  slumping as disillusionment set in with their respective regimes.    Mr Narasimha Rao's graph, on the other hand, has followed a  more complex course. He became Prime Minister amidst few  expectations and was in fact widely considered to be a stop gap  leader to be cast aside as soon as Mrs Sonia Gandhi or some  powerful Congress boss managed to seize power.    His graph rose, however, when in, the first year of ofice he  staved off such challenges in a quiet and dogged manner but then  on a downward spiral after the demolition of the Babri Masjid  and the corruption charges levelled by Mr Harshad Mehta. Now  that the Prime Minister has not only managed to survive the  crises of last year but emerged the leader of a reasonably  stable government with a full-fledged majority in the Lok Sabha,  his stock has once again mounted.    Not surprisingly, this checkered political track record  which  if nothing else illustrated Mr Sarasimha Rao's ability to handle  the rough as well as the smooth has pushed to the corner his  opponents within the Congress and outside. Former ruling party  dissidents like Mr Arjun Singh and Mr Sharad Pawar have become  increasingly wary of openly crossing swords with the Prime  Minister and the dissidence which had once threatened to engulf  the Congress has virtually faded away over recent months.    More importantly, there is a new respect within the party  for  Mr Narasimha Rao's political judgement which was not there  before. Most Congressmen today grudgingly admit that even the  Prime Minister's only palpable blunder over the Babri Masjid  demolition may not have been a mistake after all but a shredw  piece of procrastination.    They concede that while dismissing the Kalyan Singh  Government or order fire at the militing masses at Ayodhya to  protect that mosque may have been morally right and brave but  could have had disastrous political consequences for the party  if a enervated BJP had swept Uttar Pradesh in the subsequent  election. Mr Rao's prescription of patiently riding out the  saffron wave was indeed painful for those in the Congress used  to Mrs Gandhi's penchant to do open battle but in hindsight now  seems to have been the correct' strategy.    There is also far less panic in the ruling party about being  swallowed by either the Mandir or the Mandal Wole. Congressmen  realise that the wheels of the Sangh Parivar's judggernaut has  got badly stuck after the denouncement of last year's Assemby  polls while the Janata Dal's missionary zeal in promoting a  caste revolution has not been able to prevent the steady  disintegration of the party.    This is not to suggest that Mr Rao has managed to  orchestrate  a resurgence of the Congress. There are no indications  whatsoever of the party reviving in states like Uttar Pradesh  and Bihar where it has become even more marginalised than before.    Yet there are few partymen today who would support an  alternative leader to Mr Rao who after all has shown the way of  keeping a political fossil like the Congress alive at the centre  without the life support of the country's two largest states.  Many of them privately criticise the Prime Minister's  reluctance to revamp the party organisation in Uttar Pradesh and  Bihar but at the same time acknowledge the Herculean nature of  this task. Some have even started to say that Mr Rao may be  making the best of a bad job.    General public perceptions of Mr Rao are more difficult to  pin down. But there is little doubt that he has emerged a  seasoned leader who for all his flaws has been able to rise out  of political turmoil to give the country a relatively stable  government than his immediate predecessors.    Jokes about the Prime Minister's notorious indecisive nature  still do the media circles and perhaps have some justification  but they no longer raise the sort of derisive laughter at the  popular level. After all it is difficult to sneer at a leader  for faillng to take decisions when he manages to come out on the  top everytime by doing so.    In fact, there are some people who see Mr Rao as a wise  stateman who realising the limitations of the party he leads and  the country he rules gives time for problems to resolve  themselves. They see his foreign policy successes as well as his  ability to manage contradictions at home as signs of a Prime  Minister who may be the best candidate for leading such a large  and diverse nation as India.    Much of this present aura about Mr. Rao could quickly vanish  if his political career hits another iceberg. People are quick  to change their perceptions about leaders and a major economic  disaster or communal turbulence may well send the Prime  Minister's image plunging down again.    Yet, considering Mr Rao's proven skill of surmounting  disasters without appearing to put much effort, most may  hesitate before writing the obituary of a Prime Minister who has  proved his detractors wrong so many times before.</p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH BUCKING FOR WAR, BRITISH LABORITE SAYS  </P> <P> A former British defense minister accused President Bush on Saturday of  treating the Persian Gulf crisis like a schoolboy fight with Iraq's Saddam  Hussein and risking a disastrous war with "Rambo" remarks.  </P> <P> Opposition Labor Party politician Denis Healey said Bush's hard-line stance on  the gulf crisis and his eagerness to come across as a strong leader could end  up dragging a reluctant world into war.  </P> <P> "What is really worrying is that the fear of appearing a wimp has made him act  as a sort of ersatz "Rambo," pushing an unwilling world into disaster," Healey  said in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp. radio.  </P></p>

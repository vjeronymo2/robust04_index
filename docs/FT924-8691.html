			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Business and the Law: Atlantic Computers disclosure - Legal Briefs Spicer and Oppenheim (now part of Touche Ross) has lost its battle to avoid handing over to the administrators of British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings all books, papers and other records relating to B&amp;C's 1988 acquisition of Atlantic Computers, the collapsed computer leasing company. Atlantic went under in April 1990 with a deficiency in its assets of some Pounds 279m, shortly before B&amp;C itself went into administration. B&amp;C's administrators felt there were 'serious questions' about Atlantic's business and representations made to B&amp;C at the time which needed answering. Spicers argued that, under the 1986 Insolvency Act, it only had to hand over sufficient information to the administrators to 'reconstitute the state of the company's knowledge' if it had remained solvent. The Law Lords disagreed. The protection offered by the act lay not in limiting the category of documents but in the fact that the person applying for a production order had to satisfy the court that it was justified, and that it would not impose an unreasonable burden on the person concerned. The application was not necessarily unreasonable because it was inconvenient for Spicers, or might provide ammunition for a claim against it.</p>

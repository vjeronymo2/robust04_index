			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 9 (CTK) -- President Vaclav Havel  today signed the amendment to the labor law passed by the  government last month, chairman of the Bohemian-Moravian Chamber  of Trade Unions (CMKOS) Richard Falbr informed delegates of the  First CMKOS Congress today. Jiri Sitler of the President's  Office confirmed the information for CTK.    Sitler said the president would speak about his reasons for  signing in more detail during his regular Sunday radio address  tomorrow.    The congress had decided to ask President Vaclav Havel,  through either a declaration, resolution or letter, not to sign  the amendment into law. The deadline for signing the law was  midnight tonight.    Frantisek Klima, chairman of the Union of Public Road  Transportation, suggested the congress call a 10-15-minute  general strike if Havel signed the law, but the new CMKOS  chairman, Richard Falbr, rebuffed the idea, saying it was  necessary as soon as possible "to establish order among  ourselves."    "Don't expect this congress to call a general strike," he  said. His words were met with applause from congress delegates.    Falbr said he had expected Havel to sign the law, since it  would be difficult for him to defy the government coalition.    The parts of the amendment that most disturb the unions are  those defining work agreements for fixed periods of time and  regulating night shift work for pregnant women. On March 22,  about 40,000 union members from throughout the country gathered  on Prague's Old Town Square to protest the amendment.    Parliament passed the amendment the following day, vetoing  all opposition amendments to the amendment.</p>

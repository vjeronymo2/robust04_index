			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / People: Mercury tries harder at unit trusts Mercury Asset Management, one of the biggest and most aggressive London fund managers, has poached Richard Royds, the 34-year-old managing director of John Govett Unit Trusts, to head its own unit trust operation, one of the weaker parts of MAM's business. Royds, who will take over as managing director of Mercury Fund Managers in early July, helps fill a gap at the top which has existed since James Dawnay, 45, left to join Martin Currie Investment Management last November. Dawnay was replaced as chairman of Mercury Fund Managers by David Rosier, 41, who will continue to hold this post in addition to his other responsibilities. Nicholas Stewart, 37, the current managing director, becomes vice chairman. Royds' appointment is the clearest sign to date of MAM's intention of beefing up its unit trust business, which has been overshadowed by its far more successful pension fund management operation. Although MAM's unit trusts have around Pounds 1.7bn of funds, and rank tenth in size in the industry, this represents only a small part of a group which manages around Pounds 40bn in total. Whilst MAM's decision to look outside the group to strengthen its unit trust team is no surprise, the choice of Royds may be. After a stint at Capital Radio and the Media Shop, he is a relatively late entrant to the unit trust game, only joining Wardley Unit Trust Managers in 1986 and John Govett in 1988. While his rise has been rapid, the firm he comes from is hardly yet one of the unit trust industry's great success stories. At the end of last year Govett ranked 72nd in terms of the size of funds under management - although chief executive Kevin Pakenham points out how ' a very successful year to date' has achieved net sales of Pounds 40m plus, with notable successes in selling innovative futures fund products. 'One of the great problems of the unit trust business is that it has tended to recycle funds within the industry' according to Rosier. To attempt to break that pattern, Mercury needs a much more diversified product range. Meanwhile Pakenham says that Royds' departure ' leaves a 'personality', but not necessarily a large 'business', gap. ***** Richard Young is the new finance director of SUNLEIGH, the USM company which has recently moved out of engineering and into leisure products. With the switch - to PowaKaddy electronic golf trollies, Laser dinghies and Dart catamarans - came a move of the company's headquarters from Yorkshire to Maidenhead. The previous finance director was not prepared to come south, opening up the opportunity for 46-year-old Taylor. He has switched from the position of finance director at the UK subsidiary of Crane Corporation, where the product range included pipe fittings, valves and pumps. A chartered accountant, he spent 12 years with ITT in Brussels and the rest of Continental Europe, before returning to the UK for a spell with Sun Microsystems.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIFE WITHOUT KFAC: WHEN ROCK ROLLS OVER BACH  </P> <P> Quite a brouhaha, what with enraged letters and long features in Calendar about  KFAC's demise. As a former symphony musician, I wonder about the taste of the  various enraged nuts. First of all, who wants four -- count them, four --  commercials after every selection?  </P> <P> There is an excellent alternative -- KUSC, which offers 21 hours daily of the  best in classical music and -- heavenly delight -- no commercials.  </P> <P> JACK H.

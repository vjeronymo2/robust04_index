			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COURT DISBARS LAWYER ACCUSED OF DMV BRIBERY  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court on Monday ordered the disbarment of a Torrance attorney  charged with passing $400 concealed in matchbooks to a Department of Motor  Vehicles hearing officer in return for favorable rulings.  </P> <P> The justices rejected contentions by the lawyer, Barry G. Sands, 45, that there  was not enough evidence to warrant disbarment and that the money was a loan.  </P> <P> "All that matters here is that (Sands) passed something of value to (the  officer) . . . ," the court said in an unsigned 19-page opinion. "What is  crucial here is the fact that the passing of the money amounted in substance  and effect to being a bribe."  </P> <P> Sands declined comment.  </P> <P> The court's action came in a professional discipline case that emerged from a  17-month criminal investigation by Los Angeles County authorities into the  activities of Michael R. Tarrish, a DMV hearing officer in Long Beach empowered  to decide whether to revoke or suspend driver's licenses.  </P> <P> Tarrish, who told investigators he had received payments from several  attorneys, including Sands, in exchange for favorable decisions, was dismissed  by the DMV in 1987 and placed on three years' probation after pleading no  contest to accepting a bribe.  </P> <P> In proceedings before the State Bar of California, Tarrish said that Sands on  four separate occasions had bought him lunch, discussed his clients' cases and  each time passed him a matchbook containing a $100 bill. Sands said he gave  Tarrish the money because Tarrish had told him of some personal financial  problems. A hearing panel of the Bar and the Bar's disciplinary review  department urged disbarment.  </P> <P> In his appeal to the state Supreme Court, Sands denied he had done anything  unethical, saying it was "common practice" among attorneys to discuss their  cases informally with DMV hearing officers. He contended further that he should  not be punished on the dubious testimony of Tarrish, whose cooperation with the  Bar was required under the conditions of his probation.  </P> <P> The justices agreed that Tarrish's testimony should be given careful scrutiny  but noted that the hearing panel had found his account "convincing" and  "credible."  </P></p>

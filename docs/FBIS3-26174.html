Wu Jianmin, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said this at a  routine news conference this afternoon, when asked to comment on  former British Ambassador to China Sir Percy Cradock's criticism  of Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten in an article carried by the  "SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST".    Wu said that China has noticed that there are different  voices within Britain over the Hong Kong issue.    He noted that to maintain cooperation between China and  Britain on the matter of Hong Kong is in accordance with the  interests of the two sides.    He said that Patten's intransigence and uncooperative  attitude would end up harming Britain's own interests.    Cradock was ambassador to China from June 1978 to December  1983.    On China's reaction toward the recently tabled fourth  funding  plan for the construction of the new Hong Kong airport, Wu said  that the Chinese Government had just received the new financial  arrangement plan from the British side and was studying it  earnestly.    He said that the new airport issue should be settled in  accordance with the memorandum of understanding reached between  China and Britain.    In the process of such settlement, the British side should  demonstrate its sincerity, Wu said, adding that the Chinese side  has already demonstrated a lot of sincerity over the Hong Kong  matter.</p>

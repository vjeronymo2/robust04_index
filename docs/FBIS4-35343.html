			<p>BFN     [Text] The sons of our Yemeni people continue to reject the  destructive war which the Sanaa regime insists on continuing to  drive (?large numbers) of youth people into the holocaust of  death and destruction. Reports confirm that many citizens have  begun to refuse to send off their sons to the battlefronts to  fight their brothers in the Democratic Republic of Yemen. The  regime's organs in Sanaa have resorted to brutal and repressive  methods such as those used by the military police, which  subjects those refusing their orders to threats and [words  indistinct]. In this fashion, the authorities killed the sons  of a shaykh in al-Hudaydah Governorate as a way of terrorizing  the citizens and forcing them to obey the orders of the  repressive authorities in Sanaa.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Monrovia, 11 May (AFP) -- The fighting between  Mandingos and Krahns, the two rival clans within the United  Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia [ULIMO] -- Liberian  armed faction -- continued today, north of Monrovia, despite the  cease-fire reached in principle by the two warring sides which  have been involved in negotiation efforts since 9 May. The  continued fighting was noted by the Economic Community of West  African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group [ECOMOG] and  confirmed to AFP by a spokesman for the Mandingos who stated  that the Krahns attacked them yesterday evening at Suehn, 35 km  north of Monrovia.    Colonel Wealtu Sawyea, commander of the Krahn forces, told  the media today that the cease-fire order had not been sent to  him up to now by the clan leader, General Roosevelt Johnson, the  ULIMO military commander. The general's supporters stated that  his "old mother" as well as a ULIMO Krahn leader, Harry Nayou,  were "taken hostage" by Mandingo fighters in Tubmanburg, 60 km  north of Monrovia. They stated that the fighting would not stop  as long as these two people were not released.    The continued fighting did not prevent the negotiations from  resuming this morning at the ECOMOG headquarters in Monrovia  between Gen. Johnson and Alhaji Koromah, the Mandingo clan  leader and ULIMO chairman. On the third consecutive day the  discussions were to center on the sharing between Mandingos and  Krahns of the posts allocated to ULIMO within the transitional  institutions.    Gen. Johnson's supporters continue saying that their rivals  have taken hold of most of these posts -- two in the Council of  State, seven in the government, and nine in the Parliament --  while the two ethnic groups have the same number of members  within the ULIMO. Mr. Koromah and his supporters, according to  an informed source, dismissed these allegations, describing  their adversaries' demands as "irrealistic and potentially  harmful."</p>

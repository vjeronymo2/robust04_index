			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Baghdad's defiance of UN team raises possibility of air-attack AN AIR-STRIKE by the Gulf war allies against targets in Iraq is more likely now than at any time since the war because of Baghdad's defiance of United Nations weapons inspectors, US and British officials said yesterday. But Iraq's UN ambassador said dropping 'a bomb or two' on Baghdad or any other city would not force his country to let the weapons inspectors search its agriculture ministry. Diplomats at the UN said there was unanimity among the 15 members of the Security Council that Iraq could not be allowed to get away with barring the weapons team from a ministry building in Baghdad. In the face of increasing harassment, relays of inspectors have parked outside the building for 17 days. The US, Britain and France have begun consultations on possible use of force unless Iraq yields. The revival of a serious military option follows growing concern and frustration, not just at Iraq's defiance of the inspectors, but also at other rebuffs to the UN and a spate of attacks on UN guards in northern Iraq. Furthermore, US officials said the Security Council was determined not to be seen as a pushover during tense operations in Cambodia and the former Yugoslavia. 'The council is not at this point going to allow itself to be regarded as a pussycat,' one diplomat said. Sir David Hannay, British ambassador to the UN, said publicly on Monday that military action against Iraq had not been ruled out. In private, British officials said UN patience with Iraq was running out. They believe an air-strike could be made without further UN resolutions. Nevertheless, US and British diplomats in New York shied away from reported comments by an anonymous Security Council diplomat suggesting that a strike against Iraq was 'inevitable' and would take place within 10 days. Dismissing the military threat, Mr Abdul Amir Al-Anbari, Iraq's ambassador, told reporters: 'The use of force would undermine the authority of the council because, I tell you, it is not going to change the Iraqi position. 'Throwing a bomb or two, whether on Baghdad or here or there, is not going to change (matters). To the contrary, it shows that the council, without the co-operation of the Iraqi government, cannot do much.' The raised tension came amid unconfirmed reports that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein had been assassinated. The reports, filed originally by the Egyptian Middle East News Agency, were apparently prompted by interruption in normal service on Baghdad radio yesterday morning, when programmes were replaced by readings from the Koran. But normal service resumed yesterday afternoon and there was nothing to confirm the rumours. The real issue in Iraq, Page 17</p>

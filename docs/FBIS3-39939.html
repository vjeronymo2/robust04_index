			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed G.M., LE MONDE correspondent in Cape Town: </F> "French Frigate in Cape Town -- France and South Africa Resume  Military Relations"]    [Text] For the first time since 1976, and two weeks after a  similar visit by the Royal Navy, a French military ship has gone  to South Africa as part of an official visit. The Germinal  surveillance frigate, under the command of Captain Patrick  Giaume, is staying in Cape Town from 14 to 21 February. Several  meetings with South African Navy officials as well as a  demonstration of the ship's capabilities are scheduled to take  place during the visit, which bears witness to closer military  relations between the two countries.    France has just reopened its Military Attache Office in  Pretoria, which had been "frozen" for several years as a result  of sanctions. The arrival of the Germinal coincides with the  visit in South Africa of a parliamentary delegation headed by  Yvon Bourges, a former defense minister and the vice president  of the Senate's Foreign Affairs and Defense Commission. The  delegation met with South African Defense Minister Kobie Coetsee  as well as several military officials.    The Germinal -- the latest in a series of six frigates -- is  armed with a 100-mm automatic cannon and sea-to-sea Exocet  missiles. It carries a Dauphin helicopter and was designed for  extended missions, including general-purpose sea surveillance,  evacuation of nationals, and interventions. These are the  features which motivated the ship's presence in Southern Africa  in the first place. South Africa -- whose whole naval strategy  used to be geared toward defending the Cape Town route in case  of an East-West conflict -- must now redefine its objectives and  equipment requirements. According to Vice-Admiral Bernard  Moysan, the president of the Sea Trials Commission, who came to  Cape Town on board of the Germinal, the frigate is perfectly  suited to the country's new naval needs.</p>

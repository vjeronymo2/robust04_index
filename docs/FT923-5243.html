			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Derelict land grows on trees Sapling number 26, on a windy Welsh hillside, looks deceptively like any other young alder. With a spindly trunk and only a few leaves it struggles to survive. Yet it is part of a project which challenges conventional thinking on land reclamation. The project, in the heavily-mined Blaenavon area in south Wales, is experimenting with an ecological approach to reclaiming derelict land - rather than the traditional approach of employing machinery and civil engineers. If successful, it could prove applicable not only to Wales, but around the world. The idea is to use trees to generate self-sustaining soil in what is now mostly impermeable clay. The engineering approach currently adopted involves reshaping land with bulldozers. Channels and drains are created to control running waters and a thin carpet of soil is added, seeded and fertilised. The process produces green fields but time shows that such reclaimed land eventually deteriorates, requiring re-reclaiming at great expense. The Blaenavon project is the brainchild of Martin Haigh, lecturer at Oxford Polytechnic and vice-president for the World Association of Soil and Water Conservation. He has been monitoring the reclaimed mining and industrial land in Wales for the past 21 years, examining soil erosion, soil evolution and hydrology. His work has shown that the soil in former mining areas is dying; shales brought up to the surface by mining break down into clays which clog up the imported topsoil with water and prevent plant growth. Green fields of grass become water-logged and replaced by moss and algae, unsuitable even for grazing. Some mined land in Wales has been devoid of vegetation for more than 40 years. Haigh's search for a solution has resulted in a surprising form of east-west technology transfer - from the environmentally-ravaged eastern bloc to Britain. Bulgaria has been experimenting with ecological land reclamation for the past 50 years to tackle its problems. Research has shown that planting alders and other trees helps rejuvenate the soil; the tree roots bring in micro-organisms which create organic material, and that helps build up an active soil ecosystem which is self-sustaining. Bulgaria has been forced to adopt such an approach because the country's best energy reserves lie under prime agricultural land, hundreds of acres of which are dug up every year. Reclaiming such land is a national priority, receiving the attention of Bulgaria's best scientists and research institutes. In Wales, the long-term future of reclaimed land is a taboo issue for land reclamation agencies, says Haigh. He has had little encouragement from such established groups. 'This project is at the forefront of a change in philosophy in soil reclamation,' he says. Bulgarian experiments found that ecological reclamation costs one-tenth that of the UK approach because topsoil is so expensive to buy and transport. But the new method takes 10 times as long because the trees do the work naturally in their own time. 'Cost is important but it's not the whole question, sustainability is,' says Haigh. Haigh expects still to be working on his project in another 21 years - his saplings will take at least 10 years to mature to the point where he can begin monitoring the soil underneath for changes. Meanwhile, he relies on funding from a number of organisations. The BOC Foundation - a company set up by the UK industrial gases group to initiate and fund research into pollution - has committed Pounds 40,000 over two years. Earthwatch, the environmental charity, has also committed resources and manpower. Its 'volunteers', who pay to spend their holidays helping out on conservation projects, have been working with Haigh, monitoring soil and sapling growth.</p>

			<p>1994   Bilateral Antidrug Plans   <F P=102> 94WB0033B Mexico City EXCELSIOR in Spanish 2 Apr 94 pp 5-A,  22-A </F>  <F P=103> 94WB0033B </F> <F P=104>  Mexico City EXCELSIOR </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Heliodoro Cardenas Garza] </F>   [Text] The Office of the Attorney General of the Republic  [PGR] announced as part of this year's priority strategic tasks  for combating drugs the holding of a meeting of the Joint  Standing Committee To Revise the Mexican-U.S. Cooperation  Program for Drug Control.    The PGR also revealed that it will hold meetings and sign  agreements and treaties with Guatemala, Belize, Costa Rica,  Panama, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Chile, Peru, Germany, France,  the United Kingdom, Russia, and South Africa pertaining to  bilateral operations for fighting the drug traffic.    According to the institution, special attention is being  given to cooperation with the Central American nations, since,  in the Mexican Government's strategy, that region's geopolitical  situation ranks it as a priority territory. It declared that the  entry and passage of narcotics and psychotropic substances in  that area must be prevented.    The office gave a reminder that last year Mexico's  cooperation with Central America was part of our country's  general plans for international cooperation, and it was guided  by specific considerations of a geopolitical and strategic  nature.    The PGR noted that Mexico's action for drug control with the  nations of that region was aimed, in particular, at  collaborating with the international counternarcotics effort,  especially that intended to prevent the entry of narcotics or  their passage to the northern part of the area.    To reinforce this action, legal advice has been offered for  many years to prepare Articles of Agreement that would create  the Central American Standing Committee for the Eradication of  Production, Trafficking, Consumption, and Illicit Use of  Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances.    Similarly, since July 1993, the Attorney General's Office  has  directed efforts toward intensifying and defining the methods  for cooperation with the Central American nations, including  bilateral action in the endeavors with the region as a whole.    The agency explained that, following the discoveries made on  working visits paid to each of the Central American countries  between July and August 1993, a document was prepared proposing  Mexico's strategy for legal cooperation and joint drug control  with Central America.    It stressed that, on this basis, interinstitutional  consultations were held on a national scale, obtaining the  support of the departments involved in the matter, including the  Foreign Ministry.    As for the bilateral relations with the United States to  combat drugs, the PGR proposed for this year a reinforcement of  the negotiations on the extradition treaty. The aim is to leave  the prohibition on border kidnappings explicitly established,  and to reinforce this cooperation by placing emphasis on the  common battle against organized crime and money laundering. It  is intended to continue holding semiannual technical work  sessions on the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, and to seek new  means of cooperation to deal with the problems of violence on  the border. Among other things, it is also planned to study the  feasibility of obtaining a six-month permit for the Citation  aircraft to overfly and land during their maintenance trips to  the United States.</p>

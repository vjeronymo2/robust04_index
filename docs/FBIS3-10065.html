			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Carlos Alberto Sardenberg] </F>   [Text] After two months negotiating the Social Emergency  Fund (FSE), the federal government budget bill for 1994 is as  follows: Revenues totalling $89.5 billion, expenditures totaling  $81.8 billion, and a primary balance of $7.7 billion (without  including the payment of interests). This is enough to pay real  interests. Once the interests are paid, there will be a minimum  operational balance of $2.2 million. In other words, there is  the balanced budget deemed indispensable for the FHC [Fernando  Henrique Cardoso] economic plan. The FSE, which stood at $16.1  billion in its original version, has been cut to $15.5. billion.  As the FSE seeks to cover gaps in the budget, the $600 million  that has been cut will have to be compensated by expenditure  cutbacks.    Negotiations with Congress have resulted in an increase in  the federal government general expenditures by $865 million.  State and county administrations will benefit from that. In  accordance with the original budget bill, they would have been  allocated $11.7 billion. Now, they will receive $13.3 billion.  This is why governors and mayors supported voting for the FSE.    To compensate for what it gave the states and counties, the  federal government earned $500 million by holding back federal  public employees' income tax and reducing cost expenditures and  investment by $700 million. The executive branch will have to  reduce its expenditures by $500 million. The legislative and  judicial branches will have to reduce theirs by another $200  million. In other words, the federal government will continue  to live on bread and water.    From the federal revenue, the budget gained a net $833  million compared to its December version. There has been a  positive reevaluation resulting from Cofins [Social Security  Contributions] revenue and the results of the campaign against  tax evasion. Another $900 million revenue has been obtained  through the sale of National Bank for Economic and Social  Development shares. It is a feasible budget, but its  implementation will require close control by the Finance  Ministry.</p>

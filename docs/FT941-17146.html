			<p>940106 FT  06 JAN 94 / Irish group wins duty-free deal Aer Rianta, the state-backed company which runs Ireland's main airports, has won the contract to run duty-free shops at both ends of the Channel tunnel. Duty-free sales are expected to account for most non-travel revenues from Eurotunnel's operations. They are estimated at Pounds 18m this year, rising to Pounds 46m in 1996. Mr Derek Keogh, chief executive, said Aer Rianta had fought off strong international competition to win the deal. Its shops will cover an area of 400 sq m at each end of the tunnel.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / VW expects early accord on Seat Volkswagen said yesterday it hoped to end talks with the Madrid government 'in the next two weeks' to clear the way for further restructuring at Seat, its loss-making Spanish subsidiary. The company said it wanted Spain to contribute DM820m (Pounds 328m) to fund redundancies at Seat. It claimed there were 'positive signals' that the government would make funds available and a further meeting was scheduled for next week. However, in Madrid, the industry ministry said it would only be willing to pump more money into the Barcelona-based car company for new development projects. The government also argues that its scope for providing help is limited by European Union rules. Mr Juan Ignacio Molto, secretary of state for industry, told VW representatives on Tuesday that the government was not prepared to fund redundancy packages. Excess labour was 'a problem for private sector management'. Seat plans to shed about 4,600 workers, leaving it with a workforce of around 9,500 by 1996. The company expects to end the year with losses of about DM1bn, but should become profitable again in 1995. Meanwhile, VW announced that it had had 'positive results' at company and group level in April and May but would not give details of profits. The company has already said it hopes to improve on its 1993 profit of DM71m (Pounds 28.4m) at company level this year and to break even at group level following a loss of DM1.4bn (Pounds 560m) last year. Worldwide deliveries in the first five months rose 6.1 per cent over the year before to total 1.4m units. Germany was the only market where deliveries fell - by 4.1 per cent - a fact VW blamed on weak demand there generally and poor sales at Audi.</p>

The inspection is aimed at researching the situation and  material-technical conditions of the former Russian  landing-troops military base #104, which was withdrawn from  Ganja in May 1993 under President Elchibey.    TURAN believe that the military inspection by Russian  officers testifies that plans for a Russian troop return to  Azerbaijan is being carried out. Though officially, Baku denies  this, reports from Moscow prove that the return of Russian  troops to Azerbaijan is practically agreed upon. TURAN news  agency has reported that one of the Russian military bases will  be stationed in Ganja.

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Accountancy: Big Six incorporation race still in with a chance as a 1995 classic - Jim Kelly interviews KPMG's senior partner who explains the firm'sstrategy in its planned move away from a partnership structure Ian Brindle, the acerbic senior partner at Price Waterhouse, once famously said on the subject of accountancy firms moving from partnership to incorporation that it was a matter of: 'when not whether'. After that things became much more simple. The issue boiled down to a question of 'Who?'. In October this year, KPMG Peat Marwick announced the start of a consultation period with clients, regulators, and institutional investors on a plan to incorporate its core audit business. A final decision is now likely in late February or early March 1995. It is still not certain that KPMG will cross the line first. The rest of the Big Six are all either blowing the dust off long-drawn incorporation plans, circulating papers for discussion with partners, or keeping quiet. Touche Ross seems to be the least enthusiastic. There is still a chance that a rush to incorporation will deliver most of the big firms into incorporation in 1995. But the likelihood is that KPMG's public lead will be maintained to the finishing line. The problem for KPMG's competitors is divining just why the firm wants to move so quickly. Has it spotted some commercial advantage the others have missed? In particular, how is it going to deal with the many difficulties identified with incorporation over the years? All those involved see the central advantage to incorporation - the replacement of joint and several liability by corporate and individual liability. The growing burden of litigation, and threatened litigation, is seen by the Big Six as a burden serious enough to push one of them out of business. Incorporation cannot remove that threat to the business, which can still be pursued to destruction in the courts. But the lesser prize of ring-fencing the personal assets of partners from the consequences of negligence by their colleagues is plain enough. What appears to be at the core of KPMG's motivation is a desire to promote auditing as the core of its business and to give it room to develop within the new company. Freed from the anxieties created by joint and several liability, it obviously sees a more dynamic future outside the partnership. But it is the details which have often stopped other firms from moving ahead. I asked Colin Sharman, the senior partner at KPMG who has driven it forward on incorporation, some of the questions the rest of the accountancy profession is currently asking about incorporation. Would 'KPMG Audit' have to apply for all the audits currently held by KPMG Peat Marwick? 'There would be a definite change which the shareholders (of the client companies) would have to vote on,' he says, adding that the consultation period with clients and investors has been crucial in order to pave the way for such a handover. What will be the investment and fund-raising policies of the audit arm? What will be its capital base? 'We will have in the audit arm the capital we need to run the business,' he says. On the capital base, he says KPMG is taking soundings in the market and advice from a third party. 'The phrase that is used is that it needs to be substantial. It's not going to be Pounds 100. We are right in the middle of those discussions now.' How will you protect partners not in the audit arm from litigation if they become involved in a troubled audit? 'You can never, and we will not seek, to protect an individual from the results of his own negligence. That individual can always be pursued whether we have partnership or a company.' But could a litigant pursue a partner of KPMG Peat Marwick involved in an audit with the company, and so gain access to assets of all the partners through joint and several liability? 'We think not. We have looked into that and the advice we have got is no. The audit service would be rendered by the auditor and the audit company. Assuming that action was brought under the law of contract the action would be against the incorporated body.' Even in a corporation you can be sued if you are involved in negligence. But how closely do you have to be involved? 'I think if you sign the audit report, you are pretty directly involved. I think a concurring partner might well be involved. I think it could be quite a wide net rather than a very narrow net. I don't think it would be restricted to just the person who signed the audit report.' How will you spread the tax and national insurance costs of incorporation? 'The partners will bear it individually.' So it will be incurred by the auditors but spread across all the partners of the firm? 'Absolutely.' The audit partner would be a partner of the firm and a director of the audit company? 'Absolutely. Because remember that our audit partners also do non-audit work. When they are acting as an auditor, they will be acting as a director of the company.' Is incorporating the audit arm the only plan? Mr Sharman said that it was 'still feasible' that KPMG would incorporate as a whole. What will be shown in the accounts of the firm and company accounts which you have promised to publish if incorporation goes ahead? You will be able to see the total take of partners, the average pay per partner, and the key players' details.' Can you rule out a flotation? 'We've absolutely no intention of doing that. I can honestly put my hand on my heart and say we have never considered it. There are some things you talk about and decide not to do: we haven't even talked about it.' How is the consultation going? Mr Sharman said that there were two main groups. Those who accepted the need to limit liability and welcomed incorporation; and those who understood the problem and would accept incorporation subject to assurances, such as a continuation of the present insurance arrangements, and that the audit arm would be a 'company of substance'. 'And a third group which is very small. There are some people who say they do not like it. Those are people who say professional services should be provided through partnerships so we can get at all your assets. The way I interpret that is there is a difference of opinion between those people and us about what we are doing. We are providing a professional service; I think they are looking for insurance. We are not in the insurance business.' How will you preserve the partnership ethos? 'If you can preserve the partnership ethos in a partnership of 600, you can preserve it in an incorporation. The question that should have been asked is can you preserve the ethos in a partnership that moves from 20 to 600 partners.' Will the audit company be told what to do by the firm? 'I would regard it as being in the same position as a subsidiary of a holding company.'</p>

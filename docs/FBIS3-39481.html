			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Arrigo Levi commentary: "Doubts and Duty"] </F>   [Text] Serbs, beware: The time for the NATO air raids on  Serbian forces in Bosnia is gradually approaching. If the Serbs  ignore -- as they have in the past -- the ultimatums that the  United Nations, NATO, and Europe will issue to them once again  before ordering their aircraft to take off from their Italian  bases, the operation will be carried out.    Those, like myself, who have many doubts about the  effectiveness of such an intervention, and who perceive all its  unknown factors and dangers, must now forcefully stress the  following new factor: After the latest deliberate and  intolerable massacre of civilians in Sarajevo and after the  stances adopted by Butrus-Ghali, the European Union, and Bill  Clinton, there can no longer be any doubt that the Western  democracies are preparing soon to cross the fatal threshold of  an air operation. Then whatever will be, will be. And if the  Serbs do not understand what is about to happen, they are making  a big mistake.    The Serbs have many reasons for continuing to delude  themselves. Too many past threats have not been followed up by  deeds. And also there are too many gray areas that still prompt  many people to doubt the Western governments' determination.  These have taken turns in putting forward and rejecting the  idea of raids. Last spring America was ready to carry out  bombardments, but the French and British, who have thousands of  men in the former Yugoslavia (inadequately armed in order to be  invulnerable) opposed it. They said, and rightly so, that the  effectiveness of raids was doubtful, the risk of hitting  civilians too high, and the threat to the blue helmets  unacceptable; and nothing was done.    Now Paris and London seem to have changed their minds. But  still three days ago U.S. Defense Secretary Perry was voicing  reservations, asking: "Our strike capability is not in  question, but what would be the political result of the  bombardments? If they were to be the first act in a new  tragedy, what would be the second and third acts, and what would  the conclusion be?"    It is all too easy to portray alarming scenarios. In  response to NATO bombardments ordered by the United Nations, we  must expect Serbian attacks on the blue helmets throughout  Bosnia. What will NATO and the United Nations do then?  Immediately after the massacre in Sarajevo Perry stressed:  "The United States and NATO are unwilling to send armies into  Sarajevo to impose an agreement against the will of the region's  peoples." But if that is so, "what would the second and third  acts be?"    There are many hypotheses. Is it likely that the major  European powers would witness major attacks on their blue  helmets without responding and that America would not rush in to  help its allies and the United Nations? Alternatively, is it  possible that the British, French, and all the other UN forces  could escape from Bosnia, like the marines from Beirut? Would  that not render inevitable the huge land operation, the "great  war to end the little war" that all the democracies have  hitherto deemed absurd and impracticable (and not out of  cowardice but out of proper prudence)?  <H5>  Promises and Ambiguities </H5>   The Serbs, encouraged by Zhirinovskiy's crazy promises and  Yeltsin's ambiguities, may believe that the democracies will not  cross this Rubicon, that they will not send in the great army --  almost on a Gulf War scale -- that would be needed to impose  peace in Bosnia. Nobody now can be sure that this will happen,  but it is prudent to remember that democracies are by nature  slow to respond to the defiance of the violent -- this, partly  because ours are peaceful peoples who have suffered too many  wars to throw themselves into another without pondering it. But  at the last moment democracies have ultimately always responded  to threats. And they have won all the major wars of this  century.    We do not know whether, when they chose the script for the  first act -- that of air strikes -- the NATO governments already  set the scene for the second and third acts. And this  uncertainty worries us. We would like them to have done so; and  we would like it to be explained clearly to the democratic  peoples why it is impossible to continue witnessing the  massacres in Sarajevo -- which are, as American Secretary of  State Christopher said, "part of a plan that the Serbian  artillery has pursued despite repeated warnings from NATO" --  and we would also like them to explain what would be the cost of  a land intervention, which could prove necessary in order not to  lose all credibility, in order not to encourage all Europe's  extremists and further violent actions.    This time, unless the Serbs yield and stop stifling  Sarajevo,  we believe that a bombardment is certain. Sometimes, as De  Gaulle said, "you engage first, and then see what happens."  <H5>  At the Negotiating Table </H5>   The hope is that such a move, if it must be made, will not  spark a vicious circle of reprisals but that it will bring  everyone back to the negotiating table and make everyone at last  accept the European Union's peace plan, which would restore 33  percent of territory to the Bosnians, instead of the 22 percent  that they now control. But perhaps the reserves of Balkan  madness have not yet been exhausted. Soon we will know.</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOUGLAS IS AFI LIFE ACHIEVEMENT WINNER  </P> <P> The American Film Institute has named Kirk Douglas the 1991 recipient of its  prestigious Life Achievement Award.  </P> <P> The announcement was made on Friday, which, coincidentally, was the 30th  anniversary of the Los Angeles premiere of "Spartacus" -- one of Douglas' most  memorable roles.  </P> <P> "This award is special because it was voted by my peers and recognizes a whole  body of work," Douglas, 74, told The Times. "It's a nice pat on the back and,  if you've read my autobiography, you know that that's always been very  important to me."  </P> <P> Douglas, in the south of France shooting a film, was informed of his selection  by film institute trustee Steven Spielberg.  </P> <P> With his clipped delivery and famed cleft chin, Douglas has been one of  Hollywood's more enduring leading men, snagging three best actor Oscar  nominations (1949's "Champion," 1952's "The Bad and the Beautiful," and 1956's  "Lust for Life") in his more than 60 feature film performances.  </P> <P> Hollywood, says the star of such films as "Seven Days in May" (1964) and "The  Brotherhood" (1968), was never his goal. "I always wanted to be a stage actor,  so in this sense, I'm a failure. I haven't done anything live since 'One Flew  Over the Cuckoo's Nest' (1963)."  </P> <P> Last seen on the screen in 1986's "Tough Guys," the actor recently shifted his  focus to writing.  </P> <P> His autobiography, "The Ragman's Son," was published in 1988 and his first  novel, "Dance With the Devil" (1990), will be adapted for the screen.  </P> <P> Douglas is shooting Xavier Castano's "Welcome to Veraz," co-starring the noted  French actor Gerard Depardieu.  </P> <P> Like "Lawrence of Arabia," directed by last year's Life Achievement winner, Sir  David Lean, "Spartacus" (1960) is being restored at a cost of between $600,000  and $700,000.  </P> <P> Coordinated by Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, and Universal Pictures chief Tom  Pollock, the new version will contain 15 minutes of footage cut from the  original and is scheduled for release early next year.  </P> <P> As the 19th recipient of the film institute's honor, Douglas joins such  previous recipients as Billy Wilder, Gene Kelly, Lillian Gish and Bette Davis.  He will be honored March 7 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.  </P></p>

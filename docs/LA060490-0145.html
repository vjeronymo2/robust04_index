			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN THE BOOTH, EVERT FEELS LIKE 'ROOKIE'  </P> <P> Chris Evert needed to retire to feel like a kid again.  </P> <P> "I'm like a rookie coming in," said Evert, a new member of NBC's announcing  team. "It's like being 8 years old and playing in my first tournament."  </P> <P> Evert, who made her debut during coverage of the Family Circle tourney in  April, is working the French Open -- a tourney she won seven times.  </P> <P> "Clay was my claim to fame," Evert said. "It's bittersweet for me. It's been  less than a year (since she retired)."  </P> <P> She said that although she has pangs of regret that her career as a player is  over, she realizes that "I don't want to put in the time and put in the effort  full time."  </P> <P> Evert, 35, has already found her new profession more taxing than she had  imagined.  </P> <P> "It's tough to articulate what's going on on the court," she said. "I was  always more of a mental player more than anything else. I was always  instinctive and never one who took notes on a player or talked to my coach for  an hour before a match.  </P> <P> "I'm having to think more off the court than on."  </P> <P> That thinking involves details Evert used to find extraneous.  </P> <P> "I never really needed a media guide," she said. "When I played someone, I  never had to know her mother's name. Now I have to know all about the player --  not just the style of the player, but the temperament and the personality.  </P> <P> "Playing tennis was a lot easier. Now I'm using my head more for articulating  and doing research. It just came naturally to play tennis."  </P> <P> Evert said she will be critical when the situation demands it.  </P> <P> "If it's a fair comment, I have no problem with that at all," she said. "I  don't want to all of a sudden have a good relationship and good rapport with  the players, then become a broadcaster and be too critical. If I'm fair and  logical, that's fair criticism.  </P> <P> "If Martina (Navratilova) is playing awful, I'll say it. I won't say that she  is choking like a dog. That's not my style."  </P> <P> Evert said she was pleased with her performance at the Family Circle.  </P> <P> "It's hard for me to watch myself," she said. "I'm very critical. I need to  work on instant replays. They come up all of a sudden. NBC wants me to talk  more of technique and to volunteer a little more information about the players  and maybe my experience playing them. I need to do more matches. You have  someone talking in your ear, giving you three seconds to finish and be quiet  before a commercial. All of these things, I have to get used to."  </P></p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Accountancy Column: Small company reports judged not so beautiful AT a well-attended meeting in the cavernous Old Library of the Guildhall one morning last week, a large crowd of City luminaries gathered in anticipation. Among them were anxious company directors eager to hear who would receive the annual award for published accounts, sponsored by the Stock Exchange, and the institutes of chartered accountants in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Which company would take the place of BOC Group, the UK industrial gases and healthcare concern, the winner in the larger company category in 1991? Which would inherit the separate title among smaller companies (with net assets not exceeding Pounds 50m) from Nestor-BNA, the healthcare and specialist personnel group? Few except the judges and one of the winning companies - which had brought along large numbers of its annual report for distribution - knew of the decision. It was the chairman of J Sainsbury, the retailer, who stepped forward to accept the first award. The spotlight, however, quickly moved to the other award. A small note at the bottom of the official programme explained that it would not, in fact, be given out this year. Mr Richard Sykes, QC, the chairman of the judges, felt obliged to explain why in his speech. Even the Stock Exchange, which is not normally known as an outspoken voice, took the rather unusual step of accentuating the negative. The first sentence of its own press release on the ceremony said: 'the co-sponsors . . . decided to give only one award this year'. This decision, it continued, was 'unprecedented'. 'I owe you an explanation of why we decided not to make an award in the small company section,' Mr Sykes told his audience. 'A winner is a report which I can hold up as an example to others. The fact is that there was no report in the small company category which achieved that desired and desirable standard, in the view of the panel.' 'Undoubtedly there were some solid workmanlike reports,' he said. 'Undoubtedly there were some reports which in some areas achieved an excellent standard. But whenever we began to enthuse about some aspect of a particular report we were brought back to earth by a failure or inadequacy in some other aspect.' Three important elements give the judges' decision an importance that it might not otherwise have had. First, it is assessed by a reputable panel of senior individuals from business, accountancy and law. Second, it is probably the most comprehensive award of its type, covering every annual report sent to the Stock Exchange. Third, it assesses all aspects of the report, with a stress on the presentation of financial information. If any of the current awards for corporate reporting should be taken seriously, this is probably the one. The criteria on which the panel's decisions are based are never published. They are inevitably partly determined by personal attitudes. Nevertheless, more significant than the whims and subjective assessments which helped the judges pick out exemplary reports as potential winners is the objective fact that none of the smaller company reports was thought worthy of consideration for an award. More than 2,000 reports - which are monitored as a matter of course by Stock Exchange staff - were whittled down to an initial list of 300 contenders, and then a short list of 150, which the 10 judges considered. Among the companies the shortlist excluded were annual reports which failed to meet legal obligations, Stock Exchange requirements or accounting standards. A 1989 amendment to the 1985 companies act has frequently been overlooked, for example. Section 36A requires a statement in the accounts that they have been prepared in accordance with accepted accounting practice. The Financial Reporting Review Panel, the enforcement arm of the Financial Reporting Council, has written to more than 240 companies for failing to comply with this requirement. It is believed that about another 300 of the reports scrutinised by the Stock Exchange fell down on other information they are legally obliged to give. This included failure to split details of their turnover and profits by geographical region, to provide information about non-executive directors, or to indicate in which countries they operated. Equally depressing is that few of the remaining companies went much beyond the statutory minimum in an attempt to provide readers of accounts with enough information to make the figures meaningful. Mr Sykes said his criteria for selecting the winner included whether on first impression the report makes the reader want to read any further, whether it provides an understanding of the company and its operations and whether its separate activities are adequately explained. In addition, he asked his fellow judges to consider if the accounts adequately explain the numbers, whether the statistics contained are honest, helpful and consistent, and whether any additional information to help the reader understand the accounts has been provided. He stressed that these factors need not be neglected during the recession, when companies are less likely to spend large sums on hiring design consultants to help produce their reports. In fact, he criticised some reports as clearly over-designed. What the recession may have done is to have discouraged many companies from being as candid in explaining and illustrating their results as they were when their performance looked far more healthy during the 1980s. On the criteria given, Mr Nigel Macdonald, a partner with Ernst &amp; Young who was one of the judges, certainly argues that there was an undeniable decline in quality among last year's accounts compared with previous periods. It is a development he finds depressing. 'If we believe in the market economy,' he says, 'then the performance of companies is absolutely essential to the proper allocation of resources. Accounts have their place in that grand scheme of things. Ordinary shareholders are entitled to a decent briefing.' He says that aspects of the accounts that appeared particularly weak included a neglect of ratios such as gearing and return on capital employed; little explanation of the constituent parts of the business and its future strategy; and an excessive amount of small print which made the reports difficult to read. Above all, he would like to see something more akin to the management discussion and analysis which is required in US accounts, and which gives far more detail than its British counterparts on the management of the company and a commentary on the figures in the accounts. Those involved in the preparation of accounts might do well to take these comments seriously. They go beyond the opinions of a few judges on a particular award. They may well soon be enshrined in future codes of practice. As remarks written by Sir Adrian Cadbury for a speech at last week's ceremony warned, 'the overall standard of financial reporting in Britain has to be raised'. When his task force on the financial aspects of corporate governance reports later this year, these thoughts may well be translated into guidelines of change.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Observer: Over and out? Is there life after the Beeb for John Tusa? The former head of the World Service, who quit after being denied the chance to apply for the director-generalship, then had a discordant eight-month sojourn as president at Wolfson College, Cambridge, before walking out saying that he had better things to do with his time. His name was bandied about for the Arts Council job. He didn't get it. Now London News Radio, of which he is non-executive chairman, may be gobbled up by Reuters even before it goes on air. If this happens, Tusa could be looking for another part-time job. Of course, he could always do a few more shifts presenting the One o'Clock news for the BBC.</p>

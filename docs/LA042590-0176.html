			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> GOLF COURSE GAG TAKEN SERIOUSLY  </P> <P> The Augusta National has shattered the dreams of thousands of golf fans by  denying a report that it plans to open the home of the Masters tournament for  play by the public at certain times of the year.  </P> <P> The club issued a statement dated April 23 saying that the report in the May  issue of Golf magazine "was intended as an April Fools' Day joke."  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, many people have taken the article seriously as we have  received an avalanche of inquiries about playing privileges," the statement  continued.  </P> <P> It reaffirmed that the exclusive Augusta National remains a private club open  only to members and their guests.  </P> <P> The only exceptions are the professional and amateur golfers invited each year  to participate in the first major championship of the season. Britain's Nick  Faldo earlier this month became only the second player after Jack Nicklaus to  win the title in successive years.  </P></p>

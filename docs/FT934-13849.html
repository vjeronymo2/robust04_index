			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Major spurns move by nationalists MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday discounted the possibility that the Hume-Adams peace initiative will lead to a breakthrough in attempts to secure peace in Northern Ireland. He told MPs that he knew nothing of what had been agreed by the two nationalist leaders. The prime minister also delivered a scarcely veiled rebuke to Mr Albert Reynolds. He said the Irish premier's announcement that he was to have talks on the initiative with Mr Major in Brussels next week was 'uncleared with me'. If Mr Reynolds wished to raise matters that he believed would bring violence to an end in Northern Ireland, 'then I am compelled to listen', Mr Major said. He emphasised again his government's refusal to negotiate with terrorists. 'We do not negotiate with people who deal with bullet and bomb and we do not surrender to their violence either now or in the future,' he said in comments which brought cheers from the Ulster Unionist party benches. His remarks came just two days after Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, dismissed the Hume-Adams initiative as 'sheer lunacy'. Mr Major is under pressure to take account of the Ulster Unionist position because of the precariousness of his 17-strong Westminster majority. His meeting with Mr Reynolds is expected to take place two days after the next scheduled meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference in Belfast next Wednesday. Mr Major's comments came as the Institute for Public Policy Research, the left-of-centre think-tank, published a plan for a new constitution for the province in which sovereignty would be shared by its people and the British and Irish governments. Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, said the IPPR model deserved 'considered examination' but the party had no plans to change its policy of unity only by consent.</p>

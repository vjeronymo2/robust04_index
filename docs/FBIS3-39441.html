I have consulted Sir  David Gillmore, Head of the Diplomatic Service, who wishes to  associate himself with my remarks. In accordance with the  Inquiry's wishes, I have given the Inquiry an advance copy of  this statement.    "In the course of this Inquiry, officials from the Home  Civil  Service and Diplomatic Service have provided you with a vast  amount of evidence and testimony, both written and oral, on the  matters under investigation. Of those who have provided either  written or oral testimony, or both, many if not most have moved  on to new posts and responsibilities since their involvement in  the matters now under investigation, and their co-operation with  the Inquiry has been a major additional burden for them to carry  alongside their other duties. I should like to record here my  gratitude and admiration for the way in which the Civil Service  has met this task. I also draw attention to the meticulous way  in which records were kept and preserved: without a clear audit  trail, this Inquiry would have had no prospect of reaching the  truth.    "The task of assisting the Inquiry has been made more  fraught  and onerous by grossly distorted and prejudicial allegations in  the media about the role of government and individuals,  including civil servants, in these matters. While I make no  criticism or complaint about the Inquiry's procedures, the  absence of the restraints on comment about the course of  proceedings which would apply in a court of law has permitted  wild allegations and prejudging of issues in media reports.    "I take just two examples about the subject matter of the  Inquiry. One is the constant references, which have become  common currency, to `arms sales to Iraq.' This has become known  as the Arms to Iraq Inquiry. There were in fact no licences for  the export of arms, that is lethal goods, issued by the British  Government in this period.    "The second is the references to Public Interest Immunity  certificates as `gagging orders.' As the Inquiry is well aware,  the effect of such certificates is no more than to put in the  hands of the Court the decision whether the information covered  by the certificates should be disclosed to the defence.    "As regards comments on individuals I can use my own case as  an example (though others have fared much worse). Even before I  have given evidence to the Inquiry, there have been such  scrapbook items as `The Butler did it,' `Cabinet chief linked to  Iraqi gun cover-up' and `The trail of blood running through  Whitehall in the wake of the arms to Iraq affair leads to the  door of the Cabinet Secretary.' These are only examples of the  general tone of coverage.    "While I hope and believe that people do not give this sort  of report more weight than it deserves, such prejudicial press  comment has been distressing for individuals concerned, and for  their families, colleagues and close friends. The victims are  often middle ranking officials who could not have expected to be  thrust into the limelight in the way in which they have. I see,  for example, that there is a snide piece in Private Eye this  week about my former Private Secretary who was mentioned in  evidence last week and who has not had an opportunity to give  her evidence to the Inquiry. They have been asked not to respond  to the press and to leave the issues to be judged by the  Inquiry. I would like here to thank them and their families  publicly and most sincerely for their cooperation and  forbearance.    "I repeat that I neither make nor imply any criticisms of  the  procedures of this Inquiry but I register my concern and  confidence, on behalf of the civil servants involved, that the  Inquiry will in due course put the record straight and undo, so  far as in its power, the damage which has been unfairly done to  our system of government, to the reputation of the Civil Service  and to individuals."

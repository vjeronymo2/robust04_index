But don't look for  Timothy Dalton as a new comic book character.  </P> <P> The English star -- known before Bond for more dignified roles -- has refused  to allow his likeness to be licensed in the just-out book from Eclipse Comics.  </P> <P> The rest of the film's cast, however, made it to the funny pages.

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: CBS turns in record third quarter CBS yesterday posted record earnings for the third quarter and forecast a record full year. Wall Street enthusiastically greeted the results from the company, which entered the 1993-94 television season with the top-rated US broadcast network. By the close of trading, the stock reached an all-time high of Dollars 285 1/8 , a gain of Dollars 8 3/4 on the day. For the three months to end-September, the group reported net income of Dollars 118.3m, or Dollars 7.39 a share, which compared with Dollars 42.7m, or Dollars 2.76, in the corresponding period of 1992. The results included a one-time gain of about Dollars 3.20 a share, reflecting the settlement of a legal dispute with Viacom International, the US cable television group, as well as the conclusion of certain tax proceedings. The buoyant performance reflected the strength of the network's programming. Last month's debut of Late Night starring Mr David Letterman, the popular chat-show host, served to bolster CBS's already commanding lead over its rivals in the battle for viewers. As a result, the CBS television network realised a 15 per cent gain in revenues and a substantial increase in operating profit, in spite of the continued sluggishness of the US economy. In addition to higher advertising pricing, the improvement was attributed to the absence of last year's coverage of the US political party conventions, which typically fail to attract big viewing audiences. Lower operating costs at both the television and radio divisions were another contributing factor. On a consolidated basis, CBS's net sales were Dollars 752.6m, up 12 per cent on the 1992 quarter. In view of its good results and the optimistic outlook for the full year, the board of directors raised the quarterly cash dividend to 50 cents a common share, from 25 cents, the level which had been in effect since the first quarter of 1991. For the first nine months of 1993, net income was Dollars 279.9m, or Dollars 17.62 a share, on net sales of Dollars 2.47bn. In the comparable period last year, net income was Dollars 47.7m, or Dollars 3.08, on slightly higher sales of Dollars 2.54bn.</p>

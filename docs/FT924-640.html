			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Letter: National lottery - a means to fund a better quality of life (1) Sir, In your article on the national lottery ('Monopoly game', December 10), you point out that the funds from the lottery will be channelled to charities by the national heritage secretary. Charitable voluntary organisations have in recent years become increasingly dependent on grants from government departments and there is a serious danger that many of them may become little more than administrative agents of the departments. Yet it is widely recognised that the value of voluntary organisations is their ability to criticise established practice, to experiment and to initiate work which such dependence can seriously undermine. To halt this trend alternative sources of finance, totally independent of government, are urgently needed. The national lottery provides an opportunity not to be missed. Baroness Seear, House of Lords, Westminster, London SW1</p>

			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> 1ST-LEG RACE WINNER SAYS YACHT VICTORY BELONGS TO COUNTRYMAN  </P> <P> French solo sailor Christophe Auguin won the opening leg of the BOC Challenge  round-the-world yacht race today but said victory belonged to countryman Alain  Gautier who arrived more than six hours earlier.  </P> <P> Race officials ruled that a 16.5-hour penalty issued to Gautier for being late  for pre-start formalities in Newport, R.I., would stand.  </P> <P> "Gautier is the real winner," the 30-year-old Auguin said when he stepped  ashore after 38 days and 18 hours at sea.  </P> <P> Auguin sailed his 60-foot sloop Groupe Sceta across the finish line between  Cape Town and the offshore prison of Robben Island a few seconds after noon.  </P> <P> Gautier, 28, had arrived in the dark at 5:12 a.m.  </P> <P> Gautier criticized the hour-for-hour penalty. "I was first in Cape Town. I  think I deserve this leg. I respect all the rules while I am racing, but this  penalty was imposed before we even started, and I think that is incredible."  </P> <P> Auguin offered to help Gautier fight the ruling that cost him the first leg in  the eight-month race over 27,000 miles.  </P></p>

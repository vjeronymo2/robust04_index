			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / McDonnell Douglas seeks speedy deal with Taiwan MCDONNELL Douglas, the US aerospace and defence group, is anxious to conclude an agreement to sell up to 49 per cent of its Douglas commercial aircraft subsidiary to Taiwan Aerospace and other potential equity investors by the end of this year to enable it to launch a new Dollars 4bn-Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.9bn) jumbo aircraft programme. Mr Robert Hood, president of the Douglas subsidiary, said it was important for the company to secure a launch decision for its 400 to 600-seater MD-12 aircraft programme this year to ensure first deliveries in 1997. The longer-term future of Douglas as a commercial aircraft manufacturer largely depends on its ability to secure financial backing from new investors to expand its product range. Although the company had originally envisaged building a larger three-engine derivative of its MD-11 tri-jet, Mr Hood confirmed Douglas was studying the development of a four-engine or possibly a twin-engine jumbo. The initial model would probably involve a 400-seater aircraft to compete against the Boeing 747-400 jumbo. The MD-12 programme is part of Douglas's strategy to develop a broader family of aircraft to compete against the wider product ranges of its two rivals, the US Boeing company and the European Airbus consortium. Douglas manufactures products in only two of the main aircraft markets, whereas Boeing and Airbus offer products in five different markets. However, this strategy hinges on finding partners to invest in the Douglas commercial aircraft subsidiary and to participate in its MD-12 and other programmes. Although Mr Hood was 'optimistic' about the outcome of the negotiations with Taiwan Aerospace, the timing and structure of the deal remained uncertain. China Steel, the Taiwanese state-run company which could acquire a big stake in Taiwan Aerospace, is heading a Taiwan team studying the Douglas equity investment deal. On completion of its study, Taiwan would say whether it wanted to continue negotiations, Mr Hood said. Under an initial agreement signed last November, Taiwan is considering acquiring between 25 per cent and 40 per cent of Douglas. Mr Hood said the US company was also talking to other potential equity investors with the aim of selling up to 49 per cent of the Douglas subsidiary.</p>

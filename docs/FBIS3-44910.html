			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Short commentary" by Zhong Zhou (6988 1558): "An </F> Irresponsible Move"]    [Text] On 6 January, the United States unilaterally  announced the reduction of China's textile and clothing quotas  by 25 to 35 percent. This was an unjustifiable move which  disregarded international and bilateral agreements, and trampled  on the principles and regulations of the international textile  agreement.    As expressly provided in the Multi-Fiber Agreement, when a  quota is imposed on any single item of clothing or textiles, the  quota level must not be lower than that of real exports in the  previous year and a guarantee must be made that the quota level  will not be lower than 6 percent of the annual growth rate. The  U.S. quotas imposed on China not only represent an almost zero  growth rate, but also the United States unilaterally cut the  quotas by 25 to 35 percent. This act openly trampled on the  fundamental code of conduct of the Multi-Fiber Agreement signed  by China and the United States, which can only indicate that  the United States does not intend to implement international  agreements it has signed, but merely asks for implementation by  other countries.    The Uruguay Round of Talks recently reached an agreement  stipulating that, in the next decade, textile quotas would be  gradually abolished and GATT rules would be enforced once again.  The United States was not prepared to reduce restrictions but  rather imposed many more restrictions on others and implemented  protectionist measures which obviously ran counter to the  agreement reached by the Uruguay Round of Talks.    As stipulated in Article 8 of the Multi-Fiber Agreement on  illegal transshipment, if the importer considers that illegal  transshipment has taken place, it should consult with the  exporter to seek a solution; and if consultation fails to bear  fruit, the case should be submitted to the textile supervisory  organization for settlement. The U.S. move obviously violated  the procedure prescribed by this article.    As a matter of fact, even the U.S. Trade Representative's  Office had to admit: At present, the U.S. side does not have  any evidence to prove that a large number of illegal  transshipments are taking place. The U.S. side arbitrarily took  unilateral action under these circumstances, showing that its  aim was not to contain illegal transshipments but to implement  trade protectionism.    As everyone knows, the Chinese side keeps asking for U.S.  cooperation in establishing an inspection system to jointly  guard against illegal transshipment. However, the United States  insisted on unilaterally reducing quotas under these  circumstances, which shows that it does not have even the most  rudimentary cooperative manner.    The U.S. move severely infringed upon the basic rights  enjoyed by China in the Multi-Fiber Agreement. If the U.S. side  does not withdraw this decision and return to the negotiating  table to jointly seek a solution with which both sides are  satisfied, the concerned Chinese authorities will have ample  grounds to submit this issue to the textile supervisory  organization for adjudication and take corresponding retaliatory  measures.    It is regrettable that the U.S. side took this unilateral  measure contrary to the spirit of the agreement reached so  recently by the Uruguay Round of Talks striving to alter the  content of the textile agreement about which developing  countries are particularly concerned. The U.S. move runs  counter to the trend of opposing trade protectionism and  promoting free trade, which is obviously unjustifiable,  incompatible with present needs, and irresponsible.</p>

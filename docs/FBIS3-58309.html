			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Frankfurt, Jan 11 (AFP) -- The European Monetary  Institute held its first meeting Tuesday afternoon [11 January]  in Frankfurt on what is expected to be a rocky journey to  creation of a European central bank, with an initial team of 30  banking pioneers.    At a news conference after the meeting, institute president  Alexandre Lamfalussy of Belgium emphasizerd the breadth of the  task awaiting his small team. And he said that the EMI status,  resulting from the European Community's Maastricht Treaty, does  not facilitate the new agency's task, as it is too "ambiguous."    The main difficulty lies in the fact that control of  monetary  policies remains in the national central banks' hands, he  commented. But over time, the institute is to work out the  technical procedures for putting the European Community's  planned single currency into effect and prepare for installation  of the future European Central Bank, he noted.    One of the key tasks given to the institute under the  Maastricht treaty for European economic and monetary union (EMU)  is preparation of banknotes denominated in ECUs [European  Currency Unit].    The institute also has authority to make recommendations,  but  not give instructions, to members of the European Community on  monetary policy, exchange policy and associated matters.    The institute is expected to tighten cooperation among EC  central banks and coordinate monetary policies. But it has no  monetary powers, and in December, German secretary of state for  finance Gerd Haller said that the German Government would not  tolerate any action which exceeded the institute's powers.    Responsibility for monetary policy remains in the member  states' hands during the second phase of EMU, as Bundesbank  chief Hans Tietmeyer has emphasized many times, and he has also  said that "entering the third phase is unlikely at the end of  1996."    Last week the French Government gave the Bank of France  independence in setting monetary policy but stressed that the  government remained responsible for exchange rate policy and the  franc's exchange rate, and that the central bank had to take  account of overall economic policy.    The forced exit of sterling and the lira from the European  Monetary System (EMS) in September 1992 and the European  monetary crisis of last July, leading to a vast widening of the  EMS currency fluctuation margins, were a serious blow to the  credibility of the Maastricht monetary programme.    The EMI, the forerunner of a fully-independent European  central bank, is part of a complex framework of measures to  force national economies within the European Community to  converge to enable the community to adopt a common currency by  2000.    Actually, no Community member now meets the criteria laid  down in the Maastricht Treaty for entering the third phase of  EMU.    A big institute asset is Lamfalussy, previously managing  director of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel. He  is universally praised for his serious approach, knowledge of  monetary questions, and feeling for diplomacy.    Thanks to his "neutral" position, he might act as arbitrator  in conflicts sure to arise in installing the single currency, or  before a possible devaluation of an EMS currency, banking  sources say.</p>

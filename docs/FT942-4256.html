			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Scapa edges ahead to Pounds 48.5m Pre-tax profits of Scapa Group, the supplier of consumable products to the paper industry, edged 3 per cent ahead from Pounds 47m to a record Pounds 48.5m for the year ended March 31. Mr Harry Tuley, chairman, said there were signs that the paper industry 'is on a fragile recovery path from a very depressed base.' But he also pointed to the 'increasingly significant results' of the group's industrial materials division, which would provide an alternative route to earnings growth. Turnover rose by almost 13 per cent from Pounds 347.3m to Pounds 391.7m. About 80 per cent of the group's products are made or sold overseas, and currency factors accounted for Pounds 11m of the increase. A further Pounds 16.2m arose from acquisitions. Operating profits increased by Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 55.5m. However, currency gains accounted for Pounds 2.9m of the advance and Pounds 1.8m came from acquisitions. The group generated a positive cash flow of Pounds 17.3m, up from Pounds 4.3m. Capital expenditure at Pounds 19.7m was the lowest since 1987 - Mr Tuley said the group felt it had enough capacity and was being cautious. He expected it to return to the recent average of Pounds 25m in the current year. The paper and related industries division reported profits of Pounds 41.4m on turnover of Pounds 229.2m, up from Pounds 40.4m on Pounds 208.3m. The US market - Scapa's biggest - took higher physical volumes, but prices remained under pressure. The industrial materials division lifted operating profits from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 14.1m, and sales from Pounds 139m to Pounds 162.5m. The division includes speciality adhesive tapes, sales of which are now more than Pounds 75m following the acquisitions of Saba and Barnier in France. The group is searching for further acquisitions, probably in North America, 'to build on the critical mass now established.' Net interest payable rose from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 7m. Earnings per share were 13.5p, down from 13.8p, and a final dividend of 4.23p (4.03p) is proposed, taking the total to 5.88p (5.63p). COMMENT The shares reacted to slightly lower than expected profits with an 11p fall to 214p. The company's cautious statement could prove to be a little too gloomy, although there is likely to be a time lag before any improvement in the paper industry itself feeds through to the suppliers. Nevertheless, it has increased its market share of paper industry supplies and maintained profits throughout the recession, putting itself in a strong position to benefit from any recovery. Profits this year of about Pounds 54m give a prospective multiple approaching 15 - a solid hold.</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEVELOPER OF DISPUTED ABORTION PILL RECEIVES PRESTIGIOUS AWARD  </P> <P> America's most prestigious medical award was given Wednesday to the developer  of the controversial French abortion pill, a decision criticized by  anti-abortion activists.  </P> <P> Other winners of Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards were Lewis Thomas, the  writer and doctor, and four scientists who study how cells receive chemical and  physical messages.  </P> <P> Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulieu studied the workings of hormones for nearly 30 years  before provoking an international ethical debate with his discovery of the drug  RU 486, which prevents a fertilized egg from developing into a pregnancy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Approved in U.S.  </P> <P> The drug, reportedly being used for about 15% of elective abortions in France,  has not been approved in the United States, but it has provoked a storm of  controversy here nonetheless.  </P> <P> Opponents have threatened boycotts of any company that should choose to sell it  in the United States, and abortion-rights advocates have promised to lobby for  the pill's sale in the United States.  </P> <P> Dr. John Willke, president of the National Right To Life Committee in  Washington, was sharply critical of the Lasker jury's recognition of Baulieu.  </P> <P> "His achievement is to kill people," said Willke, who learned of the award  before it was announced. "It's outrageous that they would give this to a man  whose achievement is to develop chemical warfare against the unborn."  </P> <P> Patricia Ireland, executive vice president of the National Organization for  Women, applauded the award, saying, "It's an encouraging sign that the  know-nothings are not going to stop the medical research community from  honoring Baulieu's contribution."  </P> <P> Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, chairman of the Lasker awards jury, said the  controversy surrounding RU 486 did not influence the jury's selection of  Baulieu.  </P> <P> Baulieu's award was for clinical, or applied, research. The award for basic  research recognized four researchers who study the substances in cells that  allow cells to respond to hormones, growth factors and neurotransmitters, the  awards jury said.  </P> <P> The four are: Michael J. Berridge of the University of Cambridge, England;  Alfred G. Gilman of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in  Dallas; Edwin G. Krebs of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the  University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, and Yasutomi Nishizuka  of the Kobe University School of Medicine in Japan.  </P> <P> Lewis Thomas, scholar-in-residence at Cornell University Medical College in New  York and president emeritus of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New  York, received the Albert Lasker Public Service Award for his writings on  medicine that, the committee said, "have heightened and transformed the  public's perception of biomedical science."  </P> <P> The Lasker awards are a kind of American Nobel Prize for medical research and  often foreshadow the choices of the Nobel judges. Forty-six Lasker Award  winners have gone on to win the Nobel Prize, often within a few years of  receiving a Lasker Award.  </P></p>

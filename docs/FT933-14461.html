			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Banks wake up to the big deal in small sums: Rivalry in cross-border payments In the market for European cross-border payments - as with so many matters involving banks - it never rains but it pours. After years of hardly reacting to moans over the long delays and high charges that accompany such payments, banks are now falling over each other to improve things. The disclosure this week that Visa International is to set up a transfer system using its data network to allow small payments within six days is one element of a competitive ferment. At least two consortia of European banks and several telecommunications groups are working on projects. Given the development of the European single market - and European Commission pressure for greater transparency, lower charges and more reliable service - banks might be expected to compete strongly for such business. There are two reasons why they have not until now. One is that the market is still small. Most of the 200m small cross-border payments each year are made by individuals. Only 10 per cent of UK companies made payments abroad in 1991, and one in 13 received them. Second, banks already have a cross-border payments mechanism. The Swift network, founded in Brussels in 1977, is a closed and secure service used by 3,000 financial institutions in 90 countries. It allows cash and securities transfers in standard formats. But the status quo seems increasingly unattractive for a variety of reasons: Small businesses in Europe are keen to make quick and cheap cash transfers as they trade more across borders. The Swift system was designed for large transfers and does not impose strict conditions in terms of pricing or speed of transfer. This can mean variation and delays. Transfers made through Swift rely on a chain of bank links. The cash is transferred from the originating company's bank through the Swift network to its correspondent bank in the country involved. That bank then registers the payment with the bank of the company receiving it. Small payments can be delayed and cost a lot. An EC study last year found that transfers averaged six days and took up to 30, costing an average of 14 per cent of the sum transferred. Swift was established as the banks' data network. But other networks run by companies such as IBM, General Electric and British Telecom offer access to financial services companies. This means prices are falling for transfers over popular routes in Europe. European banks are increasingly seeking ways to co-operate across borders without buying expensive branch networks from other banks. The offer of cross-border services through the networks of other banks is one means of attracting domestic fee-based business from companies with trade links. The Ibos system, run by Royal Bank of Scotland, Banco Santander, Credit Commercial de France and Banco de Comercio e Industria in Portugal, has been aimed primarily at individuals, but will be relaunched this autumn with new services for small companies. Rather than using a correspondent banking network, Ibos is confined to the member banks in each country. Those banks can make transfers, through British Telecom's Timenet data network, among their accounts across borders and can be cleared within seven seconds. Royal Bank charges Pounds 6 for a Pounds 3,000 transfer through Ibos, compared with Pounds 15 through Swift. Mr Norman McCluskie, Royal Bank's managing director of operations, says the Ibos banks 'see ourselves in a very dramatic position' because of the potential for attracting new business. The bank believes Ibos will help persuading corporate customers to open accounts. The Ibos system requires access to accounts at the banks that participate. This means that as long as Ibos sticks to allowing one bank per country to take part, it may gain a competitive advantage. However, this also limits the potential business for Ibos. At the moment, Royal Bank and Banco Santander only account for 0.7 per cent of cross-border payments between Britain and Spain. The system carried 5,000 transactions last month, but can carry 40,000 per day. The issue of whether to continue limiting access to Ibos is pressing because other banks are considering establishing their own closed networks. National Westminster Bank, Commerzbank in Germany and Societe Generale in France have said they are working on a possible initiative. The participating banks in Ibos are meeting in Madrid this Friday to consider opening the network to others. They are also mulling over approaches from US banks to participate in the network, possibly on the basis of a single bank operating the service in each state. Swift is also thinking of ways to respond. The network has cut prices on the most-used transfer routes and is considering bulk transfer of small amounts. Mr Eric Chilton, Swift's chairman, thinks it would be wrong to allow other carriers to dominate the retail market while Swift concentrated on high value transfers. He says easier transfer of small sums will attract treasury operations of large companies. 'If we make transfer easier, then a lot of people who hold assets in different countries now might be keen to avoid it and run Treasury operations from the centre,' he says. The implication is that the emergence of competition for small cross-border payments has only just started.</p>

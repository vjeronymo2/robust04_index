			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, deputy head of </F> the SPD; place and date not given: "The `No' Was Clear To Hear"]    [Text][DER SPIEGEL] On 28 February German soldiers in an  AWACS surveillance plane participated in a combat mission for  the first time in the history of the FRG. The Social Democratic  Party [SPD] presidium commented on it by blandly describing it  as a "serious incident." But just a few months ago, the SPD  still voiced strict opposition to combat missions at its party  congress and brought the matter before the constitutional court.  How do these two positions fit together?    [Wieczorek-Zeul] We hold to the position the SPD took at its  party congress. Our foreign policy must not be based on military  operations. If we take over the government as of next fall, that  means that the mission of the Bundeswehr will continue to be the  defense of the alliance and the defense of our nation.    [DER SPIEGEL] And what about UN peacekeeping operations?    [Wieczorek-Zeul] Let us leave semantics out of it.  "Peacemaking" is synonymous to waging war. In our view, the  Bundeswehr should only take part in humanitarian and  peacekeeping blue helmet operations at the request of the United  Nations.    [DER SPIEGEL] What if the constitutional court decides that  combat operations are permissible?    [Wieczorek-Zeul] An SPD-led government will not resort to  any  such decision. We will make a political decision on every single  peacekeeping mission in accordance with the criteria we agreed  upon at the party congress.    [DER SPIEGEL] Does the SPD still consider the 28 February  mission unconstitutional as Burkhard Hirsch, the Free Democratic  Party (FDP) Bundestag deputy, does or was that a "peacekeeping  blue helmet mission" as specified by your party congress  decision?    [Wieczorek-Zeul] Of course German participation in the AWACS  flights was and still is unconstitutional. That is why we lodged  the appeal with the Karlsruhe [constitutional] court. The NATO  operation itself, on the other hand, was lawful because it was  based on a UN resolution.    [DER SPIEGEL] How can something be legitimate, if it is  unconstitutional?    [Wieczorek-Zeul] From the point of view of international law  it was legitimate. The question of legitimacy under  international law and the constitutional situation in the FRG  have nothing to do with each other.    [DER SPIEGEL] Now what about the FRG's obligations under the  alliance?    [Wieczorek-Zeul] The SPD is not responsible for the fact  that  the UN assigns military missions to a military defense alliance  such as NATO as a regional organization. Up until a few months  ago that was unthinkable. But if such orders are issued, they  can under no circumstances alter the the NATO mission, which is  to defend the alliance. Under the NATO treaty no obligation  exists to take part in operations such as the AWACS flights. The  FRG can say without any hesitation that it will not take part.    [DER SPIEGEL] The Bosnia operation is a NATO action on  behalf  of the United Nations. Isn't it time the SPD made up its mind  whether it is prepared to cede such powers to the UN or merely  wants to keep on calling for a stronger UN?    [Wieczorek-Zeul] In procedures like these the danger is that  NATO might control the UN and not the other way around. The  Bundeswehr chief of staff has since demanded that NATO should  not accept any mandate from the UN in the future but should  intervene militarily on its own. We cannot but be strongly  opposed to that.    [DER SPIEGEL] Why did the SPD presidium create the  impression  in its statement that the opposition did approve of the decision  to shoot down the aircraft?    [Wieczorek-Zeul] It was not the presidium's job to "approve"  the downing of the aircraft. That is not what we did. We said it  was legitimate. And beyond that we gave priority to the  situation of the people living in the former Yugoslavia and did  not engage in a debate on basic issues.    [DER SPIEGEL] At the Munich military affairs conference SPD  chairman Rudolf Scharping said there are "no real differences"  on basic foreign policy issues between the SPD opposition and  Christian-liberal coalition.    [Wieczorek-Zeul] The way I understand what he said at that  conference--and it is a position to which I subscribe as  well--is that the SPD does not put the basic decisions of German  foreign policy into question, i.e. membership in the European  Union, in NATO and in CSCE. But there are serious differences  with the coalition on the mission of the Bundeswehr. We do not  want any war and combat missions.    [DER SPIEGEL] Internationally, Scharping's Munich statement  was also taken to reflect agreement with the Bundeswehr actions  in Bosnia and Somalia.    [Wieczorek-Zeul] It is understandable, isn't it, that one  does not get involved in domestic policy debates in front of  international visitors? But Rudolf Scharping's "no" to combat  missions by the Bundeswehr was quite unequivocal at the military  affairs conference.    [DER SPIEGEL] SPD Bundestag caucus chairman Klose--who has  not been dismissed as the "foreign policy expert" of Scharping's  government committee--wanted to characterize the NATO ultimatum  to the Bosnian Serbs as an example of "credible deterrence" but  was kept from including this assessment in the party executive's  statement on the ultimatum. Why?    [Wieczorek-Zeul] It is simply the wrong language to use. For  that matter, we reached a decision later which Klose agreed with.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you think the ultimatum addressed to the  those laying siege to Sarajevo and the downing of the combat  aircraft are instruments which could also be applied to pacify  the remaining hot spots in the former Yugoslavia?    [Wieczorek-Zeul] I neither consider these instruments, nor  the United States and the majority of the countries of Western  Europe to be exemplary. Otherwise the Croats and Muslims would  not be looking for a solution at the negotiating table in the  United States and Russia would not be making efforts to  influence the Serbs. The situation in the former Yugoslavia  cannot be changed or improved by war but only by political means.    [DER SPIEGEL] Politics did not enter the picture  successfully  until after the ultimatum had worked.    [Wieczorek-Zeul] Unfortunately that is true. People would  have been spared a great deal, if political pressure had been  brought on all participants two years ago. Happily, we have been  spared the proof of whether bombardments would have pacified the  country--or expanded the war, as we all feared.    [DER SPIEGEL] The social democrats create the confusing  impression that their party chairman and their parliamentary  leader agree on foreign policy and security policy issues on the  voters' behalf but that within the party Heide  Wieczorek-Zeul--who has been caricatured by many as the "holy  inquisition"--is keeping watch over strict adherence to the  decisions taken at the party congress.    [Wieczorek-Zeul] I dispute the idea that Rudolf Scharping is  on a different course from mine. We reach our decisions  together; nobody secretly or publicly takes a different position  from others.    [DER SPIEGEL] In the first draft of your government program  the SPD keeps clear of a debate on the role of the Bundeswehr.  The relevant passage merely reads: "We would like to see the  Bundeswehr remain an alliance army." That is a bit thin.    [Wieczorek-Zeul] So far we just have a preliminary draft in  hand. Let us talk again when the program is really on paper. I  am sure that the position on the role of the Bundeswehr will  then be as clearly defined as we have discussed it here.</p>

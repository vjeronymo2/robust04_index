			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The trial of the 11 military men charged with the  disappearance and deaths of nine students and a professor at  Enrique Guzman y Valle University, also known as La Cantuta,  started at 0930 today in a specially prepared room in the Simon  Bolivar garrison building.    The civilian parties were not present at the proceedings.  General Luis Chacon Jara, who presided over the proceedings,  waited half an hour for the lawyers of the victims' relatives.  Their failure to appear confirmed their decision not to attend  and participate in the trial.    Despite the secrecy with which the trial is being conducted,  it filtered out that prosecutor Saul Calledo opened the trial by  reading a summary of the preliminary proceedings and demanding  sentences from three months to 20 years for the various accused  men.    Two of the military men, Colonel Guzman Calderon and Gen.  Rivero Lasso, were interrogated this afternoon. The questioning  will continue tomorrow at 0900.    Two criminologists are of the opinion that, should the  existing penal code be applied, the maximum sentence that the  involved military men would receive would be life for the  clearly typified crimes of kidnapping and manslaughter.    The La Cantuta case, which created a crisis in the  government  when it was transferred to a military court, is still being  debated due to the penalties demanded by the military  prosecutor, Col. Raul Calledo Valdivieso. Several authorities  have described the penalties as mild because the existing penal  code is being applied to military law. It has been reported that  the penalties demanded for the accused range from two to 20  years for the crimes of homicide, kidnapping, abuse of  authority, and oversight.    According to a comparative chart, simple homicide receives a  minimum sentence of six years and a maximum of 20 years under  military law, while under the civilian code such a crime is  punished with a maximum penalty of life. Under common law  kidnapping receives at least 10 years, but the crime does not  exist under military law.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It has been learned that a joint survey by the  Japanese and U.S. Governments was conducted to check the market  share of imported automobiles in Japan and that judging from the  survey, a joint survey report estimates that it is possible to  increase sales of U.S.-made autos by 37,000 a year if such  obstacles as a "keiretsu" structure between auto manufacturers  and dealers are removed. It also estimates that if such  conditions as securing of sales personnel and funds, and U.S.  manufacturers' efforts to produce autos that can appeal to the  Japanese market are met, sales of U.S.-made autos will be  increased by 57,000 a year. Japan and the United States, in  negotiations on autos and the auto parts sector under Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks, confronted each other over "objective  criteria," and the two nations failed to reach an agreement at  the Japan-U.S. summit talks held last week. But since the joint  survey report says that increasing sales of U.S.-made autos in  the Japanese market is possible, it is likely that the report  will have an impact on the future negotiations on auto and the  autoparts sectors.    The joint survey was based on a meeting of market-oriented  sector-selective (MOSS) committee. The survey was conducted  from February of 1992 by the Nomura Research Institute and the  U.S. firm Boose Allen and Hamilton [as published] at the request  of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] and  the U.S. Department of Commerce.    The survey report lists 1) difficulty in securing sales  personnel; 2) the shortage of sales floor space; 3) financial  shortages; 4) lack of the three biggest U.S. auto manufacturers'  (Big Three) efforts to make autos that can appeal to the  Japanese market; and 5) the existence of the "keiretsu" system,  which connects Japanese auto manufacturers with dealers, as  obstacles to the promotion of Japanese dealers' sales of  U.S.-made autos. The estimated figures shown in the report were  calculated on the assumption that the above obstacles are  removed.    The report estimates that it is possible for dealers to  increase sales of U.S-made autos by 57,000 a year if the above  four obstacles (1 to 4) are removed, adding that it is possible  to increase sales of autos by 37,000 a year if the "keiretsu"  system is abolished and if dealers make a franchise contract  directly with U.S. auto makers.    The report also says that if prices of U.S.-made autos are  lowered by 10-25 percent, it is possible to increase sales by  6,000 to 27,000 a year.    According to the Japan Automobile Importers' Union, the  number of U.S.-made autos imported by Japan in 1993 from the Big  Three was 19,335.</p>

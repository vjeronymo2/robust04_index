			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Move for Dutch coalition The tortuous search for a Dutch government coalition entered a new phase yesterday when Mr Wim Kok, finance minister in the outgoing government, said he would try to form a three-party government of his own Labour party, the right-wing Liberals and the left-of-centre D66. The negotiations, which will begin next week, represent the second attempt to put together a coalition of the three parties since the Christian Democrats suffered an historic defeat in the May general election. The first attempt was scuppered by disagreements over social welfare spending. But the differences between Labour and the Liberals in particular have narrowed after Mr Kok unveiled a proposed government programme on Monday stressing cuts in social spending and promising to boost jobs. All four main parties responded positively to Mr Kok's proposals, but he decided to exclude the Christian Democrats from the negotiations because they opposed maintaining levels of social benefits.</p>

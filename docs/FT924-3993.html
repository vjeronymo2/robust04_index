			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / People: Refit at Austin Reed Austin Reed, the clothing retailer and manufacturer that in October recorded its first ever loss in the 28 weeks to August 8, has promoted Colin Evans, the 48-year-old deputy chairman and director of the retail division, to the new post of chief executive. At the same time, group managing director Neil Fitton, is moved back to head the manufacturing side. 'This cleans up the management structure; it was getting a bit top heavy' says Barry Reed, who explains that he has been 'both chairman, and, without saying so, chief executive.' Evans (below) and Reed are cousins, both grandsons of founder Austin Reed. Reed, 61, says the plan is to put a younger team in place, whilst acknowledging also that the creation of the role of chief executive addresses the Cadbury recommendations on corporate governance. Evans has been director of the retail division for the past two years, but Fitton has had a much higher profile with the City. Commenting on Fitton's effective demotion, which surprised analysts yesterday, Reed explains how he 'came out of manufacturing and has great ability on the manufacturing side.' Fitton had been group managing director since 1985. Once marketing director of Chester Barrie, he became its managing director in 1978 when it was acquired by Austin Reed. 'These are difficult times. We must try and focus the group on the Austin Reed label. We are after all first and foremost a retailing business which also has a manufacturing side' adds Reed. David Anderson, 61, former finance director and currently commercial director, is retiring as an executive, but remains a non-executive director. Jill Anders has been made company secretary. ***** Roger Camrass, formerly a top consultant with the Butler Cox organisation, has been appointed a European director of Arthur D Little, the US management consultants. Camrass will have responsibility in Europe for the 'high performance' business initiative, a pet project of chief executive Charles La Manchia, who is widely credited with restoring Arthur D Little's position among the leading consultants. The concept behind the slogan is doing things better rather than the same things cheaper. It has much in common with the idea, fashionable at the moment, of business process engineering in which every aspect of the business goes under the microscope for re-evaluation. Camrass describes it as identifying the fundamental barriers to progress within an organisation and seeking ways to remove them. Now 42, Camrass has been in technology management all his working life. A Cambridge engineering graduate, he worked for Plessey when it was an important force in telecommunications before joining Butler Cox, where he ending up pioneering the consultancy's European operations as head of the Benelux countries. Butler Cox was sold to CSC of the US in 1990. Based in London, Camrass will be a member of Arthur D Little's information management practice board. ***** Guy Walker, chairman of Van den Bergh Foods, is to become chairman also of Brooke Bond Foods, both Unilever companies; Peter Johnson, current chairman of Brooke Bond, will retire in March. ***** Leonard Magrill, director of strategic planning, has joined the board of TEXACO Ltd. ***** Brian Walton has been appointed md of BREVINI UK. ***** Peter Merriman, formerly a director of Plessey Avionics responsible for military avionics, has been appointed general manager at JASMIN SIMTEC, manufacturer of electronic systems such as a nerve gas detection system and a portable explosives detector. ***** Stephen Johnson, formerly general manager, has been promoted to md of VOLVO TRUCKS (Great Britain); he succeeds Bernt Brandtzaeg who has been appointed vice-president of VOLVO TRUCKS EUROPE.</p>

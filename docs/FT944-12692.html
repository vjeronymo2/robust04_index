			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Mavrodi's millions pay dividends with voters Mr Sergei Mavrodi, the multimillionaire charged with tax evasion whose MMM pyramid selling company crashed in the summer, has been elected to the Russian parliament, according to early figures last night. He was backed by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democrats (LDP). It was the first important by-election for a state duma (lower house) seat since last December's poll produced a surge of support for the LDP. The result was the more remarkable since Mr Mavrodi did not make a single appearance in his Mytishci constituency, an industrial suburb of Moscow. However, members of his staff had worked the area for weeks before, promising that their boss would spend Dollars 10m of his own money improving it. Mr Mavrodi, released from jail three weeks ago in accordance with the law on elections granting immunity to candidates and deputies, had told the electors on the eve of the poll that 'your only solution is to elect me because then I will be immune from further arrest. I will not have to return to prison'. However, Mr Gennady Ponomaryov, the Moscow prosecutor, said last night that 'the legal case against Mr Mavrodi would not be terminated automatically'. Since the case - for tax evasion by his Invest Consulting firm - had begun before he stood as a deputy, it could continue without an appeal to the Duma to remove his immunity. According to Mr Sergei Taranov, Mr Mavrodi's spokesman, the new deputy would bring together a group of members of parliament dedicated to 'defend the interests of the shareholders of Russia and defend them from the uncontrollable arbitrariness of government bureaucrats'. The campaign had been remarkable both for the absence of Mr Mavrodi and the presence at the election rallies of black-clothed, swastika-wearing paramilitaries who turned out to greet the candidate of the Russian National Unity (fascist) party, Mr Alexander Fyodorov, with Nazi salutes. However, neither Mr Fyodorov nor Mr Andrei Sidelnikov, representative of the rightwing Derzhava movement led by former Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi, appeared to have scored well. The early figures showed Mr Mavrodi capturing around 28 per cent of the vote, with Mr Alexander Zharov, an official of the local administration, taking around 15 per cent, and Mr Konstantin Borovoi, a prominent financier and leader of the Economic Freedom party, around 14 per cent. Mr Borovoi had been a particular target of Mr Fyodorov's supporters, who mocked him with anti-semitic insults at rallies. Though Mr Mavrodi has said he does not intend to ally himself to any faction in the Duma, his campaign was partly run by the LDP. In return, the party can expect to gain access not just to his fortune but to the famed skills of his company's television production studio. The latter made the series of advertisements promoting MMM which persuaded hundreds of thousands of Russians to buy its shares as they climbed dizzily earlier this year. Turnout at the election was around 30 per cent - comfortably above the 25 per cent threshold to make the vote a valid one.</p>

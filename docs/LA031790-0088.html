			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WEST VIRGINIA;  </P> <P> STRIKING TEACHERS VOW TO STAY OUT  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court upheld a lower court's order that striking teachers in  one county return to work, but it overrode another judge's attempt to issue a  statewide back-to-work order.  </P> <P> The teachers' union said the strike will continue. The walkout began March 7.  Last Wednesday, about one-third of the state's nearly 22,000 teachers showed up  for work, but all schools were closed for two days of cooling off. The state  attorney general's office has declared the strike -- the first by West Virginia  teachers -- illegal, and said teachers can be suspended, fired or charged with  misdemeanors. The Legislature has approved a $27-million plan to improve  teacher salaries.  </P></p>

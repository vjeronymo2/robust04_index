			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Viktor Krejci </F> in Prague; date not given: "A Firm Exchange Rate Is the Axis of  Our Transformation"]    [Text] [Krejci] Could you explain, concretely and simply,  why you think the Czech Republic should not hasten to implement  the full convertibility of the koruna?    [Klaus] This is one of the many topics in which--I do not  know why--correspondents get the feeling that they could find  another chink of disagreement between politicians. I proclaim  that, for the economic part of the government,, and also for the  state banks and other institutions, this is not a matter-of-fact  dispute. We are conducting a detailed study of the requirements  for this step and the most suitable time to implement it.    There is absolute convertibility without any restrictions in  few places--perhaps only in Hong Kong. All other countries have  some form of regulation. So, progress from one phase of  convertibility to another is simply relative and continuous and  has nothing to do with political symbolism.    [Krejci] What are the advantages and disadvantages of such a  step?    [Klaus] It goes without saying that the introduction of full  convertibility has certain advantages, but it also has some  disadvantages. There are three disadvantages, for which a  gradual approach is necessary: First, the axis of our entire  economic transformation is secured economically by a firm  nominal exchange rate and by maintaining this exchange rate as  the Archimedes point of the whole economic system. On the other  hand, implementing full convertibility requires that this idea  be abandoned and that a flexible exchange rate be introduced.    Second, introducing full convertibility means, to a certain  extent, losing the autonomous nature of the state's monetary and  financial--that is, macroeconomic--policy. This is fine in  cases in which a country lags far behind the general liberal  tendencies of its neighboring partners, and the world drags it  from its inadequate foundation to somewhere else. This,  however, does not apply to our country. Our monetary and  financial policy is quite deliberate, quite rational, and does  not have to be "disciplined" by our neighbors. The situation is  rather the reverse. Moreover, the policy of our neighbors may  have its own logic, different from that of our country, which  has, at the moment, different tasks than standard European  states.    And, finally, third: Introducing full convertibility indeed  means exposing ourselves too much in the sense that we would  enter into the realm of rapid movements of speculative capital  that flees from one country to another, where it seems that the  interest rate conditions are a little better. This is an  instability that our transforming economy can do without at the  moment.    [Krejci] What must be done now in this regard?    [Klaus] Other aspects of the concept of convertibility must  gradually be liberated. Liberalizing what the citizen may  exchange is also, undoubtedly, associated with this. The task  is to create an attractive and pleasant environment for foreign  investors, who now have the possibility to transfer money back  to their own countries.    Therefore, I do not see a preponderance of reasons for  immediately dealing with full convertibility. Additional  analyses indicate that we are talking about a medium to  long-term program.</p>

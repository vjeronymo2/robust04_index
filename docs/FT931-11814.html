			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: Rothschild Assurance 'satisfied' with Pounds 101m J. ROTHSCHILD Assurance, the life assurance company started at the beginning of 1992 by Sir Mark Weinberg and Mr Mike Wilson, former executives of Allied Dunbar, brought in premium income of Pounds 101m in its first year. New business figures for the group showed that total funds under management, which are shared between J. Rothschild Investment Management, M&amp;G Investment Management and Scottish Amicable Investment Managers, were Pounds 290m. The company sells only through its direct sales force. Regular premiums accounted for Pounds 18.3m while single premiums were Pounds 82.7m. A high proportion of protection, rather than investment, policies accounted for the high share for regular premiums. Sir Mark, the chairman, said he was satisfied with the results, which showed that 'we have established a company of substantial size in just one year'.</p>

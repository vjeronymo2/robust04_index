			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Pensions The great UK pensions debate is currently focused on the relative virtues of money purchase over final salary schemes, and on the creation of effective safeguards to prevent plundering by a future Robert Maxwell. Investors, however, ought not to lose sight of other, related issues such as the accounting and tax treatment of pension fund surpluses. The way in which British industry unnecessarily poured billions of late 1970s and early 1980s is well documented. Even by their own conservative standards actuaries had become extremely gloomy on a diet of high inflation, rampant trade unionism and low real investment returns. In their defence, of course, they were not to know that equity markets were about to roar and that recession and high unemployment would also serve to fatten up their funds. The question of who owns a resulting surplus is contentious in the wake of the Maxwell scandal. Employees justly claim a moral entitlement to at least a part of it on grounds both that they put up some of the money through their own contributions and that pensions are a form of deferred pay. The vast majority of companies with well administered schemes would doubtless argue that since they are providers of last resort - as underwriters of any actuarial deficiency - they are also entitled to be the recipients of last resort. Certainly SSAP 24, the accounting standard introduced in 1988-89 to deal with pensions, makes the assumption that a surplus belongs to the company. The standard offers finance directors the choice of utilising the value via a one-off balance sheet adjustment, or taking it through the profit and loss account spread over the working life of employees. Because of the way this so-called variation reduces the net pension cost charged to operating profits - and creates a substantial above-the-line credit for a handful of top companies - most have tended to choose the latter option. Such treatment is intellectually defensible - today's enhanced profits are balanced by understated profits in the past - but investors should surely demand that companies provide more information about methods of amortisation. Such transfers are non-cash items, which raises the question of whether groups like the specialty materials group Courtaulds should not be able to take back some of the money for immediate reinvestment in the business. Only Lucas Industries has taken this route, but at the cost of a 40 per cent tax charge seemingly imposed by the government to dissuade small business owners from abusing a tax break. With UK industry undercapitalised at this stage of the cycle it is perhaps a pity that most bona fide operators are caught by this penalty.</p>

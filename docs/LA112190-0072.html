			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> VETERAN OFFICIAL TO QUIT SCHOOL POST  </P> <P> Allan Jacobs, associate superintendent of the Simi Valley Unified School  District, said Tuesday that he will resign, although he doesn't know when.  </P> <P> Jacobs, who has worked for the district for 18 years, said he wanted to inform  the school board and the district's new superintendent, Robert Purvis, of his  intentions well before his departure.  </P> <P> "It could be at the end of this year," said Jacobs, 60, "or it could be at the  end of next year."  </P> <P> Jacobs was among several candidates for the superintendent's job. He said  Purvis' appointment had no bearing on his decision to resign his $79,252-a-year  post.  </P> <P> Purvis was appointed by the school board in October to replace John Duncan, who  resigned to become head of the San Ramon School District in Northern  California. Purvis will take over Dec. 1.  </P> <P> Three high-ranking administrators have left in the last five months.  </P> <P> In addition to Duncan, Pete Rogalsky, senior director of curriculum, resigned  in July to become head of the Rio Elementary School District in Oxnard, and  Chet Howe, assistant to the superintendent, retired in June.  </P> <P> Jacobs served 13 years as assistant superintendent and the last five as  associate superintendent.  </P> <P> Although the district has experienced deep budget cuts and personnel squabbles  in the last two years, Jacobs said he was satisfied with what it has  accomplished in the last two decades.  </P> <P> School board member Ken Ashton said Jacobs is well respected.  </P> <P> "He's done an excellent job," he said. "We're losing a valuable individual."  </P> <P> Jacobs said that he was unsure of what he will do after he leaves, but that he  will probably pursue "other options . . . outside education." CARLOS V.

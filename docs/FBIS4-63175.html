			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian president's chief of staff, Sergey  Filatov, said that, with Nikolay Yegorov's appointment as  minister of the affairs of nationalities and regional policy,  Russia would resolve its disputes with its separatist republic  of Chechnya much sooner.    "We are concerned about the crime problem and the position  of  the poor in that republic," Filatov told Interfax correspondent  Vyacheslav Terekhov on Thursday. "It's not the status of  Chechnya or any legal matters that we are concerned about but  the maintenance of peace around Chechnya," which is being  threatened today by tension between Chechnya and another Russian  republic, Dagestan, he said.    "We would like to preclude further impoverishment and even  lower living standards in Chechnya. Those matters are giving  President Boris Yeltsin a lot of concern," Filatov said.    Yegorov replaces Sergey Shakhray, recently dismissed by  Yeltsin as minister of the affairs of nationalities and reginal  policy.</p>

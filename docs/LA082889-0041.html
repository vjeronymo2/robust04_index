			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> STROKE DRUG EDGES ASPIRIN  </P> <P> An experimental drug narrowly outperforms aspirin in preventing strokes in  high-risk patients, New York University researchers reported last week in the  New England Journal of Medicine. The drug, ticlopidine, "was found to be  somewhat more effective than aspirin in reducing the risk of death" in patients  with early warning signs of stroke, the researchers said.  </P> <P> Significantly, the drug was found to benefit women as well as men. Earlier  research had documented aspirin's ability to prevent strokes in men but was  inconclusive in women. The study, led by Dr. William K. Hass, looked at more  than 3,000 patients with early warning signs of stroke over six years. Roughly  half were given aspirin and half ticlopidine. In the group taking ticlopidine,  there were 172 strokes and 306 deaths, compared to 212 strokes and 349 deaths  in the group taking aspirin. Those taking ticlopidine experienced more side  effects, however, including diarrhea, rash, elevated cholesterol levels and  reduced white blood cell counts.  </P> <P> Although ticlopidine's ability to prevent strokes is not clearly understood by  scientists, aspirin works by thinning the blood, discouraging the formation of  clots in arteries leading to the brain.  </P></p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Frederick Cooper gains from reduced interest REDUCED INTEREST charges helped Frederick Cooper, the West Midlands-based metal finishing, architectural hardware and electrical products group, start its move out of recession with a 7.6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits before exceptional items, its first increase for three years. After interest of Pounds 380,000 (Pounds 647,000) pre-tax profits for the six months to January 31 were Pounds 1.77m. Last time's Pounds 1.95m was inflated by a pension fund contribution of Pounds 400,000. The figures were prepared under the FRS 3 accounting standard. Turnover was slightly down at Pounds 40.1m, from Pounds 41.4m, but Mr Eddie Kirk, chairman, noted that the break-even point in all parts of the business had been lowered as costs had been reduced. Firmer control of working capital and a reduction in stocks helped cut borrowings from Pounds 7.7m to Pounds 4.2m, giving gearing of 21.9 per cent at the period end, compared with 31.2 per cent last July and 41.9 per cent in January 1992. Signs have emerged of an increase in orders. Mr Kirk said that the group had just had its best quarter for over two years. Fully diluted earnings were 2.5p (2.8p) after exceptional items or 2.4p before them. The interim dividend is lower at 0.7p, against 1.5p, as the group reverted to its normal policy of paying one third of the likely total at the halfway stage.</p>

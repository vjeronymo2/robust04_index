			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: THE LASER BIN  </P> <P> *** "The Hunchback of Notre Dame." Image, 117 minutes, two CLV Extended Play  sides, under $35.  </P> <P> This is the 1939 RKO version with Charles Laughton, Maureen O'Hara and Edmond  O'Brien. For the most part, it's a typical video disc, a good reproduction of  the film without any special laser attributes. But Image has added a unique  bonus usually reserved for more expensive discs: a second audio track in which  film historian Paul Mandell offers behind-the-scenes insights. Fascinating  tidbits cover special effects (the use of oil paintings on glass combined with  live action) and makeup (Laughton's misshapen eye often moves about from scene  to scene). But the gossip may be the most captivating: During Laughton's  whipping scenes in the oppressive heat, director William Dieterle called for  one retake after another; Laughton returned home in the evening with welts over  his body and minor sunstroke. Unfortunately, narrator Mandell doesn't say  enough, so we're left with long pauses waiting for the film to play out. The  producers should take a listen to the commentaries on the Criterion Collection  video discs to see how it should be done. Barbara Saltzman  </P></p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Sony profit drops 36% in opening quarter SONY, the consumer electronics group, suffered a 36 per cent per cent drop in first-quarter consolidated operating income to Y25.3bn (Dollars 249.3m) as a result of weak demand in its main markets and the strength of the yen. The company blamed slow demand for most of its main products, from camcorders, to televisions in major markets, particularly Europe and Japan, as well as the rapid appreciation of the yen against the US dollar which reduced sharply its overseas revenues. Sony's disappointing performance came as sales fell 10 per cent to Y828.7bn from Y924.4bn. Net income was almost halved to Y7.7bn from Y14.9bn. However, income before taxes rose 31 per cent to Y38.6bn from Y29.5bn, largely as a result of a foreign exchange gain of Y20.4bn. Sony revised its forecast for the year to March 1994 in view of the persistent weakness of demand and the rapid rise of the yen. Consolidated sales are forecast to fall 7 per cent to Y3,720bn compared with a previous forecast of sales 2 per cent lower at Y3,910bn. The forecast for pre-tax profits was unchanged at Y87bn, or 6 per cent down on the previous year. On a parent company basis, Sony forecasts a 6 per cent fall in sales to Y1,760bn and a 30 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y32bn. Operating profits, however, are forecast to rise 29 per cent to Y2bn, in part as a result of cost-cutting measures. Sony's cost of sales in the first quarter were down nearly 10 per cent from Y663.5bn to Y598.4bn. The company plans to increase the ratio of products manufactured outside of Japan for sale in overseas markets from the current 35 per cent to 50 per cent by about 1997. In product areas, Sony was particularly hit by depressed demand for audio-visual equipment, including camcorders and CD players. The Japanese market is seeing its fourth year of decline in demand for audio-visual products. Sony Pictures, meanwhile, suffered a 16 per cent fall in sales in local currency terms due to a lack of box-office hits.</p>

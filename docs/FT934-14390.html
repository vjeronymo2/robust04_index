			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / As They Say in Europe: Villain of the piece HERE IS a thought: the only people really interested in the Maastricht treaty, and what is known traditionally as the 'construction of Europe,' are the British. That they do not much like it does not nullify the point. The EC occupies centre stage in political debate, or successfully plays the part of stage villain. In his speech to the Conservative party conference in Blackpool, the social security secretary, Peter Lilley, used the word 'foreigners' several times to describe the inhabitants of the community. He managed to give the word the same twist that some Germans achieve when having a go at Auslander (And he committed what the French would regard as a capital offence against their language.) Brussels, Maastricht and Europe are terms of abuse in Britain even though, as I shall attempt to demonstrate, they are not what matter now. As noted here on other occasions, each nation has its own private vision of the community. The Germans see it as a school for disciplining others to behave properly; the French believe it is there solely to pursue the interests of France. The British seem still to view Brussels as some kind of Hitler, dominated by a mad jealousy of the independence of the island nation which it has to eliminate in the interests of a new Volksgemeinschaft, or National community. But that community is no longer the main pre-occupation of these jealous foreigners. The pursuit of a narrow European union has become notably less pressing just as Germany's highest court gave the green light to the Maastricht treaty (in the face, British Euro-sceptics should note, of opponents' arguments that it was not federal enough.) In a speech that was ignored outside France, President Mitterrand suggested last week that there should now be a confederation of Europe. It is not a new idea, but the view is becoming steadily more persuasive. Le Monde noted that the countries of central Europe were fed up with their inability to get themselves accepted as part of a wider European partnership. In Berlin, similar thoughts are taking shape. Der Tagesspiegel wrote last Monday that there was a need for a 'partnership signal' to the east. The failure to provide one was a cause of the attempted putsch in Moscow. 'The rejection of this wider strategy,' wrote the paper, 'would mean the retreat to the little Europe of 1989 and the sure way back to the division of the continent.' If there is such a thing as 'European policy,' it has to confront two issues. The first is what to do about Germany. The Maastricht treaty represented a not wholly successful attempt to tackle that problem. One underlying premise was that the community's largest, and apparently most energetic, nation was not going to provide forever the compliant leadership that has been around since 1948. The next century, if not this decade, will see a revival of a normal self-assertiveness. The French are always the most vocal in making the point that Germany has to be 'anchored in Europe.' (This sometimes sounds like a demand to tether a mad dog, an image the Germans find offensive.) Maastricht provides a makeshift anchor. The second question is what is to be done about present and potential instability in eastern Europe. In other words, the problem today is about the same as it was 100 years ago: containing Germany and making sure it does not attempt to control an unruly east all by itself. The British cannot move beyond the view that there is nothing wrong with Europe that a bit of free trade will not cure. This is based on hostility to all grands projets which imply an unacceptable limitation of national sovereignty (which, in the British case, is thought to operate best when untrammelled by any considerations other than national interest, even though that interest is never defined). What the British rarely have grasped is the possibility of ghastly events taking place on the continent of Europe which could affect them. Even relatively recent experience of such events has not cured this self-inflicted myopia. But we could well see, in the next few years, a new Germany taking action to defend its perceived interests on its eastern borders and that, in turn, leading to the exercise of long-dormant muscles by its western neighbours. In the eyes of the Conservative conference, 'Europe' presented a truly worrying menace in the form of those described by Lilley as 'benefit tourists' - layabouts and drug addicts who enter the UK to take advantage of certain social security provisions. It must - at least partly - be thanks to the existence of the European Community that this is among the worst nightmares with which Britons are confronted. For the moment.

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Mitterrand urges end to Hanoi embargo FRENCH President Francois Mitterrand, the first western head of state to visit Vietnam, yesterday urged President Bill Clinton to lift the US embargo imposed on Hanoi in 1964, Reuter reports from Hanoi. After a two-day visit to Hanoi, Mr Mitterrand described the embargo as 'an anachronism'. Washington extended the embargo to all of Vietnam in 1975, when Hanoi's communists defeated the US-backed Saigon government and reunified the country. Mr Mitterrand announced on Tuesday that France would double its 1992 aid to Vietnam this year. France gave Vietnam Dollars 36m (Pounds 23.8m) in 1992. Yesterday, he said seven top-level co-operation agreements had been signed between the two countries. Vietnam, hit three years ago by the suspension of Soviet aid and now starved for capital, had approached France 'with outstretched hands', Mr Mitterrand said. He said it was appropriate for France, given its past ties with Vietnam, to be the first western country to help it reintegrate into the world community. Mr Mitterrand yesterday visited Dien Bien Phu, where forces led by Gen Vo Nguyen Giap defeated a key French army unit in 1954, thus bringing an end to colonial rule. Reuter adds: Alcatel of France yesterday signed an agreement with the Vietnamese Post and Telecommunications Authority to create a digital switching joint venture called Alcatel Network Systems Vietnam.</p>

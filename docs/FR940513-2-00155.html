The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change consists of procedures for electronic mail features and for the interactive use of DTC's enhanced Institutional Delivery (``ID'') system. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The enhanced ID system concept was approved in an earlier Commission order. The order specified that each individual feature of the enhanced ID system would be the subject of a separate filing under section 19(b)(1) of the Act. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33466 (January 12, 1994), 59 FR 3139 [File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;93&hyph;07] (order approving concept of enhanced ID system). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, DTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. DTC has prepared summaries set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change will enable ID system users to use the ID system interactively with the capability of accomplishing all ID system processing within a single business day. ID system users will have the option to continue to use the ID system in a batch mode. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal also seeks to implement two electronic mail features. These features will enable ID system users to send and receive ``notification of order execution'' and ``institution instruction'' messages. A notification of order execution can be sent by a broker-dealer to communicate the details of an order execution to an institution. If the institution accepts the notification of order execution, the institution can send the broker-dealer an institution instruction containing information, such as the allocation of block trades, which is needed by the broker-dealer to enter trade data into the ID system for the preparation of confirmations. Currently, broker-dealers and institutions make telephone calls or send facsimile transmissions to communicate this information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of section 17A of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder because the proposed rule change will further automate the process by which securities transactions are cleared and settle and thereby will facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. The proposal also is consistent with section 17A in that because the proposed rule change enhances DTC's existing ID system it will be implemented consistently with the safeguarding of securities and funds in DTC's custody or control or for which DTC is responsible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DTC perceives no impact on competition by reason of the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The interactive capability and electronic mail features have been developed through widespread consultations with securities industry members. Written comments from DTC participants or others have not been solicited on the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within thirty-five days of the date of publication of this notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to ninety days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a) By order approve such proposed rule change or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

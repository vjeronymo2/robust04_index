			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: Observers unshaken by bond shake-out The recent plunge in global bond markets has investors wondering if this is the end of the European bond rally. However, most economists still feel that once the upheaval is over, European bond yields can fall further as short-term interest rates are cut and inflation falls. 'Investors with a horizon longer than a few weeks should stick with the economic fundamentals, which point to a sustained rally,' said Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets in London. Although Europe lags the US economic cycle, the recent US monetary tightening fuelled fears that the pace of monetary easing in Europe would slow, and short-term rates in some countries could rise. The UK market was especially rattled by calls for monetary tightening from Mr Nick Knight, global investment strategist at Nomura, who has, until recently, had a reputation as a superbull. He warned that UK short-term interest rates might have to go up to 6 or 7 per cent by the year-end to defend sterling against the impact of poor trade figures. Others, however, feel there is little fundamental justification for the bond markets' sell-off, arguing that the slide was due to heavy selling by highly-leveraged investors, including US hedge funds, who had to liquidate bond positions after incurring huge losses in other markets. 'At the end of last year, a lot of funds flowed into these markets, and this is a very serious correction of that rally,' said Mr Klaus Baader, European economist at Lehman Brothers in London. 'The European economies won't stage a recovery this year. Inflation is heading down, rates are heading down . . . this all favours European bond markets.' However, some say bond yields are unlikely to return to their recent lows. One of them is Hermann Remsperger, chief economist of BHF-Bank in Frankfurt, who feels a turning point has been reached. 'The clear trend of the market has gone,' he said. 'Investment horizons will become much more short-term than was the case last year, and the opportunities for making profits will come from taking advantage of market volatility.' Mr Graham McDevitt, bond strategist at market analysts IDEA, takes a similarly cautious view. 'After this week's carnage, the psychological impact on investors has been so great we don't expect them to return to the market with any conviction,' he said. 'I think a return to the lows we have seen will be very difficult. The post sell-off rallies will generally be disappointing.' Still, many expect Europe's bond markets to recover when the Bundesbank resumes its easing course, and elections in Germany and elsewhere are out of the way. 'We still look for German 10-year yields to test the 5.5 per cent level after the German election,' says Mr Julian Callow, international economist at Kleinwort Benson. With 10-year gilt yields around 7.10 per cent, Mr Callow also expects the UK bond market to stabilise soon. 'As in Germany, domestic investors are likely to be attracted by yields in excess of 7 per cent while inflation remains subdued.' Meanwhile, US bonds should start stabilising around current levels, predicts Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg. 'We have long looked for the (long bond yield to) spike to 6.5 per cent to 6.75 per cent and, now here, feel the market has done most of the dirty work  -though a spike to 7 per cent remains distinctly possible.'</p>

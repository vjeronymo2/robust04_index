			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YAROSLAVSKY'S REELECTION BID  </P> <P> In response to "This Is Zev's Turf," Metro, March 20:  </P> <P> We have known Zev Yaroslavsky since before he ran for City Council. We are all  long-time residents of the Fairfax community and have been involved in the  preservation of Fairfax with Zev.  </P> <P> Zev has represented the needs of our community in an exemplary manner. As a  20-year member of Etz Jacob Congregation, he has been extremely sensitive to  needs of all members of his constituency, including the Orthodox Jewish  community.  </P> <P> Zev initiated the revitalization of the stores along Fairfax Avenue from  Beverly Boulevard to Clinton Avenue, utilizing $1 million in federal funds and  $3 million in private funds.  </P> <P> Zev co-sponsored the Beverly-Fairfax Patrol, which has over 100 members who  patrol our area at night to assist in making the streets of our neighborhood  safe. Zev was instrumental in the placing of a stoplight at the corner of  Clinton and La Brea.  </P> <P> Zev has helped make our community more liveable and safer. That's why we are  supporting him on April 11.  </P> <P> STANLEY TREITEL  </P> <P> RABBI RUBIN HUTLER  </P> <P> JOSEPH KORNWASSER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

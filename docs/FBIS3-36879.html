M. Snegur pointed out that the "sociopolitical situation in  eastern parts of the republic has once deteriorated and the  unconstitutional authorities in the Dniester Republic [as  published] are constantly blocking a solution to the conflict.  According to him, armed formations of the Dniester Region have  been brought into the security zone, previously part of the  combat zone, which is now controlled by peacekeeping forces.  This is a gross violation of the agreement that the Russian and  Moldovan presidents signed in 1992. He named the places where  these armed detachments are based: Bendery and the outlying  village of Parkany.    In Snegur's opinion, the situation is being aggravated by  the  special regime in force on the Left Bank along with the  reinforced border and customs posts on highways and bridges  across the Dniester. The Dniester Region authorities'  reluctance to resolve the conflict was cited as a crucial  factor. Moreover, M. Snegur does not rule out the idea that  "there will be various provocations that may end in bloodshed."    The president urged the population of the Dniester Region  and  all people of goodwill to "influence those who want to embroil  us in a bloody conflict."    Judging by the atmosphere in Tiraspol, people here are  afraid  that uncontrollable situations may arise, thus accounting for  the introduction of a special regime in the region.    The information cited in the Moldovan president's appeal is  backed up by a statement from the Moldovan delegation on the  Joint Monitoring Commission [JMC], which is monitoring the  security zone. The Dniester side has submitted its  counterarguments to the commission. According to V. Krylov,  cochairman of the JMC, who heads the Russian mission, there have  been plenty of these counterstatements and they are not just  confined to the above two spots -- Bendery and Parkany. The  facts cited are being checked out by the tripartite military  command of the peacekeeping forces, and the JMC will be able to  draw its conclusions on the basis of the command's report.    The Russian delegation, which is mediating in resolving the  conflict, is aware of the edgy election atmosphere and the  sides' desire to derive the maximum advantage from it, according  to the Russian cochairman of the JMC. But the main thing today  is to preserve tranquillity and the peace that has been  established, creating conditions for political solutions.    Bendery Garrison Commandant A. Vostrikov noted that,  according to his information, the JMC has not established that  there are armed formations in the city apart from those for  which the agreement makes provision.</p>

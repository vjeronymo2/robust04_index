			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / International Company News: Thirteen preselected for Greek telecoms bid THIRTEEN international telecommunications companies have been preselected to bid for a 35 per cent equity stake in OTE, the Greek state telecommunications monopoly, in what is expected to be Greece's largest privatisation deal. The list includes AT&amp;T, Ameritech and Southwestern Bell of the US, NTT of Japan, Korea Telecom, PTT Netherlands, France Telecom, Stet of Italy and Telefonica of Spain. The Greek government is looking for an experienced international operator to lead a consortium that would also take over management of OTE and carry out substantial modernisation of the country's telephone network. A new operator would be expected to invest up to Dollars 10bn in updating the fixed wire system, which is already close to capacity with a waiting-list for almost 900,000 new lines. A short-list of bidders will be drawn up early next year, with the sale due to be completed by the summer. The government hopes to raise about Dr210bn (Dollars 1bn) from the sale of the strategic 35 per cent stake. Another 14 per cent of the company's equity will be floated on the Athens Stock Exchange immediately after the sale, with shares being offered first to OTE employees and their families.</p>

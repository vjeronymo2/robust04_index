			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Competition steps up in loans sector Frogmore Estates, the UK property company, yesterday announced the successful syndication of a Pounds 150m loan arranged by Barclays. As with another deal signed this week - a DM65m medium term loan facility for Pohjolan Voima (PVO), the Finnish power company - the terms provide further evidence of increasing competition in the loans market, where margins have fallen sharply during the past 12 months. The Frogmore loan was priced at 60 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor), for the unsecured revolving credit facility, compared with about 100 basis points when the company last came to market in June 1982. The money will be used to refinance an Pounds 80m revolving credit facility maturing in June 1996 and for general corporate purposes. Originally launched at Pounds 120m to relationship banks and a small group of international lenders, the loan was increased to Pounds 150m. Mr Gavin Rody, of Barclays, said it had been easier to win support for the deal in the market than in 1992. 'Two years ago the market was tough. This time it has been more comfortable,' he explained. Chemical Bank arranged the four-year loan facility for PVO, designed to refinance a DM65m facility signed in August 1993. PVO will pay 35 basis points over Libor, compared with 95 basis points for the earlier deal, which was also arranged by Chemical Bank. Banks participating in the PVO deal alongside Chemical, are all Japanese. They are Fuji Bank, Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation, and Yamaichi Bank (UK). PVO was assigned a AA rating by the Japanese Credit Rating Agency in October.</p>

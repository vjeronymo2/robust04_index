			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Konstantin Parishkura report from Kiev in the "Ukraine" </F> column: "An Ecological Aspect Has Emerged in the Black Sea  Fleet Division Problem. Damage by the Russian Navy Could Amount  to 53 Billion Karbovanets a Year"]    [Text] The Ukraine Environment Protection Ministry has  issued a report saying that $17.16 billion is required to clean  up environmental pollution caused by Black Sea Fleet units  located on Ukraine's territory. According to the ministry, in  the Sevastopol bay alone vessels dump approximately 1,000 cubic  meters of untreated sewage water every day. The main pollution  source in the Sevastopol bay is a fuel tank. Underground  waters, the soil, and the sea bed are contaminated. In some  parts of the bay the depth of toxic deposits reaches 40 meters.    The Sevastopol bay is virtually dead. Approximately 30  ships, as well as ammunition and spare parts, are lying at its  bottom. One-third of the land occupied by fleet bases needs  recultivation. The volume of contaminated underground waters is  approximately 4 million cubic meters. In the event of the  fleet's division in the proportions envisioned (18 percent of  vessels to Ukraine and the rest to Russia), according to the  Environmental Protection Ministry, the Ukraine Main Ecological  Inspectorate, and the corresponding services of the Republic of  Crimea and Sevastopol city, the environmental damage from the  Russian Navy on Ukrainian territory will amount to 53 billion  karbovanets a year.    The Ukrainian Environmental Protection Ministry has demanded  that the ecological aspect of the problem be taken into  consideration in sharing out the Black Sea Fleet because  neutralizing the effects of the fleet's activity exceeds the  cost of the fleet itself by three to three and a half times.</p>

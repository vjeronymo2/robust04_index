Erlian oil field is located on the Xilin  Gol prairie at the northern border of Inner Mongolia, a frigid  and forbidding place where production and living conditions are  most difficult. Over 3,000 workers braved these obstacles, and  overcame the severe natural environment and the many production  and technical challenges, and achieved a stable annual output  from a geologically complex oil field. Last year, these oil  field workers and staff conducted explorations over a wide area  at Saihan Toroi, Eren Nur, Jargalang, and Uliastai, further  expanded the range of oil finds, produced 1.01 million tons of  crude oil, completing their nationally assigned production  mission over quota. By the end of 1993, 4 combined  oil)production stations, 4 transfer stations, and 58 jipei  [computerized distribution?] stations and departments were  operating with 820 water)oil wells, while overall production and  livelihood installations were being improved daily, a 361  kilometer oil pipeline steadily pumped crude oil to Saihan  Toloi, Inner Mongolia.</p>

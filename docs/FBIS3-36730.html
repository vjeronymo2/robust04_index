			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is in  Tashkent on a working visit. Let's listen to a report by our  correspondent Maya Ganiyeva.    [Ganiyeva] The agenda for his brief visit is extremely  packed. The day started with a meeting with representatives of  the Russian diaspora in the embassy of the Russian Federation in  Uzbekistan. The conversation was brief, and afterwards Kozyrev  went to have talks with the republic's Foreign Minister  Saidmukhtar Saidkasymov. Later, in the afternoon, he was  received by Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov. At this  meeting the most important problems of economic,  military-political, and humanitarian cooperation between Russia  and Uzbekistan as well as matters of Islam Karimov's official  visit to Russia scheduled for the end of February were discussed.    In an interview for our program Andrey Kozyrev said:    [Begin recording] [Kozyrev] Our main problem is how to  transfer our friendly relations onto a new track. In the  conditions of the existence of independent states, a great many  issues arise. But it must be said that we are examining them in  a calm, businesslike, very frank way. And I think that we will  find correct solutions here so as to give the maximum possible  assistance to the Russian population and also other citizens in  both states so that they will be able to easily cross the  border, exchange money, and dispose of their property -- this is  what people are really interested it -- well, and, of course,  remove tension arising on the basis of language, etc. Here, it  seems to me, the Uzbek side is displaying a very constructive,  specific approach -- not an ideological one -- and we do not  want to ideologize or politicize these matters in some way.    [Ganiyeva] Andrey Vladimirovich, what is the view of  Russia's  Foreign Policy Department on the trilateral economic union of  the Central Asian states?    [Kozyrev] Any accords between the republics -- if they  benefit their economic revival -- these can only be to Russia's  advantage. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER AFFAIRS: HOME SECURITY NEEDN'T BE SO ALARMING  </P> <P> Looking crazed and vicious, the man is pictured breaking through a door. The  message is it's a jungle out there, such creeps hit one in four homes, and  maybe yours. The pitch: for $395, ADT Security Systems will help "keep him  out."  </P> <P> Residential security is the fastest-growing segment of a young industry. Eighty  percent of operating security systems were installed in the 1980s, according to  the Santa Monica-based Security Industry Assn. Residential work provided  perhaps $2.5 billion of last year's $8.4-billion industry revenue, estimates  STAT Resources, a Brookline, Mass., market research firm.  </P> <P> Alarm systems are not the only -- or even the best -- defense against the  jungle out there. But they sound good.  </P> <P> Residential burglary is certainly a problem, whether one considers the 5  million household burglaries reported annually or the National Crime Prevention  Council's prediction that in a 20-year period, seven out of 10 households will  be burglarized at least once. More take place in summer, and in the daytime.  Many involve drug users, who are more hurried, less clever and less methodical  than professional burglars.  </P> <P> Someone was home in only one of eight household burglaries; in a third of  those, the burglar got violent. And yes, homes without alarms are more likely  to be hit.  </P> <P> In recent years, household alarm systems became more readily available and  cheaper, thanks to new modular systems and sensors that can be produced and  installed faster and easier. Small contractors jumped in; large national  companies serving government and industry started residential divisions.  </P> <P> The result is a field of variable sophistication and commitment. The nationals  boast longevity and Fortune 500 customers. The locals advertise endorsements  from stores, stars, or in one case (this in Los Angeles), both the police chief  and a former burglar -- the one against his wishes, the other under who knows  what arrangements.  </P> <P> Most offer a combination of on-site triggers and remote responses. Alarms may  be set off by someone pushing a manual "panic" button or disturbing magnetic  contacts on doors and windows ("perimeter" alarms), or moving across the field  of some kind of sensor. The alarm sounds in the house, the neighborhood, the  local police station or a monitoring station, where someone calls the police or  dispatches a private guard.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, these alarms sound too often: The false alarm rate is 95%, 97%,  even 98%. Some are tripped by forgetful residents. Some are set off by pets, or  rattling windows, or airplanes passing overhead, or sun shining into the path  of a sensor. Some are just poorly installed.  </P> <P> Whatever, "the assumption is that most of the alarms are false," says Robert  McCrie, editor of Security Letter and assistant professor at John Jay College  of Criminal Justice in New York. As a result, busy police stations no longer  welcome direct hook-ups, many issue fines for repeat false alarms, and some are  slow to respond even when a security company has checked that no one's home.  </P> <P> Neighbors are probably even more annoyed and unresponsive, and even owners seem  to have a short fuse. One study found that half the residential systems  installed are turned off after a month.  </P> <P> Along with false alarms, the systems foster "a false sense of security," says  Jean O'Neil, director of research and policy analysis at the National Crime  Prevention Council in Washington. Homeowners may leave their house dark,  surround it with high shrubbery, even open doors and windows. Some more readily  leave children home alone, because "we have an alarm system."  </P> <P> Consumers who don't buy alarm systems aren't necessarily at the mercy of thugs.  Since almost any system can be circumvented by a true professional, given  enough time, the goal is simply to "to make your residence a less attractive  target," says O'Neil, for both amateurs and professionals.  </P> <P> With that goal, there are many possibilities, starting with good locks, and  their regular usage: in 20% to 50% of residential burglaries, the burglar  enters through an unlocked door or window. Building and landscape design can  prohibit unobserved entry. Lights and noise can suggest that someone is home  (lamps on, radios playing) or discourage entry (dogs barking, outside  floodlights).  </P> <P> Neighbors who are home and watchful are the most help, whether they discourage  entry or just report it, whether they see intruders or hear an alarm. In most  communities, police will help set up "neighborhood watch" plans -- more  consciousness-raising than organization, but effective. "We've seen them cut  burglaries 20%, 30%, even 40%," says O'Neil.  </P> <P> Alarms that ring elsewhere are most useful when homeowners are gone a lot or  the home and contents are so attractive that thieves would take more chances.  Also, there may be no neighbors -- either because the dwelling is isolated or  the people are isolated, their neighbors all strangers.  </P> <P> Indeed, turning to alarms first, not last, may be a symptom of today's urban  isolation. Security companies are only filling a gap, as they will when they  add monitor features for latchkey children, and medical alert functions for  elderly people living alone. But no one can expect to replace families, friends  and neighbors without sounding false alarms.  </P></p>

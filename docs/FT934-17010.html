			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Weights cut in Latam WORRIES over growing US opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement have led Merrill Lynch strategists to cut their weighting in the Latin American region from overweight to neutral, writes John Pitt. Mr Thomas Robinson and Mr Douglas Johnson, international equity strategists based at Merrill Lynch's New York office, commented that 'with the momentum of opinion toward Nafta apparently shifting toward those opposed, the schedule for timely passage looks less likely, particularly as Washington's attention will be focused on health care reform over the near term'. However, they remained confident that Nafta will eventually secure approval, and consider the longer-term prospects for the Latin American markets, and particularly Mexico, which has one of the lowest inflation rates in the region, to be good. In the meantime, the strategists noted that 'although fundamental factors still support the region as a longer term opportunity, the relative risk for Latin America in the near term compared with the emerging markets of Asia and Europe is increasing'.</p>

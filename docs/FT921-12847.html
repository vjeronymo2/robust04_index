			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: IPE launches gasoline futures on Monday THE INTERNATIONAL Petroleum Exchange launches its unleaded gasoline futures contract on Monday in a bid to attract new users to the derivatives product. 'There has been a lot of interest from blenders, end-users and producers,' said Mr Alastair Harris, marketing and research director at the IPE, 'it will be a useful tool for companies with fleet management operations.' Mr Harris says that many of these companies will not be using the Rotterdam forward market for unleaded gasoline, but will have been using trading companies to hedge their exposure to petrol prices. The IPE has introduced a designated broker scheme for the first time at the exchange to get the new contract off the ground. So far, seven brokers have signed up to trade the futures product. The specifications for the IPE's product are slightly different from the one traded at the New York Mercantile Exchange, but will still allow brokers to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. The exchange hopes its product will complement the Nymex contract by providing a specifically European contract to attract new business.</p>

			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : VISITING VETERANS JOIN HARMONICA BLOWDOWN  </P> <P> The third annual Harmonica Blowdown wasn't quite the night of the endless  shuffle, but there were enough up-tempo blues at the six-hour performance to  satiate the capacity crowd at the Music Machine on Saturday night. The  blowdown, a benefit for the family of the late George (Harmonica) Smith, paired  hometown stalwarts William Clarke and James Harman with two veterans making  their local debuts.  </P> <P> Lazy Lester helped fashion the swamp-blues sound associated with Lightning Slim  and Slim Harpo on the Excello label during the '50s and '60s. The lanky  Louisiana man (who plays the Palomino on Friday) blended his deep voice and  agile instrumental work on a nicely-paced assortment of bayou boogies and  grinding swamp blues.  </P> <P> George (Mojo) Buford, resplendent in a black leather outfit and  harmonica-studded bandolier, earned his stripes playing with Muddy Waters -- as  you might have guessed from his repertoire of Chicago blues standards. But only  brief sections of Little Walter's "Blues With a Feeling" and Waters' "Got My  Mojo Workin' " struck sparks.  </P> <P> Sandwiched between those per formances, Clarke's quintet delivered an hour of  sprightly shuffles, even rousing that portion of the audience that inexplicably  spent the first half of the evening sitting on the dance floor.

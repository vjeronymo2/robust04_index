			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Strong yen goes shopping abroad - Renewed exporting of Japanese production THE RECENT sharp rise of the yen is forcing Japanese manufacturers to make plans to move still more of their production to low-cost factories overseas, which is delighting investment promotion agencies in the rest of Asia. Japanese companies have been shifting production to other Asian countries since the yen began to strengthen in the mid-1980s. The depressed state of Japan's domestic economy has slowed the pace of new investment in south-east Asia in the past few years. That slowdown is now likely to be reversed, Japanese and south-east Asian companies say, both because Japanese manufacturers are suffering from the strong yen and because Asia is the most promising growth market for consumer goods. 'The situation is similar to events in 1984,' said Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, the Thai finance minister, predicting increased investment and employment by Japanese companies. The new investment is likely to come in two forms: multinationals with existing foreign operations will expand those facilities, and smaller and medium-sized companies will probably join the exodus from their high-cost home base. In Thailand, for instance, Toyota is spending some Dollars 570m to double its capacity to around 200,000 vehicles a year and improve its distribution network; Toshiba, which has had a television tube factory in Thailand since 1990, is increasing production by 70 per cent; and Oki Electric is doubling the size of its Thailand factory and adding image drums for printers to the products already produced there. Japanese plants assembling cars and electronic goods in countries such as Thailand and Indonesia are expected to be joined by a growing number of components suppliers. 'I'm sure that many, many companies at present in Japan will come abroad, especially to the south-east Asian area,' Mr Kikuji Tateichi, head of the Japan external trade organisation (Jetro) office in Bangkok, said. Not every Japanese company has the will or the means to move its operations abroad, and many local south-east Asian manufacturers are expected to benefit from the strong yen as more and more Japanese companies source their components from foreign suppliers. 'Some Japanese companies are converting their source of supply of components, for example from Japan to south-east Asian countries such as Malaysia or Singapore,' said Mr Tateichi. Mr Richard Han, president and chief executive of the Thai company Hana Microelectronics, has already noticed increasing interest from his Japanese clients, although he expects prospective new customers to move cautiously rather than 'rush and sub-contract everything the next day'. Hana, employing 900 people, assembles semiconductors and printed circuit boards. Although some of the company's inputs are imported from Japan, its biggest cost is machinery (much of it American) and it has the advantage of relatively cheap Thai labour. If Japanese companies suffering from the yen do not find it worthwhile to move abroad, 'subcontractors like myself are perhaps fortuitously in a position to reap some of the benefit,' says Mr Han. Even when there is a shift of manufacturing from Japan to other Asian countries, it is not being made across the board. Japanese companies are keeping production of more value-added products strictly at home. Mitsubishi Electric, for example, is moving production of mass-market products such as video cassette recorders overseas, but is keeping factory capacity in Japan free to produce high-definition televisions for when market demand grows. Japanese executives say that the high level of technological skills required to manufacture leading-edge products means these will have to be kept in Japan for some time. The picture that emerges is of an increasingly clear division of labour between Japan and the rest of Asia. Mr Masaru Takagi, chief economist at Fuji Research Institute, believes this separation of roles will not be limited to mass-market products sold overseas but will increasingly extend to those aimed at the Japanese market as well. While Japanese car-makers are currently exporting mass-market cars to Asia, Mr Takagi sees the reverse happening in the future. The recent strengthening of the yen is not always good news for Asian countries and companies outside Japan, particularly those - such as Indonesia - with substantial yen loans to repay. However, as Japan starts to rely on imports for high-volume products and shifts its exports to low-volume, value-added goods, the trade balance is expected to alter. 'Japan's trade surplus with Asia will shrink,' Mr Takagi says, 'and in the long run, a trade deficit with the region is not out of the question.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- JAPANESE DIRECT INVESTMENT IN ASIA (USDollars m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         1989       1990       1991       1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Malaysia                 673        725        880        704 Thailand               1,276      1,154        807        657 Korea                    606        284        260        225 Singapore              1,902        840        613        670 Taiwan                   494        446        405        292 Hong Kong              1,898      1,785        925        735 China                    438        349        579      1,070 Indonesia                631      1,105      1,193      1,676 Philippines              202        258        203        160 Total*                 8,238      7,054      5,936       6,425  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Totals do not add up because some countries excluded  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Japan ministry of finance  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

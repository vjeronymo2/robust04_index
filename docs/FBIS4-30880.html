			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second of two installments of interview with President Ion </F> Iliescu by Jean Mirot of the French daily LE FIGARO; place and  date not given: "Romania -- An Open Country"]    [Text] [Mirot] We have not heard you talk too much about  the tragedy of Yugoslavia, one of your closest neighbors. Your  foreign minister was reminding me of a smart saying: "Romania's  only sure neighbor is the Black Sea." What are your feelings  about this Yugoslav drama, an issue on which I believe you are  more on the side of the Serbs than of the others?    [Iliescu] We are "pro-Yugoslavs." Talking about our  neighbors, we could say that, throughout history, Romania's best  neighbors were the Serbs and Yugoslavs, regardless of the type  of state that existed on their territory. We have never fought  against each other throughout history. On the contrary, we have  been on the same side of the barricade. We suffered the same  foreign occupations, that is the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian  occupations, and fought the same two world wars. There has  always been a feeling of solidarity and mutual sympathy that  dominated in our relations. From this point of view, we have  regarded all this process that is currently taking place in  Yugoslavia as a tragedy, a tragedy of a heroic people. During  World War II, there were feelings of respect for the Serbs, for  the Yugoslavs. They had the most important resistance movement  in Europe against German occupation. They resisted the  Stalinist pressure in the fifties and enjoyed great prestige.    It is appalling for us to see that after those historical  events that consolidated their unity, this form of state is  collapsing in the most tragic possible way. I have often  visited Yugoslavia. In the seventies there were already  problems, mainly in the economic and social areas. There were  economic differences and discrepancies between the north, that  is Slovenia and Croatia, and the south. There was a difference  of one to six in the proportion of national product between the  population in Montenegro and Slovenia for example. There were  even certain disputes in this respect. I was in Montenegro in  the seventies when there were discussions about the investments  of Slovene capital, regarded as a means to exploit manpower  through Slovene capital. The Slovenes in turn were asking  themselves why should they export their capital to  less-developed republics, that is, why export the surplus  capital achieved by them, and so on and so forth. This was the  period in which Kardelj (Edvard Kardelj, Broz Tito's closest  associate] sought, with the help of certain amendments to the  Constitution, to establish a federal fund for the assistance of  less-developed republics. This means that, as early as that  period, there were problems and friction that were probably  triggered by economic problems.    What is currently happening in Bosnia is mainly a religious  conflict, because, generally speaking -- although in a different  manner -- the Croats and Serbs basically speak the same  language. I believe that they belong to one and the same nation  that was separated by history. There were hundreds of years of  Austro-Hungarian occupation for some of them and Ottoman  occupation for others. The Croats became Catholics while the  Serbs remained Orthodox. The Croats are using the Latin  alphabet, while the Serbs use the Cyrillic alphabet, but in any  event, they understand each other very well.    In Bosnia, there are the Muslims. What does it mean --  Muslims? It does not mean Turks, because they are also Serbs or  Croats who converted to Islam. They had a Constitution of the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, based on the consensus of the  three ethnic groups. The referendum was based on the principle  of majority, which was contradicting the constitutional  principle of the republic, since that was based on the principle  of consensus. Then, the Bosnian conflict emerged. Before 1990,  the Croats and Slovenes advanced a proposal to turn the  federation into a confederation. Maybe that would have been a  political solution to avoid this breach. But I believe that all  sides showed a rigid attitude toward these political problems  that triggered the conflict. It is a pity, because, as I have  previously said, we are talking about a nation with a quite  troubled history, and there is a human tragedy taking place  there. Therefore, we are in favor of all possible solutions  that would facilitate the accord between the interested sides in  Yugoslavia.    [Mirot] Do you view the economic embargo as an effective  method of reestablishing peace? As you know, you are suspected  of violating the embargo on the Danube River.    [Iliescu] I know that, and this is not true. There is a  permanent Western European Union commission that is cooperating  with us. We endorsed a decision of the United Nations, and as  far as it is concerned, we showed a correct attitude in  implementing it. If some incidents have taken place, this can  happen anywhere. However, from the viewpoint of the state, we  have taken all possible measures and there is international  cooperation in supervising and making sure that these measures  are respected.    But, talking about the embargo, I do not believe that it is  an efficient measure, as practice has demonstrated, just as  military measures are not sufficient to solve disputes and  conflicts. On the hand, military conflicts have worsened the  climate and reduced the potential for dialogue, because other  aspects appear that make it even less possible to hold dialogue  after military conflicts. Therefore, I believe that the only  possible, acceptable, and effective method is to make all  possible efforts to facilitate communication, ensure dialogue,  and search for political solutions.    [Mirot] After the example of Yugoslavia, the Hungarian  minority in Romania seems to be complaining about the violation  of their rights. Is there a risk that at one point "a  Milosevic" might gather all the Hungarians who live here in  Romania under the same banner?    [Iliescu] We are constantly prepared. We have held talks  and carried out certain comparative studies regarding the rights  of minorities in Romania, especially the rights of Hungarians  and the rights of minorities in Hungary and in any other  European countries. I do not believe that in the whole of Europe  there is another country where the ethnic minorities enjoy all  those rights that the Hungarians currently enjoy in Romania.  And we can approach all aspects of this issue. The Hungarians  represent 7 percent of Romania's population, that is, they  number 1.7 million people. The majority of them live in  Transylvania, but also in other regions, and there are over  30,000 Hungarians in Bucharest.    [Mirot] And the majority of these 1.7 million are Serbs.    [Iliescu] Serbs?    [Mirot] Yes.    [Iliescu] No. Hungarians. Most of them are living in  Transylvania. The Serbs are something else. There are other  nationalities in Romania, who represent 3 percent. We have  representative of the small groups of ethnic minorities in our  parliament. We have stipulated in our Constitution that all  national minorities will be represented in parliament regardless  of the direct results of the elections. Thus, the  representation of all minorities in parliament is ensured.  There are small groups of minorities such as Italians, and even  they have their representative in parliament. The same can be  said of Armenians, Greeks, and others. However, the Hungarians  represent the largest group, thus they have 39 representatives  in parliament, I mean senators and deputies. They have  representatives in all municipality, town, and regional councils  in areas where they live in a larger number. There are only two  counties where the Hungarians represent the majority of the  population. And this majority is represented in councils that  function in these areas. They have education in their mother  tongue at all levels, starting with elementary school and ending  with university. They have their press, radio stations,  television, and every possibility to assert themselves in all  areas.    You will find nothing like that in Hungary. Their reply to  this is that you will not find such a large minority in their  country like the Hungarians in Romania. But this is not an  issue of numbers, but of principle. They made a big fuss about  the law on their minorities, but no ethnic minority has a  representative in their parliament and their parliament rejected  this idea. There is no school where the teaching is in the  mother tongue of ethnic minorities. All minorities in Hungary  study their mother tongue as a foreign language, while they play  the champions on the issue of minorities' rights.    From a psychological viewpoint I can understand the attitude  of the Hungarians. This is a remnant, a vestige of imperial  nostalgia and all countries that had empires before have the  same manner. You can see the attitude of the present Russia  toward all republics that have become independent states. They  regard the rights of Russians as a fundamental problem. This  was also the case with the French, with their departments  oversees, wasn't it?    [Mirot] Certainly.    [Iliescu] This was the case with the British when they lost  their empire. Thus, it is natural that the Hungarians have the  same feelings and this is the core of sensitivity on both sides.    The Romanians are one of the oldest nations in Europe. We  have lived here for thousands of years. When the Roman empire  started expanding, they found here an organized state of the  Dacians, our ancestors. For years on end, our ancestors had  commercial and economic relations with the Greeks and they had  an organized state. When the Hungarians came to Europe and when  the Germanic and Slav tribes came to Europe, they found the  Romanians in their place. Transylvania was the political center  of the former Dacian state and during the Roman colonization it  was the political center of the Roman colony, that is Roman  Dacia.    Throughout history, even in the statistics compiled by  Hungarians or Austrians, the majority population in Transylvania  was Romanian, but the feudal law included this principle of  "unio trium nationum" which meant that on the political plane  the Romanians were not recognized as citizens but as serfs and  the only ones who had the right to be represented in the  Transylvanian Diet were Hungarians, Germans, and Secklers.  There were different statutes for them. This was quite a long  period in history when Transylvania was an autonomous  principality. There was a period when Transylvania was  subordinated to Vienna and there was also a short period of 67  years when it was subordinated to Budapest. In all these  periods of time, only the Germans, Hungarians, and Secklers --  these last ones are a people of Hungarian origin, but an older  one that was settled on the boundary of the empire; today they  form the majority population in two counties in Romania -- thus  only these three nations had the right to be represented in the  Diet, but not the Romanians. Thus, you can understand the  feelings of the Romanians, who fought for centuries on end for  their national liberation. In 1918, after World War I, when the  Austro-Hungarian empire collapsed, the national Romanian state  was established. That was the moment of the liberation of  Romanians, of self-determination, and of union with the other  historical provinces that were formerly, that is in the last  century, liberated from the Turkish domination and Bessarabia  from the Russian domination. For the first time, a united state  of Romanians was established. Therefore, on the one hand, there  are these feelings of the Romanians toward those who wish to  contest this historic reality, but, on the other hand, we  understand the Hungarians, too. They were the dominant nation  -- although they were the minority -- and suddenly became a  national minority. It is certainly a feeling that we can  understand. However, we should also understand....    [Mirot] On the other hand, we have learned that in  Moldova, which was part of Romania, a referendum took place and  those who wished the unification with Romania -- which is a  natural feeling -- were defeated. Do you believe that one day  this unification with Moldova will be achieved?    [Iliescu] Today, the problem of unification of the two  states is not a topical issue because it is a more complicated  problem. This territory was for the first time occupied by  Russian in 1812, when Turkey was making preparations for the  campaign against Napoleon. At that time, Russia was waging a  six-year war with Turkey. It halted the war with Turkey. This  was a period when Turkish diplomacy was quite weak and the  Russians, without winning, succeeded in obtaining a territory  from the Turks, namely Bessarabia. That was half of the  historical province of Moldova. Bessarabia became a Russian  "province" for 100 years, until World War I. After World War I,  Bessarabia was integrated into the Romanian sate. In 1940,  through the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, the Soviets not only  occupied "tsarist" Bessarabia -- a territory occupied by the  tsars -- but also occupied another territory, namely North  Bucovina, which has never belonged to Russia. Before World War  I, this was a land occupied by Austria for 150 years. It was  included in the Austrian Empire, but it did not belong to  Russia. However, they occupied this land, claiming that it was a  sort of "compensation" for the 20 years of occupation of  Bessarabia by Romania. There was also an interesting event. In  1965, in North Bucovina, there was a movement of the Romanians  who said: The 20 years have passed, we should return to  Romania. There was a certain motion and I was in Suceava  [northeastern Romania] near the border and I was told that there  were many families with relations on the two sides of the border  and those families said: Our people say that it is high time  for the return of our land. But certainly, when the Russians  occupy a land, they never withdraw.    They did something else, something that the Tsarist regime  had never done before. They divided the land into three parts:  They incorporated the southern and northern parts in Ukraine --  this was carried out by Stalin and Khrushchev who was first  party secretary in Ukraine -- and they also attached a  territory, the Dniester, which did not belong to Romania. but  which was also created by Stalin in 1942, as an "autonomous  republic" of Moldova, probably having the idea of annexing the  other part of Moldova, too, that is, Bessarabia. Then, they  created a situation that is more complex today, when we can no  longer talks about a whole land. The Republic of Moldova was  proclaimed on the territory of the Soviet Republic of Moldova.  This includes only a part of the territory occupied by the  Soviets and, before then, for one century by the Russians, and  another territory, that is, Dniester. There is a movement of  Russians there who claim that if Moldova unites with Romania,  they want guarantees that they are going to stay outside  Romania's borders. This is the Dniester conflict. Thus, from  this point of view, the situation in Moldova is quite sensitive,  with pro-Russian movements and with the quite-complex feelings  of the Romanians who live there and represent the majority of  the population; 65 percent of the population are Romanians.  However, there is also the problem of the other territories.    We have always approached these problems in a realistic  manner. We believe that in politics one should take into  consideration current historical realities. Otherwise, there  will be no peace in Europe, because there are innumerable border  problems such as the problem of Germans in Koenigsberg and the  other territories, the Poles with their border problems, and  even the French and the Hungarians and all the others have such  problems. Therefore, one should take into consideration the  current realities, with the current borders, and we believe that  the only criteria to be considered are the post-war  understandings, treaties, the Helsinki documents, and the Paris  Charter. Thus, we recognized the independent Moldovan state.  We regard it as the second Romanian state, but only history can  tell what will be the fate of this state. There is no need to  create new tension now. This is not in Moldova's interest, it  is not in the interest of the Romanian state, and of peace in  general to stir this issue. One should take realities into  consideration. We will have to support the development of  direct relations and this is already a gain. Previously, during  the rule of the Soviet Union, we could have no direct relations  with Chisinau and with that region. All problems had to be  discussed with Moscow. But today we have another situation,  because we can have direct contact and human contact. We do  have this possibility now. We believe that the only solution is  to take concrete steps and develop economic, cultural,  spiritual, scientific, and human relations and to establish an  unhampered system of communication.    [Mirot] I have a last question, so that I do not take up too  much of your time. Bucharest used to be called the "little  Paris"; you speak excellent French, and it is true that we, the  French, feel somehow at home here. I hope that this feeling  will be mutual when you are in Paris. However, we are a little  worried about the Francophony and the strong offensive of the  English language. Your generation speaks French excellently,  however, under the Ceausescu regime, obviously there was a lapse  in the use of the French language. What do you do currently to  relaunch Francophony?    [Iliescu] First of all, I would like to stress a few  fundamental ideas. Regardless of the political orientation,  political groups, or personal orientations, I believe that there  is a unanimous feeling among Romanians as far as relations with  France and the attitude toward France are concerned. This is  not only a sentimental issue. This is connected with our Latin  origin -- because we are situated on the eastern side of the  Latin world and we are also an island of Latinity in a Slav  world -- but also because throughout history we have had direct  connections with France and all Romanians could feel the support  granted by France as decisive in certain tragic moments or  decisive moments for our country.    On the one hand, France discharged a spiritual influence in  the past because it was at the forefront of modern changes in  Europe -- the French revolution and the enlightened ideas of the  French realism -- and many Romanian intellectuals were educated  in France. During the 1848 revolutionary movement, there was a  direct link between the French and Romanian revolutionary  movements. Our struggle for national assertion and for national  independence were constantly supported by France. During World  War I, the time when the Romanian united national state was  established, the political support granted by France was  decisive -- Trianon was a decisive moment for us from this point  of view -- and, as a result of it, all these historical ties  created a general feeling in all Romanians for France, feelings  of sympathy and solidarity throughout history with France.  Therefore, the establishment of privileged relations with France  have always been a constant and dominant part of our foreign  policy. This is also a constant feature of our current foreign  policy as well.    However, we have a certain feeling of apprehension regarding  the official position towards an interest of some circles in  France to sustain and support the political wish of Romanians.  This feeling of apprehension is also caused by the fact that  even the French mass media sometimes expresses attitudes that  are not always friendly toward the processes that are currently  taking place in Romanian society. If you wish, I can tell you  that, in a way, the Romanians expect France to play a role  toward Romania that is similar to the role played by West  Germany toward East Germany. Maybe, in this case, the ties are  less strong. In case of Germany we are talking about a  completely united community, but we would like France to show  the same feelings.    Certainly, we are not denying the constant support that  France granted to Romania after the revolution -- immediately  after and throughout this period -- in European institutions  such as the Council of Europe and the European Union. We have  greatly appreciated this support. Our relations are generally  good but, since you started discussing this subject, I would  like to use this opportunity to tell you that the Romanians  expect a more open attitude. I cannot deny that we feel  France's friendly attitude toward us, but we would like to see a  greater interest, mainly coming from business circles. We are  in the middle of a very dynamic period of economic development  and Francophony is not only a sentimental issue. If it is not  supported with fundamental relations, through economic activity,  it might suffer, even if we take into consideration the current  feelings and the feelings that we will always nurture for France.    [Mirot] We hope that your official trip to France....    [Iliescu] I hope too. Even if the Germans are busy with the  territories in the east, are much more dynamic. They make less  noise and less fuss, but are very efficient and active. The  Italians are more active, too. They have political difficulties  but, as businessmen, they are more dynamic than the French.    [Mirot] This is true. You are right. You are criticizing  us in the mass media for the attitude that we show for Romania,  maybe also for a certain worsening of the situation, which is no  doubt connected with the revolution. The French mass media  showed some reticence when reporting about your country, but we  can assure you that we continue to love Romania.    [Iliescu] I think that the French can understand better now  the "miners incursions" [in Bucharest in 1990].    [Mirot] Absolutely.    [Iliescu] I do not believe that there can be anybody who  believes that young people's movements are manipulated by the  presidents of the republic.    [Mirot] Absolutely not.    [Iliescu] But as far as the "miners incursions" are  concerned, the French mass media took over the slogans that were  disseminated in our country.    [Mirot] Mr. President, thank you very much.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH;  </P> <P> PAY RAISE ISSUE ON CITY COUNCIL DOCKET  </P> <P> City Council members tonight will discuss whether to ask voters for their first  pay raise in 25 years.  </P> <P> Currently, members receive $125 a month, contrasted with $300 paid to council  members in Los Alamitos and some other Orange County cities, said Councilman  Frank Laszlo.  </P> <P> "Our salaries are the second lowest in the county," he said. "I think it's  about time we had a raise."  </P> <P> Under the city charter, the salaries may be increased only by a charter  amendment approved by city voters. Laszlo, a councilman for nine years, has  asked the council to put the proposal on the June primary ballot.  </P> <P> "We have discussed doing this in the past, but some of the council members  expressed concern that some citizens might not approve the raise," Laszlo said.  "The feedback I'm getting now is that most people think it's about time we  tried it." MICHELLE NICOLOSI  </P></p>

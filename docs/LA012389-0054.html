			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL'S EATERY OFFERS STUDENT STAFF A RECIPE FOR SUCCESS  </P> <P> For many people who eat at the Hungry Tiger, the bungalow cafe on the Paradise  Hills campus of Morse High School is just a nice little place for an  inexpensive but tasty breakfast or lunch.  </P> <P> After all, there are few places in town for 2-inch-thick French toast "made  from butter bread, dipped in egg, milk and cinnamon batter, toasted golden  brown and served with butter and syrup," all for $1. Or the luncheon menu's  fish sandwich and chips for $2, "delectable tidbits of breaded Atlantic Ocean  Cod, served on a toasted bun, served with French fries, tartar sauce, malt  vinegar and a slice of lemon."  </P> <P> To the Morse faculty and staff, and school guests who make up the restaurant's  clientele, the attentive, though inexperienced, student employees who prepare  and serve the food enhance the already informal, unpretentious atmosphere.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Larger Role at Play  </P> <P> Only after several visits to the Hungry Tiger -- and the chance to talk and  watch the students and their instructor in action -- do people begin to  perceive the larger role this unique vocational education course plays.  </P> <P> For Dewayne Schilling, who founded the two-semester course 17 years ago and has  shaped it ever since, his goal with the 90 or more students he teaches annually  is not primarily to train legions of future food-service workers.  </P> <P> "Sure, you can't lose knowing how to cook and prepare food," said Schilling,  who, before returning to college for his teaching credentials, enjoyed a  food-service career in the Air Force, working for a while on the presidential  jet, Air Force One, for Lyndon B. Johnson.  </P> <P> "But my philosophy is rather to show these kids how to find jobs, the mechanics  of staying on the job and being successful, how to work with people and how to  develop positive attitudes toward people and life.  </P> <P> "With that emphasis, they can go into the food business or any other business,  work part time in cooking while going to college, whatever. It's a win-win  situation."  </P> <P> Add to Schilling's philosophy his caring but firm attitude toward students, and  the recipe is complete for a course that shows how vocational education can  coexist -- even complement -- the so-called basic-skills curriculum of  </P> <P> English, math and social studies at a time when job-related study has come  under fire.  </P> <P> "We always perceive academics and vocational courses as either-or," said  Shirley Weber, the new San Diego city schools trustee from the Morse area and a  strong supporter of an improved basic-subjects curriculum. "I think that the  Hungry Tiger shows we can have both and they can complement each other. We do  need these functional courses, but what I don't want are situations where  students are put only into (vocational education courses) and not given other  options."  </P> <P> "This is a great program," teacher Connie Phillips said between bites of Hungry  Tiger chili last week. "Dewayne has accomplished things for his students that  you wouldn't believe. These kids learn about math, work ethics, politeness as  much here as in any other classroom."  </P> <P> Schilling does all this while shuttling from the dining room, where he guides  students on how to approach customers, to the well-equipped but frenetic  kitchen, where students at the short-order grill tackle the art of mixing  pancake batter while others handle vats of carrot cake mix near the ovens.  </P> <P> Senior Eric Fernandez was waiting on tables last week as part of his  two-hour-a-day course work at the Hungry Tiger. "I took the course because I  wanted some job experience in any category, and I also wanted to raise my  grade-point average," he said.  </P> <P> Fernandez credited Schilling with showing him how to prepare for a job and  present himself in a positive manner.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Stresses Teamwork'  </P> <P> "I think that also I've been helped with my other courses," the soft-spoken  Fernandez said. "Mr. Schilling stresses teamwork, learning how to work with  other people, how you should never give up on any work, that you should try  hard, and that you can make new friends." Fernandez plans to attend college  next year and might consider a career in the military.  </P> <P> Vocational education has been criticized strongly in recent years for  emphasizing too much training for specific occupations and for not stressing  enough links to academics. Academic core-class requirements for graduation have  increased in districts nationwide, leaving less time for students to take  vocational classes. Educators expect that only those classes flexible enough to  adapt to the educational reform movement will survive.  </P> <P> "I know about the criticism, but, at the same time, 85% of the student  population probably is not going to college," Schilling said. "I'm not saying  don't teach algebra, no way am I saying that. But I am saying that for some  students, why not set up algebra or science like our class is structured, where  we have class work instruction in the first semester, and then in the second  semester we apply it. You could measure angles on buildings or understand  decibels as they correlate to the kids' music."  </P> <P> Schilling said that success with his course requires that students perform as  well as they do in their core classes. When Schilling teaches baking, he  emphasizes that correct measurements and formulas are critical to a decent cake  or blueberry muffin.  </P> <P> "Baking is an exact science, and the kids then begin to see a relationship  between school and success in life, and they'll lean back and say, 'Yeah, I  should remember this,' instead of asking about the relevance of this and that.  . . . We reuse and relearn things every day here, and I often ask them to try  the same task in a different way the next day."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lessons Sink In  </P> <P> Not that the students innately pick up on the method behind Schilling's  madness. "At 16 or 17 years old, a lot of kids don't know where they want to  be," he said. "It's only a year or two later when so many come back to tell me  they got a lot out of the class."  </P> <P> Rick Whittington dropped in to say hi last week while Schilling was being  interviewed. Whittington, 20, now works for American Pest Control. He graduated  from Morse in 1986.  </P> <P> "What you learn in here helps you to go out and get a job if that is what you  want to do," he said. "And Mr. Schilling helps out all his students and treats  you the way you want to be treated. I think I worked harder in other courses  because of him, because I learned that all teachers aren't the same, that  others too were like Mr. Schilling."  </P> <P> Senior James Ethridge would like to go into hotel management.  </P> <P> "Mr. Schilling, he really can deal with students in a group or one-on-one,"  Ethridge said. "He has come down on me a couple of times, but he has been fair,  and I sometimes do get a little wild. Last year, I was in and out of the  (principal's) office for a lot of petty things, but this course has matured me,  and teachers have complimented me on my attitude. . . . I am doing better in  classes now."  </P> <P> In addition, Ethridge has become a "pretty good" cook. Last November, he cooked  all but the Thanksgiving turkey for his family and relatives during their  holiday get-together. He also said he now can cook up a real meal when he is  hungry, instead of simply throwing a bag of instant noodles into boiling water.  </P> <P> Some students praise the food-management course but admit they signed up  primarily because they thought it would be easy, despite the difficulty most  have encountered in preparing a consistent pancake batter.  </P> <P> "This course is like a break to me compared to other classes," junior Minnie  Myers said. "I thought it would be fun and I want to learn more about cooking.  I was a little surprised about all the things we did first semester in learning  how to put together a resume and going out for a job interview, understanding  what work requirements are."  </P> <P> Senior Ray Martin isn't sure how the course has helped him with school in  general, although he concedes it has "added a little bit of discipline." And,  while he enjoys knowing how to cook more than a potato, he hopes for a career  in computing after a stint in the military following graduation.  </P> <P> "Dewayne Schilling is amazing at what he can do," said Evelyn Jones, the  program's assistant director for the past two years, after having worked as a  security officer on the Morse campus.  </P> <P> "The word is out among students that he is fair; that is why this course has  been so popular over the years," Jones said. "He treats everyone the same and  gets the 'good' out of the student that no one else will give a chance. We hear  from other teachers who ask how we were able to get through to a student.  </P> <P> "Almost no student ever leaves the program. Mr. Schilling won't let them."  </P> <P> Schilling downplays his effect on students, saying simply that he will "touch  students, hug students, chew out students, force them to deal with problems. .  . . They're not used to that. . . . We learn how to finish a job we start, how  to communicate, how to understand someone's cultural background a bit."  </P> <P> "The kids see that I care about what happens to them," Schilling said. He has  few of what he calls "house rules," but among them are no wearing of gang  colors and no racial or other put-downs.  </P> <P> Even with all the counseling and personal-growth work that Schilling does with  his students, he manages to train them to put out decent meals.  </P> <P> So as far as breakfast or lunch goes, just how good is the food?  </P> <P> Math aide Fumi Marquez is one of many faculty who choose the Hungry Tiger each  day over the regular cafeteria food.  </P> <P> Said a confident Marquez -- who at five months into her pregnancy is eating for  two -- as she wolfed down a Tigerburger with cheese the other day: "There is no  competition."  </P></p>

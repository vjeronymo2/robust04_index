			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Bruton survives challenge Mr John Bruton, the leader of Ireland's main opposition party, Fine Gael, since 1990, narrowly survived a challenge to his leadership in a no-confidence vote within his parliamentary party yesterday, writes Tim Coone in Dublin. The challenge was launched by four opposition frontbenchers last week, following an opinion poll result which showed the party to be at its lowest level of support since the foundation of the state over 70 years ago.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Markets: Chasing values round the economic cycle - Serious money STOCK MARKETS are as prone to changes in fashion as clothing companies. In the last few years, as high interest rates and then recession have hit the economy, the fashionable stocks have been the so-called 'growth' companies. These are businesses in sectors which have long-term growth prospects that are relatively untouched by recession. A prime example has been the healthcare and pharmaceuticals stocks. People still get ill during recessions and the cost of caring for the greying Western populations continues to rise. Glaxo and Wellcome were two of the best performing stocks of last year and trade on price-earnings ratios of over 28 and 37 respectively. The height of the growth stock fashion was in the early 1970s, when the 'nifty fifty' stocks in the US were bid up to stratospheric ratings. Such companies would never be acquired by adherents of a rival investment philosophy - the 'value investors'. These look for stocks with low price-earnings ratios and high yields, on the grounds that they are undervalued by the market. In general, these stocks tend to be in the so-called cyclical industries, whose profits are very vulnerable to recession. The problem for value investors over the last few years has been that the success of the strategy depends on risks being overestimated by the market. In fact, all too often the risks have been underestimated. In part, this is a reaction to the euphoric early 1980s, when UK companies did so well for so long. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, interest rates have been higher, for longer, than experts anticipated and analysts have been repeatedly forced to cut their forecasts for economic growth and corporate profits. Many cyclical stocks have been forced to cut or even eliminate their dividends. Fund management groups which have followed the value-based stock-picking philosophy, such as M&amp;G and Fidelity, have seen a dent in their long term performance records over the last three years or so. Now with gloom all around, it may be that the conditions for value investing have returned once more. Certainly, Paul Woolley of US fund management group GMO Woolley argued as much in these pages last November. Should UK private investors be jumping on the bandwagon? In the US, there have been signs this year of a shift away from growth stocks and into cyclical stocks such as Caterpillar and Bethlehem Steel. But as Bill Smith of BZW points out, the buoyant mood of the US market is based on the sharp decline in interest rates, with the discount rate now down to 3.5 per cent. The hopes are for a strong rebound from recession. In the UK, by contrast, the recovery is expected to be much more patchy and sluggish - interest rates are still high in real terms and are unlikely to fall quickly while the pound remains within the Exchange Rate Mechanism. A number of sectors and companies may not yet have seen the worst. 'We are still in a period when the risk of nasty surprises from the corporate sector is high' says Bill Smith. This week's profit and dividend declines at Lonrho prove his point. As a consequence, though there was some sign that the UK was following the US shift into cyclicals in early January, the trend stopped this week. According to Jerry Evans of County NatWest, the shift might have started a bit too early in the UK and investors will probably wait until they sense the tenor of the next results season, in February and March, before taking it further. Certainly M&amp;G, which is in the process of launching a Recovery investment trust via an expensive advertising campaign, will be counting on a return in fashion to value investing in the near future. But BZW's Smith has some doubts as to whether the value theory will hold as good this time round. Cyclical stocks owed part of their outperformance in previous rallies, he argues, to the continuing tendency for the pound to devalue. A falling pound increases margins and order flow for exporters. That trick cannot be repeated within the ERM. BZW is looking for recovery to come from those companies with direct exposure to the UK consumer and the US industrial sectors. Certainly, the prospects for cyclical stocks are even more difficult to predict than normal at the moment, since while the US is expected to recover, the European economies are only starting their own slowdowns. But the long term advantages of value and smaller company investing (see below) are so well documented that it is hard to believe these effects have disappeared for ever, even if they emerge in a slightly different form. Fashion will shift again. Given the risk of continued individual company shocks, however, the private investor should ensure that any shifts in his or her portfolio are achieved by investing in a unit or investment trust. And it is even more vital that investors who want to back the value effect buy for the long term. Sometimes it can take three or five years for the undervaluation to disappear; patience in these circumstances is not just a virtue, it is a necessity.</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUBLIC BATHS  </P> <P> Throughout history, man has enjoyed public bathing. He has delighted in laying  back at a pool, stream, river, hot spring, or ocean, getting clean.  </P> <P> The Roman public baths must have been wonderful. America could use the idea  today.  </P> <P> Plenty of hot water and heat are available at our power plants. Because of the  nature of the electricity-producing cycle, 65% of the fuel used to produce  electricity is wasted as heat. That's a lot of waste heat. Clouds of steam can  be seen rising above our power plants on cold mornings.  </P> <P> So, at a steam plant, we make a nice little park with free showers and washing  facilities for clothes. Cost would be negligible.  </P> <P> Travelers would use the spas. People living in motor homes would. Kids would.  The homeless would.  </P> <P> Public baths are very civilized things. They are right in line with the  President's idea of a gentler, kinder America.  </P> <P> ROGER DURHAM  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

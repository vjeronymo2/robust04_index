Rong said that China has been watching closely and  supporting  the peace process in Angola, and appreciates efforts towards  peace the Angolan Government has made under the leadership of  President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.    He said that China is glad to see the positive progress in  the peace talks between the Angolan Government and the National  Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) which resumed  last November.

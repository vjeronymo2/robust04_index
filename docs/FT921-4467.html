			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Management: Entrepreneurs on the line - In A Nutshell Mobile phones, described by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in last year's Budget as 'one of the greatest scourges of modern life,' are thought to increase working efficiency by 86 per cent of users, according to a survey* for Cellnet by Cranfield School of Management The owner-managers of small businesses in 'blue collar' sectors, who often use their vehicle as an office, believe they achieve the greatest increase in their effectiveness from a mobile phone. They believe their phones contributed to an 11 per cent rise in their business activity, compared with a 3 per cent increase noted by 'white collar' small businesses and a 2 per cent rise recorded by managers in large companies. More than 40 per cent of business users said their phones were essential; 30 per cent thought they helped in winning business; while less than 10 per cent saw them as 'a bit of a luxury'. *The Values and Benefits of Mobile Telephones to Business Users.

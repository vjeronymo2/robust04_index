The relevant authorities  have therefore given Streams two weeks to leave the country.    Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah, speaker of the Transitional  National Assembly, declared during a news conference yesterday  that the British ambassador was behind the postponement of the  archbishop of Canterbury's visit to Sudan. Mr. Khalifah said  peaceful coexistence between religions and the good spirit  prevailing between the Muslims and the Christians of Sudan  constituted the motives for enemies to conspire and for intrigue  to occur in an effort to shake up the stability being enjoyed by  the people of Sudan.    Meanwhile, Bishop Gabriel Rorech, minister of state at the  Foreign Ministry, said the British ambassador was working to  create distortions and differences between the government and  the Episcopal Church in Sudan.</p>

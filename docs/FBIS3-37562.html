Dispute on  Outside Control Continues"]    [Text] The Russian Federal Committee for Oversight of  Nuclear and Radiation Safety (RF Gosatomnadzor) held a news  conference devoted to the state and problems of ensuring safety  at facilities around Russia that constitute a nuclear and  radiation hazard (according to Gosatomnadzor, they number 14,500  today).    The major part of RF Gosatomnadzor chairman Yuriy  Vishnevskiy's address dealt with problems that had arisen in  relations between the organization he heads and the Russian  Federation Defense Ministry. According to Yu. Vishnevskiy, the  problems boil down to the fact that, despite the repeatedly  confirmed decisions made by the Russian Federation president,  Defense Ministry chiefs are preventing the establishment of  state oversight over the Russian Federation Defense Ministry's  nuclear and radiation hazardous facilities. The situation at  these facilities, Yuriy Vishnevskiy believes, is very serious:  There have been instances of nuclear materials having been  stolen and people overexposed.    Rear Admiral Nikolay Yurasov, chief of the Russian Navy  nuclear safety inspection, commented in an exclusive interview  for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the Defense Ministry's stance on the  given question.    [Vaganov] The commander in chief of Russia's armed forces --  the Russian Federation president -- made a political decision:  to provide for nondepartmental control at Defense Ministry  nuclear facilities. Why is Gosatomnadzor not allowed in these  facilities?    [Yurasov] From the moment the RF Gosatomnadzor was formed,  we invited their specialists right away, and they worked at our  facilities. But when the process of approving documents began,  a number of problems cropped up.    [Vaganov] With what are they connected?    [Yurasov] These questions affect not only the Defense  Ministry as a departmental organ. In the first place, they are  connected with state security problems, problems of breaking up  the Russian Federation Defense Ministry structures already  created for these same purposes. We also disagree with those  requirements on provision of information put forward by  Gosatomnadzor. But we are working with them, and, I think, will  come to an agreement after all.    [Vaganov] The Gosatomnadzor chairman has stated he still  does not know the details of the theft of one kg of fissionable  materials from a military base in Murmansk in 1993. What do you  know about this?    [Yurasov] We do not know the details either. The  prosecuting bodies taking part in investigating this case have  not given us any additional information.    [Vaganov] How would you comment on yet another statement of  the Gosatomnadzor chairman: departmental control in principle  cannot be more effective than state control.    [Yurasov] Mr. Vishnevskiy expressed himself somewhat  differently: Owing to the fact that departmental control exists  and the nuclear fleet's problems have (he said) not been solved.  I radically disagree with him. The fleet's problems have been  known to everyone and for a long time. Beginning in 1988 -- I  state it with all responsibility -- the CPSU Central Committee  general secretary, the USSR president, and all chairmen of  governments were aware of these problems.    In accordance with Russian Federation president's directive  No. 224 of 9 April 1993 on the incident in Tomsk-7,  Gosatomnadzor was directed to conduct an inspection of all  hazardous zones at nuclear facilities of all agencies, including  those of the Defense Ministry. An interdepartmental commission  was set up with RF Gosatomnadzor representatives also as its  members. A report was elaborated on the results of this  commission's work that was signed by Atomic Energy Minister  Viktor Mikhaylov and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. This  report is now being looked at in the government. Unfortunately,  Mr. Vishnevskiy refused to add his signature to this document  for formal reasons.    Let the respected Mr. Vishnevskiy say, which question in the  area of nuclear safety of Russian Federation Defense Ministry  facilities are unknown in the government? Should there be  financial means, we will do all that depends on us. The thing  is that out of the two directives adopted in connection with  ensuring safety of nuclear facilities last year, one received no  financial backing at all, and the other as little as 15 percent.</p>

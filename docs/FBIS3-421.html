He was reacting to  charges by the ANC leader at a Natal election rally that the ISD  should disband, following the massacre of 11 people on Saturday  night in Bhambayi, north of Durban.    The call showed how blind the ANC was to the real causes of  violence, Mr Kriel said. "This attitude can only inflict more  death and misery on the people because while Mr Ramaphosa and  the ANC waste time and energy falsely blaming the SA Police, the  true causes of violence go unaddressed." Mr Ramaphosa should  address the real causes of violence -- political intolerance and  control of supporters, instead of throwing away the opportunity  to work for peace at grassroots level, Mr Kriel added.</p>

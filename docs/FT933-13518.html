			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (7): Capital idea ready to launch - Lloyd's prepares to take on a new character LLOYD'S OF LONDON will finalise its plans to attract corporate investment later this month, signalling an important shift in the character of the 305-year-old insurance market. Lloyd's leaders believe that an influx of fresh capital from institutional investors, insurance companies and individuals is essential if the market's recent losses are not to be followed by shrinkage and possible break-up. But in spite of some encouraging recent signs, the success of the efforts to attract new money is far from certain. Lloyd's initially agreed to invite corporate investors to join the market in January last year, when the council, or governing body, accepted the recommendations of a market task force, headed by the present chairman, David Rowland. The discovery in the spring of 1992 that the entry of new 'incorporated Names' would not require any amendment to the 1982 Lloyd's Act, which sets out the market's self-governing status, led the council to step up its preliminary work. And in April this year Lloyd's announced the basic rules for corporate participation as part of its new business plan. Underpinning all these developments has been a realisation that Lloyd's cannot now hope to sustain - let alone expand - its existing capital base by relying on the individual members or Names, who have traditionally supported underwriting with their personal wealth. Lloyd's losses in the past five years amount to more than Pounds 6.5bn and have left several thousand Names facing the prospect of financial ruin. Since 1989 more than 13,000 Names have been forced either to resign or cease underwriting, reducing overall capacity from Pounds 11.1bn in 1990 to Pounds 8.7bn in 1993. More than 2,000 Names have applied to the market's hardship relief scheme, under which Lloyd's reschedules their debts and allows Names a modest income and home. Worse still the average age of the 19,770 Names who continue to trade at the market is more than 55. 'Anno Domini and our losses mean that we are an eroding asset,' says Mr David James, a Name and leading businessman who joined the council last year. 'There is not going to be a new flood of Names. We can only come through this morass if we attract new capital. The reality is we must expect further erosion. If we cannot replace that we are in some trouble.' Further impetus for the move to corporate capital is coming from Lloyd's agencies - which handle the affairs of individual Names and manage syndicates. With more than 17,000 Names either contemplating or taking legal action, agents are anxious to attract more stable investors. In its business plan Lloyd's announced that corporate investors would be asked to deposit 1.5 per cent of their stamp capacity (the amount of premium they are allowed to accept according to Lloyd's rules) in 1994 and pay a subsequent annual fee equal to 0.5 per cent of stamp. 'Incorporated Names' must also deposit 50 per cent of their stamp with Lloyd's to underwrite (compared to between 20 per cent and 30 per cent for individual Names). Lloyd's aims to achieve average underwriting returns of 10 per cent per year would therefore guarantee corporate investors a pre-tax return of 20 per cent from underwriting. Coupled with investment income of some 7 per cent incorporated Names could hope to achieve pre-tax returns of up to 27 per cent, the business plan says. Already the prospect of these returns has attracted a number of investment bankers to work on corporate capital projects. Late last year two banks - JP Morgan of the US and SG Warburg, of the UK - agreed to advise Lloyd's on its plans. Other financial institutions such as James Capel, BZW Securities, Salomon Brothers and Phoenix Securities, a niche securities house active in the international insurance market, are exploring a series of initiatives. Marsh McLennan, Johnson &amp; Higgins, Sedgwick Group and other insurance brokers, which have a detailed knowledge of the quality of the syndicates active at Lloyd's, are working with the banks on developingthese schemes. Among the most developed are: Morgan and Marsh teamed up in developing a Dollars 70m Bermuda-based company which will provide quota share reinsurance on an exclusive basis to syndicates managed by the Merrett Group at Lloyd's, one of the biggest of the Lloyd's managing agencies. Mr Dennis Purkiss, chief executive of Merrett, says the new company could eventually become an 'incorporated Name' at Lloyd's in its own right. CLM, a subsidiary of Sedgwick, the insurance broker, has teamed up with BZW to launch a Pounds 200-300m investment company, which would be listed on the stock exchange and participate in Lloyd's through up to six subsidiaries, each of which would become incorporated Names. While the company would be based in London and eventually listed on the stock market, the subsidiaries could be licensed as insurers in Bermuda, where both the tax and regulatory environment is gentler. BZW is marketing the company among individual and corporate investors and hopes to launch it by the autumn. Phoenix Securities is working with Anton agency at Lloyd's in the development of various vehicles, while Salomon Brothers has linked up with Johnson &amp; Higgins. Marsh McLennan and J P Morgan have launched a Dollars 1bn investment fund, a portion of which could be directed to the Lloyd's market. Two main questions cast a shadow over all these schemes. Lloyd's has still to convince investors that a plan to isolate billions of dollars of potential liabilities from US pollution and asbestosis will be effective. The proposal to 'ring fence' these liabilities by transferring all policies underwritten by Lloyd's syndicates in 1985 and all earlier years to a new reinsurance company, NewCo, formed an important part of the business plan. Lloyd's admits though that the scheme is highly ambitious and is dependent on months of painstaking efforts by market officials. More importantly, Lloyd's is coming under pressure from groups of loss-making Names to modify the terms on which corporate capital can join Lloyd's. The rebels argue that corporate investors must pay a higher joining fee or contribute part of their future profits to a fund, which would be used to help pay the losses of Names badly hit by recent losses. The issue figured prominently at an extraordinary general meeting in July and will be an important part of a confidence vote on which Names will vote by early August. Mr David Rowland, chairman, is keeping his fingers crossed that Names will vote against the rebel motions. Defeat would rule out the introduction of new corporate investors at least in the medium term and could seriously jeopardise the market's existence.</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / People: Ex-MP Maude to join Salomon After the disappointment of losing his Warwickshire North seat at the UK general election last month, things have been looking up for Francis Maude, 38, former financial secretary to the Treasury. First, he agreed to advise Hongkong and Shanghai Bank on its bid for Midland Bank. Now he is to join Salomon Brothers, the American investment bank, as a director of Corporate Finance at its London offices. He will continue as consultant to HKSC until the bid for Midland is over. At Salomon, Maude will be responsible for the bank's European privatisation business. This will involve advising Salomon's clients in east and west Europe on the financial and structural aspects of selling off state-owned assets. Salomon announced on Friday that Malev Hungarian Airlines is retaining its services to advise it on the sale of a minority interest if a suitable partner is found. Maude oversaw privatisation and competition policy in his two years at the Treasury, including the launch of the share shop scheme during the privatisation of British Telecom. In fact, Maude would have been closely involved with the Treasury's decision last September to drop Salomon in favour of Goldman Sachs as its US adviser on the Pounds 5bn BT flotation because of allegations that Salomon traders rigged US government securities auctions. Announcing the appointment, William Strong, head of European Investment Banking at Salomon, praised Maude for his 'broad international perspective'. Before joining the Treasury where he also represented the UK at the European Community, Maude was a minister of state at the Foreign Office with special responsibility for Hong Kong and was involved in granting British passports to 50,000 Hong Kong Chinese.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim  Chong-pil, "chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP]" of  South Korea, told "an enlarged caucus meeting" on March 21 that  though many people contend that dialogue should be held with the  North because it is the same nation, "the government must show a  cold and strong reaction" to it.    Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says his remarks  were  an anti-compatriot declaration for cutting off even the bonds  between the North and the South as the same nation, and a  declaration of confrontation and war.    The analyst says:    Rejecting fellow countrymen and pursuing confrontation and  war is inconceivable for a Korean.    The traitor Kim Chong-pil is a pro-Japanese, pro-American  stooge and an anti-communist fascist who served the defunct  dictator Pak Chong-hui as his right-hand man and prolonged his  dirty life by depending on outside forces, estranged from the  fellow countrymen.    A MINJU CHOSON analyst says such a traitor as Kim Chong-pil,  who is fostering antagonism and confrontation within the nation  and bringing the situation to an all the more grave phase must  be removed with the traitor Kim Yong-sam.</p>

			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> AIDS VIRUS FOUND IN 1 IN 500 AT COLLEGES  </P> <P> The first large study to determine the rate of AIDS infection on college  campuses found that about one in every 500 students was infected with the human  immunodeficiency virus, health officials reported. If the results of the  anonymous blood-testing survey on 19 campuses reflect the situation at colleges  around the country, about 25,000 of the country's 12.5 million college students  are infected with the virus, said Richard P. Keeling, director of student  health services at the University of Virginia and president of the American  College Health Assn. The overall rate of infection, 0.20%, is slightly higher  than the 0.14% infection rate reported for military recruits and is comparable  to rates found by the Centers for Disease Control in hospitalized patients and  in pregnant women giving birth, a CDC official said.  </P></p>

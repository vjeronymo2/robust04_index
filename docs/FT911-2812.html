			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Minding Your Own Business: A hard lesson follows the soft sell - Computing THIS IS AN account of an experiment to test after sales service in the computing world. It is an almost unremitting tale of woe. It is also, alas, not an especially rare experience in this area from which small business computer users, who are buying equipment themselves rather than employing special consultants, can usefully take note to avoid suffering similar frustration and annoyance. The saga begins at the end of November last year when, needing some extra equipment for a computer, I placed an order with a specialist company for the goods. The add-on duly arrived but proved not be working properly. This, in itself, was not a terrible event. Electronic goods can become temperamental when shunted through the postal process and are normally promptly replaced. Less reasonable, however, was the fact that the gadget had arrived together with a sheet of paper detailing several facilities which were featured in the manual but NOT implemented in the model I had received. In fact I, and presumably every one else who had placed a similar order, had been sent a pre-production unit for the full price of the advertised item. For a computer journalist this was no real problem. A quick call to the company's public relations company would certainly have produced immediate apologies and the required product. But, on the basis that this is not a route open to most users, I decided to proceed more conventionally, returning the goods and requesting both a fully working model and an explanation. An initial telephone query to the company had resulted in the claim that most customers would not mind (which translates as 'would not notice') the missing features and anyone who did could always send it back for replacement. My letter (recorded delivery) pointed out that to expect the recipients of substandard goods to go to the added expense of having to post them back in order to get what they had paid for was adding insult to injury. It was a detailed and courteous letter from an unsatisfied customer. Over a month later it had received no reply. A telephone call to the managing director (still as from an aggrieved customer) established that he was in a meeting from which he would never emerge and that it was necessary to speak to an official who expressed shocked surprise that I had not received a reply to my original letter. Their computer showed, he said, that the reply was sent out on December 28. I was impressed, and said so. After all my letter, although dated several days earlier, had not been posted until December 29 as the recorded delivery slip confirmed. Asked to read out this prophetic reply, the employee was somehow unable to bring it to his screen. But at least I was promised that the replacement peripheral would be sent to me, 'next Friday or Monday.' Several Fridays and Mondays duly arrived. The goods, however, did not. Suppressing the temptation to end the experiment, I wrote again to the invisible managing director requiring, within a week, the return of my property plus reasonable compensation for the expense incurred through postage and telephone costs, lost interest on my money over some three months and the amount of time spent trying to sort out the situation. Ten days later, silence having continued to prevail, I received another telephone call, this time from the company's public relations firm. They knew nothing of the problem, having called to ask me if I was interested in a new computer program. At this point my resolve weakened and I revealed all. The result was predictably rapid. The vanished add-on arrived by courier the next morning. A week later came a deeply apologetic letter from the managing director together with some software in lieu of compensation. The names of the guilty parties have been left out of this sorry saga because it is a small company, producing some admirable products, which fell victim to a common problem of success in the computing industry. The sheer volume of that success took the management's eye off the ball  - ie the service given to customers - while it developed its range. In an industry this competitive, that can be a fatal error and, in its own interests, the company's undertakings to correct the situation immediately are almost certain to be carried out. But others will continue to make the same mistakes and buyers must beware. Computer goods must meet the same standards as other consumer products, and unless you agree in advance to buy a product with some features missing, you have been short-changed if that is what you get. If the company will not either refund your money or replace the goods immediately, do not follow my example and allow correspondence to drag on indefinitely. Report the matter to the local Trading Standards Office - always a good way of getting a quick response from an otherwise sluggish business. If the problem is particularly bad, write and tell me about it for an occasional forum here on the kind of pitfalls smaller customers encounter in this area.</p>

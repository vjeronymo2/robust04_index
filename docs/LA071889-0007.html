			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: MOON TRIP NOW JUST A CHIP SHOT  </P> <P> Landing on the moon was child's play as astronaut Michael Collins led  schoolchildren on a simulated space trip, commemorating the 20th anniversary of  man's first steps on the lunar surface. Collins and students from Prince  George's County, Md., schools were linked by television satellite to a mock-up  mission control manned by astronaut Charles Duke and students at the Houston  Museum of Natural History in Texas. Duke was the "capcom," or capsule  communicator, when Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin Jr. set foot on  the moon July 20, 1969. Collins, the Apollo 11 command module pilot, orbited  the moon while his crew mates romped on the lunar surface. During the  simulation at a high-tech science education center in Greenbelt, Md., Collins  and the students used computers to gather moon rocks, build and launch a space  probe, analyze lunar samples, monitor life support systems and operate robots  and lunar rovers. "They had a good landing. They're a team of real  professionals," Collins said of the students. "We're ready to hire them."  </P> <P>  -- This time it's personal for Richard M. Nixon. For the first time, the  former President will describe in detail his experiences in resigning the  presidency and his life in retirement in an autobiography due next spring. "It  is the most personal book I have ever written," Nixon, 76, said in a statement.  Simon &amp; Schuster, the publisher, would not disclose terms of the contract  but said it plans a first printing of at least 200,000 and a major marketing  campaign. Nixon has pledged his income from the book to the Nixon Library and  Birthplace, scheduled to open next year at Yorba Linda, Calif.  </P> <P>  -- Seventy years after the death of Nicholas II, about 200 people gathered in  a monastery graveyard in Moscow to hold the first public Requiem in the Soviet  Union for the czar who was shot, along with his family, by Bolshevik guards in  July, 1918. Worshipers defied repeated orders by police to leave the prayer  meeting conducted by Russian Orthodox priests at Donskoi Monastery. The  unofficial Commission on the Remains of the Russian Imperial is calling for the  remains of the royal family to be given Christian burials in the Peter and Paul  Fortress in Leningrad, traditional resting place for Romanov royalty, Vladimir  Anishchenko, a commission member, said. Monarchists have contacted Grand Prince  Vladimir Kirillovich, ranking member of the Romanov family, who lives in  England. "He just came back to life when he heard about our activity,"  Anishchenko said. SHIRLEY MARLOW  </P></p>

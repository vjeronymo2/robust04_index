			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Rolls-Royce pre-tax profits fall 71% to Pounds 51m: Shares rise as group maintains dividend ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine and industrial power group, yesterday reported a 71 per cent drop in pre-tax profits last year but expressed confidence in its long-term prospects by maintaining its dividend. The decline in defence spending and the slump in the civil aviation industry were responsible for the sharp decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 51m last year from Pounds 176m in 1990. The company's core aerospace activities lost Pounds 6m last year, against a profit of Pounds 81m the year before. The group's industrial power activities also reported lower profits of Pounds 73m last year, down from Pounds 102m in 1990. The decline in profits also included a Pounds 58m restructuring charge to cover the 7,000 job cuts the company made last year. Sir Ralph Robins, chief executive, confirmed yesterday the company expected to reduce its workforce further this year by 3,000. Group sales declined 4 per cent last year to Pounds 3.5bn from Pounds 3.67bn the year before. Sales in the aerospace division fell 13 per cent to Pounds 2.033bn but increased 11 per cent in the industrial power division to Pounds 1.482bn. The company decided to maintain its final dividend at 4.7p a share making an unchanged total dividend for the year of 7.25p a share. Although the company has had to resort to its reserves to cover the dividend payment, Lord Tombs, chairman, said the decision reflected the company's confidence in its future. Earnings per share were 2 1/2 p, against 13.9p in 1990. The decision to maintain an unchanged dividend after speculation of a possible cut helped lift Rolls-Royce shares which closed 6p higher at 146p in a generally weak market. 'We have continued to strengthen our position in highly competitive international markets,' Lord Tombs said. The company maintained a strong balance sheet with year-end net cash of Pounds 52m (Pounds 170m in 1990) and an increased order book of Pounds 6.6bn (Pounds 5.7bn in 1990). Research and development spending was Pounds 216m - lower than the 1990 peak of Pounds 237m. Lord Tombs said he expected annual R&amp;D spending to average 8 per cent of turnover. The group's industrial power activities now accounted for more than 40 per cent of sales. Military business had declined to around 20 per cent of group sales last year.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian </F> Socialist Party, by Pal Szombathy; place and date not given:  "List Leaders Give Interviews -- Horn: A Full Next Cycle Can Be  Served With a Changed Style"]    [Text] In our election series, list leaders of parties  that set up a national list give interviews on their party's  typical program points and concepts. This time, we interviewed  Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP],  who said that this campaign is again filled with categorizing  one another.    [Szombathy] What kind of program have the Socialists managed  to prepare and what are the main elements of action? So far,  apart from categorizing one another, we have not heard much  about the program points.    [Horn] It is unfortunate that, rather than discussing the  important issues, this campaign is again filled with  categorizing one another. Hardly any parties talk about the  real problems: unemployment, the possibilities of changing the  economic structure, restoring agriculture, and public law and  order. Without handling and solving these kinds of issues the  country will be unable to get out of the crisis. The MSZP's  professional and political program was preceded by many months  of expert discussions, and we also tested our ideas on the  broader public. Naturally, the implementation of these depends  on the circumstances after the elections, not only on our  intentions. It is unfortunate that the government does not give  much attention to the kind of situation in which it will pass  the power over. In 1993, the economic condition of the country  went through a lot of deterioration: The deficit of the payment  balance increased to an unprecedented level and reached $3.5  billion. The country's foreign debt service obligations  rocketed because the government had taken on more than $6  billion loans through the least favorable bond form. We are all  facing very heavy burdens: According to some views, without  some urgent measures of the new government, the country might  become impossible to finance in the near future. We should be  dealing with these cutting issues in the campaign.    [Szombathy] What kind of debates preceded the finalization  of the Socialist program?    [Horn] I think that this issue belongs to the past now  because these debates have been concluded. The MSZP managed to  come to a compromise. It is obvious that, with the approach of  the elections, all parties are trying to formulate promises that  are impossible or hardly possible to fulfill. I add that the  opposition parties are in a more difficult situation because  many facts are not known to them. Therefore, they have to keep  comparing their statements with reality. I can say with  confidence that the Laszlo Bekesi's economic policy program  reflects the MSZP's perception and its intentions to act. The  internal debates were also useful because this program had gone  through significant changes compared to the original version.    [Szombathy] If you come to government, what will be the  first tasks of the cabinet?    [Horn] We immediately have to start to form a realistic view  of the situation, we have to hold talks with the World Bank, and  we have to make a permanent agreement with the IMF. Only a  coalition agreement open to public scrutiny can be lasting.  Whatever kind of government is formed, it will have a serious  chance to complete its term only if it changes the current style  and attempts to treat society as an adult partner. It has to  show a large amount of self-moderation and begin the savings  with itself. It will definitely have to start to streamline the  state apparatus.    [Szombathy] How can the aggravated media situation be  solved?    [Horn] Everything possible has to be done to establish  impartiality in the public service media. The Hungarian  Television's future might lie in keeping only Channel 1 for  public service and it would be a good idea to privatize the  other. Drawing up a media law instead of the terminated version  will be one of the most urgent tasks of the new Parliament. It  would not be good, either, if a witch hunt were started in the  media: People who are good at their jobs should be kept, but  perhaps not in their current positions.    [Szombathy] Do you consider the possibility of the MSZP  remaining in opposition after the elections? If you are too  strong then it might be difficult to find a coalition partner  because, with your dominance in government, you might "gobble  up" others.    [Horn] Relations within a coalition are not decided by the  number of mandates. Several western examples prove that, in  case of overwhelming victory, the will of the other partners is  also considered. It is difficult to imagine a coalition  agreement if the partners do not agree on the choice of people.  I am not worried about these fears.    [Szombathy] How would you comment on the public service  television's boldest attack on you: The "Panorama" program  showed a witness whom you had supposedly injured.    [Horn] It is unprecedented for a public service media to  shower a political party with so many abuses. The latest  edition of "Panorama" is a culmination of this. If the editors  had asked me, I would have told them that I had never been to a  prisoners' hospital or in Kelebia. The statements were gross  lies that hurt my human dignity without giving me a chance to  answer all this. The government is responsible for the  degeneration of the attacks: All this is making a subsequent  dialogue between the political forces impossible.</p>

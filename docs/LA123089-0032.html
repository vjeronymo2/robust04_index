			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPHY: KEEPING A RECORD OF HOME ITEMS, ARTWORK  </P> <P> Most people consider shooting photographs as a way to record the events in  their lives. But photography has a practical purpose -- it's a way to keep  records of your household inventory and artwork.  </P> <P> Shooting these photographic records can be accomplished simply with a flash and  a camera, or elaborately with multiple lights and a large format camera on a  tripod.  </P> <P> Nora M. Sharpe of Costa Mesa recently asked about art: "I am a ceramic artist  and keep a record of my work with slides and photographs. I also use slides and  photographs to send to galleries and enter competitions. I have had some work  photographed by a professional photographer but would like to do the work  myself, although I have developing done by a local photo lab.  </P> <P> "How can I make the light more dramatic? Should one use contrasting paper in  the backgrounds? If you use a dark object against white paper, how do you take  the reflective light into consideration; just by the light meter?"  </P> <P> There's little doubt that shooting quality copy photographs of your artwork can  be the difference between winning or losing a competition, since your effort  may be judged on the quality of a 35-millimeter slide. Also, sending your  original artwork would be too cumbersome to transport or mail.  </P> <P> The key is to set up a system for photographing your work and then staying with  it.  </P> <P> With flat artwork, which includes paintings, lithographs and drawings, it's  necessary to ensure that the subject is evenly illuminated. Shooting it in the  shade or with two lights from two sides at a 45-degree angle works well.  </P> <P> You should stay away from bright sun for copying work. The glare and  reflections make it a difficult light source to control. Using one light  directed from the camera isn't recommended because of the reflection it will  cause.  </P> <P> Shooting three-dimensional objects is more difficult because you need  additional lighting techniques to give the object its form. Also, the  background is very important. Stay away from distracting patterns -- brick and  stucco walls or old fences. They won't do justice to your work.  </P> <P> Consider buying a roll of backdrop paper from your local camera store. The  colors and reflective surface can vary, allowing you the opportunity to use  your imagination. Those with multiple lighting setups can change the color of  the backdrop by using colored gels over the light directed at the background.  This will give variety without the need to change rolls of background paper.  </P> <P> Use a background of contrasting colors to make your work stand out. Loud colors  are not advised unless they are suited to the art.  </P> <P> A tripod is essential. It will enable your to use a slow shutter speed and an  f-stop of f/11, f/16 or f/22 that will produce great depth of field, keeping  your work in focus.  </P> <P> If you're using a setup in the shade, your light will be flat and very low in  contrast. For most situations, this is the easiest method. But to produce  dramatic results, use multiple lighting setups. A simple place to start is with  one light at a 45-degree angle and another light with half the power directed  from the other side.  </P> <P> Next, move the lights to vary the shadows and highlight areas. Experimentation  is a must. Since each piece of artwork is an original, you should try to light  it in a unique way. Make notes as you work and take an extra shot of each setup  so you can have record of how you did it.  </P> <P> Get the proper exposure by moving in close to obtain an accurate meter reading  of the reflected light from your subject. This is critical, especially if your  background is black or white. Bracketing your exposure will be your best  insurance for proper exposure.  </P> <P> If you're shooting in the shade, you may find it necessary to use a filter to  correct the bluish cast. Select an 81A or 81B filter to avoid the problem. If  you choose to light your subject with tungsten light and are shooting  transparencies (slides), select film designed for this light.  </P> <P> Exhibitions: Color Cibachrome landscape photographs by Clinton Smith are on  exhibit at the Susan Spiritus Gallery in Costa Mesa until Jan. 28. The work  features images from throughout the United States. The gallery is in Crystal  Court at South Costa Plaza.

The images were shot on assignment for  Life magazine in 1962. The bookstore hours are 10 a.m to 9 p.m. Mondays through  Fridays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturdays and noon to 5 p.m Sundays.

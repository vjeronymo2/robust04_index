			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Property: The road to true conversion - Gerald Cadogan looks at homes made from churches and chapels All Saints, Langport is the first large medieval church that the diocese of Bath and Wells has declared redundant, and 'it will certainly not be the last', warns Philip Nokes, deputy diocesan secretary. More will follow as congregations amalgamate, but still lack the money to maintain their fine buildings. And the recent hugely increased parish payments to the dioceses make it ever harder for the faithful few to keep a roof over their heads. At Langport, the parish of 3,000 has another large gem of a medieval church (Huish Episcopi St Mary), 500 yards away. How could it support two? Which should go? Objectors to losing All Saints tried to appeal to the Privy Council. An attempt to hand it to the Churches Conservation Trust failed, because the trust did not have the money to take it on. Now, it is on the market. Cluttons is inviting any reasonable proposal for a new use, subject to consent from the local council, English Heritage and the Church Commissioners. No price is set. The sale could be freehold or leasehold. Grants may be available. Special care must be taken not to disturb interred human remains. The alternative to vesting in a trust is conversion or demolition. But knocking down listed churches and chapels is bound to meet resistance from councils, conservation bodies and, often, the non-churchgoing community. Converting churches is tricky. As potential homes, they do not subdivide well. It needs ingenuity to make them good places in which to live. Happier adaptations are as studios, workshops, restaurants or concert halls. Such uses make the most of their generous proportions and are popular with planning officers as they maintain the 'integrity' of the building. Unfortunately, the pews which are often part of that integrity will almost certainly be discarded. In North Dorset, the council's conservation officer hopes to produce a list of buildings at risk, to elicit sympathetic buyers. He has submitted the names of several buildings to SAVE Britain's Heritage, a pressure group which publishes a similar list entitled 'Stop This Rot: A Collection of Buildings to Restore in England &amp; Wales', at Pounds 10.95. One building in Dorset is a wooden chapel built like a wooden barn. If repaired, it would continue in its present use holding farm machinery. The Unitarian church, in Gosditch Street, Cirencester, Glos, is in such a desperate state that the council has served a repairs notice on the church trustees - the first step to a compulsory purchase order. It could prove a bargain for a sympathetic new owner. But, as with all church and chapel conversions, the price depends on the terms of the planning consent. It can be hard work to define a new use, as architect Richard Pedlar of Bristol has found with the United Reformed Church at Blakeney, Glos, on the edge of the Forest of Dean. This handsome late Georgian building has been on the market for seven years, although he has had it brought inside the local conservation area and its listing has been upgraded, which means closer supervision of changes by English Heritage and the council. This should improve its chances of grant aid. His hope is that the Youth Hostels Association will take it, but local support is vital for the success of such a scheme. The structure and function of churches and chapels is what makes them so hard to adapt. Their main job has been as meeting places. The easiest churches to turn into housing are medieval and Georgian, as they are built in the domestic tradition. The most difficult are Victorian - usually great barns of churches with high windows. Yet these - often marooned in the middle of slum clearance sites and new traffic schemes - are the most available. In Fellows Road, London NW3, Winkworth in St John's Wood is selling a converted four-bedroom chapel, complete with gallery, for Pounds 395,000 (down from Pounds 475,000). Its Highgate office offers a splendid flat that makes full use of the stained glass windows in the former United Reformed Church. Priced at Pounds 340,000, and now called Cloisters Court, it is on the corner of Cromwell Avenue and Hornsey Lane, London N6. Former Georgian chapels are for sale at Brockenhurst, Hants (Wood, Pounds 140,000), and Blockley, Glos (Jackson-Stops, Pounds 260,000, down from Pounds 285,000). Using grants from the government (70 per cent) and the Church Commissioners (30 per cent) the Churches Conservation Trust (formerly the Redundant Churches Fund) takes only a very few redundant churches, and these must be of architectural distinction. In June it was sheltering 291 churches. The dioceses shelter a few more, as do the Friends of Friendless Churches. In June 1993 the Historic Chapels Trust was launched. To date it has two chapels and is negotiating for another nine. English Heritage funds 70 per cent of overheads and eligible repairs to the chapels. The chapels trust must raise the rest privately, but hopes that an agreement with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool for the presbytery and chapel of St Benet, Netherton, Merseyside, will set an example. The Archdiocese will pay for 30 per cent of the repairs to the group of buildings. The most unusual former church on the market is the mostly 14th century St Michael and All Angels, now Old Church House, on the Grand Union Canal at Grove, Bucks (Cole Flatt, Pounds 280,000). The owners converted it 20 years ago out of the smallest church in the county. It has two bedrooms and many medieval fittings. Are you ready to live beside a graveyard?

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Concession over medicines bill A BILL to increase information on the safety of medicines yesterday cleared another parliamentary hurdle after its sponsor - Mr Giles Radice, the Labour MP for Durham North - agreed to changes designed to address pharmaceutical industry concerns. The Medicines Information Bill will now move to its Commons report stage in April. But the government's ambivalent attitude still means that it is far from certain to become law. Speaking after yesterday's proceedings, Mr Peter Lumley, director of public affairs at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said: 'The bill as it now stands is not anywhere near as formidable a problem for the industry as it was when first printed.' Yesterday's breakthrough came when Mr Radice agreed to withdraw clauses that would have given consumers the right of access to information held by drug licencing authorities on the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines, subject to certain restrictions.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Major faces fresh leadership crisis: Tory call in House for PM to quit - EU voting deal angers government backbenchers Mr John Major faced a fresh crisis of confidence in his leadership last night after a compromise deal with Britain's European Union partners over voting rights came under fierce attack on the Conservative back benches. The bitter end to the row which had threatened to hold up the entry of four new countries to the Union raised further doubts over whether the prime minister can survive expected heavy Tory defeats in this summer's mid-term elections. Mr Major strongly defended the new EU voting arrangements, which combine an increase in the number of votes required to block legislation with provision for delaying contentious directives. He insisted also that Britain had won assurances that the European Commission would not seek to use health and safety legislation to bypass the government's opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. That claim was disputed by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, who said he had 'simply clarified the programme of the Commission for the present year.' Amid deep gloom among government supporters, one maverick Tory MP, Mr Tony Marlow, stunned the House of Commons by charging that the deal had stripped Mr Major of his authority and demanding he resign. Despite Mr Marlow's long-standing reputation as a rebel and an eccentric, it was the first time in more than 50 years that a fellow Tory had called in the Commons in such blunt terms for the prime minister of the day to stand down. As Mr Major set out the terms of the deal, hostile Eurosceptics were joined by usually loyal centrist MPs in attacking them as a retreat from the position staked out only last week. With pro-Europeans also condemning Mr Major's handling of the row, Westminster was swept with a new wave of speculation about a challenge to his leadership later in the year. The compromise, which provides Britain with limited voting safeguards when Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway join the Union next year, won overwhelming endorsement in the cabinet. If it had been rejected, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, would have considered resigning from the cabinet. But four rightwing cabinet ministers - Mr Michael Howard, Mr Michael Portillo, Mr Peter Lilley and Mr John Redwood - privately backed the widespread view among Tory MPs that Mr Major should have held out for a better deal. The cabinet 'bastards' as they were once referred to by Mr Major after the Tory civil war over the Maastricht treaty did not force a formal vote on the issue. But with Mr Portillo particularly forceful in pressing the case for rejection, they argued that the agreement did not give Britain adequate legal protection. One suggested that Mr Major call a heads of government meeting to press for a better deal. Mr Hurd countered by telling his colleagues that Britain's EU partners would not give further ground. Ministers said that in those circumstances the cabinet split 18-4 in favour of the deal. Facing derision from Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, and Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Major gave an uncertain Commons performance in defence of the deal. Amid silence on the Tory back benches he stressed that Britain now had a firm commitment from the rest of the Union for a 'root-and-branch' reform of the voting system in the planned 1996 intergovernmental conference. Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said later the assurances from Brussels on social policy meant the UK would be excluded from the provisions of three new directives - on workplace discrimination, part-time working and parental leave for employees. But Commission officials rebuffed any suggestion that Britain had received guarantees that the new voting arrangements would not lead to social policy proposals unpalatable to the UK. 'We are not going to let them imply that there is a trade-off in social policy,' one Commission official said. Wrath of Eurosceptics, Page 7 Observer, Page 21</p>

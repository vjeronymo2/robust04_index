			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Shokorev, from the All-Russia Center for </F> the Study of Public Opinion, under the "Survey" rubric: "The  Population Denied Confidence Neither to the Premier, Nor to  Yegor Gaydar"]    [Text] The population's first reaction to the government  crisis, or more precisely, to Yegor Gaydar's quitting the post  of vice premier, was indifference. This sense prevails over all  others in a little bit more than a third of those polled. It  can be added that some 10 percent found it hard to answer the  question on what they felt about Yegor Gaydar's quitting.  Anxiety was experienced by 18 percent, distress by 15 percent.  The main feeling in 17 percent was satisfaction, and if one  takes into account the fact that nearly half of them are  supporters of communists and national patriots, that feeling is  quite deep.    The answers to the question on confidence in some political  leaders asked in the same All-Russia Center for the Study of  Public Opinion survey can be divided into two parts: the number  of those who answered or did not answer the question on trusting  a political leader, and the correlation between trusting and  mistrusting. The first parameter seems to be as significant as  the second one. Whereas the trust-mistrust balance is in the  positive area, with more than half the respondents unable to say  what they thought about the leaders, the result obtained seems  to be doubtful.    The trust-mistrust correlation and the known-unknown degree  for all the leaders are represented below [diagram omitted].  The group of Grigoriy Yavlinskiy-Viktor Chernomyrdin-Boris  Yeltsin-Yegor Gaydar is unified by the rather high degree of  their being "well- known." The distribution of views about  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy evinces what can be termed as the  "Yavlinskiy phenomenon." He is trusted by twice as many people  as those who do not trust him; nearly 35 percent, however, did  not say what they thought about him.    The prime minister's position appears to be ideal in the  positive area with a rather low share of those who found the  question hard to answer. The poll, however, had been conducted  even before the final composition of the government was  announced. The Boris Yeltsin- Yegor Gaydar crew remained in the  minds of the respondents for some time after 20 January.  Despite Mr. Gaydar's resignation, his name remains associated  with the president's course.    The other group is Andrey Kozyrev-Boris Fedorov. They are  united by a positive trust-mistrust correlation, and a big  number of those who found the question hard to answer. Vladimir  Shumeyko and Anatoliy Chubays are found in the negative area  with approximately the same number of those who assessed their  activities.    Two figures -- Gennadiy Burbulis and Gennadiy Zyuganov --  are  found separately, and way below them is Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  whose scandalous fame makes him known to a great number of  respondents. Only 17 percent trust him, however, while 63  percent do not. Way down on the extreme right of the scale is  newly elected State Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin. The number of  those who did not answer the question on trusting him is  two-thirds of those polled, whereas the trust-mistrust  correlation lies in the negative area.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |trust             |do not trust      |hard to say       |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, May 26 (XINHUA) -- The 3rd International  Textile and Garment Machinery Exhibition (ITGME'94) was opened  here today.    Taking part in the show, which lasts to May 30, are more  than  182 textile and garment machinery producers and suppliers from  20 countries and regions, such as Denmark, France, Germany, Hong  Kong, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, China, the United Kingdom  and the United States.    The exhibitors are showing their high-tech weaving,  spinning,  knitting, dyeing and printing, sewing, embroidery, pressing,  finishing and other relevant machineries.    This important exhibition will also provide the customers  with the latest information regarding the latest innovation in  textile and garment machineries.    In his written speech, Indonesian Minister of Industry  Tungky  Ariwibowo said that this exhibition will be a useful means  linking manufacturers and customers for exchanging of  information on market and technology.    The textile and garment industry has developed rapidly in  Indonesia for the last few years, becoming one of the pillars of  the country's economy besides oil and gas.    The export income from the industry jumped from 4,000  million  U.S. dollars in 1991 to 6,000 million U.S. dollars in 1992.  With a slight decline, the export earning of textile and  garment in 1993 maintained at 5,900 million U.S. dollars.    The comparatively weak competitive power of Indonesia's  textile products is reportedly the main reason for the drop.  Therefore, the textile industry in the country is in urgent  need of modernization of equipments, so as to raise productive  efficiency and upgrading of products.    According to data from the Ministry of Industry, the import  volumes of textile and garment machinery in 1990, 1991 and 1992  were 970 million, 1,372 million and 530 million U.S. dollars,  respectively, while that for January to October in 1993 period  was 450 million dollars.    Xu Jinchang, head of the Chinese delegation, which is the  biggest one in the exhibition, told XINHUA that China-made  textile and garment machineries in the medium level are suitable  for the Indonesian market.    The Chinese businessmen would like to use this exhibition as  an opportunity to make extensive contacts with their Indonesian  counterparts and exchange information and experiences with them  to promote bilateral cooperation in the field of textile and  garment machinery industry.</p>

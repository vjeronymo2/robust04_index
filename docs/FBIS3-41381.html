			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, February 18 (BTA) -- Last year the National  Investigative Service specialized department carried out  investigations in 70 cases involving the trafficking and pushing  of about 600 kg of heroin and some 80 kg of marijuana.  According to department head Vladimir Stoykov, drug traffickers  and pushers can hardly be convicted because under the operating  law the harm inflicted on society is measured by the cost of the  narcotics sold or seized.    In comparison to those prevailing in Western countries, the  price of narcotic substances in Bulgaria is low. A kilogramme  of crack sells at 260,000 leva (about U.S.$7,000), while the  pure narcotic cost twice as much. A shot of 0.25g is sold for  450-500 leva in the Bulgarian black market, Mr. Stoykov said.  Given those cheap prices, in terms of value the damages caused  by drug trafficking and pushing fall under the title of petty  offences, and as offenders are usually careful to keep under the  limits set by the law, it is impossible to impose harder  punishment on them, he went on to say. Mr. Stoychev pointed out  that traffickers smuggling 30-40 kg of heroin had received four  or five years in prison. Stressing that courts often release  arrested traffickers on bail, Mr. Stoykov said that the National  Investigative Service had no information about the number of  convicted offenders.    A great number of drug pushers are amateurs who cannot  assess  the purity of the narcotic overdosing it sometimes. Hence the  danger of a lethal outcome drug abusers are exposed to,  overdosing caused the death of seven drug addicts in Sofia last  year, Mr. Stoychev said.    Drug abuse became a serious problem in Bulgaria two or three  years ago. Though the drug traffic from Asia to Western Europe  passed through Bulgaria, the cases of pushing narcotics were few  until then. Over the last few years drug pushing in this  country has been on the rise. The number of drug addicts on  record has gone up from about 3,000-4,000 to more than 20,000,  as recent statistics show. Some 25 percent of pupils in Sofia  have tried or are taking drugs now, Minister of the Interior  Viktor Mikhaylov told the National Assembly some time ago.    Starting with glue-sniffing, 13-year-old children then take  to heroin, Col. Slava Koeva, chief inspector at the Criminal  Police of the Sofia Directorate of the Interior, told  headmasters of Sofia schools yesterday. In her opinion,  homeless and stray children are most susceptible to drug abuse.  According to a survey conducted by the Institute of Criminology  and Criminal Law with the Interior Ministry, 21.2 percent of  juvenile delinquents are substance abusers and 16.5 percent are  drug addicts, Col. Koeva said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["REUTER/YONHAP report from Vienna"] </F>   [Text] On 17 May one official at the North Korean Embassy  in Vienna said that news reports that North Korea has already  begun replacing fuel rods of the 5 megawatt nuclear reactor in  Yongbyon are not true.    He said that news reports that used nuclear fuel rods have  already been removed for installment of new ones are contrary to  the truth. But, he hinted that preparatory work to replace  nuclear fuel rods at the Yongbyon nuclear reactor may have begun  by now. He added: "We do not know whether nuclear fuel rods are  being replaced. But, it, if any, may be preparatory work. It  takes two months to replace nuclear fuel rods."    In the meantime, the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] said that a team to inspect North Korea's nuclear  facilities went to Yongbyon via Pyongyang on 18 May.    The inspection team will conduct inspections of the nuclear  reprocessing facilities--whose inspections were held in check by  the North Korean side last March--and will examine the  surveillance camera installed at the nearby nuclear reactor.  The IAEA side pointed out that such an examination alone can  find out whether fuel rods at the nuclear reactor have been  replaced or not.</p>

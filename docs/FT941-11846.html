			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Long leash for a runaway economy: China's reforms are deepening but inflation is a persistent and worrying threat Chinese leaders might have reason for self-congratulation as they prepare for the annual Spring Festival holiday with a new batch of economic reforms in place. But worries about inflation, an overheating economy and unrest among peasants and industrial workers are casting a shadow over the celebrations. In the Year of the Dog, which begins on Thursday of next week, the leadership's greatest challenge will almost certainly be to wring inflation out of a surging economy while consolidating fiscal and monetary reform. Failure to counter the prices spiral would risk further social distress, especially in industrial towns and cities where workers in faltering state industries are suffering considerable hardship. For Mr Zhu Rongji, the senior vice-premier in charge of the economy, the Chinese new year brings mixed blessings: financial reform is deepening but inflation is casting a worrying shadow. He cannot be complacent about achieving his oft-stated wish of a 'soft landing' for an economy which, judging by the latest industrial production statistics, is continuing to defy efforts to rein it in. Industrial output in December grew by an astonishing 29.8, according to the State Statistical Bureau, an increase of 11 per cent over November's rate of growth. This acceleration surprised western economists in Beijing, and indicates a quicker-than-expected response from industry to an easing of credit restrictions in the last quarter of 1993. Accompanying the burst in economic activity has been an increase in prices. In December, the cost of living rose by an annualised 23.9 per cent in the leading urban centres, compared with 21.9 per cent for the 12 months to November. In response, the leadership gave a clear sign last weekend that it is anxious to curb a rampant economy. China's state council, or cabinet, said it would not approve new investments in fixed assets this year beyond existing projects. More than anything else, the capital spending spree has contributed to unsustainable economic growth rates. In 1993, fixed asset investment - in activities such as the construction of economic development zones - grew by 47 per cent to Yuan115bn (Dollars 13.3bn) compared with the previous year. This year's capital spending target of Yuan131bn represents a 14 per cent increase on last year, although the state council decree may herald a lower increase. But Mr Zhu and his colleagues know they must be careful at a time of increasing unemployment - particularly in urban areas - not to apply the brakes too harshly. 'What we want is a soft landing while the growth rate is gradually lowered. If we drastically reduced the growth rate, we would have to pay the cost of social stability,' Mr Zhu told Business Week magazine recently. Western officials in Beijing are giving the leadership the benefit of the doubt about gradually bringing the economy under control. 'I do see positive developments,' said the representative of an international bank. 'There has been a switch in policy from emphasis on growth at all costs to stability and consolidation. 'While they are entering the new year on the back of strong economic activity, the trend for this year as a whole will be towards lower growth,' he added. Mr Zhu and his colleagues have set a growth target of 9 per cent for the year, down from 12.8 per cent in 1993. But western economists doubt this target is attainable. One worrying development for the leadership is that cost of living increases in politically sensitive rural areas - peasants are in a sour mood about low returns and high input costs - are catching up with those in urban centres. In 1993, the national average increase in the cost of living was 14.5 per cent: the rise was 15.7 per cent in the 35 main urban centres against 13.3 per cent in the countryside. In the past few years, the difference in the cost of living between country and city has halved to about 2 per cent. The authorities cannot afford to ignore threats to public order in a fractious countryside. Surplus labour among the peasant population is estimated at between 150m and 200m, and more than 200 incidents of rural unrest were reported last year. While the grain harvest in 1993 was bountiful, some hard-pressed farmers witheld grain they were obliged to sell to the state in protest at low prices and rising seed and fertiliser costs. These protests, which coincided with reports that the state was about to raise the price of compulsorily acquired grain, spurred a round of panic buying by consumers and steep price increases late last year. Local authorities were obliged to dump government stocks of grain onto the market and, in some cases, to introduce ceilings to dampen a price spiral. In light of restiveness over price increases, the authorities have redoubled efforts to curb monetary growth, with Mr Zhu demanding strict controls on new credit at a national bankers' conference in Beijing late last month. 'You should not surpass these (loan) limits by even one cent,' said Mr Zhu, who is also central bank governor. Money supply figures for the fourth quarter last year have not yet dribbled out of the Chinese bureaucracy. But they will almost certainly show a sharp rise over the quarter to the end of September, as a panicky government loosened the purse strings in response to urgent pleas from state industries whose supplies of credit had been choked off. The rate of M1 growth, the broader measure of monetary growth, had fallen sharply from 34.2 per cent in June last year to 20.4 per cent in September after a mid-year 16-point austerity programme. Banks were obliged to recall loans for speculative activities, and new credit was squeezed tight. Now, the Chinese economic reform programme faces a crucial year, in the view of western officials. There is no question the leadership has set itself an extraordinarily ambitious programme. It includes sweeping reforms of banking, trade and of foreign exchange management. But the most difficult challenges will be reforms to the tax system and state enterprises. Tax changes are to include a complex new revenue-sharing arrangement between Beijing and the provinces, along with a value-added tax (VAT) system that would challenge the most sophisticated tax authorities. A western banker said he doubted there were half a dozen officials in the tax bureau who fully understood the new regime. But Mr Zhu insists the government will muddle through. Senior officials say tax reform will probably take about five years to implement and perfect. And Chinese and foreign businesses would seem to be justified in their apprehension about dealing with the tax authorities in what promises to be a chaotic initial phase. Reform of crumbling state enterprises poses huge problems, and plans to tackle this vexed issue are murky. Officials have announced 100 enterprises will be singled out for a process of corporatisation - a Chinese half-way house to privatisation in which enterprises are detached from state control  -but results are likely to be patchy, judging by past efforts. The main question before policymakers this year will be the extent to which they have to compromise on their central task of fighting inflation. The views expressed by the World Bank in October hold good today. 'A premature loosening of monetary policy at the present time could jeopardise the hard-fought early gains on inflation and trigger a re-emergence of high inflationary expectations,' wrote the bank's chief economist in Beijing. Reforms are being implemented rapidly, but in the absence of low inflation, Mr Zhu and his colleagues are continuing to live dangerously. They cannot afford to ignore threats posed by inflation or signs of social unrest both in the countryside and in urban centres. But there is limited room to manoeuvre between what is politically expedient and the need to maintain strict controls on monetary growth. Mr Zhu has shown he is prepared to risk strong opposition to his austerity programme, but he cannot be sure that he will prevail.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Guyana President threatens legal challenge to election results PRESIDENT Desmond Hoyte of Guyana has threatened a legal challenge to the results of the elections on Monday which his People's National Congress party lost to the People's Progressive party of Dr Cheddi Jagan, Canute James reports from Georgetown. Dr Jagan, 74, a former Marxist who now advocates a market economy, is to be sworn in as president at the weekend. He has promised to name a cabinet representative of both the sometimes antagonistic ethnic groups in the country, those of Indian and African descent. Mr Hoyte, although saying his party accepted the result for the time being, added that it did so 'without prejudice' to its right to approach the courts for adjudication on 'administrative and other irregularities during the elections'. However, foreign monitors called the poll free and fair. One of them, former US President Jimmy Carter, said the result should be accepted by all parties.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Newman Tonks sees benefits of changes Newman Tonks, the architectural hardware group, emerged from a spell of extensive reorganisation with a sharp increase in pre-tax profits for the year to December 31. Profits were Pounds 15.8m, against Pounds 4.36m, restated for FRS 3, for the 14 months to December 1992 as the group changed its year-end. The comparable figure was depressed by provisions of Pounds 6.81m for the sale or closure of unwanted subsidiaries. There was an exceptional credit this time of Pounds 266,000, being the losses on disposals offset by the release of provisions. Earnings per share were 7.6p, compared with losses of 0.65p. With the exceptional items stripped out, earnings were 7.38p, against 5.22p. In line with the intention, announced last September, of bringing dividends more closely into line with earnings, the proposed final is 3.67p, for a total of 6.2p, against 9.3p. The previous total was a factor in lifting gearing to 39 per cent at the year end, against 29 per cent 12 months earlier. Turnover was Pounds 257.6m (Pounds 266.5m), including Pounds 730,000 (Pounds 7.55m) from discontinued activities and Pounds 6.95m from acquisitions. Operating profits were Pounds 17m (Pounds 12.1m), with continuing activities showing a 17 per cent advance. The rise reflected the revival of demand in the US and the continued strength of the locks and security businesses. COMMENT Newman Tonks has been through a bridging year. The main costs of reorganisation were taken in 1992 but recovery of demand in its main markets, the US excepted, is for this year or perhaps 1995. Once that recovery does come, then lower costs and the results of investment, which continues at Pounds 8m a year, should have a quick effect on the bottom line. In other words, the group is ready to ride up the cycle to pre-tax profits of, perhaps, about Pounds 19m this year. This would give earnings per share of 10.5p which, at yesterday's price of 169p, puts the shares on a prospective multiple of 16 and suggests that, general market conditions permitting, they have a distance yet to run.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergio Malbergier] </F>   [Text] The British Government Export Credit Guarantee  Department (ECGD) announced yesterday that it has reopened  credit coverage of exports to Brazil, which had been suspended  in 1983.    The measure was a consequence of Brazil's renegotiation of  its foreign debt with banks and "the encouraging progress of the  stabilization program," an ECGD communique says.    Michael Heseltine, secretary of state for trade and  industry,  said: "The resumption of the ECGD coverage of exports to Brazil  will provide new opportunities for British companies."    "Brazil is the ninth largest economy in the world, and it  will be even more open now that the effects of the debt crisis  will begin to decrease," Heseltine said in a communique.    The coverage of credits was suspended in 1983 due to  Brazil's  delays in paying its debt. The coverage was resumed in 1989,  but it was again suspended following new Brazilian delays with  its debt.    The ECGD said that it would concentrate on covering private  companies, particularly in areas that will encourage the  rehabilitation of the country's economy.    Douglas Hurd, secretary of state for foreign and  commonwealth  affairs, visited Brazil at the beginning of April with a  delegation of entrepreneurs. On that occasion he said that the  United Kingdom wanted to increase economic relations between the  two countries.</p>

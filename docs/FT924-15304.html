			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ramco Oil in Azerbaijan deal Ramco Oil Services, in partnership with Pennzoil company of Houston, has signed an oil production agreement with the Azerbaijan authorities which the Aberdeen-based oil services company says will have a 'very significant impact' on its performance next year. Subsidiary Ramco Energy and Pennzoil have won rights to develop the Guneshli Field in the South Caspian Sea which has an estimated 1.4bn barrels of recoverable oil remaining. Ramco will take 10 per cent of the profits until Pennzoil has recovered development costs, after which Ramco's share will rise to 17.5 per cent.</p>

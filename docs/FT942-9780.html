			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Chemical Bank expands in mortgages with Dollars 330m deal Chemical Banking is to acquire Margaretten Financial, a New Jersey-based mortgage banking company, for Dollars 25 a share, or a total of Dollars 330m in cash. The acquisition of Margaretten is part of Chemical's strategy to build on its nationwide consumer financial services business, and become a bigger force in the business of originating home mortgages, and servicing existing mortgages. For banks in the mortgage industry, a servicing business can help offset the negative impact on origination volume of rising interest rates, as well as produce a steady stream of fee income. After the acquisition is completed, probably by mid-summer, Chemical will be the fourth-largest originator of mortgages in the US, with volume of about Dollars 26.3bn, and the fourth-largest company servicing mortgage loans, with volume of about Dollars 54.5bn. Mr Felix Beck, chairman of Margaretten, said of the deal: 'We believe this transaction provides our shareholders with the enhanced value we have been seeking since our initial public offering in January 1992.' The New Jersey company, which has 78 retail offices and 11 wholesale offices in 25 states, was a subsidiary of the diversified financial services group Primerica before going public in 1992 through a share issue. That issue valued the company at just over Dollars 300m. Last year, Margaretten reported revenues of Dollars 245m, but made only a small profit. This was because a rise in the number of customers refinancing their mortgages forced it to increase amortisation charges in order to write down the value of some portfolios. News of the deal was fairly well received on Wall Street. Shares in Margaretten, which have fallen as low as Dollars 12 3/8 in the past year, rose Dollars 1 3/4 to close at Dollars 24 5/8 , while Chemical stock rose in morning trade before closing unchanged at Dollars 33 3/8 .</p>

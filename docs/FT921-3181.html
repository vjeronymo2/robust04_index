			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (4): Spending peg untenable - Ministers pleading for debt relief are told to clean up the budget act WHEN NIGERIAN ministers argue their case for debt relief and access to concessional funds, they are bluntly told that until they clean up their budget act, they cannot expect a sympathetic hearing. Nigeria's opaque, convoluted and inefficient fiscal system runs counter to the new-found donor criteria of accountability and transparency. Funds are fungible, and donors want to know where and how their aid - or debt relief - is being used. The 1992 budget is not exempt from this criticism. In his presentation, President Ibrahim Babangida forecast foreign currency revenues of Dollars 8.9bn; but budget and planning minister Chu Okongwu predicts earnings of Dollars 10.4bn. Keeping track of revenue and expenditure is almost impossible. The 1992 budget estimates last year's deficit at N19.5bn (Dollars 1.9bn), but within weeks of this figure being released the Central Bank of Nigeria published its estimate showing a N33bn shortfall. This 70 per cent discrepancy between two estimates, prepared within weeks of one another, merely compounds donor frustration. A year ago, the government tabled a balanced budget with expenditure of N38.6bn funded by expected revenues of N38.8bn. The reality was very different. Spending was 76 per cent above target at N68bn, while revenue fell almost 10 per cent below budget, resulting in a deficit of N32.9bn. Apart from the N3.7bn revenue shortfall, the deficit was largely the result of substantially higher-than-forecast debt-service payments. External debt-service was N18.7bn above budget, accounting for 57 per cent of the deficit. Last year's budget had assumed debt relief similar to that achieved in earlier reschedulings, but the actual outcome was less favourable. While roughly half the oil revenue accrues to the state and local governments, the federal government remains responsible for their debts. During 1990-91, it tried to collect debt-service payments from the state governments, but this is a slow process, given disagreements over the amounts, exacerbated by the creation of the nine new states. Furthermore, as economic performance began to slip behind IMF-stipulated targets, so aid inflows slowed. The 1991 deficit was partly funded by drawings from the various stabilisation accounts built up by the government since 1989. These accounts were designed to sterilise 'windfall' inflows of oil revenues, resulting from higher-than-budgeted prices and exports. Because half the stabilisation revenue belongs to the state and local governments, the federal government has been unable to control their spending, some of which was incurred in preparation for state and local government elections. At the end of last year, these stabilisation balances amounted to some N32bn, and when the federal government receives its share along with loan repayments from state governments, the actual deficit is likely to be approximately N15bn, or 5 per cent of gross domestic product. This year promises to be far more difficult on the revenue side, though  - as usual - the ministry of finance bases its revenue projections on an extremely conservative exchange rate forecast of N9.5 to the dollar. The 1992 budget assumes oil production of 1.8m barrels a day, and exports of 1.43m b/d, with a selling price of Dollars 21 a barrel. Opec quota-cuts and depressed oil prices suggest that not only will there be no windfall this year, but that oil revenue could turn out to be substantially lower than the projected N79bn. Much will hinge on the exchange rate; by last week this had fallen to N18 to the dollar which makes a nonsense of the budget arithmetic. Should the naira settle at around N15 to the dollar this year, as some bankers expect, then oil revenues should still stay ahead of budget, even if the price averages Dollars 17 a barrel. Unfortunately, however, naira depreciation is a double-edged sword, because it will also mean significantly higher external debt-service payments. On these assumptions, the budget remains in surplus provided non-oil revenue holds up and public spending targets are met. The N8bn in extra revenue is almost enough to cover a N9bn rise in external debt-service costs. At the end of the day, neither scenario is likely to apply. There are bound to be spending overruns, if only because inflation is now increasing rapidly; and while there will be a beneficial fiscal drag effect on revenue, the impact on spending will be substantially greater. The budget assumption that public spending (excluding debt-service) can be pegged at 1991 levels, at a time when inflation could well average 30 per cent, is clearly untenable. Unless the government gets a tighter grip on public spending than in 1990-91, the danger is that the incoming civilian administration will find itself saddled with a sizeable 1992 deficit. Almost before it gets its feet under the table, it will be forced either to cut public spending dramatically - which will be politically impossible - or to find new sources of revenue. In his final budget, President Babangida outlined proposals for tax reform, including the introduction in 1994 of a modified value-added tax; but far more will be needed, especially on the revenue administration side, to provide a broader fiscal base, reducing dependence on oil.  ------------------------------------------------------------------                         BUDGET 1991-92 (NBN)  ------------------------------------------------------------------                    1991 budget     1991 actual   1992 budget  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Revenue               38.8            35.1          54.0 Expenditure           36.8            68.0          52.0 Surplus (deficit)      0.2           (32.9)          2.0 % of GDP               -             (11.4)          0.6 External debt-Svc     16.6            35.3          21.7  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Central Bank of Nigeria and 1992 Budget  ------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------              ALTERNATIVE BUDGET                SCENARIO* (NBN)  ---------------------------------------------               1992       1992              budget   alternative                        scenario  --------------------------------------------- Revenue        54         62 Expenditure    52         61 Surplus         2          1  --------------------------------------------- * The alternative scenario assumes an oil price of Dollars 17 a barrel, production of 1.60m b/d and a naira/dollar exchange rate of N14  --------------------------------------------- Source: FT statistics  ---------------------------------------------</p>

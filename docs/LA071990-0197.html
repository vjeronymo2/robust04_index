			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> MEETING TONIGHT ON RECYCLING PROJECT  </P> <P> A town meeting will be held tonight to offer information about Recycle Anaheim,  the city's curbside recycling program, which will begin citywide service next  month.  </P> <P> Residents have been mailed information on the program, but organizers said the  town meeting -- featuring a video presentation -- would help encourage  participation.  </P> <P> The program, administered by Anaheim Disposal Inc., which handles the city's  trash collection, began as a pilot plan last September at 11,000 households  throughout the city. Officials say the trial program was able to divert more  than 3,000 tons of recyclable refuse from Orange County landfills during the  first 10 months, and its success encouraged them to take the program citywide.  </P> <P> The town meeting is at 7 p.m. at Canyon High School, 220 S. Imperial Highway.  LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

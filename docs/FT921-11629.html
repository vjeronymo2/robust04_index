			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Intangibles The issue of goodwill and brands in UK balance sheets is starting to rumble again. Today, the new Accounting Standards Board has its first session on the topic. Earlier this week, a detailed study backed by the UK's leading finance directors pressed for the valuation of intangibles. The battery of techniques is becoming ever more complex and more lucrative for its practitioners. In terms of basic principle, it is all built on sand. Brand valuation is open to at least two fundamental objections. First, a brand name has different values in different hands. The Savoy name would be worth rather more to Mr Rocco Forte than it would be attached to a boarding house in Blackpool. Second, all brand valuations are based on applying a multiple to the brand's cash flow or earnings. As Mr David Damant of MAP Securities argues, international accounting theory now says that accounts are there to allow the user to judge future cash flows. If assets are valued on the basis of future cash flows in the first place, the process becomes circular. Much of the stimulus for the debate came from the Rowntree takeover, which was taken to show that Rowntree's brands constituted hidden value. A more up-to-date example might be the now worthless Maxwell Communication, whose latest accounts showed net assets of Pounds 1.3bn thanks to intangibles valued at Pounds 2.9bn. It might be objected that Mr Robert Maxwell's accounting practices were scarcely typical: but it is just such cases which call for conservative accounting standards. In other countries besides the UK, the rationale of the balance sheet has become a matter of deep confusion. In the UK, there is a pragmatic solution: that the company making an acquisition should simply record the purchase as an asset at full cost. The tangible assets would then be depreciated and the balance checked annually for diminution of value. This would avoid the rooted objection of British companies to amortising goodwill. In that respect, it would go against international practice and perhaps the EC's Fourth Directive on company law. If that could somehow be addressed, the whole nonsense about brands could go out of the window.</p>

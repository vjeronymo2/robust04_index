			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 13 Jun (NA) -- This week, Economy  Minister Domingo Cavallo will face a new offensive by the  governors, who are demanding changes in the system of federal  income sharing and object to the import of subsidized  agricultural products and the transfer of provincial pension  funds to the nation.    These issues, which concern ruling party governors as much  as  opposition governors, will be analyzed in two meetings in Santa  Fe and Buenos Aires on 14 and 16 June respectively.    Santa Fe will be the location for a meeting of the so-called  "club of friendly governors," which was born last week when  Entre Rios Governor Carlos Moine convened a meeting with his  counterparts at the Constituent Assembly to discuss the national  economic plan and its repercussions on the regional economies.  Santa Fe Governor Carlos Reutemann abruptly decided to broaden  the club's coverage and invited all governors without exception  to continue discussing their problems.    One of the governors' proposals will be difficult for  Cavallo's team to swallow, as the provincial executive branches  want all taxes collected in the nation entered into the revenue  coffer and then want an equitable share of it, that is, 50  percent for the central administration and 50 percent for the  provinces.    Reutemann trusts that all governors, except Eduardo Angeloz  of Cordoba, will come to the meeting. Rodolfo Gabrielli  (Mendoza), Horacio Massaccesi (Rio Negro), Carlos Maestro  (Chubut), Jose Estabillo (Tierra del Fuego), and Juan Carlos  Rojas (San Juan) have already confirmed their participation.    Besides the above-mentioned revenue sharing percentages, the  governors of provinces bordering neighboring countries, such as  Mendoza, Entre Rios, and Rio Negro, among others, continue to be  concerned about the consequences of imported, subsidized  agricultural products to local producers.    On 16 June, Cavallo will participate in the third meeting  between national government officials and northern provincial  governors to try to convince governors of the benefits of  transferring their pension funds to the nation.    During the first meeting, 15 days ago, there was no  agreement  despite the efforts of Cavallo, presidential Secretary General  Eduardo Bauza, and Social Security Secretary Walter Schulthess.    The second meeting, held last week, was purely technical. On  that occasion the provincial economy and finance ministers met  with Schulthess. The ministers also disagreed with Schulthess,  and the negative positions started to become official.    The provinces of Entre Rios, Formosa, and Misiones have  already notified the nation that they will not transfer their  pension funds. According to Schulthess, Cordoba has already  refused; the five Patagonian provinces, where pension funds so  far maintain surpluses, will also refuse to transfer their  pension funds.    On 16 June, the central government will use heavy ammunition  to try to convince the northern provinces' governors. They will  meet once more with Bauza and Cavallo in the Buenos Aires  offices of the Federal Investments Council (CFI).</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / World Trade News: US 'risks selling off airline industry to foreign carriers' MR ROBERT Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, yesterday warned the US government it risked 'selling off the US airline industry' to foreign carriers if it approved the Dollars 750m (Pounds 460m) investment by British Airways in USAir without securing equal competitive opportunities in the UK for US airlines. His warning came amid growing signs that both the US and UK governments want to accelerate talks to liberalise air transport between the two countries, clearing the way for BA's acquisition of a 44 per cent stake in USAir. US and UK negotiators resumed talks in Washington yesterday in an apparent effort to reach an agreement before next week's US Presidential election. This has worried the big US carriers including American, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which are pressing their government not to rush into any compromise likely to undermine their competitive position against BA. In London yesterday, Mr Crandall said proposals tabled by both the US and UK were unacceptable because they did not provide equal opportunities for US carriers. Mr Crandall, who was due to hold talks yesterday with Mr John MacGregor, UK transport secretary, said any agreement should enable US carriers to have open access to London's Heathrow airport, including necessary landing slots to operate new services. 'What we are asking is simply to fly all the places where BA can fly,' he said. 'We want to fly a lot of long-haul services from the US into Heathrow and east of Heathrow in direct competition with BA.' The US and the UK are considering phasing in open skies in exchange for allowing BA to acquire its stake in USAir. Mr Crandall said air services between the two countries should be totally and immediately liberalised. American Airlines was not interested in acquiring a large stake in any European carrier because none could offer access to the same number of passengers as USAir would offer BA. 'The US domestic market accounts for 40 per cent of the world market.' He claimed the big three US carriers would collectively lose Dollars 500m a year in revenues if the BA-USAir deal went ahead without a balanced UK-US liberalisation agreement. 'Both our workers and our stockholders would suffer.'</p>

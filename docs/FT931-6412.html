			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / 'Timeshare' scheme piloted by Recharge North East REDUNDANT and retired managers are to be recruited for a 'timeshare' scheme piloted by Recharge North East, an initiative launched yesterday to help regenerate former coalfield areas in north-east England, Chris Tighe writes. Recharge will employ managers on part-time contracts, placing them in small and medium-sized enterprises on tasks aimed at assisting the companies to survive and grow. Recharge's director, Mr Danny Sharpe, a former deputy director of the Department of Trade and Industry in the region, said the scheme was needed because many smaller companies lacked spare management capacity to implement advice they were given. About 400 people have applied to advertisements in the region for the first batch of 12 'timeshare' managers. Those selected will be placed in companies, free of charge, for up to 10 days, possibly spread over many weeks. The Pounds 3m, three-year Recharge initiative is jointly funded by the DTI, British Coal Enterprise and the European Community's Rechar programme for declining mining areas. The initiative was announced in October after the government's decision to close 31 pits. Mr Sharpe insisted that setting up Recharge had not pre-empted final decisions on the threatened pits, but was designed to cushion the effect of losing 18,000 north-east coalfield jobs since 1982. Recharge will help smaller businesses improve marketing, identify those with greatest growth potential and recruit volunteer businessmen as mentors for small companies.</p>

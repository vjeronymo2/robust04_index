			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Total personal wealth up sharply since 1976 TOTAL personal wealth in the UK increased more than fivefold between 1976 and 1989, with occupational pensions taking a sharply increased share, according to government statistics. The total, including marketable wealth plus occupational and state pension rights, rose from Pounds 500bn to about Pounds 2,600bn over the period, the Central Statistical Office says in Economic Trends, published yesterday. Over the 13 years, there was little change in the overall distribution of the marketable wealth of individuals. The share of the top 1 per cent fell slightly, while that of the upper quartile increased a little. The top 1 per cent owned 21 per cent of the country's wealth in 1976, compared with 18 per cent in 1989. The top 25 per cent owned 71 per cent in 1976 and 75 per cent in 1989. Another study in Economic Trends shows London and the south-east continuing to have more than their fair share of the national economic cake, although they experienced below-average growth in 1990. Provisional figures for gross domestic product (GDP) per head of population showed wide variations throughout the country, with London at the top of the scale with Pounds 10,400 and the rest of the south-east with Pounds 9,300. The highest GDP per head outside the south-east in 1990 was East Anglia with Pounds 8,400, and the east Midlands with Pounds 8,100. The lowest was Northern Ireland, at Pounds 6,200 per head. The figures suggest a continuation of long-term trends, except that the south-east experienced below-average growth, while the Yorkshire and Humberside region appears to have grown more rapidly. Over the past 10 years there has been a significant variation in the economic performance of the regions. The growth in GDP was most rapid in East Anglia, followed by the rest of the south-east and the south-west. The north-west, north and Scotland have grown less strongly, and these regions contributed a lower proportion of UK total GDP in 1990 than 10 years earlier. London's position at the top of the GDP scale in 1989 at 148 per cent of the national average reflected not only the dominance of the capital as an industrial and commercial centre, but also the inclusion of commuters' earnings. The next-highest GDP per head in a study of areas was Berkshire at Pounds 9,500 (126 per cent of the average), Grampian Pounds 9,100 (120 per cent and Cambridgeshire and Surrey, both Pounds 8,400 (111 per cent). At the other end of the scale the GDP per head in Mid-Glamorgan was Pounds 5,400 (72 per cent of average), followed by Merseyside, Cornwall and Northern Ireland at just over Pounds 5,700 (76 per cent). A large swathe of northern England is emerging as Britain's most prosperous area, according to BWD Rensburg, the stockbroking group. Mr John Dyson, corporate services director, said yesterday a semi-rural 'northern playground' had emerged, covering an area from the Lake District in the west to North Yorkshire in the east. Disposable incomes were often as high or higher than in the most prosperous parts of the south, but lower unemployment, smaller mortgages on better property, lower indebtedness, and ease of travel made people feel better-off than their southern counterparts.

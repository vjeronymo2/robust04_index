			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AZZI GOES HOME AND STANFORD COMES AWAY WITH WOMEN'S TITLE  </P> <P> Accepting the award for most valuable player for leading her team to the  national championship -- Jennifer Azzi.  </P> <P> Who else?  </P> <P> The hometown girl, who left Oak Ridge, Tenn., four years ago only to return to  nearby Knoxville to finish her career before thousands of cheering fans, scored  17 points, had five assists and grabbed four rebounds in helping Stanford down  Auburn, 88-81.  </P> <P> The 5-foot-9 Azzi received a standing ovation from a record  national-championship crowd of 16,595 when she fouled out with with 1:28  remaining.  </P> <P> Shortly thereafter, she was atop the stand at mid-court in Thompson-Boling  arena Sunday with the award in her hand and a national championship ring on her  finger.  </P> <P> "I can't describe how I feel inside right now. All I know is that it feels  really good," Azzi said. "Katy (Steding) and I have played four years together,  and all in one moment all that hard work has paid off."  </P> <P> Apparently so. Azzi and fellow seniors Steding and Stacy Parson are credited  with leading the transformation of a 5-23 program into a 32-1 national  champion.  </P> <P> Auburn (28-7), with three consecutive unsuccessful tries in the title game,  kept up with the Cardinal for 20 minutes.  </P> <P> But after coming out of the locker room tied, 41-41, Stanford's quickness and  teamwork took its toll on Auburn's defensive press.  </P> <P> Center Trisha Stevens put the Cardinal ahead, 48-46, with a four-foot shot from  the lane with 17:32 left, and Stanford eventually built a lead that proved  insurmountable.  </P> <P> A six-foot hook by the 6-3 Stevens -- who finished with 16 points and 10  rebounds -- put the Cardinal up by six with 14:45 left, and Auburn could get no  closer after that.  </P> <P> The Tigers came within seven points after a three-point basket by guard Evelyn  Thompson with 1:05 left, but she fouled Stanford guard Sonja Henning, who made  both free throws to stop the Tigers' momentum. "We wanted to attack the middle,  and (Henning) and (Azzi) read the defense and attacked," Stanford Coach Tara  VanDerveer said. "We haven't been pressed much all season, but there's a reason  for that -- it opens up the opportunity for the three (front-line players), and  we look at it as an opportunity for the fast break."  </P> <P> Auburn Coach Joe Ciampi's assesment of Stanford: "They have so many weapons and  defensively they gave us big problems. We anticipated concentrating on (Trisha)  Stevens, Azzi and Steding to start . . . but you never know."  </P> <P> That left the floor open to Henning, who scored 21 points and grabbed nine  rebounds.  </P> <P> "My disbelief was with how quick they got the shot off," Ciampi said. "We felt  we could get back and be in position to get back and contest the shot. They  were shooting three-point hots (as accurately) as we were layups."  </P> <P> Stanford shot 42.3% from three-point range, hitting 11 of 26. Azzi was four of  eight from the three-point line. Steding, who finished with 18 points and five  assists, was six of 15.  </P> <P> The Cardinal broke the Auburn press early and forced the Tigers into playing  one-on-one.  </P> <P> Steding and Azzi, with five three-point shots between them in the first seven  minutes, sparked the Cardinal to an 11-point lead, and it appeared a blowout  was in progress.  </P> <P> But Auburn fought back and took a 28-27 lead with 7:43 left in the first half  and widened the margin to 41-32 with 2:05 left.  </P> <P> Stanford scored the next nine points to tie the game, 41-41. And for the next  20 minutes, determination and execution of the Stanford machine proved  overwhelming.  </P> <P> "We're a team in every sense," Azzi said. "And our success comes from within  us."  </P> <P> Asked if she was saddened by never again wearing a Stanford uniform, Azzi  responded: "I feel so good now, at this moment. I'm sad knowing I'll never wear  a Stanford jersey again, but I'm glad it paid off."  </P> <P> VanDerveer: "When she came out (after her fifth foul) I wasn't thinking about  it. Then it hit me -- I won't see Jennifer and (Parson) play again. So I'm  happy, but I'm sad."  </P> <P> NCAA Women's Notes  </P> <P> Both tournament and single season attendance records were set at the 1990 Final  Four. The paid attendance for both games totaled 39,490, the turnstile count  34,196. Paid attendance for the 1987 Final Four at Austin, Tex., totalled  31,230, and the third all-time high was 18,788 at last year's tournament at  Tacoma, Wash. . . . The all-tournament team for this year's Final Four included  Jennifer Azzi (MVP), Katy Steding of Stanford, Venus Lacy of Louisiana Tech,  Chantel Tremitiere of Auburn and Carolyn Jones of Auburn.  </P> <P> Stanford's Sonja Henning did not make the team, despite an outstanding  tournament in which she shot 50% and averaged 12 points and more than seven  assists a game. . . . Jones, a 5-6 guard, was high scorer for Auburn with 16  points.  </P> <P> The NCAA women's basketball rules committee has instituted changes for next  season: players fouled while attempting a three-point basket will be given  three free throws if the basket is missed; if a goaltending call is made during  a free throw, a point will be awarded and the team causing the infraction will  be assessed a technical foul; and in jump-ball situations, the ball will be  awarded out of bounds at the spot closest to where the situation occurs. The  ball had been awarded at the sideline.  </P></p>

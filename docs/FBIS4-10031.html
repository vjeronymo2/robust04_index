			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 31 Mar (PL) -- Mark A. Entwistle, the  Canadian ambassador to Cuba, said today that his country's  businessmen will increase their investments in Cuba. He also  reexpressed his government's opposition to the U.S. blockade of  the island.    During an interview given to GRANMA newspaper, Entwistle  said  commerce is the most active sector in the relations between the  two nations because the Canadian private sector is showing  growing interest in the economic opportunities offered by Cuba.    Canadian businessmen are beginning to observe growth  potential in the Cuban economy in areas such as tourism, mining,  and oil. In some of these areas, Canadian businessmen are  already participating, and in others, the investment prospects  are very interesting, he said.    The ambassador observed that Cuba occupies fifth place in  his  country's commercial relations with Latin America as trade with  Cuba amounted to $370 million in 1992, and shows a tendency to  grow.    Canadian businessmen foresee Cuba possibly being a bridge  between South America and the Caribbean and estimate that  possible associations with the Cubans will project them into the  future, Entwistle added.    The ambassador also ratified his country's disapproval of  the  U.S. blockade against Cuba and asserted that U.S. attempts to  have third countries implement this policy are not being  accepted.    It is very simple, he said; the United States has a policy  on  Cuba, and Canada has its own policy on Cuba.    For Canada, he added, from our political perspective, Cuba's  isolation is harmful. Our interest is to contribute to creating  a climate that will allow for improved relations between the  countries in the hemisphere.</p>

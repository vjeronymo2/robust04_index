			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / CBI seeks block on rise in pound MR HOWARD DAVIES, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, last night urged the government not to let sterling gain in value and to cut public spending. Speaking at the annual dinner of the Institute of Materials in London, Mr Davies said that UK financial conditions would have to be tightened as economic recovery gained strength. To achieve this, the government could either cut expenditure or let the pound rise. Echoing widespread concern in industry about recent gains in sterling's value, Mr Davies said allowing a further strengthening of sterling would be 'the wrong response' and would do nothing to correct the UK's large current account balance-of-payments deficit. Mr Davies also called for a prolonged period of 'lower interest rates' to stimulate investment. However, in a separate report published today, the Chartered Institute of Marketing said that business investment is proving to be one of the strongest elements in Britain's economic recovery. It said there were signs that UK business investment would recover to 16 per cent of gross domestic product by 1995, which would be the third year of recovery from recession. Following the 1979-81 recession, it took five years for investment to reach that level. The marketing institute forecast that by 1995 investment in Britain would take a larger share of GDP than in the US or the other big European countries. However, it would still be well below the 20 per cent figure typical for Japan or the 30 per cent to 35 per cent investment share of GDP recorded by economies in south-east Asia. Mr Douglas McWilliams, the institute's economic adviser, said that economic recovery in Britain would continue slowly after a quick start. This would mean a more sustainable recovery than in the 1980s. But the recent improvement in the level of unemployment would not be sustained and 'depressingly high unemployment levels' would remain for most of this decade, he warned.</p>

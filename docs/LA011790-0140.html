			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WINTER UTILITY USE SPARKS .4% HIKE IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION  </P> <P> Industrial production rose 0.4% in December, the second consecutive monthly  gain, as unseasonably cold weather fired up output by utilities, the government  said today.  </P> <P> Despite the 6.3% gain in utilities, manufacturing production remained sluggish,  also partly because of the weather.  </P> <P> The slow pace was reflected by the loss of 25,000 factory jobs and an unchanged  40.7-hour average work week.  </P> <P> The manufacturing sector, particularly in durable goods -- items such as cars  and household appliances expected to last more than three years -- has been  affected by the Federal Reserve Board's tight rein on credit designed to  curtail inflation because many such items are financed by loans.  </P> <P> In its report today, the board said December's gain in production followed a  revised 0.3% advance in November, up from the 0.1% reported initially. Output  had declined 0.4% in October and 0.1% in September.  </P> <P> "The extremely cold weather in December caused a sharp rise in utility output  but also resulted in some production disruptions, particularly in petroleum  refining and construction supplies," the Fed said.  </P> <P> "Aircraft production returned to normal in December following the settlement of  a strike" at the Boeing Co., it said.  </P> <P> In another report, the central bank said the operating rate at the nation's  factories, mines and utilities rose 0.2 percentage point to 83.3% in December,  reflecting the increase in the production rate. The operating rate measures  both output and changes in productivity levels.  </P> <P> The operating report is watched as a barometer of future inflation. The closer  U.S. industry gets to full operating capacity, the greater difficulty it has  producing enough to meet demand, leading to shortages and price increases.  </P></p>

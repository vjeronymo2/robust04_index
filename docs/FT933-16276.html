			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Executive pay rises slow UK EXECUTIVES' pay rises have slowed to less than half the annual rate that prevailed at the start of the recession, the latest index produced for the Financial Times by the Noble Lowndes group of management consultancies shows. The index, which includes benefits such as cars and pensions as well as salaries and bonuses, shows an average increase for all ranks of executives of 5.3 per cent over the past 12 months. The figure for just the first six months of 1990 was 6.5 per cent. As companies have put a tight grip on pay expenditure, the average annual rate of increase even for chief executives has fallen below 6 per cent. Yet there are signs that, after applying the brake increasingly hard to last December, companies are starting to relax it again.

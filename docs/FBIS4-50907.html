			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- At the 1994 China  international high-level economic forum in Beijing, the leading  officials of some economic affairs departments of the Chinese  Government extensively reported on the status of reforms of the  economic structure in various areas and on the strategic ideas  for carrying out such reforms. The reports commanded broad  interest from the participants. Economic experts and  entrepreneurs from various countries spoke highly of China's  tremendous achievements in reform and opening up, offering many  valuable opinions and suggestions for reforming China's economic  structure through discussions and replies to relevant questions.    The two-day, high-level economic forum concluded at the  China  World Hotel today. During yesterday's and today's sessions,  Wang Zhongyu, minister in charge of the State Economic and Trade  Commission; Gui Shiyong, vice minister of the State Planning  Commission; Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic  cooperation; Finance Minister Liu Zhongli; Chen Yuan, vice  president of the People's Bank of China; and Liu Hongru,  chairman of the China Securities Supervision and Administration  Committee, reported on the status of and prospects for reforms  in their respective fields.    Speaking of the strategic ideas for China's enterprise  reform, Wang Zhongyu said: In carrying out this reform, we aim  to strengthen enterprise-related legislation and place  enterprise reform within the legal framework, with the general  goal of establishing a socialist market economic structure. We  also seek to further improve the system of legal persons in the  form of enterprises while carrying out reform of property rights  in enterprises, and to further change enterprises' operating  mechanisms while following the basic course of instituting a  modern enterprise system. We aim to create a favorable external  environment for deepening enterprise reform while closely  meshing such reform with the efforts to establish a market  network, to reform the macroeconomic management system, and to  institute a social security system. The ultimate goal of  enterprise reform is to make enterprises more dynamic and to  improve their economic efficiency as much as possible.    After reporting on the substantial progress in reforming the  planning and investment structures, Gui Shiyong analyzed the  current major problems in the planning and investment  structures. He noted: These problems include the failure to  fully harness market forces in those economic activities in  which market forces should play their roles and enterprises  should make decisions independently; some of those activities  have even been subject to improper administrative interference.  A macroeconomic regulatory and control system, which satisfies  market economic demands, has yet to be established, and there is  a lack of effective mechanisms based on the combination of  various regulatory and control means. New functions, contents,  and methods of planning have yet to be explored, and there are  not enough strategic, macroeconomic, and policy-oriented plans.  The extent of participation by people in planning is relatively  small, and the legal footing of planning work remains rather  fragile. A risk-control mechanism in connection with investment  has yet to be instituted, and the practice of "eating from the  same big pot" has not yet been truly shattered. These problems  need to be solved by continuing to deepen reform.    In noting the striking differences between the new reform  of the foreign trading system currently under way in China and  the reform carried out over the past 15 years, Wu Yi said: The  current reform of the foreign trading system is proceeding  simultaneously and in concert with reforms in other key sectors  of the national economy -- finance, taxation, banking,  investment, planning, foreign exchange, and the enterprise  system. The current reform has never been more extensive,  forceful, and difficult. Our reform plan was hatched after  conducting investigations and studies over an extended period of  time, summing up reform-related experience over the past 15  years, and drawing on the successful practices of foreign  countries. In the current favorable domestic and foreign  environment, the opportunity for carrying out reform is quite  good, and the conditions for doing so exist.    After discussing the satisfactory results of the way the new  financial and taxation systems operate, Liu Zhongli said: Some  foreign media recently reported that we are trying to mitigate  the central government's financial troubles by increasing  enterprises' tax burdens and collecting more local financial  revenues; such reports are groundless. Under the current  financial and taxation reform, the central government will not  collect a single cent from local governments' existing financial  revenues; it will only claim a slightly larger share of any  additional financial revenues. Local governments understand and  support this move. As for enterprises' tax burdens, the  country's general ledger is designed in such a way that no  increases in such burdens will be reflected; however, some  increases or decreases in individual enterprises' tax burdens  are normal because of the changes in the tax structure.    Chen Yuan explained the prime goals for the future reform of  the banking system. These include the establishment of a  central banking system that implements independent monetary  policy under the State Council's leadership; the establishment  of a network of banking institutions that undertake separate  policy-related and commercial banking business, with state-owned  commercial banks playing a dominant role among other banking  institutions that exist side-by-side; and the establishment of a  unified, open, and strictly managed network of banking markets  which permit orderly competition.    In discussing the opening of China's stock markets to  foreign  companies, Liu Hongru said: Some foreign companies have  expressed the hope of issuing shares on China's stock markets.  Although China's stock markets are currently closed to foreign  companies, they will open up gradually over the long term, in  the same way as other commodity markets have. We are carefully  studying relevant proposals made by foreign companies.    In his closing address, Li Tieying, state councilor and  concurrently minister in charge of the State Economic  Restructuring Commission, said: This international seminar has  been a complete success, having attained the goal of further  enhancing mutual understanding between China and the rest of the  world, and of expanding cooperation and trade contacts between  China and other countries and regions. He noted: As China  enters a new era of full-scale socialist economic construction,  it doubly needs to increase exchanges and cooperation with other  countries. China will not change its policy of opening up to  the outside world, nor will it change its policy of actively  supporting and encouraging foreign investment.</p>

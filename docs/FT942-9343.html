			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / French airline in Heathrow complaint The Anglo-French 'airport war' yesterday took another twist as Air Liberte, a small private French airline, said it was complaining to the European Commission about its failure to get adequate slots to open a service to Heathrow. Mr Cedric Pastour, deputy director of Air Liberte, said his company was taking precautionary action so that 'if we do not get satisfaction out of the new negotiations between the French and British governments. . . Brussels will take up our case'. Over the weekend, the two governments agreed that by the end of June, British Airways and UK Air could start flying into Orly, the main domestic French airport, in return for French carriers getting better access to Heathrow. Mr Pastour said there was a particular problem for new airlines at Heathrow. Air Liberte had last November requested four landing and takeoff slots at Heathrow, he complained, only to have half of them refused last week and the other half granted 'in an commercially unusable form', such as having to keep an aircraft at the UK airport for 5 1/2 hours. The British Airports Authority, which runs Heathrow airport, said yesterday that all slots were allocated every November by Airports Co-ordination Limited, an independent company. The decision on Air Liberte slots would have been made according to IATA rules, it said, and without prejudice. There is intense pressure on slots at Heathrow, with the limited access to the airport having already led to a breakdown in talks between the US and UK on the renegotiation of their bilateral air agreement. The problem has been greatest for new airlines and airlines seeking access to Heathrow as part of the European Union's 'open skies' policy of deregulation, with over a third of Heathrow's slots already allocated to British Airways. Virgin and American Airlines are just two of a large number of airlines that have complained of delays in launching new services, or continuing limits on their services, due to the lack of availability of Heathrow slots. Earlier this month, the British Air Transport Association, which represents UK airlines, complained that all of the 520 daily departure slots available at Heathrow this summer were already booked, while 496 of the 517 daily arrival slots were pre-booked. The association is pushing for an extra runway in the Heathrow and Gatwick catchment area as soon as possible to alleviate the problems of congestion. Meanwhile, only a few flights to Corsica are expected to escape today's strike at Air Inter, the domestic carrier belonging to Air France, held in protest at its imminent exposure to foreign competition. Mr Bernard Bosson, the transport minister, yesterday said the strike was 'comprehensible, but not the solution'.</p>

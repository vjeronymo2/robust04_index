			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Ding Genxi: "Ministry of Chemical </F> Industry Changes Functions, Focuses on Macro Regulation and  Control, Does a Good Job of Providing Services for Both Ends"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In accordance with the decision  made by the first session of the 8th National People's Congress,  the CPC group at the former Ministry of Chemical Industry  reformed the bureaucratic structure of the former Ministry of  Chemical Industry in a comprehensive manner. This reform has now  been basically completed; in terms of the ministerial-level  bureaucracy, the numbers of department- and bureau-level units  and division-level units have been reduced from 15 and over 90  to 12 and over 60 respectively, and the number of functionaries  has been reduced from 577 to 320. Those office workers and  department, bureau, and division-level cadres rendered surplus  have all been placed. The new Ministry of Chemical Industry has  begun to function in accordance with the new functional  requirements.    The former Ministry of Chemical Industry managed over 6,000  chemical enterprises and institutions at the county level or  above in the chemical industry system. The ministry was not only  responsible for approving chemical projects and allocating  materials and funds, but also responsible for making production  plans of enterprises; even plans and arrangements concerning  enterprises' equipment overhauls were made by the ministry. The  scope of management was excessive, and management was carried  out in an overly detailed manner. The new Ministry of Chemical  Industry will not only manage the previous chemical sector, but  also manage, in a comprehensive manner, the chemical industry  which consists of different sectors such as the petrochemical,  coal chemical, salt chemical, and refined product chemical  sectors and enterprises of different ownership statuses such as  foreign-funded chemical enterprises and township chemical  enterprises. Even since its establishment, it has broken away  from the traditional views and practices characterized by  intervention in enterprises' production and business activities,  and has instead concentrated on macro-level management. For  instance, the chemical industry production planning conference,  recently gathered by the Ministry of Chemical Industry, was  mainly devoted to analyzing the situation of the chemicals  market next year, inviting the comrades in charge of the  relevant ministries and commissions to discuss what chemical  materials provided by the chemical industry their respective  sectors would need and how much of each material they would  need, and then making macrolevel production plans for the next  year on the basis of market demand. The practice, prevalent at  the previous years' production planning conferences, of haggling  over plan targets with directors of chemical industry  departments or bureaus of the localities, resulting in the  Ministry of Chemical Industry being eventually forced to impose  plans on its subordinates, was changed. According to a source,  this year's plan, made by the Ministry of Chemical Industry in  view of market demand and the actual situation of enterprises,  was based on the superior's working in concert with its  subordinates and was deeply welcomed by the localities and  various quarters. Leading comrades of many localities said that  this change on the part of the Ministry of Chemical Industry was  not only conducive to making production in line with demand, but  also conducive to adjusting the product structure of the  chemical industry and improving economic efficiency, and that  thus the change had won profound support from the people and  enterprises.    In the process of transforming the function of government,  the Ministry of Chemical Industry has given particular emphasis  to providing services for the "two ends," providing services  both for the localities and enterprises and for foreign  businesses. Since its establishment, the new Ministry of  Chemical Industry has dispatched investigation groups to conduct  investigation at the grass roots on many occasions, and has also  held symposiums of various kinds so as to hear enterprises'  appeals and demands and to keep enterprises informed, thereby  helping enterprises resolve a series of practical problems in  development. With the rapid development of our national economy,  some large chemical enterprises abroad have been shifting their  attention to China in terms of their investment plans. In view  of this development, the Ministry of Chemical Industry informed  enterprises of the said situation in a timely manner, and  informed foreign businesses of the state of development of  chemical industry across China, thereby making the two sides  very happy. Since the beginning of this year, the Ministry of  Chemical Industry has signed comprehensive cooperation  agreements with 12 large chemical companies such as Japan's  Asahi Chemical Industries, Eastman Chemical Company of the  United States, and Germany's Bayer AG and the Economics Ministry  of the Netherlands, and has signed project cooperation  agreements with General Electric of the United States and  Germany's BASF AG, involving 122 projects of exploratory  activity and cooperation. Recently, the ministry also signed  agreements with the Mexican Government on economic and  technological cooperation on petrochemical and chemical  industries. The Ministry of Chemical Industry has so far signed  joint-venture contracts worth a total of $230 million and  joint-venture intention agreements involving a total of $800  million with foreign businesses.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / PM refuses to axe charity tax relief PROPOSALS in a Home Office-sponsored report that charitable tax relief should be abolished were firmly rejected by Mr John Major last night. 'It is the privilege of everyone to submit reports to government departments, but it is the right of government ministers to reject them,' he said. 'And this prime minister does just that. I want to make it clear that tax relief for charitable giving is here to stay.' Abolition of tax relief was among a range of controversial recommendations in a report by three former advisers to the Home Office's voluntary services unit. Mr Major told Business in the Community's Per Cent Club - a group of leading companies committed to community involvement - that the government had increased incentives for individual and corporate charitable donations through the inheritance, income and corporation tax systems. 'I stand four-square behind the tax concessions we have made to the voluntary sector,' he said. Voluntary-sector leaders will be relieved that Mr Major has stamped on the suggestion of withdrawing tax concessions. Other aspects of the report - notably a suggestion that charities providing government-funded welfare services should surrender their campaigning role - has stimulated considerable debate. Mr Major announced other initiatives to promote the voluntary sector in his speech. These included plans for a national network of volunteers. A new award scheme will encourage people to offer themselves for voluntary work. Local organisations will be able to bid for grants for projects that increase the scale and impact of voluntary effort. The first awards will be made next year. The government, said Mr Major, was working with the Prince's Trust charity to encourage more young volunteers, and the number of awards for voluntary service would double to more than 300 in future honours lists. A deregulation task force studying burdens on the voluntary sector is due to report by Christmas and, the prime minister said, has already identified 50 potential areas for reform. 'When you have to obtain more than 10 different licences or permits just to run the village hall, when you spend more time fending off environmental health officers, social workers, fire officers than giving the service you want to give, then no wonder some people think it's not worth it. They give their time for free, they don't expect it to be wasted by bureaucracy.'</p>

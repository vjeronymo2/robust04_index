			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-ROCKWELL OFFICIAL PLEADS GUILTY TO FRAUD;  </P> <P> DEFENSE: THE MANAGER SET UP A PHONY MACHINE SHOP TO WIN A SUBCONTRACT. HE THEN  DID BUSINESS IN A NON-APPROVED SHOP AND POCKETED THE DIFFERENCE.  </P> <P> A former Rockwell International Corp. purchasing supervisor pleaded guilty  Thursday in federal court in Los Angeles to mail fraud and conspiracy to  receive kickbacks in connection with a scheme to defraud the defense contractor  on the B-1B bomber program.  </P> <P> Ralph Affinito, 49, of Rancho Palos Verdes, pleaded guilty to secretly setting  up a sham machine shop in an effort to obtain subcontracts from Rockwell, where  he was working as a supervisor in the parts purchasing department in El  Segundo.  </P> <P> Affinito admitted to U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. that he and a  friend, Ward Finch, set up the phony machine shop, and Affinito provided Finch  with information that enabled him to make successful bids for the  subcontracting jobs.  </P> <P> Finch, in turn, subcontracted the actual work to unapproved machine shops. The  scheme cost Rockwell more than $430,000, according to Assistant U.S. Atty. John  F. Walsh III, who prosecuted the case with the help of investigators from the  Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service.  </P> <P> Affinito is the 19th person to plead guilty to a felony uncovered during a  multi-agency investigation of kickbacks in defense subcontracting. The probe is  called DEFCON.  </P> <P> Walsh said Affinito set up the sham machine shop, called Draw Industries, with  Finch, a real estate broker, in 1982. The prosecutor said Affinito doctored  files to make it appear that a competitive bidding process had taken place  when, in reality, the defendant had simply awarded the work to Draw at an  inflated price.  </P> <P> Affinito and Finch pocketed the difference between the inflated price paid by  Rockwell and a cut-rate price charged by the real, though unapproved, machine  shops.  </P> <P> If the scheme had not been discovered, said Carlos Torres, an IRS investigator,  it could have cost Rockwell "millions of dollars."  </P> <P> FBI agent Dale Bibel said that, although no work was done by Draw Industries, a  building was rented, machines obtained, time cards displayed, metal shavings  strewn on a floor and temporary phony employees procured to deceive Rockwell  officials when they came to examine Draw Industries.  </P> <P> Most of the DEFCON cases were prosecuted in 1986 and 1987. The case against  Affinito is only being resolved now, Walsh said, because it has a convoluted  procedural history.  </P> <P> Originally, Affinito went to trial in 1987 on an indictment charging him with  the Draw Industries scheme and a separate kickback scheme at Hughes Aircraft.  He was acquitted on the Hughes charges but convicted of the Draw scheme.  </P> <P> Just a few weeks after the trial, however, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an  opinion that struck down a number of mail-fraud convictions, including  Affinito's.  </P></p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Italy puts curbs on journalists ITALY's chamber of deputies yesterday reviewed a bill which would make it a crime for journalists to report on trials before verdicts are given without prior court approval, Reuter reports from Rome. If the bill becomes law, journalists could face up to two years in prison and Dollars 1,500 in fines if they publish information not cleared by the court. Reporters could also serve up to three years if they publish the names of magistrates and police working on a case. 'We have to keep checks on journalists, make it clear to them the kind of information that should not be published, and set up a deterrent for those who break the rules,' said Mr Giuseppe Gargani, president of the chamber's justice commission. Critics say the law has been drafted to protect the politicians facing corruption trials. 'The truth is that . . . journalists are under fire, because they report in depth on the political scandals sweeping the country,' said Mr Ferdinando Imposimato, a parliamentarian and former judge.</p>

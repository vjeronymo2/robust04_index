			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc chief sees slow growth in profits Mr Jean Rene Fourtou, chairman of Rhone-Poulenc, France's recently privatised chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, yesterday expressed caution about recovery in the group's principal markets this year, and said he did not expect a substantial increase in profits until 1996. Announcing a 36 per cent fall in net profits to FFr962m (Dollars 163m) in 1993, which was in line with estimates given by the company prior to its privatisation in November, Mr Fourtou said that the economic outlook remained uncertain and there were signs of stabilisation rather than significant recovery in its principal markets. Mr Fourtou blamed the decline in last year's profits on the recession in Europe and the fall in prices of basic and agricultural chemicals. The price of acetic acid and soda, for example, declined sharply in the face of weak demand from industrial customers. But despite the fall in profits and the difficult markets, Mr Fourtou said the group had made substantial progress in increasing productivity and in reducing debts. Net debt fell by FFr9bn during the year, from FFr33.7bn to FFr24.1bn. Cashflow improved from break even in 1992 to FFr2.15bn. The fall in debt was partly a reflection of the sale of assets, including the group's 35 per cent stake in Roussel-Uclaf. Mr Fourtou said that the strategy of selling non-core assets, which brought receipts of FFr6.1bn in 1993, would continue in an attempt to reduce debts further. In 1993, consolidated sales fell by 1.4 per cent to FFr80.56bn. Operating income fell by 12.8 per cent to FFr5.92bn, reflecting restructuring provisions of FFr1.17bn. Provisions in the group's healthcare division rose sharply, from FFr5m to FFr616m, reflecting the conversion of a site in France and difficult markets in Italy and Germany as a result of the introduction of healthcare reforms. The decline in operating income also reflected the fall in profits from the group's basic chemicals operations and its fibres and polymers division. Profits in the latter division fell from FFr532m to FFr56m, while the organic and inorganic chemicals division suffered a loss of FFr78m compared with a profit of FFr528m in 1992. The decline in these divisions was only partly offset by a 15 per cent rise in profits in the group's healthcare division, from FFr4.96bn to FFr5.69bn. Specialty chemicals activities also resisted the effects of recession, maintaining profits at FFr559m. Lex, Page 20</p>

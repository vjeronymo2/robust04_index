			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sanita Upleja: "New Party Established -- </F> Political Union of Economists"]    [Text] Riga, 20 March -- On Saturday [19 March], a group of  economists of the Saeima [parliament] faction "Concord for  Latvia," and their supporters gathered at the founding meeting  of the Political Union of Economists [TPA]. At the meeting,  the program and statutes of the newly established party were  adopted. Edvins Kide, leader of the faction, was elected  chairman of the board.    Founders of the new party are members of the election bloc  "Concord for Latvia -- Rebirth for Economy," "Union of Latvian  Farmers," "Union of Fishermen," and the "League of Economy,"  along with representatives of small business. On the part of  the Saeima faction "Concord for Latvia," the initiators of the  new party were E. Kide, Jevgenijs Zascerinskis, Vilnis Edvins  Bresis, Leonards Stass, Janis Lucans, Juris Janeks, and Irena  Folkmane. As DIENA has already reported, from now on instead of  one Saeima faction, there will be two independent factions.    As the new party leader, E. Kide stated at the meeting that  the new party, in contrast with the ruling coalition which  represents the interests of big capital and the economic elite,  will be situated "in the center of the political spectrum with a  tendency to the left" and will represent the interests of  mid-sized and small business. E. Kide declared that in the  Saeima, TPA wants to represent the middle class, tradespeople,  and intellectuals. Regarding similar programmatic options and  their position on the political spectrum, TPA has decided to  cooperate with the Democratic Party [DP], Democratic Labor  Party, Latvian Social-Democratic Workers Party [LSDSP], and  trade unions. Also during the municipal elections, TPA will  create coalitions with LSDSP and the DP. E. Kide and other  speakers repeatedly stressed that TPA is an economic party  created on the basis of a club of economists, and that it stands  for maintaining state property in strategic branches, social  security, and equal rights for stateless people in the economy.    The TPA program declares that the state president should be  elected in a popular election and endowed with greater powers,  and expresses the demand to separate legislative and executing  power by adopting a law which will not permit individuals to  serve as deputies and ministers at the same time. TPA  emphasizes the need to achieve mutual understanding among  citizens and proposes to issue a declaration of concord for  society. Regarding the problem of citizenship, TPA declares  that citizenship should be granted to those people who have  lived in Latvia for the last 10 years and have a command of the  Latvian language, though the last condition does not apply to  elderly people and pensioners. In granting citizenship,  priority should be given to permanent residents born in Latvia,  except military personnel of foreign armies and their  descendants, as well as to family members of Latvian citizens.    For those who have been residing in Latvia since 4 May 1990,  a steady quota system should be implemented for achieving  Latvian citizenship. TPA rejects double citizenship and demands  the establishment of a law determining that the state president,  Saeima deputies, members of the Cabinet of Ministers and other  high-ranking state officials cannot be citizens of other states.    Regarding foreign policy, the TPA is orientated toward a  balance between East and West, emphasizing that our Eastern  policy should be constructive rather than based on emotions.  One of the main tasks of Latvian foreign policy, mentioned in  the TPA program, is to normalize relations with Russia and the  CIS. As for the security and sovereignty of Latvia, the main  conditions for their fortification, in the view of TPA, is  active work within the framework of the United Nations, CSCE,  and the Partnership for Peace, as well as joining the European  Union and the Council of Europe.    In its program, TPA condemns centralized power and supports  extending the role of municipal authorities, which should be  affirmed in the Constitution. TPA demands that municipal  authorities be given the right to initiate legislative acts in  parliament. TPA declares that the number of local government  electors should be expanded by granting voting rights to all  permanent residents of Latvia.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH HEADS TO SUMMIT 'CONFIDENT';  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: PRESIDENT LEAVES TONIGHT FOR 'HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY' IN MEETING WITH  GORBACHEV IN MEDITERRANEAN.  </P> <P> President Bush said today he and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will meet  off the coast of Malta not as traditional adversaries but as envoys for  "positive, productive change."  </P> <P> "Ours is a powerful, historic opportunity," Bush said during a ceremony in the  wind-swept White House Rose Garden marking his departure for the first summit  between the two superpower leaders.  </P> <P> Bush and Gorbachev confer Saturday and Sunday on American and Soviet warships  off the coast of Malta in the Mediterranean for what officially has been  described as informal talks designed to give the two leaders a chance to assess  the other.  </P> <P> "Mr. Gorbachev and I are not in some kind of competition," Bush said of the  Soviet leader, whose flare for the dramatic has put him at the center of  attention.  </P> <P> "This meeting represents a point of departure, the beginning of a process as  full of promise as any that we've known," said Bush, who initially sought to  downplay expectations of what he called the "non-summit summit."  </P> <P> "Given the remarkable and rapid change in Eastern Europe, our meeting will be  yet another important step in this long but hopeful journey toward a Europe  that is indeed whole and free," Bush said.  </P> <P> The President, who planned an early evening departure aboard Air Force One,  stressed his support for Gorbachev's program of reform, even as he hailed the  changes sweeping Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> "America understands the magnitude of Mr. Gorbachev's challenges and let there  be no misunderstanding, we support perestroika," he said.  </P> <P> Bush's send-off ceremony was attended by nearly 300 Administration officials  who filled the Rose Garden under blue skies and brisk winds.  </P> <P> As he left after the six-minute speech, Bush told reporters: "I'm ready for the  meeting. I'm ready and confident."  </P> <P> Earlier, at a Cabinet meeting called to preview the session, Bush said he was  confident that "Gorbachev is looking at the meeting very much the same way we  are."  </P> <P> He also said he received a full report Wednesday night from Canadian Prime  Minister Brian Mulroney on his own meetings in Moscow last week with Gorbachev.  </P> <P> Mulroney told reporters Gorbachev isn't looking for "miracles" from Malta but  deserves help from the West such as observer status at world trade talks.  </P> <P> Bush, in an interview Wednesday with newspaper correspondents that was released  today by the White House, said the unfolding changes in the once hard-line  Communist states in Eastern Europe have given "more of an urgency" to the  meeting since he first proposed it in July. But he insisted, "There's been no  change, in my view, as to what this meeting is to be about."  </P> <P> Asked if the United States had sent Gorbachev the message that it wants no  surprises at Malta, Bush said: "We've sent the message that we don't think  there are going to be any.  </P></p>

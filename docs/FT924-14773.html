			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Technology: Britain gets the message A vital part of Microsoft's eagerly awaited Windows NT operating system has been developed by a small UK communications software company which now plans to sell it to the world at large. Data Connection of Enfield, North London, is supplying universal messaging technology for the new operating system which is expected to be launched next year. It is the only element in Microsoft's new flagship system which is being developed by a UK company. The system is Data Connection's own version of an industry standard called X400, an important ingredient in the OSI open systems specifications. X400 includes electronic mail, electronic data interchange, secure messaging and file transfer. According to Ian Ferguson, Data Connection managing director, the company's DCX. 400 system is the first that works well and can be installed easily by customers. Conventional electronic mail systems cannot handle document or file transfers, while electronic document interchange systems cannot handle electronic mail, he says. Data Connection is offering the DCX. 400 to companies which want to incorporate it into their own products and to corporations planning to build custom electronic messaging systems. A licence starts at around Pounds 150,000.</p>

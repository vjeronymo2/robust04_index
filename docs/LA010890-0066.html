			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YO!;  </P> <P> SLANG: IT'S NO SECRET THAT BEING COOL IS IMPORTANT TO KIDS. TODAY'S "IN" WORD  IS SIMPLY PART OF THEIR OWN UNIQUE ARGOT.  </P> <P> The children are acting up again. You hear them on the street corner, in the  schoolyard, at the mall: "Hey, Yo! Yo, man, what's happenin'?"  </P> <P> What is happening, indeed?  </P> <P> What's with this "Yo" business, anyway?  </P> <P> It depends on whom you ask. There is no shortage of pontificators on the  subject.  </P> <P> But a caution: Beware the opinions of assorted social policy experts, political  types and ivory-tower intellectuals. Most of these good folk haven't a clue as  to what's "Yo." Examples:  </P> <P> * "A salutation among troubled inner-city youth reflecting membership in a  pathologically deviant subculture."  </P> <P> * "A solicitation used by drug dealers meaning, 'Open for business.' "  </P> <P> * "A derogatory reference to black adolescents employed by suburban white  kids."  </P> <P> * "Anyone who carries a gun."  </P> <P> * "Old south Philadelphia slang for 'Hello,' probably derived from the  interrogatory, 'Yoo hoo!' Popularized by Sylvester Stallone in the first  'Rocky' movie."  </P> <P> * "A gangster or would-be gangster."  </P> <P> These stereotypical adult responses remind me of those 1950s teen-ager movies  in which some lavishly pubescent, elaborately hair-sprayed young ingenue  manages to unglue her ear from the rock 'n' roll blaring from a transistor  radio just long enough to announce, "Gee, this is really cool!" To which her  mom replies, "Why don't you put on a sweater, dear?"  </P> <P> Today the kids shout, "Yo!" and these same dense adults are thinking, "Oh my  God, he's got a gun!" Or: "Thank goodness our little Throckmorton attends  private school!"  </P> <P> You want to know what's really happening?  </P> <P> What's happening is the kids are yelling "Yo!" and doing a lot of ritualized  palm-slapping and checking out the designer labels on each other's sneakers.  And what they're thinking is: "Gee, this is really cool!"  </P> <P> Being cool is very important to kids, dig?  </P> <P> I checked this out with some, like, very heavy experts, and they've finally  pulled my coat to what's "Yo." To wit:  </P> <P> "Expressions like 'Yo!' belong to the specific language of the younger  generation," says Richard Rowe, a program specialist in the Baltimore Mayor's  Office of Youth and Children. "It's part of their adolescent rebellion.  </P> <P> "Whatever its derivation -- drug slang, the movies, 'rap' music -- the kids  have made it their own," he says. "They pick it up from the streets or from  watching music videos on TV. It's simply a language young people have developed  to deal with each other, to make themselves a community."  </P> <P> "All adolescent boys are 'Yo's'," agrees Bobbe Frasier, director of the Black  Mental Health Center in West Baltimore. "It's what we used to call 'cool,' and  what our parents called 'hip.' Today it's 'Yo.' Like 'rap' music, it talks  about the children's aches and pains and what they see. It's also their  commentary on the adult world."  </P> <P> The biggest difference between today's young people and earlier generations of  youthful rebels, says Frasier, is the context in which their coming of age  occurs.  </P> <P> "These are the children of the post-civil rights, post-black nationalist eras,  but many of them are growing up in decaying environments and poverty that  affects their psychological development," Frasier says.  </P> <P> "They experience a lot of stress because many of them live in highly stressful  situations.So we find that many of them are reflecting a lower self-esteem, a  lower sense of control over their lives, and (they) believe their destinies are  in the hands of someone other than themselves," Frasier says.  </P> <P> Rowe and Frasier see the obsession with symbols of material success among  "yo-boys" and "yo-girls" -- designer clothes, gold jewelry -- as reflecting not  only a normal adolescent desire to emulate adult status symbols, but also as  indications of a deep insecurity, a need to fit in.  </P> <P> And it's not only black kids who feel that way. A lot of white teen-agers are  saying "Yo," too.  </P> <P> "All kids today are subject to mass-market appeals," Frasier says. "They may be  poor, but they still want things. Some get jobs so they can buy the things they  want. And some get involved in criminal activity for the same reason.  </P> <P> "We tend to think of adolescents as indolent, but in reality these kids are  long on rugged individualism," Frasier adds. "They want to 'live large,' --  meaning the opulent life, the color TV, the nice car -- even if it's also a  short life. Because all teen-agers, deep down, believe they are immortal."  </P> <P> Rowe and Frasier blame the media for the negative stereotypes of "Yo-boys,"  especially those involving black male teen-agers.  </P> <P> "If these kids were being told on a daily basis that they were winners, that  they were loved, maybe they wouldn't have taken gang culture as their model,"  Rowe says. "Young men join gangs because they are not getting the sort of  attention -- what psychologists call 'lap time' -- that they need. So they  identify with that element in society that says 'you are important.'  </P> <P> "Basically, what this is about is that perhaps we as adults have not been there  for our children like we should have," Frasier says. "We want to blame them for  not having the values we want them to have. But the truth is, they are a  reflection of what we ourselves are."  </P> <P> So next time you hear a kid say, "Yo!" don't panic. He probably doesn't have a  gun. Could be he's already in private school. The best thing might be just to  tell him to put on a sweater. Because he's, like, "cool."  </P></p>

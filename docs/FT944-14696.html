			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: US input helps lift Ferguson 15% to Pounds 6m Growth in all three divisions enabled Ferguson International Holdings, the labels, hangers and communications components group, to report a 15 per cent profits increase in the six months to August 31. The shares rose 23p to 331p. Pre-tax profits advanced to Pounds 6.01m (Pounds 5.24m) on turnover ahead 23 per cent to Pounds 80.5m (Pounds 65.6m). The figures benefited from the first full contribution from Red Wing, the US hangers business bought in September 1993 for Dollars 11.5m (Pounds 7.1m). Since the period-end Ferguson has bought Elswick, a rival UK labels supplier, for Pounds 37.7m in cash and shares. Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman, said that before the acquisition, Ferguson was number one in textiles labels; with Elswick that position was more firmly established and the group was now also number one in food labels. Since his arrival in 1990, Mr Cassidy has - via disposals - shifted Ferguson from a mini-conglomerate to a group with three core activities. He said yesterday that in the first half, the US businesses had fared well, those in the UK had maintained profitability, but trading conditions in continental Europe remained 'extremely difficult'. The UK's contribution to operating profit fell to 55 (59) per cent; the US pushed its share to 40 (26) per cent, thanks to Red Wing and a strong contribution from TV components. However, the input from continental Europe declined from 10 to 2 per cent, with profits of Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 500,000). By division, labels achieved a 'modest' profits rise to Pounds 3.44m (Pounds 3.48m) on turnover of Pounds 36m (Pounds 35.8m). Profits from the hangers business grew to Pounds 1.57m (Pounds 1.21m) on turnover sharply up at Pounds 25.4m (Pounds 16.6m), mostly as a result of Red Wing. Communications components contributed Pounds 1.45m (Pounds 1.02m) on turnover ahead at Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 13.1m). The stronger US economy had encouraged the expansion and upgrading of cable networks. Interest charges rose to Pounds 446,000 (Pounds 357,000) because of the Red Wing buy. Gearing was 23 per cent (14 per cent), but will rise to about 75 per cent in the short term after the Elswick buy. Earnings rose to 11.9p (10.4p) and the interim dividend is lifted 6 per cent to 4.5p (4.25p).</p>

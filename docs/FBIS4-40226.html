			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The signature of the agreement on partnership  and cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union took  place in Luxembourg on 14 June. This was an announcement made  at a briefing at Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry. [passage  omitted]    Speaking at the ceremony of signing the document, Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk said the agreement was laying a  qualitatively new legal foundation of our state's inclusion in  European integrational processes. As well as being a matter of  fundamental priority, he underlined, Ukraine's accession to  European economic and political structures is a logical and  necessary course of its external policy at the present stage.    The Ukrainian president added that the single Europe would  also benefit a lot from cooperation with Ukraine in terms of the  availability of transit roads across the territory of Ukraine,  rich deposits of raw materials, and tens of millions of highly  skilled workers.    If the boat of the Ukrainian state is rocked loose, Kravchuk  warned, it can become a potential source of instability on the  continent.</p>

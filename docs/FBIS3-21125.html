			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] On 8 December the Japan Atomic Power Company  revealed that it is considering having the U.S. company  Westinghouse participate in the detailed design and equipment  manufacturing for its Tsuruga NPP III and NPP IV (output:  1,420,000 kW each) planned for construction at Tsuruga City in  Fukui Prefecture. Japan Atomic Power is taking positive action  to ease U.S.-Japan trade friction in the electric power industry  by importing gas turbines, etc., from the U.S. Participation by  Westinghouse in this project, which has a projected total  construction cost of one trillion yen, should alleviate some of  the trade friction.    Tsuruga NPPs III and IV will use a modified PWR reactor with  increased output and better safety devices. The reactor is based  on the modified reactor developed jointly by five electric power  companies including Kansai Electric Power, Kyushu Electric  Power, Japan Atomic Power, etc., and Mitsubishi Heavy  Industries, Westinghouse, and the national government. Because  of its past involvement, Japan Atomic Power is considering  asking Westinghouse to participate. However, Mitsubishi Heavy  Industries is scheduled to be the main contractor, and Yutaka  Kurihara (executive director, Japan Atomic Power) says,  ``Westinghouse will not receive half the work load.''    The U.S. company General Electric and Hitachi, Ltd., have  each received one-third of the orders for the Kashiwazaki Kariwa  NPPs VI and VII (output: 1,350,000 kW each) being build by Tokyo  Electric Power. It appears that Japan Atomic Power has learned  from this example in considering the participation of a U.S.  company.    On site coordination has not been completed for Tsuruga NPPs  III and IV, so the date construction will begin is still  undecided. Because construction will take at least 4.5 years,  these NPPs will begin operation after the turn of the century.</p>

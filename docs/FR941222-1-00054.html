			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second set of coeluting compounds consists of 2- and 4-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aminoaniline, and 2-methoxyaniline. EPA based the risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment for this set of coeluting compounds on 2-aminoaniline,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as discussed in Section II.D.2. The resulting calculated high-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> end individual cancer-risk level is 1E&hyph;5 for the surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impoundment management scenario.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the risks associated with the plausible management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice for this waste, EPA is proposing to list wastewaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the production of azo dyes, excluding FD&amp;C colorants, as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous waste, designated EPA Hazardous Waste Number K165.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Agency recognizes that if wastewater treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sludges from the production of azo dyes (K164) are listed as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed, the available options for wastewater management may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change and surface impoundments may not be used. Wastewaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are managed in an impoundment will generate sludges through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precipitation. In the event that K164 sludges were listed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wastewaters were not, the sludges generated in a Subtitle D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater impoundment would be hazardous wastes and the surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impoundment would become subject to RCRA Subtitle C regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency is requesting comment on whether it would be plausible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to use a Subtitle D surface impoundment to manage wastewaters if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wastewaters were not listed and the wastewater treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sludges were listed as hazardous wastes. The Agency also is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requesting comment on the need to list K165 wastewaters, given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the plausibility of the worst-case management scenario on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the risk assessment was based may be affected by the K164  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sludge listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons stated above, EPA proposes to add the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following constituents to Appendix VII to Part 261_Basis for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Listing: 2-aminoaniline, 2-methoxyaniline, 2-aminotoluene, 3-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aminotoluene, 4-aminotoluene, and aniline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, 2-aminoaniline, 4-aminoaniline, 2-methoxyaniline and 3-aminotoluene are proposed to be added to Appendix VIII to Part 261_Hazardous Constituents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Wastes from the production of triarylmethane dyes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and pigments (excluding triarylmethane pigments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using aniline as a feedstock).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Wastewater treatment sludge from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production of triarylmethane dyes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pigments (excluding triarylmethane pigments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using aniline as a feedstock).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing to defer the decision on whether to list  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater treatment sludges from the production of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triarylmethane dyes and pigments (excluding triarylmethane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pigments using aniline as a feedstock) due to insufficient waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characterization data. The Agency is planning to collect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional information on this wastestream. EPA then will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publish a supplemental notice with a proposed determination on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether to list this waste. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Malaysian investment for Goodman Fielder unit COLD Storage (CSH), a Singapore-listed subsidiary of Australian food group Goodman Fielder, is to buy a 70 per cent stake in Standard Confectionery, a Malaysian fresh and frozen cakemaker, for about MDollars 15m (USDollars 5.8m), Reuter reports from Singapore. The investment was 'part of Goodman Fielder's strategy to transform Cold Storage into a major regional consumer-food manufacturing and distributing company,' CSH said. It saw good growth potential in fresh and frozen cakes in Malaysian and export markets. '(We) expect this acquisition to earn CSH a return well in excess of 10 per cent,' it added. Goodman Fielder said recently that it planned to announce a string of investments in Asia worth more than ADollars 100m (USDollars 67.4m) in the next few months. The acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval, is due to be completed before the end of March. CSH said the purchase was not expected to have a significant impact on its results for the financial year ending June 30.</p>

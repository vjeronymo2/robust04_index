			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Letter: Retirement proposal bad for employment and costly long-term Sir, I read with some concern your article, 'Retirement age of 65 proposed for men and women' (August 4). This recommendation is nothing less than a cost-saving exercise and a huge betrayal of the quality of life expected by the majority of working women. The men gain no favours either when considering the substantial numbers already opting for early retirement. I feel the Social Security Advisory Committee has based its proposals entirely on the basis of how government will find the wherewithal to fund future state pensions. A substantial percentage of today's female workforce has been working full time, paying a full stamp, since early teens and, to boot, raising a family before returning to work in their mid- to late-20s, increasing their working day to two full-time jobs. Women are now living longer than men. The SSAC proposals obviously intend to reverse this trend. On the equality issue of bringing men and women to the same retirement age, can the SSAC justify these proposals against the employment factor for our young people? The longer a mature generation stays marketable, the fewer the job opportunities for the young. Young people are needed in all sectors of the marketplace to bring fresher energies and newer ideas to Britain's future growth and development in a competitive world. Can the SSAC believe Britain will be better served by somebody approaching retirement age rather than enthusiastic and technically more highly trained young school leavers and graduates? The social issues of the unemployed youth of today will be nothing compared with those in 15 years' time. The billions looking to be saved over future years to improve pension packages will be far outweighed by the funding required for the young unemployed by way of benefits and educational/work experience training packages. Finally, in a so-called democratic society, where has freedom of choice disappeared to? I fear we may well need another Emily Pankhurst to endorse this committee's suggestion that the issue is one of 'political unpopularity'.

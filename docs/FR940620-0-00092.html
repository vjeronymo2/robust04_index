However, raised observation posts may qualify for exception under ADAAG 4.1.1(5)(b)(i) only if their primary use is for purposes of security or life or fire safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.1.3(5)&blank;Elevators <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ADAAG 4.1.3(5) contains exceptions from the requirement for a passenger elevator in certain facilities and circumstances. Exception 1 has been modified to address State and local government facilities that are less than three stories and not open to the public where the floor above the accessible ground floor houses no more than five persons and is less than 500 square feet. In addition, an exception to the requirement that elevators serve each level of multi-story buildings is provided for at air traffic control towers. Under Exception 5, elevator access is not required to serve the cab and the floor immediately below the cab since an elevator serving such levels would obstruct the required 360 degree clear view. While commenters noted that lifts may provide a feasible alternative means of access to these levels, the Board wishes to further assess the impact a requirement for vertical access, such as a platform lift complying with ADAAG 4.11 (Platform Lifts), would have on these facilities. Under NFPA 1010_1991 Life Safety Code section 30&hyph;2.4.1, air traffic control towers are required to provide only one means of egress. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), a vertical means of access to the cab will require the provision of a second means of egress from the cab to the ground level of the tower. Since air traffic control towers are typically built or operated by the FAA, a Federal entity, the Board plans to further consider this issue during adoption of ADAAG as the accessibility guideline for Federally financed facilities covered by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151 et seq.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title III of the ADA states that elevators are not required in facilities that are less than three stories or that have less than 3000 square feet per story unless the building is a shopping center or mall, the professional office of a health care provider, or another type of facility as determined by the Attorney General. Title II of the ADA does not specify a similar exception for State and local government facilities. The NPRM asked whether an exemption from the requirement for an elevator based on the presumed physical abilities of occupants is justified for certain State and local government facilities, such as firehouses with upper floors that are used only by firefighters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

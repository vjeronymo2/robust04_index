I  dare not say I do. I am only one of these people.    On 26 January 1993, I wrote a report entitled "`Ten Thousand  People Want' To Become `Another Thousand People's Friends,'"  introducing Tianjin's labor service market. In it, one short  paragraph mentioned how the market guided the "wave of peasant  laborers" and it also carried a short commentary affirming that  the labor service market's exploration about that was very  meaningful and that this should be continued. Honestly,  although the short commentary discussed the question of how to  guide and manage peasant laborers, I cannot but admit that I had  misgivings about whether I could shoulder this heavy task for  the labor force market.    The labor force market now has limited conditions but the  "wave of peasant laborers" is great. Although it may be  possible to find jobs for some peasant laborers, the number is  insignificant. Moreover, peasant laborers can move about freely.  Are they willing to accept orderly management?    My misgivings have been dispelled since I received a letter  on 5 February from "a man who has a job," voicing his thoughts.    The man is called Zhang Dejin, a worker in the service  detachment of Shilou Fire Service in Fangshan district, Beijing.  Although we never met, I can say for sure from his letter that  he is a peasant worker, a villager from the hills. After  reading the report of how Tianjin's labor force market guided  the "wave of peasant workers," he wrote me a letter with great  excitement, saying that "he had had this idea for six or seven  years and had finally found the person to talk to about it." I  am honored that as an author, I have the trust of a reader but I  feel that the weight of the letter lies in the words which  profoundly analyze the "indiscriminate flow of laborers" and  which call for the founding of a peasant labor market with full  expectations.    Let me reveal the original contents of the letter to all of  you.    "After working for one year outside, I had this idea:  Why does society call peasant laborers "indiscriminately  flowing laborers." It means that first, they are flowing  indiscriminately; second, there is a gap between city and rural  people; third, peasant laborers create many unhealthy trends in  society, exert a very bad influence on social stability, and so  forth."    The "wave of peasant laborers" makes a "wave" because  of the large number of laborers who need transport each year and  cause a big headache. Service personnel in buses and on trains  are disgusted with them. Their bulky personal baggage causes  inconvenience to work personnel. What they do causes harm to  those who are touring, visiting friends and families, and on  business trips.... How do city dwellers look on peasant  laborers. Most of the laborers do filthy manual work and they  do not change their working clothes. In a bus, if a peasant  laborer stands by the side of a seated passenger, he will  immediately stand up and give him the seat. What effect do  their words and deeds have on city children.... City dwellers  look down on them. They have reason to discriminate against  them. When a person comes to a strange place without a cent,  with very little education, and holding extreme views, what can  he do in order to survive. What will he get up to? So long as  someone gives him money and food he will do whatever he wants  including committing crime. The starting point for prostitution  in society is like this: A country girl whose head is full of  feudalist ideas has been deceived. In order to fight back and  survive, she can only live like this. What excuse do they use  to abduct and traffic in women. Most of them use the pretense  of employing workers, child workers from society. The article  "Where Have the Hill Girls Gone" on page 10 of the 25 January  edition of RENMIN RIBAO, was just part of the story. I am  illiterate because I began to work very early and this has been  very harmful to my own body."    Here I have quoted large paragraphs of Zhang Dejin's  original  words. I did not even change his grammar and the mistake of not  using question marks at the end of questions. Although the  letter may have flaws, it does not cause the peasant laborer,  who is in the wave, produce an inferior analysis of himself. If  we say that city dwellers mostly see the surface of the  "indiscriminate flow," then peasant laborers themselves dare to  analyze the question from the angles of society and themselves.    The beginning of the decadent phenomena. Peasant  laborers consider bribing and giving presents as paying a debt  of gratitude. Many have come to work in cities. I know that  some of them, the quick minds as they are called in society, are  up to some bad things. Now that peasant laborers need to be  managed, they seize this opportunity to invite guests, give  presents, and become laborers' foremen. Will these foremen  still participate in labor? Many shoddy and fake products come  from the hands of peasant laborers. For example, taking  advantage of peasant laborers, many small private enterprises do  not register for a place of temporary residence and do not  obtain temporary residence certificates. They do not register  with the authorities and yet begin production in out-of-the-way  places on the outskirts and they sell their products by improper  means. Moreover, these units also evade taxes and their  products seriously affect the market. How do the small  businessmen from the flowing population lead a life, and so  forth? Can all these phenomena be resolved equitably? Yes,  they can but who will trouble to do this?"  "In areas where peasant laborers abound, there are no  village-run enterprises and nearly no township-run enterprises.  So what are the village and township work personnel doing?  They have time, energy, and ability to rationally send peasant  laborers to employing units. For what do peasant laborers hope?  Before I left home, I had thought that it would be a little  easier to make money in a place nearer home. There were already  three parties that had asked for money, and there would not be a  fourth party. A person who has a wife and children hopes that  his family will be taken care of properly. It is more  appropriate for him to be near home. There was an article on  page five of the 29 January edition of RENMIN RIBAO entitled:  "The Core of Rural Work Cannot be Independent of Developing  Agriculture." Parents hope that their children will go to a  definite place so they do not have to worry about them. Female  housekeepers and female workers in individually-run restaurants  are particularly afraid. Families hiring the housekeepers fear  that they will not behave themselves. Bosses of individual  entrepreneurs are the same. Employing units and individuals  have the backing of the government's labor department. Peasant  laborers have the backing of a basic-level village or township  government and both sides have the sense of security. If  villages or townships act as employment agencies, they can  increase incomes and lessen peasant burdens at the same time.  If so, foremen who only invite guests and give presents and who  do not do labor must also participate in labor, thus promoting  the current "anticorruption" work. It is the same now as when I  worked as a worker that foremen do not work a single day and  that, at the end of each month, they give presents, settle  accounts, retain their portion, and give out the remainder as  wages."    Zhang Dejin's hope for the use of rural labor force is that  it "be like conscription in which a certain unit registers at a  designated place." He said: "The following are some of  my suggestions for the rational arrangement for peasant  laborers. My suggestion is that every city should have a labor  service market. How many markets are like that of Tianjin. What  figure makes the "wave of peasant laborers" a "wave." In order  to cope with this, we can only begin work with the government  first. Take back the portion previously taken by foremen and  peasant laborers contribute their part. For example,  registration fees and labor insurance can be used to develop the  labor force market. If so, it would develop much faster than it  does. For example, our Pingyuan County has a vast flowing  population. Through the county's labor affairs bureau, peasant  laborers had to pay several dozen yuan without going out in  order to vie for vacancies in the Huabei Oil Field and Beijing's  police and public security units. What vacancies there were, I  did not have a good idea. Anyway, peasant laborers thought this  was reasonable. The government labor affairs bureau can collect  an introductory charge from employing units and individuals.  They are very willing to pay the money. Establishing and  improving the labor force market, step by step, by pooling funds  from laborers is much quicker than the natural establishment.  The greatest beneficiaries are the whole society, whole  country, and laborers themselves."    This ordinary, letter which is full of genuine feelings, is  enough to enable city dwellers to understand more about the  so-called "indiscriminate flow." The opinion on the  significance, ways, and means of establishing a labor service  market for peasant laborers in the letter does enough to win the  respect of city dwellers.    Having an idea of something is the foundation of  understanding it and understanding precedes the "resolution" of  a problem. Cities have a great responsibility to resolve the  "wave of peasant laborers" and they are an important market for  absorbing the rural work force. Only by first understanding  peasant laborers can we enthusiastically think of the ways to  take action to help them find a way out. Not only labor affairs  departments should do this but also the government and all  quarters of society should care for them. Peasant laborers are  the main body of the labor force market. The fact that they have  such earnest aspirations and ideas to establish a labor force  market offers a good foundation for the establishment of this  market.    If we can find more jobs or make good arrangements for  peasant laborers, their livelihood can be guaranteed and  stability will prevail in society. Moreover, it is possible  that many a good and talented people, such as entrepreneurs and  scientists, will emerge from these peasant laborers one day!    The opportunity is now. Zhang Dejin's letter also tells us  one thing: "As a national traditional festival, the Spring  Festival is a very good opportunity. Peasant workers are now  spending the holiday back home and village and township  governments have the best time to control their flow." Places  charged with the task of exporting labor services must not miss  this opportunity from now on. With the great importance attached  to it by governments at all levels, with organization by labor  departments, and with the support of peasant laborers and  employing units, the rural labor force market will surely and  undoubtedly grow and expand.</p>

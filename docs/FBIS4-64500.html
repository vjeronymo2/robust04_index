			<p>BFN     [Text] Rome, May 3 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata told Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on  Tuesday [3 May] that Tokyo wants to strengthen and expand its  ties with Europe.    Hata told Scalfaro that Japan needs to make important  contributions to the international community, and hopes to  promote cooperation with European nations knowledgeable and  experienced in affairs in Africa, the Middle East and East  Europe.    During the 45-minute meeting, the Italian head of state  asked  about the future prospect of economic relations between Japan  and the United States, the world's two largest economic powers,  saying the relationship will affect many other countries.    The prime minister expressed hope to settle a bilateral  impasse over trade "framework" talks at an early date, the  officials said.    Hata assured Scalfaro that the outcome of talks between  Japan  and the United States will apply to any other country.    Hata's predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, and President Bill  Clinton failed in their February summit in Washington to strike  a deal on a new framework to slash Japan's trade surplus and  increase its share of imports. Talks have not been resumed.    Hata arrived in Rome Monday night, kicking off a series of  official visits to Italy, France, Germany and Belgium.    Hata's trip, less than a week into his post as prime  minister, is aimed at forging personal ties with leaders before  the July summit of he Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized  nations, in Naples, Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said.</p>

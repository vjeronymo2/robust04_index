			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Book Review: Bridging the gap for the ordinary man THE LESSONS OF HISTORY By Michael Howard Oxford University Press Pounds 17.50, 217 pages Professor Sir Michael Howard is the most urbane of contemporary British historians. His best and most detailed book, The Franco-Prussian War, was published in 1961. Since then he has gone on to produce shorter works, numerous essays and lectures and newspaper articles. It was essential for his task that he had a major work behind him. And what a brilliantly well-chosen one it was. Franco-German relations have remained the key to much of European history long after 1870, and an understanding of the details, the technology and the psychology of war remain an indispensable guide to the present. No contemporary historian could be better equipped. Professor Howard can write with equal facility about the nuclear balance of power and the war in the Gulf. He bestrides the gap between continental western Europe and the east coast of the United States. For Howard is more than a military historian. He writes well and sometimes speaks even better. When he became regius professor of history at Oxford in 1981, he drew attention to the apparent anomaly of a university professor being appointed by the crown. Yet as he must have known, he was the ideal man for the job. In his inaugural lecture, he spoke of the old debate about what the Oxford history school is for: whether to train historians to teach historians, or to teach history to the ordinary man. He cited a predecessor as defining the latter as 'one capable subsequently of being a cabinet minister, a bishop, an ambassador, a viceroy of India or one of the permanent under-secretaries in the civil service'. Howard's preference, mutatis mutandis, clearly lies in teaching the ordinary man. In such a task he has been outstandingly successful. Some of the truths in this selection of essays and lectures may be self-evident, but they are still worth repeating. For example: do not judge the past by the fashions and ideas of the present; bear in mind that while historical idols may not have feet of clay, they were made of flesh and blood; remember that Neville Chamberlain and his generation grew up rooted in empire, not the European continent, which may help to explain some of their mistakes about Germany. Again, Howard explains that one of the reasons why people expected the first world war would be short was that the last big European war, in 1870, had lasted only six months. He points out that it is a demonstrable myth that nazism was a natural extension of Prussia. Moreover, it scarcely occurred to anyone until towards the end of the 19th century that European conquests of territory had to be morally justified. On the contrary, conquest could be seen as a mission civilisatrice, or even a mandate from heaven, not even much resented by those conquered. It was the natural way of things. Howard gives all the warnings, too, about the dangers of ethnocentrism: 'Our awareness of the world and our capacity to deal intelligently with its problems are shaped not only by the history we know but by what we do not know. Ignorance, especially the ignorance of educated men, can be a more powerful force than knowledge.' On war, he cites Clausewitz and the 'paradoxical trinity'. This is composed of governments, for whom war is an instrument of policy, of the military, for whom it is the exercise of a skill, and the people as a whole, the extent of whose involvement determines the intensity with which the war can be fought. The problem is, as we know from the war in the Gulf, getting the balance of those three forces right. It is as difficult for the war-maker as for those who try to stop him. As an entertainer, Howard is full of intriguing facts. On the eve of the first world war, he notes that five out of the seven honorary doctorates at Oxford were given to Germans, yet at the same time one in three of undergraduates had joined the Officer Training Corps in preparation for battle. The British army defended the use of the bayonet until the last partly because possession of it provided a moral incentive to use it. Howard thinks that militarism was instilled into the British by empire, which had to be defended. Then he makes the wholly serious point that while wars used to be about territory, today people are more important than land. As an historian, Professor Howard has performed his own mission civilisatrice. As he himself warns, however, even historians are products of their own times. Howard would not, I think, have advocated Britain being a full part of the European Community from the Treaty of Rome onwards. He prefers nation states, in which he had his intellectual upbringing, to pastures new. Indeed if he were not so urbane, he might even have been a natural member of the Bruges Group. That is the only depressing comment that I have to make on a book by a very wise man.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FOLLOW-HOME THIEF SUSPECTED IN 2 INCIDENTS  </P> <P> Two weekend robbery attempts in Tarzana and North Hollywood, including one in  which two people were shot, may be connected to a string of robberies in which  drivers of expensive cars have been followed home and robbed, Los Angeles  police said Monday.  </P> <P> No arrests were made in either incident, but police said both are similar to 28  other robberies or attempted robberies that have occurred since October.  </P> <P> In the first of the latest incidents, John Koudsi, 53, drove his Mercedes-Benz  from his Beverly Hills home to the North Hollywood home of his 80-year-old  mother, Linda Koudsi, about 6 p.m. Saturday, police said.  </P> <P> When John Koudsi reached the door of the Bellingham Avenue home, he was  approached by a man with a gun who demanded his Rolex watch. While the robbery  was taking place, Koudsi's mother opened the door and the robber fired two  shots at them, police said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mother, Son Hit  </P> <P> Lt. Ron LaRue said the first shot hit Linda Koudsi in the finger and struck her  son in the leg. The second shot struck John Koudsi in the lower torso. The  robber fled without taking the watch.  </P> <P> LaRue said that shortly after the shooting, Linda Koudsi suffered a heart  attack. Both she and her son were taken to an undisclosed hospital, where they  were in stable condition Monday, he said.  </P> <P> LaRue said it appears that John Koudsi was followed to the home before the  robbery attempt.  </P> <P> On Sunday night, a similar robbery attempt occurred in Tarzana, police said.  </P> <P> Lt. William Gaida said a 60-year-old man, whose identity was not released, was  driving a Mercedes-Benz from Century City to his home on Hermano Drive when he  noticed that he was being followed.  </P> <P> "He was aware of the recent robberies and was watching his rear-view mirror,"  Gaida said.  </P> <P> The man made several turns in an effort to lose the car following him and when  he believed he had been successful, he continued home, Gaida said. But as the  man pulled into his driveway, he saw the other car. He quickly backed out of  the driveway and the other car sped away.  </P> <P> Gaida said the driver tried to follow the car but lost it. When he returned  home a few minutes later and stopped his car, he was immediately confronted by  a man with a handgun. The driver started blowing his car horn and the gunman  ran away.  </P></p>

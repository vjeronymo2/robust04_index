			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DRUG CENTER MAY HAVE TO UNDERGO SITE IMPACT STUDY  </P> <P> After a six-hour public hearing on locating the Nancy Reagan Center for  drug-abuse treatment in Lake View Terrace, a Los Angeles zoning official  appeared to be leaning toward ordering an extensive review of the project's  potential effect on the community.  </P> <P> "It's clear to me that there is a lot of confusion and a lot of  misunderstanding about this project," said Darryl L. Fisher, associate zoning  administrator. "I have to consider if it wouldn't be possible that an  environmental impact report would resolve a lot of those questions."  </P> <P> Fisher said he will decide within two weeks whether to require the report,  which would delay the project several months.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Want to Open in Spring  </P> <P> Officials of Phoenix House, the nonprofit company proposing the center, said  they want to open the facility by spring because the former First Lady is back  in California. She would have an office at the center, but her duties have not  been announced.  </P> <P> Councilman Ernani Bernardi said during the hearing that he will ask the City  Council on Tuesday to require the environmental study. Fisher said he will  determine the feelings of the council before making his decision.  </P> <P> About 300 people attended Friday's hearing at the Lake View Terrace Recreation  Center, more than half of them supporters of the center who wore yellow buttons  that read "Save Kids." Most of the supporters were clients, counselors or  teachers from other Phoenix House programs -- in Santa Ana and Venice -- who  were bused in for the hearing.  </P> <P> Also among them were a sprinkling of San Fernando Valley residents who have  decided to support the center.  </P> <P> Fred Nobles, managing partner of the Van Nuys-Pierce Park apartments in  Pacoima, said that although his efforts to clean up the area's drug and crime  problems have helped, "we need Phoenix House. What we are doing is not enough."  </P> <P> Anne Finn, widow of Councilman Howard Finn, who represented Lake View Terrace,  said that during tours of other Phoenix House centers, she was impressed with  how grown-up and clean-cut the youngsters were.  </P> <P> "If only we could have such a haven for cure as Phoenix House on every block,"  she said.  </P> <P> When Pacoima public-housing advocate Mary Cooley heard about plans for the  center, she was against it. But she said she changed her mind after her  drug-addicted daughter was referred to the Phoenix House facility in Turlock by  Mayor Tom Bradley's Valley assistant, Doris (Dodo) Meyers.  </P> <P> "I think sometimes a lot of us operate out of fear instead of out of reason,"  Cooley said.  </P> <P> Supporters emphasized Phoenix House's track record in other locations and the  need for in-patient drug treatment in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Opponents said there are blemishes on that record and noted that the hospital  site is within 25 yards of homes. They also noted that the site is on the edge  of an already drug- and crime-riddled area.  </P> <P> They said the northeast Valley shoulders more than its share of halfway houses,  juvenile detention centers and sanitariums.  </P> <P> "We have reached the point of saturation where this community is about to give  up . . . and stop fighting," said Fred Taylor, political adviser to the  Minister's Fellowship of the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inappropriate Use  </P> <P> Opponents said an environmental study would prove that the center is an  inappropriate use of the former Lake View Medical Center site.  </P> <P> But Phoenix House representatives said that while they do not welcome the  additional expenditure of time and money that such a study would require, they  believe that it would vindicate them.  </P> <P> An environmental study would only mean "there's going to be a period of time  where we're saying the same thing we're saying now, just in greater detail,"  said Larraine Mohr, senior vice president for Phoenix House's California  properties. "There is no environmental impact of this facility."  </P> <P> Attorney George J. Mihlsten said the center would generate far less traffic and  other nuisances than the Lake View Medical Center did before it closed three  years ago. Mihlsten, known as one of City Hall's most effective lobbyists, said  he is representing Phoenix House at no charge because he believes in its cause.  </P></p>

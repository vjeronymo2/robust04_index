			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Vickers Hard on the heels of British Aerospace, Vickers has demonstrated how easily defence profits can glide silently into the black hole of diversification. And as with BAe, Vickers must struggle to persuade the market that its problems are under control. Despite the robust way in which Vickers has cut costs at Rolls-Royce Motors, sales have fallen faster than overheads, generating a string of trading losses on top of rationalisation charges. Vickers' gearing is rising rapidly and will reach 50 per cent by the year end. It is merger or closure for BAe's regional jets. Distressingly, Rolls cars may go the same way. The problems at Rolls go well beyond the downturn in the luxury car market, though that is bad enough. Rolls needs heavy investment if it is to match the technology being developed by Mercedes and the Japanese. Vickers simply cannot inject cash on the scale required. Providing capital to update existing models can only be a holding exercise. Besides, there is an image problem for a car designed to appeal to a disappearing sense of British status. It is understandable that much management time is being spent getting the Rolls fire under control. But, disappointingly given the failure to reach an accommodation with BMW, fire-fighting begins to look like the only strategy on offer. There are some profitable operations in Vickers. Without Rolls the company could make profits of Pounds 40m a year. Even the tank business may generate export orders, though the market will be tough. Yet a clutch of businesses, however profitable, do not add up to a company with strategic purpose. Sir Colin Chandler, the new chief executive, has yet to show he can provide some.</p>

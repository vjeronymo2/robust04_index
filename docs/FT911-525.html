			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Granada The most rumoured rights issue in recent history finally hit the screens yesterday. Granada, though, must have gassed its mole before news could leak of the accompanying 40 per cent dividend cut and the full extent of the company's indebtedness. When the whole story was revealed, the shares tumbled 13 per cent. It is hard not to feel some sympathy for Mr Lewis, scapegoat for a series of ill-fated adventures in which others played an equally central part. The lurid boardroom drama has nevertheless served to obscure the fact that the timing of Granada's operation was closely linked to the refinancing of BSkyB. With or without Mr Lewis's scalp, no institutional shareholder could have contemplated offering its support when the (admittedly faint) possibility still existed that the terrestrial TV company's Pounds 130m loan guarantee to its satellite cousin could suddenly be called in. The new shares have been pitched at such a big discount that one wonders whether the issue needed to be underwritten at all. Investors, however, must face up to a period of uncertainty during the TV franchise bid and the hunt for a new chief executive. With the prop of a high yield now removed, the prospects thereafter will depend on how much the franchise costs, how quickly computer services can be turned round, and whether BSkyB fulfils its promise. That makes it more risky than a straightforward recovery stock.</p>

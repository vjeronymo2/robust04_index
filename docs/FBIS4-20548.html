			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Dassault Eletronique: Report for </F> 1993"]    [Text] In 1993, Dassault Electronique Group had a  consolidated revenue of 3.9 billion francs, as per prognostics,  slightly above the 1992 level. Orders represented 5.2 billion  francs, a more than 25-percent growth over the preceding year.  These excellent results reflect export orders for equipment to  be medium term delivered. As of 31 December 1993, order books  also showed significant growth, having for the first time  reached 9 billion francs (not including price revisions).  Turnover of the Dassault Electronique parent firm was 2,770  billion francs in 1993, practically the same as in 1992 (2,791  billion francs) for booked orders worth 4,145 billion francs, a  40-percent increase over 1992 (2,970 billion francs). During  the October 1993 meeting of the Board of Administration, the  Chairman, Bertrand Daugny announced that the Group had returned  to profitability in 1993.</p>

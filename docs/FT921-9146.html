			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Labour pledges to keep fraud case juries A LABOUR government would not move to end trial by jury in fraud cases, Ms Marjorie Mowlam, the Labour City affairs spokeswoman, said last night. She said replacing juries with alternatives such as the three-person tribunal advocated by the Roskill Fraud Trials Committee would risk undermining 'basic civil rights'. She said the party would, however, consider appointing specialist legal advisers to juries in complex fraud cases. Ms Mowlam said Labour would streamline the roles of the bodies responsible for fighting fraud as part of a wide-ranging review of domestic approaches to the pro-secution of such alleged crimes. It would be given a broad remit, including consideration of the following areas: Improving the efficiency with which resources currently earmarked for dealing with fraud are used. Ms Mowlam says there was duplication of effort among the bodies with fraud-related responsibilities, including the Serious Fraud Office, the Crown Prosecution Service, the Department of Trade and Industry, the City's self-regulating organisations and the Stock Exchange. Savings from better use of these resources could help the SFO to improve its performance in prosecuting large fraud cases. Labour would retain the SFO and the CPS as separate bodies. Opening the way for the SFO and other prosecuting bodies to opt for civil instead of criminal proceedings if there was a better chance of obtaining a conviction. Encouraging prosecuting counsel to limit the number of counts rather than 'throwing the book' at defendants. The SFO has been criticised for embarking on all-embracing prosecutions that clog up the courts for months or even years and become complex beyond the grasp even of experienced judges. Placing time limits on both the duration of trials and delays in bringing cases to court. 'Bringing successful prosecutions should act as a deterrent to others considering fraud,' Ms Mowlam said. 'When the delay in bringing a case is years, the deterrent effect is minimal.' Examining the effectiveness of the pre-trial hearings introduced at the recommendation of the Roskill committee. Ms Mowlam also called on the government to use the lessons of the Guinness proceedings as part of the basis for changing takeover legislation and reforming auditing and accounting practices. Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, should 'turn his mind to improving the DTI's performance as a regulator', she said. Ivor Owen adds: Ms Mowlam later reinforced these criticisms in the Commons, arguing that the need for action had been underlined by the collapse of the third case concerning Guinness, and the 'potential collapse' of the second Guinness case. She went on to question whether fraud could be dealt with under the existing law, and emphasised that the three people who had been convicted had spent less time in jail than the time that was taken up by the trial. Recalling that the sentence imposed on Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman, had been reduced because of ill-health, she said he had appeared on the media earlier yesterday 'in blooming health and protesting his innocence'. Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, refused to comment on individual cases but confirmed that Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the Lord Chancellor, was reviewing court procedures.</p>

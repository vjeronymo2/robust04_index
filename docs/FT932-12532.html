			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Little appetite for diet of military involvement - Philip Stephens considers the issues facing Conservatives over the civil war in Bosnia LADY THATCHER caught the moment. But it was only a moment. As the government contemplates acquiescence in US-led military action against Serbia it is being warned quietly but firmly by its supporters at Westminster against dragging Britain into the bloody civil war in Bosnia. The outrage and frustration at Serbian atrocities against the Bosnian Moslems which Lady Thatcher articulated 10 days ago have not disappeared. They will be rekindled by the latest offensive against the Moslem enclave of Bihac. If Serbia reacts to the tightening of sanctions by seizing the besieged town of Srebrenica the former prime minister may be able to claim another moment. But as Conservative MPs have contemplated more carefully the implications of western air strikes or the lifting of the international arms embargo, their rage has been tempered by the harsher military and political realities. The savagery of the Croatian latest attacks on Moslem villages has reminded them that it is a three-sided civil war with no clear front lines to defend, no ready-made safe havens to be protected. No-one believes the Vance-Owen peace plan could be imposed by force. Soundings in their constituencies have persuaded MPs that the nation's anger at the atrocities shown nightly on television news has yet to translate into a willingness to see British soldiers fight and die in an attempt to impose peace. Nor is the Labour party speaking with one voice. Mr John Smith's public backing for limited air attacks on Serbian supply lines in Bosnia has won far-from-universal support among his frontbench colleagues. No-one is questioning it publicly but some are dismayed, others are furious. If Mr John Major judges, as is likely, that the transatlantic alliance demands that he stands beside President Bill Clinton then the odds are that his party will rally round. There is a deep-seated tradition in the Conservative party that the government must be supported during international crises and the Nato alliance is guarded preciously. But, with the exception of a handful who have called consistently for military intervention, it is difficult to detect any enthusiasm for such a policy on the Tory back benches. Instead there is a determination to ensure the government draws a firm line beyond which it will never step. Mr Michael Jopling, a former chief whip, sums up the mood: 'Everybody is frustrated, everybody is horrified. The question, though, is what is best'. The lesson from past conflicts is that air strikes will achieve little. Mr Jopling's question is rhetorical: 'Is the advantage of bombing cancelled out by a halt to humanitarian aid?' His scepticism is echoed by Mr Tim Renton, another respected figure on the back benches: 'We have to accept this is a civil war . . The idea that we can bomb the Serbs into better behaviour is totally unrealistic'. In private conversations other prominent backbenchers are more forthright. It would be 'lunacy' says one, for Britain to risk being drawn into a conflict: '(Lady) Thatcher said what I would have loved to. But I don't believe a word of it.' Reluctant acceptance that limited air strikes may be inevitable is coupled with an insistence that British ground forces must not become involved in the fighting. If there is the slightest risk that bombing will make them a target for Serbian attacks, the existing forces must be withdrawn immediately. There can be no question of large-scale reinforcement. For Mr Douglas Hurd, the mood is at once helpful and dangerous. The foreign secretary is less than popular among those seeking a military solution. Lady Thatcher described his argument against lifting the arms embargo - it would create a level killing field - as disgraceful. The once-young fogeys on the fringes of the Tory right who believe that western force is all that is needed to re-establish order in the Balkans see Mr Hurd as the symbol of establishment appeasement. But his strong opposition to removal of the arms embargo - and his commonsense observation that it could not be lifted only for the Moslems - is widely shared among Conservative and Labour MPs. The general view is it might salve temporarily European consciences but that it would increase greatly the level of suffering. The humanitarian aid effort would not survive the inevitable escalation in the conflict. The foreign secretary's careful refusal over several months to discount the possibility of the west being pushed into military action has left him in front of, rather than behind, the opinion in his party. His weekend decision to commit British forces to the defence of the Canadian peace-keeping troops in Srebrenica did the same. Most of his cabinet colleagues - Mr Malcolm Rifkind the most important - are also more cautious. Mr Hurd is far from enthusiastic about air strikes. He has stressed repeatedly his belief that in the end there will be no alternative to a political agreement. He wants more time for the tougher sanctions regime to take effect. Guaranteeing order in the former Yugoslavia, as he puts it, would impose huge risks over an indefinite period. The risks could not be justified to the people of Britain. If he acquiesces in a decision by Washington to press ahead regardless it will be with great reluctance. The Conservative party will be more reluctant still.</p>

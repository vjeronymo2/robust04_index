			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan by </F> 'Abd-al-Hayy Muhammad in Baghdad; date not given]    [Text] [Muhammad] The economic embargo against Iraq has  been in force for three years. What are the causes and results  of this embargo and how are you facing the hardship, such as  prices and inflation soaring madly?    [Ramadan] The unjust embargo imposed on Iraq on 6 August  1991  is entering its fourth year, making it the first in the entire  world. Any embargo launched against any country in the last  half of this century for any reason does not compare with the  unjust embargo imposed on Iraq in the name of international  legitimacy under the hegemony of the United States. The embargo  is being enforced under stark and direct American threats to the  nations of the world. No one cared about the humanitarian  aspect (medicine and food) of this unjust embargo, which is not  covered by the Security Council resolutions.    The way the embargo was implemented and followed up on  reflected the intentions of those who imposed it, foremost of  which was the United States. It has become clear that the  implementation of the embargo has nothing to do with the reason  they gave; that is, Kuwait. The objective of the blockade,  obviously, is to stop Iraq's progress, which represents the  beginning of the Arab nation's progress. Had Iraq's position  proceeded only from its own interests, the country would not  have been dealt with so brutally. They know full well that  Iraq's development will benefit the Arab nation, no matter how  far they go in promoting borders and regionalism.    The embargo will erode and be smashed through the  capabilities of society, and it will be lifted completely when  the enemies realize that it is impossible to achieve their  objectives. In our confrontation, we rely above all on our own  capabilities. From the first day of the aggression and the  embargo, and despite their claims that it would be lifted when  the fighting ended or the reason was removed, we did not trust  the party who made the decision because it was made for  conspiratorial purposes and that party planned to maintain it.  We did not await a decision ending the embargo from the same  party that imposed it. Yes, today, we are making intensive  efforts to build our capabilities and to face the basic  dilemmas. The main planner of the embargo wanted to deprive our  citizens of fuel, electricity, and water. These are three basic  things that would exhaust the resistance of any country in a few  months. But in only a few weeks, our capabilities managed to  restore fuel, electricity, and water. I do not think that there  is a country in our region (and I do not say the world, so that  I will not be accused of exaggeration) where the situation of  water, electricity, and fuel in terms of price, competence, and  power, matches that of Iraq, although those facilities were  deliberately attacked by the colonialist alliance. We began and  continued to reconstruct everything that was destroyed, not only  the projects dealing with water, electricity, and fuel. We can  say today that the building of the economic structure is better  in Iraq than in any other country in the region. If we compare  situations in the region's states with that of besieged Iraq, we  will find that Iraq's is much better.    Now that we have overcome many problems and dilemmas, our  main burden remains food and medicine, which raised inflation  greatly. This is frequently natural. We cannot say why  inflation in Iraq today is high; we do not know the reason. We  cannot say if the reason is a faulty economic structure or the  wrong economic development policy.    Inflation in Iraq is going up as it is in other Arab  countries that are neither in a state of war nor under an unjust  blockade; countries that, moreover, claim good relations with  the entire world and friendship with the world capitalist  countries and the countries that protect and run international  funds that provide loans, grants, and aid. Nevertheless, those  countries face higher inflation rate than Iraq.    We managed to provide better living conditions for the  Iraqis. Our current crisis has a time limit that is mainly  linked to the promotion of the agricultural sector and the  provision of most basic foodstuffs, which play a major role in  inflation. At the same time, we have in mind a host of measures  and are now implementing them gradually, to prolong the  steadfastness of the Iraqis against the American international  conspiracy. We trust that the harmful effects of the economic  blockade on many countries will start to appear--if they have  not already appeared. These countries include Turkey, Russia,  France, and many other countries that began to speak about the  impact of the blockade on them and about their financial losses  as a result of implementing the embargo against Iraq. They are  demanding that this embargo be reconsidered. Of course, had the  Iraqis not held out and continued building and construction, the  impact of the blockade on the entire foreign scene would not  have been felt. Stopping the economy and development in Iraq is  an extremely serious issue that will negatively affect many  countries, not only Iraq. We will overcome the blockade, and by  doing so, we will not be merely passing a crisis but embarking  on new breakthroughs and progress.    [Muhammad] We have seen and sensed many major achievements  in  the area of construction, but perhaps the most important one is  the progress in agricultural development. Why this turn toward  agriculture? What kind of facilities have you offered to  citizens? Are you facing any obstacles in this field?    [Ramadan] As you know, ancient Iraq was called the land of  fertility, not only the land of Mesopotamia. This means Iraq is  distinguished from many countries. No single inch of Iraq is  unfit for agriculture, and as they say, no single inch  underground does not contain oil. Iraq is very rich in arable  land but there are some problems. Some agricultural areas are  highly salty and need reclamation, others need irrigation  projects, others need facilities to get water through, and  others need unconventional irrigation techniques. But in  principle, all Iraqi lands, including the desert area on the  Iraqi-Jordanian border, are suitable for agriculture and for the  growing of grains in particular.    I do not say that the February 1968 revolution was not  concerned with the agricultural sector, but practically the  revolution did not turn all attention to that sector because of  the availability of other resources, especially oil, and the  ease with which many foodstuffs could be imported. We admit  that we did not push our agricultural sector as strongly as it  should have been. One of the most important results of the  blockade and of the Mother of all Battles, therefore, was giving  top priority to agriculture within the reconstruction process.  This is why you now find three major dams being constructed at  the same time with Iraqi resources. Despite the blockade, there  are a number of large- scale reclamation projects. I tell you  that at the best times, when Iraq used to receive billions in  revenue, you could not find three dams under construction at the  same time.    Because there is extensive land reclamation, there are great  facilities in the ownership of land. We put no restriction on  the ownership of land. Previously, we said that the owner must  be a peasant and from the region where the land is located. Now  we give land and provide several facilities to any Iraqi  citizen, peasant or not, as soon as he shows readiness to work  in agriculture. We bear in mind that if the profits of the  agricultural sector are not good, people will not be interested.  As you know, 90 percent of the effort in the commercial sector  is parasitic and nonproductive. Yet, many countries provide  facilities for commerce, and you find many people getting into  it and lines of brokers appearing. In agricultural and  industrial sectors, on the other hand, you find hindrances and  obstacles. Therefore, we offered many facilities in buying  lands, seeds, machinery, and fertilizers. People were  encouraged and responsive, and today we have made major strides  in this area. In the next two years, when a number of dams and  reclamation projects currently under implementation are  completed, Iraq will see a radical and decisive development in  the area of agriculture. We will not be satisfied with planting  in only the land around the two rivers; we will plant in desert  lands, beginning with the oases on the road between al-Anbar and  Jordan. We insist on this policy even after the lifting of the  unjust blockade; we must achieve self-sufficiency in food, and  the agricultural sector must join that of minerals in the field  of exports.    [Muhammad] Intense and complicated talks have been going on  for seven months between Iraq and the UN special committee  headed by Rolf Ekeus to look into the economic blockade. These  talks seem to be facing numerous difficulties that threaten them  with failure. What are the United Nations' real conditions for  lifting the blockade on Iraq and what are the difficulties  facing Rolf Ekeus' committee? What is your assessment of the UN  plan to export Iraqi oil?    [Ramadan] Frankly, if the malicious and conspiratorial  intentions of the United States, in particular, come to an end,  you would find no problem between Iraq and the UN committee.  The situation is obvious, and we have complied with the  Security Council resolutions although we were disgusted by them.  Thus, the blockade and problems should have ended long ago but  the Americans' malicious intentions, provoked by Zionism,  prevented this from happening.    The United States places impediments and obstacles to the  committee's work to foil its tasks. We do not look forward to  the lifting of the blockade through the resumption of Iraqi oil  exports according to the UN-proposed plan, which is another form  of blockade against Iraq that causes psychological harm to the  citizens. Yes, we want the blockade to be lifted and oil  exports to be resumed but only in a manner that does not harm  our independence and national sovereignty. We want Iraq to sell  and buy without intervention by any power in its affairs. As  for the current plan to resume oil exports according to their  own way, it is rejected because it constitutes a flagrant  intervention in our affairs and sovereignty.    [Muhammad] U.S. aircraft have penetrated Iraqi airspace  numerous times. What is the truth and aims of these violations?  Will the Iraqi response in the future be confined to forwarding  memoranda of denunciation to the United Nations and the Security  Council as is the case now?    [Ramadan] We will examine the situation in the proper time  and have a response to them, God willing. These violations  provide new evidence and indications for those far and near to  know what America exactly wants and whether it sponsors peace or  terrorism.    We say facts indicate that the United States, which claims  to  be fighting terrorism, sponsors it everywhere. We assert that  the U.S. aircrafts' violation of Iraqi airspace is a violation  of Iraq's sovereignty and independence. I wonder, isn't a state  that violates the sovereignty of another state a leader and  advocate of terrorism? Where is international legitimacy, the  Security Council, and the United Nations and why do we not hear  their voices?    [Muhammad] The situation in northern Iraq is extremely  ambiguous. What exactly is happening there and what is your  assessment of the situation now after the establishment of a  Kurdish government there?    [Ramadan] We cannot say that there is a Kurdish state or  government in the north. The Iraqi Administration, troops,  organizations, and institutions have withdrawn from the north of  our own free will. We were certain that the United States and  the allies wanted to exhaust Iraq's power and capability for  steadfastness, construction, and development by keeping us busy  in a war with their agents in the north. They wanted to exhaust  our power, so we avoided the trap they set for us. Now the real  identity of the Israeli and U.S. agents in the north has become  clear to our people there. The presence of these Kurdish agents  in the north today depends on the presence of U.S. troops in  Turkey, whose mandate there has been renewed for another six  months. It is now obvious that the presence of the U.S. troops,  better known as the "Hammer," is to protect the Kurdish agents  in the north. The day the U.S. troops leave, the ordinary Kurds  will kick these agents out of the Iraqi land for good. Let me  assure you that what is happening now in the north is not a  permanent situation but part of the series of schemes against  Iraq.    [Muhammad] The foreign media continue to report problems in  southern Iraq and in the marshes. What exactly is the situation  there?    [Ramadan] The situation in the south and the marshes is  completely safe. Not only is it normal, it is better than good.  I invite you to visit the south to see for yourself. (N.B.)  [newspaper-supplied editorial note] I embarked on a  journalistic fact-finding mission in southern Iraq for two days,  during which I was convinced that things there are normal and  calm.    [Muhammad] The human rights organizations, especially  Amnesty  International and the Arab Organization for Human Rights, say  that there are executions, arrests, and violations of human  rights in Iraq, particularly against the merchants, that the  Iraqi leadership is behind. They also note that Iraq is yet to  see any radical improvement in the field of public freedom,  political pluralism, and real press freedom. What is your  comment on this?    [Ramadan] These organizations are either agents,  implementing  suspicious schemes, or ignorant about the facts and the  situation in Iraq. Iraq has entered a war with all the  conspiratorial countries in the world, and the war is  continuing. Up to now, Iraq has not introduced any emergency  measures, although it is facing an aggression and an unjust  embargo. However, if there are false tears, concern, and fear  for the merchants, let me stress to you that we will detain and  pass the people's sentence against any merchant who tampers with  or hoards the people's food. In the law of God and humanity, he  who strips the people of their food must be beheaded. I wonder:  What merchants do the human rights groups mean? Shall we give  freedom to merchants who tamper with the people's fate and means  of livelihood? What do the Arab governments do to merchants who  tamper with their peoples' means of sustenance? The Arab  governments, which are part of this aggression and the embargo,  as well as the unjust merchants are now shedding false tears  over the execution of the corrupt merchants. We grant honest  merchants major facilities to work honestly, but we pursue  whoever tries to starve the people. This is our policy. If  this policy runs counter to so-called democracy, then we reject  this democracy because we have a responsibility to the people.    As for political pluralism, we have issued a law on it and  anyone who wants to form a party can come forward. But we want  parties that think about what to do for Iraq under its current  circumstances; parties that struggle, bear full responsibility,  and offer something new, not engage in one-upmanship for power.    We issued a law on pluralism before the blockade but no  party  has come forward; this is due to Iraq's current circumstances.  Once the blockade is over, Iraq will witness actual and real  implementation of the pluralism law, but now we are in a state  of war.    [Muhammad] Currently, there is talk that Arab popular  movements and organizations are retreating from solidarity with  Iraq. What is your comment on this and what is currently  required of the Arab popular movements and organizations in the  context of their solidarity with Iraq?    [Ramadan] The popular movement in the Arab arena is growing  enormously today. As for the situation at the official level,  it is wavering, at the best of times, and conspiratorial at  other times. The official Arab stand is conspiratorial and  undoubtedly casts its shadow on the popular situation. Had the  official stand toward Iraq not been so, the popular stand would  have been different from what it is now and would have  demonstrated great and true solidarity with us.    We are not mistaken about the Arab citizen's beliefs and  convictions toward us, but the official policies hamper his  solidarity with us. Hence, we should not accuse the popular  political organizations and parties of something that is not  their fault and ignore the official stand and its pressure and  effects on these organizations and parties.    [Muhammad] Our Arab region is experiencing serious and  crucial developments--foremost of which is the settlement to  liquidate the Palestinian cause--that cause Iraq's crisis not to  be placed on the agenda of Arab efforts and moves. How do you  assess this situation and the Gaza-Jericho accord?    [Ramadan] We have a principled and historical view of the  Palestinian issue linked with the tenet of the Socialist Ba'th  Party that leads the government and people in Iraq. Iraq's  stand is obvious and public; that is to say we will not give an  inch of the Palestinian territories. However, Iraq is currently  experiencing a historical situation that forces it not to be  vociferous about the issue; but this will not change our stand a  bit.    Giving dialogues and meetings for the capitulatory  settlement  precedence over Iraq's cause or the blockade is something  natural because the "ramshackle" collection of Arab states  described as conspiring and wavering are making use of the  current phase of the Palestinian cause. I wonder what the Arab  countries have done on the blockade on Iraq?    We will never forget that the first forum to beat the war  drums and declare war on Iraq was the Cairo conference. This  conference gave a legitimate cover to the UN Security Council  resolutions. We will also not forget that your party was the  first that issued a statement denouncing the Cairo conference  before the Egyptian and Arab public. It is not strange to see  that there is great interest in carrying out the capitulatory  political settlement, exploiting for this purpose the current  poor Arab circumstances, particularly Iraq's circumstances. If  Iraq's circumstances were different, the Arab situation would be  very different too. Is it not very strange to find some Arab  countries speaking of abolishing the Arab economic boycott of  Israel but not saying anything about abolishing the unjust  blockade against Iraq? Indeed these countries are demanding that  this blockade be tightened. This illustrates the extent of the  current deterioration, complacency, and conspiracy in official  Arab circles.    [Muhammad] What is your opinion of the stance adopted by the  Palestinian leadership--the PLO--on the Gaza-Jericho agreement?    [Ramadan] I do not believe that there is such a thing as a  Palestinian leadership today; not after all that has happened.  There is a stance adopted by some individuals who will bear the  responsibility for what they are doing. If we think of the PLO  as the Palestinian leadership, then we must remember that more  than half of the PLO's members are not around anymore. Some  have resigned, some have adopted completely different positions.  It is clear that the decisions that are being made now are not  decisions agreed on during PLO meetings but those made solely by  the PLO chairman and some other members who do not represent  that organization. We assure everyone that the Gaza-Jericho  agreement blocks all the ways to liberate Palestinian land in  the future. This agreement contradicts the goals of the  Palestinian cause. We find no future promise in all the  agreements on Gaza and Jericho. We see in these agreements an  end of the Palestinian cause as far as the enemies and the  complacent ones who have tired of the struggle are concerned.  The Palestinian people, however, will never forget their land  and sovereignty.    [Muhammad] What are the latest developments on the Iraqi-  Iranian scene? Why have the public and covert negotiations  between the two countries failed?    [Ramadan] We have two unresolved issues with Iran: the POW  issue, on which nothing new has happened, and the Iraqi planes  in Iran. Intermediaries are trying to work out the second issue  but nothing concrete has happened. Unless these two issues are  settled, we can have no normal relations with Iran.    [Muhammad] Are there any new developments regarding the ties  with Egypt?    [Ramadan] After we established interest sections here and in  Egypt to handle the affairs of our and their citizens, nothing  new happened. We welcome Egyptian nationals here and protect  their interests and rights.</p>

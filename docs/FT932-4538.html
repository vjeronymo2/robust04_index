			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Drug investigation takes new turn in charging judicial policemen AN investigation into links between the Mexican police and drug traffickers, begun by Mr Jorge Carpizo, the attorney-general (pictured above at a press conference), has taken a new turn with the charging of six judicial policemen, writes Lucy Conger in Mexico City. The six have been charged with protecting the leader of the Sinaloa cartel, allegedly responsible for a shoot-out with rivals at Guadalajara airport on May 24 which left a Roman Catholic cardinal and six other people dead. The detainees, also charged with criminal association and drug-related crimes, include two federal judicial police commanders and the director-general of the Jalisco state judicial police, based in Guadalajara. Mr Carpizo has sent shockwaves through the security forces in the five months since assuming his post, and is investigating more than 200 federal judicial policemen suspected of having links to the drugs trade. Mounting criticism of the investigation prompted Mr Carpizo on Monday to offer his resignation.</p>

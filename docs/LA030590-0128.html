			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JANET JACKSON SELLS OUT ALL 4 FORUM SHOWS IN 48 MINUTES  </P> <P> Singer Janet Jackson sold out four shows at the Forum in just 48 minutes  Sunday, with two of the shows instantly added to her schedule to accommodate  waiting ticket-buyers, a spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Fans lined up at ticket outlets around Southern California to buy tickets for  Jackson's announced April 20 and 21 shows and bought out the $22 tickets, at  four per customer, in 22 minutes, said spokeswoman Maureen O'Connor.  </P> <P> With fans still in line, organizers announced that two additional shows will be  added April 25 and 26. In 48 minutes, the 80,000 tickets for all four shows  were sold.  </P> <P> Jackson's single "Escapade" is No. 1 on Billboard's pop charts, and her album,  "Rhythm Nation 1814," has sold more than 4 million copies.  </P> <P> O'Connor said the two extra Forum concert dates were being held in reserve.  "They were trying to be conservative because she has never toured before. They  just wanted to see what the market would bear," she said.  </P> <P> The 23-year-old singer's Los Angeles appearances kick off a 100-show,  nine-month tour. Jackson did not tour after the release of her 1986 album,  "Control."  </P> <P> Because of the added Los Angeles dates, Jackson's appearances in Oakland have  been changed to April 28 and 29.  </P></p>

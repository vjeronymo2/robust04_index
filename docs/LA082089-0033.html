			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT HOME: IN IRVINE: IRVINE, WHERE NOT MUCH IS LEFT TO CHANCE;  </P> <P> ORDERLY GROWTH WITH CONSISTENT ARCHITECTURE, OPEN SPACE AND LOTS OF ROOM TO DO  BUSINESS.  </P> <P> To get an idea of how fast Irvine has grown, think back to the late 1960s.  Orange County was already big enough to support a major league baseball team  and Disneyland, but Irvine didn't even have a supermarket.  </P> <P> Early residents such as Mary Lou and Ed Chavez, who moved into the area from  Laguna Beach in 1966, had to drive to Corona del Mar, Tustin or Costa Mesa for  groceries, and they couldn't take the San Diego Freeway, because it hadn't yet  been extended through the area.  </P> <P> "It was quite an event in our lives when we finally got a store and a gas  station," recalled Mary Lou, a retired elementary school teacher.  </P> <P> Today, Irvine has its share of supermarkets, gas stations and other trappings  of development. The population stands at about 100,000, up from 62,000 in 1980.  During a stretch in the '70s and early '80s, Irvine was the state's  fastest-growing city. And there's more to come: By the turn of the century,  planners estimate the city will have 225,000 residents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Earned National Reputation  </P> <P> The city's business development has been equally impressive. Already, four of  Orange County's six largest publicly held companies call Irvine home. More  firms are being lured to the Irvine Spectrum, an ambitious business park now  taking shape at the junction of the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways.  </P> <P> Irvine has earned a national reputation as a carefully thought-out city. A  zealous master plan has kept growth orderly and property values rising. But  critics see in the greenbelts and consistent architecture a community sapped of  vitality.  </P> <P> An article in The Washington Post last year complained that Irvine "is a place  with no possibility of surprise, or chance, no spontaneous diversity." The  story loosely compared the city with the Stepford wives -- "perfect in a  horrifying sort of way."  </P> <P> Residents bristle at such criticism.  </P> <P> "The people who write that Irvine has no character come from places with  billboards, junkyards and body shops, and they're trying to rationalize why  they live where they do," said Joyce Birdwell, a senior engineering designer at  Printronix Inc., an Irvine-based firm that builds computer printers.  </P> <P> Birdwell first heard about the city in the mid-'80s while living in Houston,  and what she heard was mostly positive. She moved to Irvine about three years  ago after a short stay in El Segundo.  </P> <P> Ed DeLeonardis, a radiologist who grew up in Glendale, moved to Irvine with his  wife and three children four years ago. He concedes that Irvine has a  reputation problem with certain outsiders.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ban on Billboards  </P> <P> "Some people go out of their way to put down Irvine as a place full of yuppies  and status-oriented people," DeLeonardis said. "But I don't think Irvine's all  that different from other areas with similar income levels."  </P> <P> If Irvine looks homogenous, it's because of the planning and zoning controls.  Besides banning billboards, the city makes sure that television antennas are  kept out of sight and telephone lines underground. Irvine has numerous parks,  and nearly every boulevard has landscaping, which helps hide gas stations and  other unsightly business establishments.  </P> <P> In most neighborhoods people can't paint their homes an unapproved color or  keep a recreation vehicle parked for long on the street.  </P> <P> These measures and features have come in response to the blight created in  other Southern California communities.  </P> <P> "Safeguards have been put in regarding landscaping and traffic so that you  don't have billboards and harsh streetscapes, as in a lot of older areas,"  DeLeonardis said. Most Irvine residents seem to accept these restrictions as a  way to keep property values up.  </P> <P> Despite the rapid growth of the past two decades, Irvine still has plenty of  crop land interspersed among developments. This open space harks back to the  area's agricultural origin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gold Rush Merchant  </P> <P> In 1864, four men, led by James Irvine -- a Scots-Irish immigrant who had  become a successful San Francisco merchant during the Gold Rush -- purchased  parts of three Spanish-Mexican land grants and used the property to raise  sheep.  </P> <P> Six years later, Irvine bought out his partners. In 1894, his son, J. I.  Irvine, incorporated this land into the Irvine Co. and started to shift the  focus to crop production.  </P> <P> By the turn of the century, a settlement of tenant farmers had taken root in  what's now the eastern part of town, near where Sand Canyon Avenue crosses  under the Santa Ana Freeway. Several historic buildings, including a lima  bean-packing plant, have been renovated as part of Old Town Irvine.  </P> <P> Today, the Irvine Co. continues to lease land to tenant farmers, who grow  oranges, strawberries, asparagus, bell peppers and other crops in various  fields scattered around the city.  </P> <P> And despite the pressures of suburbanization, agriculture won't disappear  entirely from the scene. Last year, the Irvine Co. agreed to transfer 8,000  acres of open space to the city -- much of it crop land -- in return for  various development concessions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Still a Bit Isolated'  </P> <P> Residents generally applaud the decision to preserve some open space.  </P> <P> "One unique aspect of Irvine is that we're still a bit isolated," DeLeonardis  said. Farmland greets motorists coming into the city from either direction on  the Santa Ana Freeway. "You know when you're entering and leaving town," he  said.  </P> <P> Around Turtle Rock, on Irvine's southwestern flank, much of the open land has  been kept wild. Vicki Weatherhead, a secretary who has lived in Turtle Rock  with her family since 1975, still spots a variety of wildlife, including  coyotes and red-tail hawks.  </P> <P> "And we've have quails eating in our back yard," she said.  </P> <P> Unlike the other developed parts of Irvine, Turtle Rock is hilly and relatively  isolated. Perhaps this explains why some Turtle Rock residents have become so  tightly knit, Weatherhead said.  </P> <P> On each major holiday, for instance, the people on her street throw a potluck  block party. On average, about 30 residents and guests show up. "This has been  going on since before I moved in," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> High Property Prices  </P> <P> Blessed by geography, Turtle Rock has become Irvine's priciest area. The most  expensive residential properties run about $1 million, according to Ruth  Jacobs, an agent at ERA-Main Street Realty. That's well above the $306,000  median price for a detached house in Irvine.  </P> <P> On the low end of the city's price scale, a three-bedroom, two-bath house in El  Camino, a neighborhood near the Marine Corps Air Station in Tustin, can be  bought for $225,000, Jacobs added.  </P> <P> Irvine condominiums sell for a median price of $158,000. The range is from  $115,000 for a two-bedroom unit in a development called Orangetree, near Irvine  Valley College, to $750,000 or so for a four-bedroom view condo in Turtle Rock.  </P> <P> Overall, housing prices in Irvine jumped 36% during the 12 months ending last  May. The rate of increase has since slowed, and properties are staying on the  market a bit longer, Jacobs said. "There's a lot more inventory than there was  last year at this time."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Buyers From Outside  </P> <P> Rich Steinhoff, a broker at ERA-Main Street Realty, said the hefty price jumps  of the recent past have put Irvine out of reach of many first-time buyers. "The  market is mostly move-up," he said, and the vast majority of buyers come from  outside the city.  </P> <P> Why are people attracted to Irvine?  </P> <P> Residents are quick to recite a checklist of items they like about their city:  cleanliness, open space, order, an extensive network of bike trails, numerous  recreational facilities and low crime (the third-safest place in Orange County,  according to a recent state report).  </P> <P> Irvine's public education system also gets high marks. Two high schools  (Woodbridge and University) have been recognized for excellence in education by  the federal government.  </P> <P> The people who live in Irvine also boast about -- of all things -- the city's  growing role as an entertainment center. Top musicians regularly perform at the  Irvine Meadows Amphitheater.  </P> <P> </P> <P> University Offerings  </P> <P> The acrobatic Blue Angels put on aerial shows at El Toro Marine Corps Air  Station which borders Irvine. Then there's The Improv, one of Orange County's  few comedy clubs, and Wild Rivers, an aquatic amusement park.  </P> <P> Above all, UC Irvine features a steady offering of concerts, plays, speeches  and sporting events. "Most communities don't have a major university in their  back yard," DeLeonardis noted.  </P> <P> But it wasn't always like this. David Howitt, an electrical contractor who  moved his family down from Santa Barbara in 1971, remembers University High's  Friday night football games as the main social event in the area.  </P> <P> "You went whether you had kids at the school or not," he said.  </P> <P> Of the problems brought by rapid development, longtime residents seem to  complain about traffic most. The Chavezes still remember when they used to  drive the length of Culver Drive, Irvine's main drag, without seeing another  car. Today, motorists can't go far without getting slowed by traffic or the  many left-hand-turn stoplights on the busy thoroughfare.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Caught Off Guard  </P> <P> DeLeonardis believes Irvine's planners have been caught off guard by the  general increase in vehicular volume.  </P> <P> For example, now that Alton Parkway has been extended to the Saddleback Valley,  providing commuters from the south with an alternative to the San Diego  Freeway, surface traffic has increased in Irvine.  </P> <P> "That has caught some planners and politicians by surprise," said DeLeonardis.  As a result, he figures that city officials will more carefully scrutinize the  impact of future road extensions.  </P> <P> The El Toro Marine base creates a different sort of problem for residents in  the eastern part of the city.  </P> <P> "Jets fly out of the base, occasionally at 3 in the morning, and so low that  the house shakes," said Cathleen Mattie, who rents a condo in the Northwood  section of Irvine. Even so, Mattie likes the city, and she considers rental  rates in the area reasonable. "You get a lot more for the money than in Costa  Mesa," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rule Out Move-Up  </P> <P> Mattie graduated two years ago from Cal State Fullerton, and now works as  publications coordinator at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. She said  she would like to buy in Irvine someday but sees a definite affordability  problem. "Buying isn't in the works right now," she said.  </P> <P> Even some established homeowners don't believe they can afford to trade up in  Irvine. Birdwell views herself in that situation, despite a large increase in  the value of her one-bedroom Northwood condo since she purchased it in 1987.  </P> <P> "I'm definitely happy about the appreciation, but to sell my unit and buy  another place in Irvine is totally out of the question," she said.  </P> <P> Howitt and his wife came to the same conclusion, but they decided to take the  money and move. The Howitts recently sold their home in The Ranch, one of  Irvine's first neighborhoods, for $272,000. They had paid $33,000 for the  1,800-square-foot property in 1971.  </P> <P> The Howitts are moving to Menifee, a new planned community in Riverside County.  In part, they decided to leave Irvine to cash in on their home's appreciation.  But also, they want to rediscover the quiet life they once enjoyed in Orange  County.  </P> <P> "All in all, Irvine's still a pretty fine city," Howitt said. "But I guess  you'd call us country people at heart."  </P> <P> </P> <P> AT A GLANCEPopulation  </P> <P> 1989 estimate: 100,803  </P> <P> 1980-89 change: + 57.9%  </P> <P> Median age: 32.7 years  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix  </P> <P> White: 80.4%  </P> <P> Other: 9.6%  </P> <P> Latino: 8.6%  </P> <P> Black: 1.4%  </P> <P> Annual income  </P> <P> Per capita: $22,907  </P> <P> Median household: $57,438  </P> <P> Household distribution  </P> <P> Less than $15,000: 5.1%  </P> <P> $15,000 - $30,000: 10.7%  </P> <P> $30,000 - $50,000: 25.2%  </P> <P> $50,000 - $75,000: 30.2%  </P> <P> $75,000: + 28.7%  </P> <P> </P></p>

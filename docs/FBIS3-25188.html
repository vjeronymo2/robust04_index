Ajello told MEDIAFAX yesterday that "right now, it is just a  matter of prestige for the two sides (the government and the  Mozambique National Resistance, Renamo)." "This issue has  become a matter of principle and that should have been avoided."    We approached Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana for an  opinion,  after apprising him of Ajello's views.    Hunguana replied that Ajello's reading of the problem  revealed "naivete, to say the least."    Hunguana asked: "Why is it that Renamo defies decisions made  by the competent organs? What is the real reason?"    To the labor minister, the most recent pronouncements by  Dhlakama and Ngonhamo are at variance with the logic of the  peace process, leading to speculation that Renamo has a hidden  agenda that includes the use of force.    Does the goverment take a military view of Renamo's  insistence on maintaining its military position in Salamanga?    "Such an interpretation cannot be excluded", Hunguana  replied. [passage omitted]    This is Renamo's Jose de Castro's version of the events:  Renamo agreed to leave the relevant farming area in Salamanga  and move 700 meters away from it "to avoid controversy", but the  government wants Renamo to shift its men to at least 10 km from  it. Castro told MEDIAFAX that Renamo asked for that area for  logistical reasons, adding that it offers good conditions for an  assembly area. He confirmed that, at a meeting of the  Supervision and Control Commission, CSC, Renamo had conveyed its  belief that the government wanted Renamo out of the farming area  because it had been given to Transport and Communications  Minister Armando Guebuza.    Ajello announced publicly on 8 February that he would launch  "an initiative" to settle the problem.    We asked him: What initiative? To which he simply replied  that it would be an initiative "outside the usual channels" to  "get us out of this trap." Ajello believes that there will be  no logistical problems for the UN Operations in Mozambique,  should it need to move the Renamo forces to one of two assembly  areas--one 10 km and the other 30 km from the disputed area.    Other than that, Ajello believes the process is going  satisfactorily. To the extent that elections may be held in  October? "We must have elections in October", he categorically  replied, adding: "We have no other choice."    Not even a smaller UN budget for, let us say, another six  months, until April 1995?    "No, elections must be held in October." [passage omitted]</p>

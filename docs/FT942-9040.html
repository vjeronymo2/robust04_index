			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Caribbean urged to continue reform / Review of the CDB report Caribbean governments must continue to restructure their economies in order to deal with rapid changes in the global environment, according to the annual report of the Caribbean Development Bank, published this week. In a review of its members' economies, the bank which is based in Barbados, said that the medium-term prospects for Caribbean economies were not encouraging due to increased pressure on both the private and public sectors to become more open and more efficient in order to meet the demands of trade liberalisation. Without sustained growth in the industrialised economies and changes in domestic economic policy, the Caribbean region can expect no better than the moderate levels of growth which most countries in the region recorded last year, the bank cautioned. The bank said that whilst some of its borrowing members recorded relatively high levels of growth last year, the majority turned in a disappointing performance 'with growth remaining in the lower ranges.' Unemployment rates stayed high and the fiscal situation of many governments remained tight. Growth rates of between 7.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent in gross domestic product were recorded last year by some countries, including Guyana, the Cayman Islands and Belize, the bank reported. Lower than expected earnings from banana exports adversely affected growth in the Windward Islands of Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia and St Vincent, the report continued. Jamaica recorded low growth because of marginal expansion in bauxite and agricultural commodities, while Trinidad and Tobago's economy contracted because of the weak state of the international market for oil, the country's main export. 'The resumption of economic growth in North America had a positive impact on visitor arrivals in a number of member countries,' the report noted. While most resort countries in the region benefited from the increase in stay over visitors and cruise ship calls last year, the industry in the Bahamas remained weak, the bank said. The tourism sector will be among the first to reflect an improvement in the resumption of growth in the main markets, the CDB predicted. Fluctuations in the dollar exchange rate led to a decline in banana production and exports, particularly from the Windward Islands. The industry was affected by changes in banana marketing arrangements in Europe, 'which will at the outset provide increased access for lower cost Latin American fruit and eventually result in the phasing out of preferential market access from traditional countries,' said the CDB. Cumulative sugar production in the bank's members last year was 732,000 tonnes, three per cent less than 1992 production. The largest fall of 10 per cent was in Barbados, while the biggest absolute decline was in Jamaica where production fell 7,900 tonnes. A fall in crude oil production in Trinidad and Tobago will continue, said the bank, 'with the outlook for international prices not being particularly encouraging given the inability of Opec members to limit output to agreed production quotas, and given the likelihood of the eventual return of Iraqi production to world markets.' Weak international prices for aluminium depressed the mining and refining of bauxite in Jamaica and Guyana last year, the report noted. The bank concluded that the region is likely to find increasing difficultly in obtaining external funding, citing the trend for traditional donors to now consider what they perceive as more pressing needs in eastern Europe and Africa.</p>

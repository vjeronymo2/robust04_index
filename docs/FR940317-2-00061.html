How To Review Listed Material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Transmittals or Program Memoranda can be reviewed at a local FDL. Under the FDL program, government publications are sent to approximately 1400 designated libraries throughout the United States. Interested parties may examine the documents at any one of the FDLs. Some may have arrangements to transfer material to a local library not designated as an FDL. To locate the nearest FDL, individuals should contact any library.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, individuals may contact regional depository libraries, which receive and retain at least one copy of most Federal government publications, either in printed or microfilm form, for use by the general public. These libraries provide reference services and interlibrary loans; however, they are not sales outlets. Individuals may obtain information about the location of the nearest regional depository library from any library.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Superintendent of Documents numbers for each HCFA publication are shown in Addendum III, along with the HCFA publication and transmittal numbers. To help FDLs locate the instruction, use the Superintendent of Documents number, plus the HCFA transmittal number. For example, to find the Carriers Manual, Part 2_Program Administration (HCFA&hyph;Pub. 14&hyph;2) transmittal entitled ``The Contractor Performance Evaluation Program_FY 1993,'' use the Superintendent of Documents No. HE 22.8/7&hyph;3, and the HCFA transmittal number 123.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI.

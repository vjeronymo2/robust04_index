			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jordan cultivates phosphates exports - The industry's moves into wider markets DESPITE a depression in the world market for phosphates and potash, Jordan is proving to be a remarkably resilient exporter. Jordan Phosphate Mines Company, which is majority-owned by the state, last year captured 15.3 per cent of world phosphate exports, making it the number two exporter of phosphate rock, behind Morocco and overtaking the US. Potash sales in 1992 were up to 3.24 per cent of total world exports. Furthermore, Jordan's mining sector is rapidly changing to meet the demands of the market and it seems set to become a big producer of complex fertilisers and chemicals by the end of the century. JPMC's phosphate exports fell from 6.4m tonnes in 1989 to 4.2m tonnes in 1991 - in line with a 37.7 per cent drop in world exports of phosphate rock in 1989-92 and the collapse of the company's traditional eastern European markets. The company's exports picked up slightly to 4.3m tonnes last year, and results from the first half of this year suggest that a similar figure is likely for 1993. The lower exports - in addition to falling international prices and severe government taxes recently implemented under Jordan's economic restructuring programme - have slashed the JPMC's net profits almost seven-fold over the past four years. Last year the company registered a net profit of only 16.1m Jordanian dinars (Dollars 22.8m) compared with JD33.1m in 1991 and JD109m in 1989. However, JPMC's general manager, Mr Thabet Taher, brushes aside any talk of doom and gloom. With a gradual shift of trade towards the rapidly expanding Asian markets, and two major joint ventures for the production of phosphate-based fertilisers and phosphoric acid already signed with Indian and Japanese companies, he is optimistic about the future. Contracts with India have partly replaced the loss of eastern European markets. Despite distortions in India's demand for fertiliser, caused by the government's recent abolition of price controls, Jordan shipped 1.3m tonnes of phosphate to India last year - making it JPMC's biggest client. In 1991, a Dollars 150m joint venture was signed with India's Southern Petrochemicals Corporation to produce an annual 200,000 tonnes of phosphoric acid for the Indian market. A new processing plant with 60 per cent Indian and 40 per cent Jordanian equity is due to begin operations in 1995 and, according to Mr Taher, Indian demand may be increased to 400,000 tonnes. A similar deal was signed last year with a Mitsubishi-led consortium of four Japanese companies that will take a 60 per cent share in a Dollars 360m compound fertiliser plant. JPMC and Arab Potash Company (APC), Jordan's other main exporter, will each have a 20 per cent holding. Under the agreement, a new plant, due to open in 1995, will produce 300,000 tonnes of compound fertiliser for Japan, which is about 10 per cent of the country's entire consumption. JPMC is negotiating with trading partners in Pakistan to establish another joint venture that will produce material for the Pakistani market. Meanwhile, APC is also following strategies of product diversification and expansion as a means of securing its future. The company, which has a phosphate plant on the Dead Sea, is 58 per cent owned by the Jordan government and 42 per cent by foreign Arab investors. It has maintained annual exports of potash of between 1.3 and 1.4m tonnes over the past five years. Unlike JPMC, APC exports have been relatively unaffected by the political upheavals of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union as most of its trade is with Asian countries. Last year it exported a total of 1.35m tonnes of phosphate, 87 per cent of which went to Asian markets. But APC has seen its profits fall. Despite a 12 per cent drop in exports between 1991 and 1992, net profits fell from JD38m to JD28m, mainly because of an increase in government levies. APC's plans include a two-phase expansion programme, already under way at its Dead Sea site, which will increase potash production capacity to 1.8m tonnes by 1994 and 2.2m tonnes by the year 2000. George Wimpey International is the contractor. In addition, a Dollars 600m Dead Sea chemicals complex is due to begin operations in 1995. It will produce bromine derivatives, magnesium oxide and potassium-based fertilisers. APC's managing director, Mr Ali Yousef Ensour, explains that loans of Dollars 31m from the World Bank and the Jeddah-based Islamic Bank for Development have so far been agreed upon. Additional funding is expected to be raised by APC and foreign investors. Two US companies, Ethyl Corporation and Great Lakes Chemicals, are assisting with the technical side of the plans. With the abundance of raw materials and the unique saline composition of the Dead Sea, Mr Ensour says he is confident the complex will put Jordan on the map as a highly competitive chemical producer in addition to its phosphate and potash exports.</p>

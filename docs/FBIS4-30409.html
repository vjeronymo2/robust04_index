			<p>BFN     [Text] At a news conference after a 24 June cabinet  meeting, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai commented on  the yen's rebound on New York Foreign Exchange Market, saying:  "Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii has also repeatedly said the  government will deal with currency movements with a resolute  attitude. We will maintain this attitude while considering a  concerted intervention with other countries." He thus indicated  a strong possibility of a concerted dollar-buying intervention  in currency markets with the United States and European  countries.</p>

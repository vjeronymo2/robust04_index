			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (12): A shadow on Qwerty's keys - Electronic Pen Technology THE QWERTY keyboard has always been an odd choice of interface between man and machine. It is difficult to use, and for many, intimidating. By the end of this decade, if the prophets of high technology are right, the keyboard may have been consigned to the dustbin, at least as far as portable computing is concerned. In its place could come voice or electronic pen technology, or a combination of the two. The hottest new products at last November's Comdex computer fair in Las Vegas were those operated by moving an electronic pen across a touch-sensitive screen or pad. Portable Computer manufacturers, including industry heavyweights Toshiba, Apple, and IBM are racing to deliver computers which take their commands from a pen rather than a keyboard. Some market researchers have predicted that 1m pen computers will be sold by 1995, but the market is in its infancy and the estimates vary wildly. Last year perhaps 100,000 pen-based machines were sold. Among the first pen-based machines to reach the market were hand-held machines from Poqet, the Fujitsu subsidiary, and the GRiDPad from Victor Technologies. Meanwhile NCR, the AT&amp;T subsidiary, has already launched a successor to its 3125 pen-based machine which was the first system based on Intel's 80386 microprocessor. The new NCR 3130 is based on the Intel 80386SL microprocessor, comes with two megabytes of RAM expandable to 16, flash memory or a hard disk, and weighs 4.4 pounds. A new screen texture has been used that feels more like paper than glass to write on. If the machine is dropped, it senses gravity changes and shuts the hard disk down. So far, two basic designs of pen computer have appeared: the clipboard and the palm-top. Clipboards are generally A4 size, weigh about 6lb, and are used just like a conventional pen and paper clipboard for collecting data or completing pre-defined electronic forms. Customised software enables engineers, market researchers, nurses or surveyors, for example, to gather data, with the pen operating like a glorified mouse, pointing to items on the screen to select them. On both sides of the Atlantic several companies have begun to use clipboard machines so as to achieve cost savings in paper-intensive areas. The UK Department of Trade has also sponsored the Freestyle projects to explore the use of pen computers in industry. But the biggest market share of the pen-based computer market is expected to go to the hand-held palm-tops. The most eagerly awaited of these is the Newton, Apple's 'personal digital assistant' which is due to be launched later this year. Newton, measuring 7in by 4in, will feature a flip-up lid and a thin electronic pen which clips onto the side of the casing. Once again, however, the development of the pen computer market, like the desktop PC market before it, could be constrained by competing software operating systems. In addition to Apple's Newton, there are already three competing operating systems, Microsoft's Windows for pen computing, which claims the support of more than 120 software vendors, Penpoint from GO, a Silicon Valley company and Geoworks. IBM is also understood to be working on a version of its OS/2 operating system for pen environments. Microsoft, in particular, is betting heavily on the success of pen computing. Mr Bill Gates, its chairman and co-founder, has said he expects pen computing to take off very rapidly. Hesees pen-based computer systems as 'the next generation of portable computers.' The company believes that the relative ease of using a pen-shaped electronic stylus instead of a keyboard will provide computer power to users like as lorry drivers, meter readers, the police and others who, because of their jobs, cannot use a conventional portable computer with a keyboard. However before pen computers become widely adopted, the character recognition software which they use for turning pen writing into computer text will have to become more sophisticated. At present most systems can just about cope with neatly-written capitals, but are lost when it comes to reading standard cursive writing. What is more, most typists, even the two-fingered variety, can write more quickly with a keyboard. For these reasons, some critics suggest that the advantages of pen computing are being overstated. One possible intermediate solution to this problem is to build machines which feature both keyboards and electronic pens. One such machine is the recently launched GRiD Convertible which looks and works like any other clamshell-type notebook computer. However, by using cunning hinges which drop the screen flat on its face, the Convertible can be closed with the screen on the outside. It can then be used like a conventional clipboard pen system. Meanwhile Sharp, the Japanese electronics group, will launch the latest in its IQ electronic organisers next month which for the first time uses pen technology. The IQ-9000 has a small keyboard and an electronic pen which can be used to activate the usual functions of an organiser on its touch sensitive screen. However, as in the PC market, any surge in pen-based computer sales will probably not happen until the development of application software will enable the machines to do really useful work - and no-one really knows what form that will take or when it will happen.</p>

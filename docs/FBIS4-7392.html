			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nguyen Duc Lu, M.A., Ho Chi Minh National </F> Institute of Politics]    [Text] Freedom of religion is one of the rights of people  and citizens. This right, like other legitimate rights, must be  respected on the legal, moral, and emotional fronts.    In Vietnam, there are many different religious beliefs and  doctrines. In the nation's history of struggle and development,  the religions have always remained close to the people;  struggled against colonialism and imperialism to win national  independence, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness, and freedom of religious belief; and strongly  defended their beloved fatherland. The people in the religious  zones, including those in the Catholic zones, compatriots, and  missionaries have fulfilled their obligations as citizens,  carried out their religious and worldly duties well, and  contributed their strength and possessions, including their  blood, to carrying on the resistance and building the country.  Many children from religious families have taken up arms to  fight, sacrificed their lives, scored glorious achievements in  war, and been awarded many medals by the state. In today's  renovation movement, many members of various religious groups  are manifesting the "good life, good morals" tradition and  exploiting their capabilities and intelligence to enrich both  their families and society in order to achieve the goal of a  "prosperous people, strong country, and civilized society."    The various religious beliefs certainly won't interfere with  the ability of religious people to become integrated and work  together with other people in the common revolution. The party  and state have a correct religious policy. The various-echelon  cadres, sectors, and localities truly respect the people's right  of freedom of belief and will exploit the capabilities,  intelligence, and strength of religious followers in the present  renovation movement.    Unfortunately, in recent years, a number of places have done  things incorrectly and even acted contrary to the party's and  state's policy of freedom of belief. A number of cadres have  exhibited feelings of distrust and acted in a narrowminded way  and this has offended religious sensibilities and affected the  religious freedom of believers. There are many reasons for those  erroneous attitudes and acts, but one of the main reasons is the  lack of understanding and immaturity concerning the issue of  religion. Some people say that religion is a totally negative  social phenomenon, and it should, therefore, be eliminated, the  sooner the better. They regard religion as a type of drug that  poisons the spirit of the masses. They do not see the rational  factors in religion or the moral and humanistic values of  mankind that must be protected and passed on.    In recent years in our country, along with the process of  renovating and democratizing social life, the rapid growth of  economic elements, the expansion of the market mechanism, and  the tendency to cooperate with other countries having different  political systems, there has also been a process of restoring  and expanding religious activities. Concerning this, there is  nothing to discuss, because this has to do with the rights of  each citizen, and these rights are protected by the laws of the  state. However, superstition, witchcraft, fortune-telling, and  so on have spread rapidly. Publications that propagate  superstition have flooded the market and can be found  everywhere. They can be found among people of all age groups,  occupations, level of education, and social position and even  among cadres and party members. They cause people to have  illusions about fate and believe that they aren't masters of  their own fate but must entrust themselves to fate and spirits.  Actually, there have been many distressing situations because of  superstition, and some people have been deprived of their right  to life. Such things are unacceptable. Thus, eliminating such  activities is aimed at protecting people's rights.    Looking at things in a dialectical way, the present  situation  regarding religious life is both normal and abnormal. It is  normal in the sense that this is the ordinary life of people and  the legitimate rights of religious people. Our nation has  recently passed through wars of national liberation. For a  rather long period of time, because of the pressing and urgent  target of winning national independence, people have been  prepared to limit and even temporarily neglect their religious  needs in order to concentrate on driving out the invaders and  winning national independence. Today, now that the entire  country is at peace and the tendency is to renovate and  democratize all aspects of social life, spiritual needs, which  include freedom of religion, are something ordinary and easy to  understand. But this is also abnormal, because in religious life  today, a number of people are using religion and freedom of  religion to carry on political activities and spread  superstitions in order to profit and carry out other evil  actions. They are making use of loopholes or the mistakes of a  number of cadres in a number of localities to slander the state,  saying that the state is violating human rights. They are  slandering the authorities in a number of localities, saying  that they are oppressing Buddhists, and speaking out on behalf  of a number of extremist elements in Buddhism. A number of  people posing as Buddhists are creating social disturbances,  obstructing communications, overturning and burning vehicles,  and opposing those who are carrying out public services at Phu  Xuan bridge in Hue City. It is very clear who is protecting and  who is violating human rights. They even claim that they have  made a list of more than 10 people who have set themselves on  fire in order to protest the human rights violations. They have  urged people to commit suicide. Not only have they violated the  criminal laws, but they have also violated Buddhist tenets  concerning killing. Furthermore, they have violated  international human rights agreements. Article 18 of the  International Agreement on Civil and Political Rights clearly  states that "freedom of religious expression or religious belief  can be restricted only by legal stipulations, and these  restrictions must be necessary for maintaining safety, social  order, public health or morals, or other basic freedoms of  people." No country can, in the name of the rights of this  person or group, abridge the rights of other people and groups.  Guaranteeing human and civic rights must be tied to prosecuting  those who violate those rights. Thus, protecting the rights of  people and promptly prosecuting those who violate those rights  are not mutually exclusive. In actuality, they supplement and  support each other. This is a basic and obvious point that  ordinary people can easily understand.    What is the real nature of the so-called "human rights  violations and violations of freedom of religion in Vietnam"  that enemies inside and outside the country are talking about?  In their plot to carry on "peaceful evolution" to change the  political system in the remaining socialist countries, they are  giving particular attention to the banner of religion in order  to deceive and arouse the masses. They say that in Vietnam,  there is no party or political organization with the  capabilities, discipline, and spirit equal to that of religious  groups. Only believers have the spirit and courage to sacrifice  themselves for their beliefs, because their faith helps them to  ignore hardships and dangers. They say that "the end of the  communist system in Vietnam will be decided primarily by  religion." On the other hand, they are doing their utmost to  distort and slander things using traditional arguments:  "Communism is synonymous with atheism, and religion posits a god  and so how can the two co-exist?" They say that "communism has  declared war on religion." They have said such things in an  effort to create a split between the party and authorities and  people with religious beliefs and between believers and  non-believers.    Thus, in reality, statements such as "Vietnam is violating  human rights" and "religious oppression" are part of the  political plot of the reactionary forces. They certainly do not  want Vietnam to become a stable country so that it can strive to  achieve the goal of becoming a "prosperous people, strong  country, and civilized society" with a socialist orientation.  They are intentionally closing their eyes and refusing to  acknowledge renovation of understanding or the implementation of  the party's and state's policies on religion.    The state has always had a unified policy of respecting and  guaranteeing people's freedom to believe or not to believe and  respecting spiritual values and traditional cultural life. The  religious life of the people has existed since ancient times and  will certainly continue to exist far into the future.  Coexistence between believers and non-believers and between  people of different faiths in the community is an objective  fact. There has been a tradition of solidarity in building and  safeguarding the country, and today, this is a source of  strength in renovating, building, and defending the fatherland.  Every follower of every religion is different in terms of his  material life, but all share a religious life and the life of  the times. Although people may have different beliefs, they are  all equal in terms of rights and responsibilities before the  law. There is no "orthodox religion," and the state does not  regard any religion as a "heresy." It always respects the  freedom of belief of all religions. This shows a respect for the  human rights of each citizen. In building socialism, we have  always emphasized refraining from influencing the inner feelings  of people or rejecting the right of people to freely choose  their own religious beliefs.    Thus, in the renovation process, as the party has affirmed,  "religious beliefs are a spiritual necessity for some people. We  must implement and unify policies on respecting and protecting  freedom of belief, oppose actions that violate the freedom of  belief, and at the same time oppose actions that make use of  religious beliefs to harm the interests of the fatherland and  people." This has been codified in state law in order to protect  the rights of the people. Religious activities are social  activities just like other social activities. Because it is  responsible for controlling society, the state must examine and  control the social aspects of religions. This is because besides  its relationship to the church and the community that shares the  same religious beliefs, a religion also has a relationship with  and affects society. The state must not interfere with religious  beliefs, but it is responsible for controlling the social  aspects of religious activities using the laws. The main purpose  of this is to protect the rights of citizens and the religious  freedom of belief.    Religion is a delicate, complex, and profound social  phenomenon in the spiritual, ideological, and emotional lives of  many people in many generations. Religion is related not only to  "ethical matters" but also to "matters of life." It is related  not only to "the other life" but also to present life. There  must be respect for freedom of belief, but at the same time,  those who use this right for non-religious purposes must be  opposed. We must respect people's freedom to believe, but at the  same time, we must also respect people's freedom not to believe.    Respecting people's freedom of belief means respecting  people's faith, religious ceremonies, and other religious  activities that are in accord with national cultural traditions  and improving the morals and character of people. We cannot  accept counter-cultural or inhuman actions that are contrary to  the legitimate needs of the masses and that lead to confusion, a  lose of direction, passivity, and even violations of the law.    Respecting freedom of belief, which is one of the  fundamental  elements of the human and civic rights of people, does not mean  allowing freedom to "burst out" in confusion and allowing the  spread of every type of "heresy" along with today's open market  mechanism. At the same time, human rights should not be relied  on to revive and encourage backward customs that the people once  voluntarily did away with.    As for believers, they are both elements of the religious  community and citizens of a country. They have obligations and  responsibilities both to their church and to their fatherland.  They enjoy both human rights and the rights of citizens just  like every other citizen. Thus, on one hand, they have the right  to demand legitimate freedoms. On the other, they must struggle  against those who violate and make use of those rights and  contribute to building and defending the country so that it  prospers.</p>

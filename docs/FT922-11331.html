			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Another rough ride for Patten: Hong Kong's new, powerful governor There is no doubt about it: Mr Christopher Patten will be a heavyweight governor of Hong Kong. When it comes to matters Chinese he is, however, an inexperienced heavyweight, a high-powered innocent abroad. Will he outwit the dragon, or will it gobble him up? As he sets out for fittings for a plumed hat and other gubernatorial fancy dress he may reflect upon the strengths he takes to the job. His contacts in Whitehall are as good as - some say better than  - those of most ministers in Mr John Major's cabinet. When he speaks the people of Hong Kong will know that what he says has the backing of the prime minister and the foreign secretary. When he negotiates with the Chinese they will soon see that there is nothing to be gained by trying to shift disputed items up a rung to Downing Street. Mr Patten's ties with the foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, go back to when they both served in the Conservative research department in the late 1960s. They worked together when Mr Hurd was political secretary to the then Mr Edward Heath and again at the Northern Ireland Office in the early 1980s. In 1986, as the Westland helicopter affair blew itself out, Mr Patten and a group of like-minded ministers told Mr Hurd that 'should the No 11 bus come along' - that is, should Mrs Margaret Thatcher be struck down - they would campaign to make him her successor. That is exactly what he and his friends did when the No 11 hit home in November 1990. The new governor's close relationship with the prime minister is of more recent vintage. When Mr Patten was a parliamentary secretary in the Northern Ireland Office in 1984 he became acquainted with Mr Major, then a freshly-minted junior government whip. 'That is the most talented man of my generation,' he told a friend. The well-hidden man of talent eventually joined the 'blue chip group', a dining club founded by Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, a Foreign Office minister, and our hero, among others. During his 17 months as chairman of the Conservative party Mr Patten and Mr Major have come to know one another well; the successful outcome of the election puts the latter in the former's debt. These advantages should allay the doubts of those Hong Kong residents who ask, with some justification, what credentials Mr Patten has for the job, other than a sense of deep disappointment at losing his seat in Bath. He is very upset; he came to regard both the constituency and his delightful nearby cottage, a converted chapel, with especial affection. But Mr Patten has always kept a place in his dreams for what he calls 'life after politics', even imagining himself, at times when his fancy takes flight, as perhaps a future president of the World Bank, or head of a United Nations development agency. Such fantasy appointments enable him to picture himself helping to develop the Third World on a large scale, as he actually did with some success, although on a small scale, as minister for overseas development in 1986-89. He won the ODA a budget increase of 7 per cent in real terms - and he did it while Mrs Thatcher was still prime minister. 'That's big potatoes,' he said, boosting Britain's minuscule aid budget as best he could. But Hong Kong is not Third World: it is in a growing and rampant first world corner of Asia. Mr Patten has never regarded his ambitions as forever confined to the British isles, but there is no evidence that he knows much of Hong Kong, or Chinese, or China. He is, however, a quick study. In spite of a robust social round at university he managed a good second in history at Balliol College Oxford. He is widely respected for his intelligence, his willingness to entertain all manner of ideas and persons, and, latterly, his political ruthlessness. The image of 'cuddly Chris' has been destroyed by his hard-nosed management of the election campaign. What is revealed is a rapidly matured 47-year-old politician of unquestioned ability and fine imagination whose principal qualifications, listed above, derive from the fact that he has practised no other art than politics since he left university. His first big conundrum will be whether to break with all that. If he is to win the allegiance of Hong Kong's articulate high earners and businessmen he must demonstrate that he sees himself as the protector of the colony's interests, even where those conflict with Britain's. But how can he - he who is above all chum and confidant of the prime minister and foreign secretary? The man who, as secretary for the environment, administered Mrs Thatcher's poll tax while regarding it as a disaster may find a way. It will, however, be difficult. Mr Patten's greatest domestic challenge is to ensure that institutions which protect the interests of Hong Kong's citizens and businesses - an independent judiciary, a partially elected legislature, and a free press - are firmly rooted; his greatest foreign policy challenge is to convince the Chinese government that it is in their interests that he should do so. The framework is there, at least on paper. There are two basic documents, the September 1984 Anglo-Chinese joint declaration, and the Basic Law - drafted by the Chinese and passed by their legislature in 1990. Neither is perfect but both legitimise the concept of 'one country, two systems' and provide for a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong after its reversion to Chinese sovereignty on July 1 1997. The colony's vibrant economy is currently exhibiting the dynamism for which it is justly famed. Real growth this year is expected to accelerate to 5 per cent from 4 per cent in 1991. Hong Kong's economic integration with southern China - principally Guangdong where strong ties of family and dialect exist  -is proceeding at an astonishing rate. The local bourse is the best performing leading stock market in the world. This is the golden goose that it is in everyone's interest - Britain's, Hong Kong's, and China's - to keep alive. The trick can be done by a skilful political operator, which Mr Patten happens to be. But he will need many skills. The administration he will take over lacks firm leadership. The civil service employs capable officials but is demoralised. Like the executive, it is struggling to come to terms with the introduction of limited democracy. This needs some explaining. The colony's legislative council, (LegCo), has 60 members, 18 elected by popular vote. Most of the 18 returned in last September's poll support Mr Martin Lee, the leader of the United Democrats. Like Mr Patten, Mr Lee is a devout Catholic; unlike him he is driven by conviction, and hence regarded by the present administration as inflexible. Thus the Hong Kong government has acted as if the elections never happened. Mr Lee's supporters have been obliged to adopt the role of an opposition. Mr Patten must decide whether to risk bringing Mr Lee and his associates into the executive council, or ExCo. The sticking point for the present governor, Lord Wilson, was Mr Lee's refusal to accept collective responsibility, although he said he would abide by secrecy. Yet this is only an issue if the governor makes it one; the rules of government are not immutable nor are they universally observed. Mr Patten will anyway have to get to know the personalities in LegCo quickly. The council has to approve government expenditure; it can amend bills; and it may scrutinise government decisions. A sure touch with LegCo might be the least that Mr Major, ever the Whip, could expect of his new governor-general. That achieved, Mr Patten will face the not unfamiliar question of electoral reform. He has it within his gift to gerrymander, when he negotiates the details of the new electoral system to be put in place by 1995 under the existing agreements. He should resist the temptation. He will be told that the people of Hong Kong are not interested in democracy, that all they want is a quiet, prosperous life. He will also be told that Mr Lee is increasingly unpopular. This can be put to the test in 1995; how fairly will depend upon the new electoral system. Mr Patten has two tasks here. First, he must make the right choice: 20 representatives elected in 20 seats by one-person, one-vote is best. Then he must get China to agree. He must somehow persuade Beijing that a Hong Kong which recognises a plurality of views is most likely, in the long run, to retain the confidence of its people and their commitment to its development. Relations between Britain, its Hong Kong dependency and China have been slowly but painfully recovering since the rupture of June 4 1989. But the 'big atmosphere', as the Chinese call it, is still poor. China is deeply suspicious of British intentions. In its view Britain aims to maximise the commercial benefits to itself (through projects such as the Dollars HK114bn (Pounds 8.3bn) airport) and at the same time lay down structures that will perpetuate British influence beyond 1997. Beijing's counter is the Chinese water torture: an incessant drip, drip, drip of interference in domestic affairs. Its spokesmen now regularly comment on the colony's activities in a manner calculated to undermine the government's authority. Recently, without consultation, China appointed 44 Hong Kong worthies to advise it on Hong Kong matters. The relationship with China is managed by the governor through intermediaries, notably the Anglo-Chinese Joint Liaison Group (JLG) which negotiates the detail of the hand over. He also has regular contact with Lu Ping, head of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, who reports directly to Li Peng, China's current prime minister. But what does this mean for the colony? The current power struggle in Beijing is not helping. The natural tendency of Chinese officials is to keep their heads down and wait to see which faction emerges triumphant. It is hardly surprising that little progress is being made in the JLG. Negotiations over air service agreements between Hong Kong and third countries and the future of British military land in the colony are proceeding at a snail's pace. Trivial matters such as a plan to change the status of the local broadcaster have been allowed to get out of hand. There is a growing backlog of work relating to Hong Kong's external relations: some 400 treaties have to be changed to account for Hong Kong's post-1997 status. In short, the dragon Mr Patten will set out to tame is many-headed, possessed of ancient wisdom, and strengthened by an accretion over the centuries of an infinite patience. We will only know he can do it if he does.</p>

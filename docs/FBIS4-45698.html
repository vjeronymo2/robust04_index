			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE in English: </F> "Ruberti and Fereres Sign Agreement Establishing EU'S  Prospective Technological Institute in Seville"]    [Text] This Friday [16 April] European Commissioner Antonio  Ruberti and the Spanish State Secretary Elias Fereres signed the  agreement establishing the European Union's Prospective  Technological Institute of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) in  Seville. Professor Ruberti pointed out that, "This institute is  a key element in the mechanism for studying and following up  scientific and technological evolution and evaluating the  research policy choices which the Commission is in the process  of making. A collaboration agreement between the Institute  (which will be built in the Cartuja Technological Park) and the  University of Seville has also been signed; and a European  Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG) will be set up. The  Prospective Institute is one of the CCR's eight institutes, each  specialising in a particular area (environment, tele-detection,  advanced materials, etc.) carrying out part of their activities  in the framework of the specific programmes of the Community R  and D framework programme. The Prospective Institute will work  closely with bodies specialising in prospective study and  technological observation which are members of the ETAN network  that is part of the future programme of socio-economic research  proposed under the 4th framework programme 1994/99. In the  coming years, it will set up a European observatory for science  and technology (OEST) which will work with similar national and  European bodies to collect, process and disseminate information  on R and D policies in the industrialised countries and their  evolution. A system of technological observation will also be  developed to detect new scientific break-throughs and  technological innovations at an early stage and to alert persons  in charge of such areas of the existence of these new  developments.</p>

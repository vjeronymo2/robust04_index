			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Republikaner Chairman Franz Schoenhuber: "The </F> Morally Decayed Republic"]    [Text] How confusing and torn apart is the country in  which we are living. On the one hand, a large part of the media  is defending a man like Herbert Wehner, who -- to be quite frank  -- was a communist henchman. Because of his denunciations, he  bears part of the blame for the killing of some of his former  friends in Moscow by a shot in the neck.    On the other hand, the same media absolutely condemn a man  such as Hans Filbinger, who was quite certainly not a very  agreeable fellow, either, because he signed death sentences in  his capacity as a judge. One can surmise that he thought he had  the law on his side.    As a man who consciously experienced dictatorship as a young  person, I can fully understand that the fear for their own lives  goaded some people to regard their own salvation as more  important than that of their friends. Very few are suited to  become heroes in the shadow of the gallows. Still, those who  failed the test should no longer be permitted to play a role on  the political stage.  <H5>  If You Beat My Wehner, I'll Beat Your Strauss </H5>   Had Wehner been a conservative, he would have been  immediately dropped by the Christian Democratic Union/Christian  Social Union [CDU/CSU] as soon as the file on him became public.  Yet, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] remains  faithful to this denouncer, even after his death. And the  CDU/CSU is acting remarkably moderately -- why? Is it afraid of  a possible tit-for-tat? If you beat my Wehner, I'll beat your  Strauss. Even though one cannot compare the behavior of the two  late leading politicians, one is more and more tempted to  suspect that Strauss was involved in treacherous activities. If  somebody allowed a Stasi officer and arms dealer such as  Schalck-Golodkowski access to ones Federal Intelligence Service  [BND] files, he, at least, indirectly, favored the enemies of  the FRG.    After all these revelations, ill-feeling among the sinners  of  this country is rising. Are living leading German politicians  bribable, some from Washington, others from Moscow? Rumors are  sprouting. Is maybe even Genscher the man behind IM-Tulpe  [informal agent Tulpe]? I refuse to believe it. Stasi agents  may still even be sitting in the BND itself.    We have long had Italian-like conditions. The Italian  politicians have the Mafia on their neck, while in the case of  ours, it is the Stasi and also the Mafia, that is extending its  network across Europe.    One gets ahead quite nicely again in this country wearing  "red socks." The perpetrators triumph, the victims despair.    The reasons for this nightmare are deeply rooted. They reach  far into the past.  <H5>  Walk Upright! </H5>   In the FRG there has not been any honest discussion of  Nazism, in the new laender none of communism. Facts were  dismissed in western Germany, facts are being dismissed in  eastern Germany. The young people watch it and are ashamed of  their fathers. Initially, the daughters and sons of Stasi --  and other communist -- officials saw their upright fathers only  in long underpants, while now they see them stark naked in their  moral shabbiness and whininess.    After 1945, quite a few daughters and sons of high-ranking  Nazi officials turned to the left in disgust -- one only has to  look at the family backgrounds of the generation of 1968 --  while in the former GDR [German Democratic Republic], young  people are now falling from one extreme into the other following  ultras wrongly being described as right-wing.    It is the task of our party to offer these young people --  particularly in the new laender -- a political home in a  democratic constitutional party such as ours. Let us sum up:  Large parts of the Nazi and Communist generation of fathers has  failed in the face of history. They shunned discussion with  their children. They were hiding behind the argument of having  had to protect their existence.    We are facing up to the necessary debate -- but not  cap-in-hand. The exodus from Babylonian Captivity begins. We  Republikaner are marching at the forefront and are setting the  trend. And no Schnoor, no Birzele, no Uhrlau, including their  auxiliary forces in the media, can stop us!</p>

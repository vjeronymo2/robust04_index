			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: READER'S TIP FOR USING BAKING COCOA SIFTS OUT INCONSISTENT  MEASURING  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I use baking cocoa quite often and have always found it difficult  to measure. Some of the cans have rather small openings, and the cocoa itself  is often lumpy.  </P> <P> I've solved both problems by simply sifting an entire eight-ounce can into a  two-pound plastic margarine tub with an air-tight lid.  </P> <P> Now I have easy accessibility for any size cup or spoon, and the smooth texture  makes for more consistent measuring. It stores just as well as in the original  container.  </P> <P>  -- SHERRIE, Roanoake, Va.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I have an easy way to get most of the fat off of broths and  soups.  </P> <P> Pour the cooled broth or soup into a jar or plastic container with a  tight-fitting screw-on lid. Make sure the lid is tight, then turn the jar  upside down and put it in the refrigerator. The fat will rise and harden on the  jar bottom (which is now at the top). Then pour off the broth or soup without  the fat.  </P> <P>  -- GERMAINE, Manchester, N.H.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: My favorite grocery store has bulk foods, and there are often  cards with recipes or special hints for using them. I slip the card right into  the bag, so when I'm ready to use the food, I don't have to hunt for the  directions.  </P> <P>  -- DEBBIE, Silver Springs, Md.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Do you know a way to remove melted plastic from the top of my  toaster oven without ruining the cream-colored finish?  </P> <P>  -- MRS. G. M., Wantagh, N.Y.  </P> <P> DEAR MRS. G.M.: Try fingernail-polish remover. Be sure the toaster oven is cool  and unplugged since fingernail-polish remover can be flammable.  </P> <P> Test the remover on an inconspicuous part of the finish to make sure it doesn't  cause any color changes. If it doesn't damage the finish, soak a cotton ball  with polish remover and go after that pesky plastic. If it does cause problems  with the finish, use rubbing alcohol instead.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I clip coupons and have a large envelope filled with them. When  it is time for my grocery shopping, I take out the coupons I will use and  arrange them in the same order as the grocery-store aisles are arranged.  </P> <P> This way I'm not shuffling through them at the store. I simply take the one  that is on top each time.  </P> <P>  -- JENNIFER, Denver, Colo.  </P> <P> DEAR READERS: Fall is traditionally apple time, so take advantage of all the  wonderful kinds of apples that are available right now.  </P> <P> We enjoy Red Delicious apples all year for their crisp juiciness, but there are  many other varieties.  </P> <P> Winesap apples are good baked as well as fresh; Rome Beauties are best for  baking and making good cider, and Jonathans are good for cider as well as for  eating fresh. Cortlands are very versatile and are good as salads, cider, baked  or fresh.  </P> <P> Not all apples have to be red either. Green Granny Smith apples are tart,  crunchy and full of fiber and are my favorites for breakfast. They're good in  pies and sauces and also in fresh salads. Golden Delicious are also versatile,  so you can use them for eating fresh, baking or almost anything.  </P> <P> And while we're talking about cooking apples, did you know they're great cooked  in the microwave? Soft apples take less time than firmer apples, so cooking  times will vary with the type of apple you're using.  </P> <P> Applesauce takes only six to eight minutes and needs no stirring. Baked apples  take only a minute and a half in the microwave. Apples cut into rings can be  placed in a glass pie plate with a little butter or margarine and microwaved  for 30 to 45 seconds. They're a great accompaniment for meat, especially pork,  and other fall and winter vegetables such as squash.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Everyone in my family loves avocados in salads and main dishes,  but I have a problem picking out avocados that are ready to eat right away.  Either they are too hard or they ripen overnight and can't be used.  </P> <P> When I'm buying them I check to make sure they are soft. They feel right, but  when I peel them I find they are brown and tasteless.  </P> <P> Is there a certain way I can check to make sure the avocados I buy are not too  ripe?  </P> <P>  -- SARA, Laredo, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR SARA: When buying avocados, don't pick the soft ones unless you are going  to use them that evening. Avocados to use in a few days should be firm, but not  rock-hard.  </P> <P> If the avocados are too hard, you can put them in a brown paper bag and set it  in a warm place to help them ripen quickly.  </P> <P> To check for ripeness, stick a toothpick in the fruit at the stem end. The  fruit is ripe if the toothpick goes in and out easily. If you have too many  ripe avocados, keep them in the refrigerator to prevent them from ripening any  further.  </P> <P> Don't toss the pits in the trash; plant them. They make beautiful indoor plants  that are easy to grow. I have some that are touching the ceiling.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I have a hint you may be interested in. When I make soup or  sauce, I always make enough to freeze.  </P> <P> I freeze it in quart bread pans and after it is frozen solid, remove it from  the pan and wrap it in freezer wrap or foil and label it.  </P> <P> This way they stack neatly in the freezer and I can keep a nice variety for our  own use or for unexpected guests.  </P> <P>  -- ALMA, South Dennis, Me.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I wonder if your readers realize all the helpful uses for  non-stick pan spray. It adds no flavor and only a few calories and I find it  great for the following:  </P> <P> Spray sauce pans before making pudding, white sauce or heating creamed  vegetables. No sticky pan bottom. Try it in a baking pan before pressing in the  meat loaf and the pan will sponge clean in the dishwasher. It's terrific for  broiling pans for steaks, chops and chicken -- no burned-on fat, no tiresome  scouring.  </P> <P> I've found it to be so helpful with most everything I bake and cook. It's not  just used for making cakes.  </P> <P>  -- A READER, Sarasota, Fla.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I go to a country store and buy double-yolk eggs. For some reason  my family likes them better and I enjoy making them happy. If a recipe states  one egg, can I use a double-yolked one?  </P> <P>  -- RUTH, Baton Rouge, La.  </P> <P> DEAR RUTH: The experts at the American Egg Board say that usually the yolks of  double-yolk eggs are smaller than a regular egg yolk and can be substituted one  for the other.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: A recipe I was making called for one cup of dark brown sugar, but  all I had on hand was light brown sugar. Can you substitute light for dark and  vice versa?  </P> <P>  -- LEE, Portland, Ore.  </P> <P> DEAR LEE: Yes, you can substitute dark for light or light for dark. The only  difference is the amount of molasses. More molasses is in the dark brown sugar  than in the light. Dark brown sugar has a stronger flavor.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: This helpful hint is for new mothers, like myself.  </P> <P> A lot of stores use plastic bags for merchandise. These plastic bags fit well  in diaper pails, and when the bag gets full all I have to do is tie the handles  together and pitch it in the outside garbage can. Not only does it save me from  a mess, it also saves money I would have spent buying diaper pail liners.  </P> <P>  -- DENISE, Marysville, Calif.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Here it is almost time again for little trick-or-treaters. I  disliked the idea of handing out treats that parents might not want their  children to eat, especially if it's baked goods or unpackaged fruit.  </P> <P> Here is an easy solution. I attach an address label to all the goodies that I  give out. Since all of the neighbors know me, they know that the treat is safe.  </P> <P>  -- VANESSA, Benton Harbor, Mich.  </P> <P> This is a great idea. I hope after reading this, other readers will be tempted  to try it.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P>  Send a time- or money-saving hint to Heloise, P.O. Box 795000, San Antonio,  Tex. 78279. Letters will not be answered personally, but the best hints  received will be used in the Hints From Heloise column.  </P> <P> </P></p>

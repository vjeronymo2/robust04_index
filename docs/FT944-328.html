			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries fall in wake of dollar's decline US Treasury prices fell in the wake of a declining dollar yesterday in thin trading. Late in the session the 30-year government bond was down  7/8 at 96 3/32 , yielding 7.834 per cent and the two-year note down  1/16 to 99 19/32 , yielding 7.707 per cent. At one point the yield spread between the two-year note and the long bond narrowed to 6 basis points, fuelling speculation that it could turn negative early next year. German bunds lost early gains and ended lower after the Bundesbank issued the first DM3bn tranche of the government's new year bond. Market participants were disappointed by the 7.375 per cent coupon - lower than the 7.5 per cent most had expected - and the pricing of the issue, and dealers reported little demand. Another tranche is due to be auctioned today, and in the absence of buyers so close to year-end, the supply could weigh on prices, dealers said. French bonds weakened in after-hours trading, dragged down by the decline in bunds and a drop in the three-month Pibor futures contract. UK gilts drifted higher in an uneventful session, slightly outperforming their continental European counterparts. The March long gilt future closed at 102 7/16, up  3/16.</p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Airlines Lufthansa and British Airways will be delighted by the US government's approval of their code-sharing agreements with US carriers. The potential benefits are perhaps best gauged by the vehemence of the opposition of rival US airlines. By effectively tapping into the US domestic market, the two European airlines can help secure lucrative business traffic which is so critical to profitability. Although BA carries some 25m passengers a year, it makes two-thirds of its revenue from 75,000 customers who regularly travel at the front of the cabin. BA's link with USAir is under a cloud, given the latter's severe financial strains. But Lufthansa's code-sharing arrangements with United should help it return to profitability. Lufthansa could gain up to DM100m a year in extra revenue through code-sharing. That should ease the way for the government to reduce its majority shareholding as part of its privatisation programme. Lufthansa's closer links with United will be especially painful for Delta, which has a big presence at Frankfurt. The few big US carriers without a European partner must be growing ever more desperate to get hitched. Despite recent accords, there remain big uncertainties about the regulation of some transatlantic routes. While passengers would appreciate the virtues of further liberalisation, it is not clear that shareholders should be so enamoured. As the domestic US airline market graphically illustrates, too much competition can be an uncomfortable thing.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIZING UP PRESIDENT BUSH: EFFECTIVE, NOT A DAREDEVIL  </P> <P> President Bush will not be a clone of President Reagan. But how different will  he be, and in what ways?  </P> <P> The short answer to the first question is very, and to the second, most. Not  different in the basic objectives that he seeks, but different in the ways in  which he pursues them.  </P> <P> Ronald Reagan touched a certain mystic chord in the nation's heart. A Bush  presidency will be more prose and less poetry. Reagan kept his eye on the goal.  Bush will focus more on the means of reaching it. Reagan had an unparalleled  ability to reach out and touch millions of Americans at once through  television. Bush will reach out and touch many more people individually, and  will track more closely the inner workings of his own Administration.  </P> <P> George Bush has always had an adventurous spirit, but has followed it in a  measured way. In World War II he became the Navy's youngest pilot, and a good  one -- he won the Distinguished Flying Cross and three Air Medals -- but being  a good combat pilot means being effective, not being a daredevil. After college  he set out on his own for the oil fields of Texas, but carefully kept his ties  to the banking world of the Northeast. He doesn't shrink from risks, but he  prefers prudent risks.  </P> <P> One of the strongest influences on his life was his father, U.S. Sen. Prescott  Bush, who was also a managing partner of the elite New York investment-banking  firm of Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co.  </P> <P> As a senator Pres Bush didn't make large waves. That wasn't his style. But he  did win high respect from his Senate colleagues. He had a firm sense of right  and wrong, and held himself to rigorous standards of personal conduct. An  ardent internationalist, he helped persuade Dwight Eisenhower to get into the  1952 presidential race. He was courteous, sometimes even courtly, with a  conservative's instinctive distrust of government panaceas but also a firm  belief that government exists to serve the public, not vice versa.  </P> <P> Call it social conscience or a patrician sense of noblesse oblige, but the  whole Bush family was imbued with a deeply rooted sense of public duty. To the  Bush clan, public service is not someone else's responsibility. It's theirs.  </P> <P> George Bush is not a theoretician. He does not have an intellectual turn of  mind. He habitually deals with the concrete, not the abstract. He does have a  keenly honed sense of how the world works. As U.S. ambassador to the United  Nations, head of the U.S. mission to China and director of the CIA, he saw the  real world beyond the U.S. borders. And there is a down-home quality about his  thought processes that creates real empathy with people on an individual basis  while leaving his view of the bad guys and how they operate in the world  remarkably unclouded.  </P> <P> Because of this down-home quality and his own familiarity with Washington, the  snake-oil salesmen who so heavily populate the Beltway area won't find him to  be an easy sell. He has heard their pitches before. He knows the words -- and  also the music.  </P> <P> It's no coincidence that for years his closest political confidant and  collaborator has been Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III. Baker is  called a pragmatist. To the rigid ideologue a pragmatist is a person without  principle. In the real world a pragmatist is often one who maneuvers to get as  much of what his principles dictate as he can, then moves on to the next  battle. Ideologues make better copy because they make livelier drama. But  mixing in some pragmatism makes better policy.  </P> <P> Soon, of course, the "inconsistencies" game will begin. Analysts not capable of  holding two thoughts in their heads at the same time will point to separate  Bush initiatives and declare them inconsistent with one another. Already the  game has begun. To 90% of the Beltway crowd, kinder and gentler means one  thing: fatter federal social programs funded by higher taxes. Bush doesn't  believe that taxes are necessarily kind and gentle.  </P> <P> But if people read his lips correctly, the new President should not be a font  of major surprises. By and large, he is the sort who says what he means and  means what he says and who doesn't feel that he has to raise his voice to make  his point. By listening more closely, those who at first find his actions  puzzling may in time find them less so.  </P></p>

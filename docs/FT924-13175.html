			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Letter (6): Coal seen as victim of muddled economic thinking and lack of long-term strategy Sir, We recently conducted a survey among the largest users of energy in the UK. Only 22 per cent of them unreservedly supported an increase in gas-fired generation of electricity. There was a call for a balanced investment programme with a continuing major contribution from coal to ensure gas is not misused. There was also a widely held belief that the costs of gas generation would not be lower in a genuinely free market. Before committing us to the decimation of the coal industry, the government should listen to people who operate in the real world, who actually take decisions and whose motivation is common sense, efficiency and concern for the environment.

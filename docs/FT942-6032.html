			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Insurers bought A weighty note from BZW highlighting the fundamental valuation story drove shares in the composite insurance sector forward. The detailed piece of research, published annually, includes alternative valuation models of normalised earnings and projected total returns in an attempt to highlight the relative long term attractions of the stocks in the sector. Analysts Mr Trevor May and Mr Andrew Pitt at the investment bank conclude: 'Although there are disparities in the relative company ratings, we now consider that the sector as a whole is cheap and rate all five composites a buy.' BZW was particularly keen on Royal Insurance, which it said was fundamentally undervalued. The shares surged 8 ahead to 242p in trade of 2.5m, while Commercial Union hardened a penny to 525p. The broker promoted Sun Alliance and General Accident to its buy list. The former firmed 6 to 293p, on volume of 2.6m, after BZW said it stands to reap returns from record 1994 underwriting margins; while the latter jumped 13 to 554p as the analysts pointed to its yield attractions. Shares in engineering group Siebe moved sharply forward ahead of today's figures, as analyst Mr Paul Compton at Credit Lyonnais Laing took the stock off the sell list. The stock closed 21 ahead at 556p, with Kleinwort Benson, the group's broker, also reported to have been recommending the shares. Reports of a sign of an improvement in European car sales boosted GKN, a leading components manufacturer and supplier to several car makers. The shares gained 15 at 584p. News of a Pounds 93m contract for its Balfour Beatty subsidiary lifted BICC and the shares finished 4 1/2 firmer at 418p. A profits warning from Hall Engineering saw the shares tumble 71 to 169p, to make it the day's worst performing stock. The company said 1994 profits would be worse than the previous year's because of a postponed contract and pressures on steel margins. Hall reported a sharp increase in profits last year from Pounds 2.36m to Pounds 8.56m. British Steel eased a half-penny to 136p, with Nomura said to have urged investors to sell the stock. Reports that engineering group FKI had abandoned plans for a Pounds 400m US acquisition cheered the market. FKI put on 2 at 182p. Kingfisher weakened ahead of the company's agm today, with a variety of concerns exercising dealers' minds. Worries that trading at B&amp;Q, the home improvement business, had not picked up, and that Woolworth would prove disappointing, were being dismissed by the stock's supporters. However, even they were admitting to hoping for some calming words today - which are likely to be accompanied by a more detailed sales picture than normal - to steady the recently volatile share price. Yesterday it closed 6 down at 543p. UBS was reported to have increased its Next profits forecast, the shares edging up a penny to 238p. Negative weekend press comment on Body Shop was said to have contributed to a fall of 4 1/2 to 235 1/2 p. Discount supermarket group Shoprite was the best performing stock in the market as the shares jumped 10 per cent, with bargain hunters moving in following last week's profits warning, which saw the stock virtually halve in value. The shares added 9 at 89p. Hotel group Forte gained 3 1/2 at 229p, with traders citing recent institutional presentations, last week's positive agm and lingering hopes that the bid for French chain Merdien will be successful. Weekend press reports over plans to link up with the Savoy Group were dismissed as well known within the market. Savoy shares receded 5 to 1020p. In a quiet drinks sector, Bass proved to be the highlight, the shares climbing 10 to 518p, with SG Warburg reported to be positive on the stock. Among telecoms stocks, Vodafone was a strong feature, with US buying combining with positive sentiment among UK analysts over the upcoming subscriber figures for May. The shares moved forward 12 to 531p on moderate turnover of 2.2m. The regional electricity companies rode along with the volatilities in the bond market, ending a weak session well below the market. Eastern declined 6 to 598p, London 6 to 564p and Midlands 10 to 595p. Beazer Homes slipped 2 to 154p after announcing interim results largely in line with market forecasts. The company was floated by Hanson with a price tag of 165p in March. The announcement of an oil discovery in Colombia by bid target Lasmo left the market unimpressed. The shares eased 3 to 145p, on volume of 2.6m, on the first closing day of Enterprise Oil's bid.</p>

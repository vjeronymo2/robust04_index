			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Paraguay monitored through 23  June.    The National Development Bank, BNF, has reported using an  Inter-American Development Bank line of financing to grant loans  to 600 mostly agroindustrial companies. Total loans amounted to  62.6 billion guaranies. The BNF said that 83 percent of this  amount was used to finance the purchasing of machinery,  equipment, and the construction of factory facilities, and that  17 percent was used as initial operative capital or to implement  industrial projects. The loans were used to create 90 new  companies and to enlarge and modernize 510 existing productive  units. (Asuncion ULTIMA HORA in Spanish 20 Jun 94 pp 12-13)    President Juan Carlos Wasmosy announced that the Paraguayan  Central Bank's net international reserves registered a  "surprising increase" to $966 million in the first half of June.  The Central Bank reported that on 13 May total reserves were  $855.4 million, at the beginning of June reserves climbed to  $901 million, and that they today stand at $966 million. The  Central Bank did not explain officially the reasons for the  sudden increase, but it was reported that some of the causes are  Brazil's payment of its debt on Itaipu royalties, the entry of  short- and medium-term foreign capital into the country, and the  local deposit of Brazilian capital escaping from the uncertain  electoral climate in Brazil.

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Fed 'stays with the curve' on inflation: But critics fear the interest rate increases might hamper economic growth The US Federal Reserve's decision yesterday to raise short term interest rates was almost universally expected, but the argument over whether this is the right step to take is not so one-sided. In its statement announcing an increase of half a percentage point in both the discount and federal funds rates, the Fed said it was acting 'against the background of evidence of continuing strength in the economic expansion and high levels of resource utilisation'. 'The actions are intended to keep inflationary pressures contained and thereby foster sustainable economic growth,' the Fed said. But administration officials and Democratic members of Congress are worried that the Fed might be too jittery about prices rises that are still scarcely visible to the naked eye: in its zeal to kill off inflation 18 months down the road, does it not risk killing off an already slowing economic recovery before its time? Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, and Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, were conciliatory yesterday in their joint statement. 'The administration recognises and respects the independence of the Federal Reserve to make decisions about the nation's monetary policies. We share a common goal with the Federal Reserve of sustained growth with low inflation,' they said. There is not much more the administration can do, except back the Fed's board with new appointees. That seems to be having little effect, for yesterday's vote was unanimous, despite the addition to the board of Mr Alan Blinder and Ms Janet Yellen, two Clinton nominees. Democratic senators were more forthright in their criticism of the Fed's decision. Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, called it unwise and Senator Paul Sarbanes, who will take over next year as chairman of the banking committee, urged the Fed to 'leave the economy alone'. 'The economy is doing pretty well but every time the Fed takes the rates up it dampens economic activity,' he said. Many business groups share this concern. But the financial markets side firmly with the Fed on the need to deal with brewing signs of inflation. Even an increase of a quarter of a percentage point yesterday would have been greeted with disappointment as a sign that the Fed was 'behind the curve' on inflation. The members of the Federal Open Market Committee are less godlike in their certitude than the markets. They appear to have taken to heart Oliver Cromwell's advice to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland: 'I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.' Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, put it a little differently last week in testimony to a congressional committee last week. 'Policy making requires an assessment of the consequences of various policy alternatives should they prove to be wrong. We must ask ourselves: how difficult would it be to reverse policy mistakes and at what cost?' The committee also includes five presidents of regional Federal Reserve banks. They stay in close touch with business leaders in their districts, and several of them have in recent weeks made a concerted effort to justify higher interest rates in speeches to community leaders and chambers of commerce. Fed officials say they have not been fully convinced by signs of an economic slowdown in some recent statistics, such as the large increase in business inventories in the second quarter, and argue that the capacity of the job market and industrial plant to absorb more demand is becoming stretched. The Fed said yesterday that its half point increase in rates was 'expected to be sufficient, at least for a time, to meet the objective of sustained, non-inflationary growth.' That probably averts the likelihood of further tightening at next month's committee meeting, but does not appear to rule out the possibility of another increase before the end of the year.</p>

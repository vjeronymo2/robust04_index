			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Competition brings hard times for Portugal's farmers Competition within the European single market is cruelly exposing the backwardness of Portuguese agriculture. Red Cross workers began delivering food parcels this week to the destitute families of unemployed farm workers in the Alentejo, the southern grain, wine and olive-growing region. Angry fishermen in the northern port of Matosinhos yesterday attacked two Spanish lorries, tipping into the street the fish that Spanish companies manage to truck into Portugal faster and cheaper than local fishermen can land their catches. The Trade Ministry yesterday announced an inquiry into commercial practices in the dairy sector after bitter complaints by Portuguese co-operatives that an Italian company was using unreasonably aggressive tactics to win a share of the Portuguese milk market. Farming and fishing have been central to the Portuguese economy for centuries and strong emotions are being aroused by an increasingly visible withering of the sector. The numbers of agricultural workers has fallen from 20 per cent of the total workforce in 1986, when Portugal joined the European Union, to 10 per cent today. In particular, the plight of farm workers in the Alentejo, once the heartland of Portuguese agriculture, is aggravating tensions between the centre-right government and its critics. Meagre state subsidies are not enough to support the families of unemployed labourers in a region where the jobless rate is almost double the Portuguese average and the suicide rate is the highest in Europe. Mr Antonio Campos, agriculture spokesman for the opposition Socialist party, says agricultural earnings in Portugal have fallen 45 per cent over the past three years and the value of farmland has been halved in two years. The country produces only a quarter of what it eats, compared with 50 per cent in 1986, he says. This, he claims, is a result more of inadequate government policies, than of competition in the single market. He says the earnings of Spanish farmers have increased 22 per cent since 1991 and Spain has not only conquered the horticultural market in Portugal but also won 30 and 15 per cent of French and German markets respectively. Mr Campos and other critics say the Es1,000bn (Pounds 3.95bn) in EU funds Portugal has invested in agriculture since 1986 have been spent unwisely and are equivalent to less than half the loss in earnings farmers have suffered over the same period. An independent study shows that the bank debts of Portuguese farmers last year totalled Es380bn, almost equal to the Es400bn earned by the sector, and that a third of debts are likely to be irrecoverable. But Mr Anbal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, yesterday hit back at critics of his agricultural policies and denounced those clamouring to protect the sector from European competition. In a state-of-the nation address to parliament, he said that although the agricultural workforce had been halved over the past eight years, the value of agricultural production was the same. 'It is pure illusion to think that the way forward for our agriculture lies in closing our frontiers or keeping a large workforce on the land,' he said. 'We have to be realistic and face the facts.'</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Warsaw 'ready to revive talks with creditors' THE Polish finance minister, Mr Jerzy Osiatynski, yesterday proclaimed Warsaw's willingness to resume debt reduction negotiations with its commercial bank creditors but 'only if we are certain that the banks are ready to conduct constructive talks in good faith'. The first round of talks to reduce and reschedule Poland's Dollars 12.3bn (Pounds 8.2bn) debt to the London Club of commercial bank creditors collapsed last week after the Poles rejected the Club's starting offer. Mr Osiatynski emphasised that 'Poland needs an agreement with the banks but not at any price, not at the price of undermining the present reforms and agreements with other partners'. This was a reference to Poland's 1991 agreement with the Paris Club which reduced the Dollars 33bn owed to western governments by 50 per cent. Poland is looking for a similar reduction in its commercial bank debt burden. But Mr Osiatynski said the proposal presented by the banks last week represented 'a 28 per cent reduction, which, after subtracting the Dollars 2.5bn up-front payment that implementation of the agreement would cost, signifies an 8 per cent net reduction'. The assessment was contested by a spokesman for the London Club last night, who said that Poland, which the club classifies as a 'middle income, European country', was offered a 33 per cent reduction, closely aligned to the standard Brady-type debt reduction which is usually only offered to developing country debtors. He emphasised that the banks presented the offer as a 'starting point for negotiations' and added: 'We also want to sit down and continue negotiations with Poland.' The 10-man London Club negotiating team represents over 400 creditor banks, including the heavily committed German and other European banks which are anxious not to create a precedent for generous debt reduction which could be seized upon by Russia, Bulgaria and other big debtors. But the banks recognise that the political hiatus before the Polish general elections on September 19 offers a 'window of opportunity' for an agreement. The Polish negotiators, meanwhile, are restrained by tight, IMF-imposed budgetary restraints and heavy existing repayment commitments to the Paris Club and other creditors. Warsaw has obtained pledges worth Dollars 1.3bn from the World Bank and other international institutions to finance a London Club deal and is ready to devote Dollars 400m a year to servicing its commercial bank debt. According to Mr Osiatynski, the London Club's proposal would initially mean annual payments of Dollars 600m increasing swiftly to Dollars 1bn a year.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar close to a crucial test THE DOLLAR yesterday con-tinued to rally towards this year's peak of DM1.65 against the D-Mark following the release of the best set of US leading indicators in 10 years, writes James Blitz. The US currency had climbed nearly a pfennig at one stage, after news that the leading indicators rose 1.9 per cent in December against economists' predictions of a 1.7 per cent gain. The dollar's rally was also triggered by German economic indicators showing a flagging economy, and a need to stimulate economic production through lower interest rates. December industrial orders in Germany fell 1.8 per cent and manufacturing output was down 2.4 per cent. The US unit ended in London at DM1.6420, up  1/2 pfennig on the day. In New York it closed at the London level of DM1.6420. This week is seen as a critical test as to whether the dollar can break through DM1.65. Analysts were yesterday upward revising their expectations for the January US payroll figure, with at least one European bank nearly doubling its estimate from 85,000 to 160,000. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation, said: 'A payroll week is always big for the dollar. A lot of long-term players are in the market waiting to test the currency's strength.' Mr Brian Hilliard, a Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull economist, was confident that the dollar was about to surge ahead. The dollar could gain additional strength if the Bundesbank makes a conciliatory move on short-term interest rates either today, at its weekly money market intervention, or tomorrow, at its fortnightly council meeting. Few people expect any policy easing, because Germany's public sector wage talks will probably finish on Thursday at the earliest. These are seen by the Bundesbank as a crucial guide to the inflation outlook. The relaxation in tensions inside the European exchange rate mechanism has taken pressure off Germany to ease for now. The French franc yesterday traded at around FFr3.3820 against the D-Mark. One small source of tension was that both Danish and Irish authorities were forced to intervene in the markets, selling the Irish punt, because the Danish currency was at its ERM floor against the Irish one. This was not yet seen as an important test of the system. The dollar's strength put heavy pressure on the pound at the end of European trading, pushing it as low as Dollars 1.4400. This, in turn, sent the Sterling Exchange Rate Index down to a record low of 77.1 at the end of the day. The pound closed in London at Dollars 1.4460, off 3/4 cent on the day, and finished lower in New York at Dollars 1.4435. Sterling was calmer against the D-Mark for most of the day, as dealers took the view that another UK base rate cut may not come before the March Budget. But it still ended  1/2 pfennig easier at DM2.3750.</p>

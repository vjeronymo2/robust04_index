			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 23 Mar (XINHUA) -- The rural work  conference of the CPC Central Committee opened here today. The  conference clearly and definitely pointed out that the basic  tasks of China's agriculture and rural work this year are to  work under Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building a  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic  line; seriously implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the October 1993  central rural work conference; stabilize the party's basic rural  policies, deepen rural economic structure, and raise the  comprehensive agricultural productivity; promote economic  development, increase the incomes of peasants, and social  stability in rural areas; and create a good economic environment  and stable social environment to facilitate smooth proceeding of  major reforms and bring about a sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the national economy.    Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee  and Chinese president, and Li Peng, member of the Standing  Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and  premier, delivered important speeches at the meeting. Present  at the meeting were other members of the Standing Committee of  the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, Qiao Shi, Li  Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing and Hu Jintao. Zhu Rongji, also a member of  the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau, presided over and addressed the meeting.    Other attending were Ding Guangen, Li Lanqing, Li Tieying,  Zou Jiahua, Chen Xitong, Jiang Chunyun, Qian Qichen, Wei  Jianxing, Wen Jiabao, Ren Jianxin, Chi Haotian, Song Jian, Li  Guixian, Chen Junsheng, Ismail Amat, Peng Peiyun, and Luo Gan;  the principal people in charge of the party committees and  governments of all provinces, autonomous regions,  municipalities, and cities with provincial-level economic  decision-making authority; and people in charge of departments  concerned under the CPC Central Committee and the State Council.  The central topic for discussion at the meeting was arranging  this year's agricultural production and rural work. The meeting  called on party committees and government departments at all  levels to further strengthen their leadership over agriculture  and rural work, implement the policy measures put forward by  last year's central rural work conference, and particularly pay  attention to the production of grain, cotton and oil-bearing  crops and to the "vegetable basket" project and strive for good  agricultural harvests this year.    In his speech, Jiang Zemin first discussed the emphasis of  the party's work and present realities in rural areas. He  explained the purposes of the conference and why it was being  held less than six months after the last central rural work  conference. He said: Agriculture and work in rural areas are  very important to the implementation of the basic principles for  this year's work set by the central committee, and to the good  management of relations between reform, development and  stability. This year is an important year in setting up a  socialist market economic structure, because we are also  carrying out reforms in finance, taxation, banking, investment,  and foreign trade. The smooth implementation of reform needs a  good economic environment and a stable social environment; and  it especially needs stability and development of agriculture and  the rural economy. The key to ensuring supplies and curbing  inflation lies in doing a good job in grain and non-staple food  production. Stability in rural areas and a strong agricultural  base will ensure stability in the country, smooth reforms, and  sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development.    Jiang Zemin said: The general situation in rural areas is  good, but there are some relatively urgent problems, including a  decline in grain output in south China, two consecutive years of  reduction in cotton production, remarkable rises in the prices  of non-staple foods, and the slow growth of peasants' incomes.  In view of this, the central committee deems it necessary to  make further arrangements for agriculture and rural work.    In the second part of his speech Jiang Zemin explicitly  defined the basic agricultural and rural tasks for 1994. He  also stressed the need to concentrate on the following current  tasks:    First, we must ensure the production and supply of grain,  cotton, oil-bearing crops, and vegetables. He said that with a  population of nearly 1.2 billion people, China had to achieve  self-sufficiency in grain and a basic balance between supply and  demand. He called on all provinces, autonomous regions, and  municipalities directly under the central government to conduct  a careful investigation and analysis of the production and  supply of grain in their respective areas, make a thorough check  of current grain stockpiles in their granaries, and make plans  to maintain grain growing acreage and to increase per-unit  yields this year. Not only must major grain- producing areas do  this, but developed coastal areas must also strive to stabilize  their grain planting acreage, production, and stockpiles. It is  necessary to deepen reform of the grain purchasing and marketing  system and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control to  ensure that grain sources are under the control of the state.  Cotton-producing areas should concentrate on cotton production.  Suburban areas in large and medium cities should carry out the  "vegetable basket" project successfully in order to guarantee  the production and supply of non-staple food. It is necessary  to carefully study and to solve, step by step, the problem of  the widening gap between the prices of agricultural and  industrial products so as to encourage farmers to grow grain and  cotton.    Second, it is necessary to develop all sectors of the rural  economy to increase the income of farmers. Jiang Zemin said  considerably increasing the income of farmers together with the  development of production constitutes an important and difficult  mission in China's agricultural and rural work this year. We  must, therefore, give equal importance to increasing the income  of farmers and ensuring an effective supply of farm produce. We  must steadily and vigorously readjust the industrial setup in  rural areas by developing farming which stresses high yields,  high quality, and high efficiency and by developing a  diversified economy as well as town and village enterprises on  the basis of guaranteeing a steady increase in the output of  grain, cotton, and other major farm produce.    Third, it is necessary to maintain social stability in rural  areas. Jiang Zemin called on leading cadres at all levels to  work conscientiously in discharging their duties so as to  promptly handle hot issues strongly reflected by the masses:    -- Resolutely reduce the burden of farmers. Resolute  measures should be taken to ensure that no one is allowed to  continue collecting fees or charges which have been abolished by  order of the central authorities; no one is allowed to continue  increasing quotas, which have been abolished by order of the  central authorities; this year no one is allowed to collect  money from farmers, and any one who arbitrarily collects money  from farmers will be made accountable; resolute measures must be  taken to ban indiscriminate fund-raising, indiscriminate  collection of fees or charges, and indiscriminate levying of  fines.    -- Effectively improve the comprehensive management of  public  security in rural areas. The principal party and government  leaders in all areas should conscientiously assume  responsibility to ensure security in rural areas by resolutely  cracking down on criminal activities, improving the quality of  judicial and public security personnel, strengthening  discipline, and enforcing the law.    -- Resolutely check unhealthy practices in the party and in  society which the masses have strongly criticized. Effective  measures should be taken to stop unhealthy practices such as  feasting and wining, squandering public money, abusing power to  carry out extortion, and indulging in boasting by making false  reports, all of which have been strongly criticized by the  masses.    -- Conscientiously do a good job in assisting poor areas. It  is necessary to mobilize and organize the masses in impoverished  areas, disaster-stricken areas, and reservoir areas where the  residents must be evacuated to free themselves from poverty and  become better- off by developing production to help themselves.    Jiang Zemin stressed the need to resolutely implement the  principle of "grasping two links simultaneously and attaching  importance to both" in order to maintain stability in rural  areas.    Fourth, it is necessary to strengthen basic-level  organizations in rural areas. Particular attention should be  focused on building party branches with the emphasis on  selecting their secretaries, on building village committees with  the emphasis on setting up a democratic management system, on  building village collective economic organizations with the  emphasis on serving peasant households in a better way, and on  building youth, women's, and militia organizations.    In the third part of his speech, Jiang Zemin focused on how  to further strengthen the party's leadership over agriculture  and rural work. He said whether we truly put agriculture at the  top of the list in guiding our entire economic work is an  important test of whether we truly regard economic construction  as the central task. He urged party committees and governments  at all levels to correctly handle the relationship between  agricultural and industrial development, and, while ensuring  sustained and steady agricultural growth, to decide an  appropriate scale and speed for economic development and the  proper percentages of funds for primary, secondary, and tertiary  industries. He said China should ensure the needs of  agricultural development even if it meant fewer projects were  launched.    Jiang Zemin stressed: We should unwaveringly carry out the  policies and measures adopted by the party central committee and  State Council on stepping up agricultural and rural work. Some  policies and measures adopted last year have not been carried  out. Central and local departments at all levels should take  immediate action to inspect work at every level and carry out  these policies and measures -- under no circumstances should we  miss this opportunity.    Jiang Zemin emphatically stressed: Party committees of  provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities must use a  large portion of their energy on rural work, and prefectural and  county party committees must put their efforts primarily into  rural work. In particular, major leaders of party committees at  all levels should personally get involved in and fully ensure  that all rural work this year is properly carried out. We  should use the performance of major leading cadres at all levels  in agricultural and rural work as an important criterion for  evaluating their overall performance. Party and government  cadres at all levels should further improve their work style and  method. After this meeting ends, major comrades in charge of  the party committees and governments of all provinces,  autonomous regions, and municipalities should conduct in-depth  investigations and studies in rural areas, listen with an open  mind to the views and wishes of grass-roots cadres and the  masses, gain a clear idea of how the policies and measures of  the central authorities have been carried out, have a good  understanding of the major problems in rural reform and  development, and seek effective ways to solve these problems.  Based on this, they should lay down a practical plan for this  year's agricultural and rural work in their localities.    In his speech, Li Peng first analyzed the current rural  situation and explained the importance of doing good rural work  this year. He said: The better the situation is, the more  leading cadres at all levels should stay cool-headed. We should  not relax for a moment in doing this year's rural work.  Practice over the years has proved that whenever agriculture  develops well and the rural situation is stable, the whole of  society is comparatively stable and reform and development can  be carried out in a comparatively smooth manner. China has a  rural population of 900 million; it is the key to maintaining  social stability. Agriculture affects the national economy and  people's livelihood; the production and supply of agricultural  products have direct effects on price stability; price  stability, to a high degree, depends on whether the supply of  agricultural products is ample. Li Peng stressed that leading  cadres at all levels must have a clearer idea of the importance  and urgency of this year's rural work, should firm up their  confidence, overcome difficulties, and strive to reap a good  agricultural harvest this year, especially of grain and cotton.    Li Peng said: The major rural work for this year is: First,  we should strive to ensure a steady agricultural growth and an  effective supply of agricultural and sideline products; second,  we should increase the incomes of peasants and strive to meet  the average annual increase target set in the Eighth Five-Year  Plan; third, we should properly solve acute problems in rural  areas to ensure rural social stability. He said: To put it  specifically, we should ensure success in our work in the  following 10 areas:    -- It is necessary to maintain the acreage available for  grain, cotton and vegetable production. Stabilization of  farmland is a basic condition for achieving the goals of  stabilizing grain output, increasing cotton output, and  enriching the "vegetable basket." In northern China, the grain  growing area should be increased; in southern and coastal  economic developed areas, the growing area for grain should be  increased by a large proportion. We must maintain the  availability of farmland for cotton and vegetable production  this year, and the wanton use of vegetable gardens for other  purposes should be strictly forbidden. When other use of a  vegetable garden is unavoidable, we must create new vegetable  gardens before existing vegetable gardens can be used for  construction purposes.    -- We must raise procurement prices for grain and cotton to  whip up the enthusiasm of peasants for production.    -- We must ensure the supply of agricultural means of  production and control their prices. We should do a seriously  good job in agricultural production, transportation, and the  marketing of agricultural means of production; strengthen  administration of the market for agricultural means of  production and crack down on fake and shoddy products; and  encourage direct procurement and sales between production  enterprises and farm operators to reduce middle links and  circulation costs. We must strictly control the prices of  agricultural means of production.    -- We must promote the use of agricultural science and  technology, and strengthen the training of agricultural  technicians. Counties and townships should stabilize  organizations which promote agricultural science and technology,  take effective measures to increase the number of agricultural  technicians, and increase funding for the promotion of science  and technology. We must also do a good job in developing  education in rural areas.    -- The state should control adequate grain sources. This is  a basic condition for ensuring the supply of food grain to the  market and keeping prices relatively stable. In addition to  raising the procurement price of food grain and encouraging  peasants to sell their products to state grain departments, the  state should control wholesale markets and play a guiding role  in the retail selling of food grain. We should continue to  improve the grain market, establish a market system with  emphasis on the wholesale market, advocate and support  large-scale trade of food grain among various regions, and  maintain the normal operation of urban and rural trade fairs.    -- We must reform the procurement and marketing system for  food grain and set up grain risk funds. We should establish an  independent state adjustment center for grain reserves. The  scale of the reserves should be maintained at an appropriate  level to allow for prompt adjustment of the grain supply. Both  the central authorities and localities should set up grain risk  funds which should be included in the central and local budgets.    -- We must increase investment in agriculture. We should  increase the proportion of agriculture in state capital  construction investment, state budgets, and loan funds.  Starting this year, the rate of increase agricultural funds  must not be lower than the rate of increase for revenue. We  should seriously grasp the building of 500 key commercial grain  counties and 100 fine cotton producing counties, and establish  demonstration centers for efficient agricultural production with  high yield and fine quality.    -- We must promote continuous and sound development of  village and town enterprises. In long-term development, we must  rely on the development of village and town enterprises to raise  income levels for peasants, shift surplus workers in rural  areas, and reasonably settle "migrant workers." At present, we  should guide village and town enterprises to improve their  production structure, improve quality, and raise management  levels and economic efficiency. We should encourage the  development of village and town enterprises in concentrated and  adjacent areas, leading to the development of towns and small  cities. We should provide specific guidance for village and  town enterprises in different areas and at different levels of  development. We should encourage village and town enterprises  in eastern coastal areas to further raise quality, expand the  scale of production, and develop high-tech and export-oriented  products. In central and western regions and minority areas, we  should suit measures to local conditions, give full play to the  advantages of local resources and labor force, and explore  effective ways to speed up the development of village and town  enterprises there. Increased State Council loans for village  and town enterprises in central and western regions and minority  areas must be guaranteed in both scale and amount.    -- We must improve conditions for agricultural production  and enhance the overall farming capability. Great efforts  should be made to launch irrigation and water conservation  projects to increase effective irrigation acreage. While  striving to take drought-prevention measures, we should also  make every preparation to prevent floods. We must persist in  overall agricultural development and strive to improve low and  medium yield farmland. We should accelerate afforestation and  major ecological projects.    -- We must properly solve hot issues in rural areas to  maintain social stability there.    Li Peng said emphatically: Now that the tasks and action for  agricultural and rural economic development have been defined,  the crucial point is how they should be carried out. He  continued: Governments at all levels should carry out the  responsibility system in their rural work. They should have a  sense of urgency, enhance work efficiency, and conscientiously,  responsibly, and actively implement these policies and measures.    Li Peng reaffirmed: In supporting agricultural and rural  economic development, the State Council as well as relevant  ministries and commissions, should be responsible for the  realization of any policies and measures introduced by the  central authorities; local governments should resolutely carry  out the measures adopted by them at the request of the central  authorities; and local governments at all levels should  guarantee to carry out the policies and measures formulated by  themselves.    Li Peng stressed: Governors of provinces (chairmen of  autonomous regions and mayors of municipalities) should bear  responsibility for the supply of grain and edible oil for areas  under their jurisdiction. Mayors of large and medium cities  should be responsible for the supply of non-staple foods. They  should knuckle down to their duties in carrying out the  "vegetable basket" project, which is listed as one of their job  responsibilities. Their work performance should be checked  annually and reported to the people's congress and to the people  of their cities.    The meeting pointed out that, under the guidance of Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the basic line of the CPC, party committees  and governments at all levels as well as the State Council and  all relevant departments, should work together with one will and  conscientiously carry out the guiding spirit of this meeting, so  as to achieve new success in this year's agricultural and rural  economic work.</p>

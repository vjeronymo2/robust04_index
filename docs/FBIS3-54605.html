In a memorandum submitted to the PLO Executive  Committee, 'Abd-al-Shafi said that in light of the evolving  situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, particularly after  the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles  accord, the requirements of the transfer of power, and other  matters related to the implementation of the accord, we see a  need to set up a national authority council in the Gaza Strip  and another one in the West Bank. This council should consist  of respected local nationalist personalities who enjoy national  credibility and high moral standards and who represent various  sectors of the social and political fabric.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi, who recently led the reformers'  delegation  to Tunis, defined the authority's tasks as follows:    It will be the only national and local authority and the  local address of the PLO.    It will be the only channel of contact with the PLO.    It will serve as an advisory body to the Palestinian  leadership on all local matters, above all by giving its opinion  regarding the transfer of powers and other matters stemming from  the Declaration of Principles and its implementation.    It will carry out all other tasks in its capacity as a  national and local authority council.    It will coordinate among the various bodies should this be  necessary.    The memorandum submitted by 'Abd-al-Shafi suggested that  this  authority continue in its tasks until elections are held. It  also proposed that the PLO Executive Committee form a small  preparatory committee, comprised of personalities from inside,  to set up this authority.    Dr. Taysir 'Aruri, member of the Palestinian People's Party  political bureau, has said that 'Abd-al-Shafi's demand enjoys  his party's support and that of FIDA [Palestinian Democratic  Union], Fatah's partners in the Palestinian leadership. He  pointed out that Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, member of the PLO Executive  Committee and FIDA's leader, supported this idea during the  Palestinian leadership's meetings, but the proposal was rejected  by Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday morning [11 March], on the eve of a  provincial ideological and propaganda work conference,  provincial party committee Secretary Liu Fangren visited the  Guizhou Radio Station and the Guizhou Television Station, where  he urged all the comrades on the radio and television front to  take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics as the fundamental guide; adhere to the  party's basic line; continually emancipate their minds;  constantly seek truth from facts; stick to a correct public  opinion orientation; conduct fruitful propaganda work; and make  propaganda work contribute to Guizhou's drive for reform,  opening up, and modernization.    Comrade Liu Fangren also met with persons in charge of the  Guizhou Provincial Radio and Television Department, the Guizhou  Radio Station, and the Guizhou Television Station; inspected the  operation rooms of Guizhou radio and television stations; and  made an on-site speech in which he said: In 1993, Guizhou  comprehensively fulfilled the national economic growth quotas,  and also enjoyed political stability, economic prosperity, and  nationality solidarity, thanks to concerted efforts on the part  of the people of the whole province, including the diligent  comrades on the province's radio and television front. This  year, as China's reform is entering a crucial stage, propaganda  work should unswervingly serve the overall interests. What are  the overall interests? Grasping opportunities, deepening  reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and  maintaining stability undoubtedly represent the overall  interests of the whole party and the propaganda work in 1994.  This year, China is to implement a series of major reform  measures. In view of this new situation, we should actively  conduct propaganda and news reporting work in a timely manner  and in an assured way, with an eye to pushing ahead with the  reforms.    Comrade Liu Fangren stated: Radio and television work  constitutes an important part of the overall propaganda work  because of their extensive coverage. Thus we should make  redoubled efforts to improve the quality of radio and television  programs, and try to make them more interesting and absorbing.  The radio and television front should strive to build a strong  contingent of competent personnel; encourage those engaged in  the radio and television work to go deep among the masses and  into reality, as well as to the forefront of the reform, opening  up, and modernization drive; and conduct more interviews with,  and file more reports on advanced models capable of displaying a  history-making spirit of selfless devotion.    Those accompanying Secretary Liu Fangren on his visit to the  Guizhou radio and television stations included Huang Yao, member  of the provincial party committee standing committee and  director of the propaganda department; Gu Zhijie, secretary  general of the provincial party committee; and others.    Secretary Liu Fangren and his entourage also visited the  headquarters of GUIZHOU RIBAO and the Guizhou branch of XINHUA,  and met with news workers there.</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Russian women have right to fair debate on abortion Sir, Your article on the right of abortion in Russia was disappointing ('Russia's woman face a new reign of fear', August 21/22 1993). To assume, as Lore Cidylo does, that abortion is a 'fundamental right' is to miss the point of the debate: to determine whether such right does exist or not. Unsubstantiated statements more at home with a political pamphlet than the FT ('for women, democracy has turned out to be a painful disappointment', 'Russian women say they will put up a vociferous legislative fight') are not useful to the debate. And to suggest that democracy may 'spell a setback to women's rights' reminds me of many a dictator. Abortion is an extremely serious issue that deserves to be discussed both deeply and objectively and not in a sectarian way. Louis Baqueriza, Staronovodniskaya 4-B App 11, Kiev 252015, Ukraine</p>

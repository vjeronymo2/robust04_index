			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Amstrad Mr Alan Sugar looks likely to get a well-deserved bloody nose. He can hardly be surprised. His offer for Amstrad combines the worst features of a management buy-out with a disclosure level inadequate even in less compromising situations. Shareholders can congratulate themselves on striking a blow for corporate governance. But after that, what next? There is not much hope of a higher offer. Outside directors might prevent further embarrassment. They could not be expected to wring full value from the assets. One has to hope Mr Sugar will do that job himself. Judging by the rock-solid share price, he has convinced the market that Amstrad is worth more than just principles.</p>

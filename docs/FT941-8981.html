			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Government halts Arran probe The Office of Fair Trading will not continue with an investigation into bus services on the island of Arran, where Western Scottish, with 12 buses, says that Arran Transport, with two buses, is running uneconomic services with a view to forcing it off the island. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said the size of the case did not justify the costs and burden of an investigation - which would have lasted six months - into the competition issues raised.</p>

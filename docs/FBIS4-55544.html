			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Coriolan Hancu: "If the Greater Romania Party </F> Leader Is Not in Prison in 1996, He Will Run for the Presidency"]    [Text] Today will be a difficult day for Ilie Verdet,  chairman of the PSM [Socialist Party of Labor]. This is because  during today's news conference by his socialist, former  nomenclature, comrades he might be subjected to an avalanche of  questions reminding the PSM leader that not so long ago -- at  the time when the Tudor Mohora-Adrian Paunescu duel had not yet  been won by the latter -- he had stated: "There is no such  thing as a National Bloc and I will conclude no agreements with  Corneliu Vadim Tudor [chairman of the Greater Romania Party --  PRM]."    Among other things, the secret pact concluded last week by  the two parties, which consecrated the defeat of the Mohora  faction and caused dissatisfaction among the members of the two  parties, also comprises a joint project intended for the future:  According to this, PSM and PRM should support a joint candidate  in the next presidential elections, a person that conforms with  the interests of both parties. The leaders of PSM and PRM  concluded that pact, hoping that in Romania, in the same way as  in Poland and more recently in Hungary, the possible early  elections will be won by the Communists, that is, by them,  because the ideologies of the parties they lead are parts of the  red doctrine. However, Ilie Verdet and Corneliu Vadim Tudor  seem to ignore the fact that so far Romania has been run solely  by the former nomenclature.    Regarding the candidate to the presidency the two parties  envisaged for the 1996 presidential elections, he is, according  to rumors, none other than the "tribune" himself [Corneliu Vadim  Tudor]. Of course, only if by the time the elections are held  he is still at large (he currently faces a total of  approximately 200 legal suits.)    However, the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] will  certainly take all necessary measures to ensure that when the  time comes, the Communists all over the country should favor one  candidate alone to the supreme office in the state, namely Ion  Iliescu.</p>

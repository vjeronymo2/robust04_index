			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As you are all aware, the Federation of Labor Unions  of Niger [USTN] has launched a 48-hour warning strike as of  today. The USTN is demanding the cancellation of the ordinance  banning workers' right to go on strike, and a 30 to 50 percent  salary increase. The USTN organized a rally at the Place de la  Concertation today before conducting a peaceful march to the  prime minister's office, where its leaders presented workers'  grievances to the premier's permanent undersecretary. A large  contingent of security forces supervised the demonstration, and  no incidents were reported.    The strike seems to have been widely followed in the capital  despite various orders given to workers to report for work. In  Zinder, the strike was widely followed but the peaceful march  failed. According to the NIGER NEWS AGENCY [ANP], only about 50  labor activists joined the march organized by the local USTN  secretary general. In Diffa, the strike call was widely  followed, the local ANP correspondent noted. The march was also  a success and union activists chanted slogans hostile to the  ordinance on the right to go on strike.    Meanwhile, several labor unions, particularly the National  Union of Commerce Workers, have sent motions to the USTN  expressing their unflinching support for the USTN and calling on  their activists to respect and follow the strike call. The  Autonomous Union of Magistrates has also expressed total moral  support for the USTN in its demand for salary increases and for  payment of salary arrears. It called on the USTN and the  government to find a solution to the dispute over the law  ratifying the bill on the right to go on strike.    The Executive Bureau of the Union of National Administration  School Students, after analyzing the situation, regretted the  showdown between the various parties and called on the  government and the USTN to show a higher degree of patriotism by  making every effort to give priority to dialogue in finding a  solution to the problem. It urged members of parliament to  fully play their role as people's representatives by helping to  ease all tensions. The union also called on Nigerois to be  aware of the various dangers that are looming and threatening  our dear country.    The National Executive Bureau of the Union of Youth,  Culture,  and Sports Workers also reminded some officials that the  exceptional period and the period of intimidation are gone for  ever. It gave its unwavering support to the USTN's struggle and  urgently appealed to all its activists to heed the strike call.</p>

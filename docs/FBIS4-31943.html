			<p>BFN     [Text] A coalition agreement on future cooperation was  reached on 15 June between the Hungarian Christian Democratic  Movement in Slovakia and Coexistence. Ildiko Nagy reports from  Bratislava on the details:    [Begin Nagy recording] It lays down close political  cooperation, the setting up of joint bodies, a dual election  coalition, and further expansion with a third partner. The two  sides also agreed that they would begin discussions soon with  the Hungarian Civic Party on expanding the dual coalition into a  triple one.    In answer to a question from Hungarian radio's correspondent  [Nagy], Bela Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian Christian  Democratic Movement, said he was satisfied with the result  because they managed to achieve what the movement's national  executive asked the negotiating delegation to do: to try to form  a triple coalition. The two partners have already agreed on the  conditions for this; however, this will be made public only  after the dual coalition agreement is signed next week.    The documents adopted at the 8 January 1994 Komarno rally  constitute the basis of the agreement. If these are acceptable  to the third party--that is, the Hungarian Civic Party--then, in  the view of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement  chairman, they will succeed in forming a triple election  alliance.

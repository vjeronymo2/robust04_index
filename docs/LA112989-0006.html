			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUTTING U.S. DEFENSE SPENDING  </P> <P> The unfolding major decline in worldwide communism should strikingly improve  the military security of the United States. However, even if we receive a  "peace" dividend because of reduced military expenditures, our country might  face tougher economic competition.  </P> <P> Some of those countries converting from communism to capitalism would become  far more competitive in a global economy.  </P> <P> At the end of World War II, the U.S. dominated the world economy, but has seen  its share of the world gross national product slip with the rise of other  capitalist economies out of the ashes of war.  </P> <P> Aren't we in for a new wave of hard-nosed competitors out of the ashes of  communism?  </P> <P> What if a number of these new capitalists follow Japan's post-war philosophy of  high savings and investment rates, in order to favor a rapid buildup in  production capacity? If so, are we willing to curtail our profligate consumer  borrowing and spending habits in order to compete under the new reality?  </P> <P> FLOYD A. OLIVER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

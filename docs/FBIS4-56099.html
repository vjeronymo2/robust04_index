			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Pavol Kanis by </F> correspondent Ivan Samel on 26 May; place not given -- live or  recorded]    [Excerpts] [Samel] Mr. Minister, what steps will be  followed after the submission to NATO yesterday of the Slovak  document on the Partnership for Peace program, both on  Slovakia's and on NATO's part?    [Kanis] By presenting the document we have begun to  institutionalize the process of implemenating the Partnership  for Peace program. Relevant organizational structures will be  created that will be involved in a specific program of joint  actions, as expressed in the individual program. In this way,  the basic prerequisites will be created for tackling the  questions of Slovak security. A special NATO group will soon  come to Bratislava to begin, along with our military and  security specialists, to examine the content of the document we  have presented to NATO, above all the proposals we have included  in it which express our capabilities and resources which we will  provide in the implementation of the document presented in  Brussels. They will begin to confront the document with  reality, with what Slovakia is capable of doing. Up to now, we  have received offers for joint exercises from the Netherlands  and Norway, and during a dinner the Romanian defense minister  also proposed that we carry out such a joint exercise at which a  military unit from a NATO member country would participate.    We are a small state wrestling with a number of problems and  cannot efford to make mistakes in the procedure. We will  carefully weigh up the whole situation which arises from the  presentation document and create certain model situations. As  soon as possible, we would like to prepare all the defense  personnel who are going to share in the implementation of the  presentation document to a degree which enables us to be  perfectly prepared to cope when we take part in joint actions.  [passage omitted]    [Samel] Unquestionably, the Russian Federation has a  specific  position in NATO's eyes. Can an individual treaty between NATO  and Russia influence the form of the individual treaty concluded  between Slovakia and NATO?    [Kanis] I believe that the course of NATO has shown that  apparently no country has the chance of gaining any other status  with regard to the partnership for Peace Program. Naturally,  the Russian Federation is a great Euro-Asian power, and because  of this it will apparently cooperate in a different manner. I  would not exclude the possibility of certain problems being  tackled through bilateral U.S.-Russian relations, outside the  Partnership for Peace Program. My understanding of the  situation is that within the Partnership for Peace program the  Russian Federation will be in an equal position. This does not  mean that some other, additional provisions will not be  included, wither at the bilateral level or at the level of  cooperation with NATO.    [Samel] Can a situation arise under which Slovakia would be  compelled under certain circumstances, such as a treaty between  Russia and the United States, to leave the Partnership for Peace  program?    [Kanis] I totally exclude such a possibility. Central  European nations and states today have an opportunity slowly to  draw nearer to the West European and trans-Atlantic security,  political, and economic structures. Therefore, I do not admit  to such a possibility at all. The thing is to ensure that  conditions are created within the framework of the Partnership  for Peace program for small Central European nations and states  to enable them, of their own will, to become a real entity in  European politics.</p>

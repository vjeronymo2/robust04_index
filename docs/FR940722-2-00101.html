OPRA has designated this proposal as concerned solely with an existing fee, permitting it to become effective upon filing, pursuant to Rule 11Aa3&hyph;2(c)(3)(ii) under the Act. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments from interested persons on the amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Description and Purpose of the Amendment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the proposed amendment is to respond to recent and ongoing changes in computer and communications technology that have resulted in an ever greater number of OPRA subscribers choosing to receive options information in the form of a bulk data feed transmission from a vendor, rather than as a vendor-controlled interrogation or display service. At the time the Subscriber Indirect Access Fee was first adopted, only a relatively few large subscribers received a data feed transmission, usually to serve multiple terminals in a network. The Subscribers Indirect Access Fee was intended to allocate to these subscribers OPRA's higher administrative costs associated with providing access to subscribers whose terminal population is not under vendor control. Recent changes in computer and communications technology have now made it cost effective for an increasing number of smaller OPRA subscribers to access options market information by means of vendor-provided, data-feed transmissions received on a single computer terminal. Since such single-device data-feed subscribers do not subject OPRA to the higher costs associated with multiple device counts and entitlements, OPRA has determined that it would more fairly allocated its costs through the fees charged to various categories of users of options market information to exempt such single-device data feed subscribers from the Subscriber Indirect Access Fee. Such subscribers will continue to be subject to OPRA's basic Subscriber Fee, and the Indirect Access Fee will continue to apply to multiple terminal users of data feed transmissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Solicitation of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Rule 11Aa3&hyph;2(c)(3), the amendment is effective upon filing with the Commission. The Commission may summarily abrogate the amendment within 60 days of its filing and require refiling and approval of the amendment by Commission order pursuant to Rule 11Aa3&hyph;2(c)(2), if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors and maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a National Market System, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing.

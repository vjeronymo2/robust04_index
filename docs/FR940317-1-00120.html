			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii) Father or mother, or both.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Brothers or sisters, or both.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A member of another U.S. Armed Force may present a claim to an Army claims office for loss of or damage to personal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property incident to his or her service. Any such claim will be investigated and processed short of adjudication under the provisions of this chapter. The completed file will contain all required supporting documents, including evidence in support of the amount claimed and documents facilitating recovery from a carrier, insurer, or other third party. Such claims will be forwarded direct to the nearest legal office of the service concerned for settlement. However, Marine personnel claims should be forwarded directly to the Commandant of the Marine Corps (MHP&hyph;40), Headquarters, United States Marine Corps, Washington, DC 20380&hyph;0001.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Claims of civilian employees of nonappropriated fund activities for damage to or loss of personal property incident to their service will be processed in accordance with this chapter and subpart L, with payment made only from nonappropriated funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Subrogees, assignees, conditional vendors, and similar third parties are not proper claimants under this chapter, and their claims are barred from payment. Further, claims for losses of subrogees and similar third parties are barred from consideration or payment under other chapters when the property owner could have presented a cognizable claim for loss under the provisions of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Personnel who do not fall within one of the categories listed in a above (such as Red Cross employees, foreign military personnel, United Services Organization personnel, or employees of Government contractors, including technical representatives) are not proper claimants under this chapter, and their claims are barred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Claimants who are absent without leave (AWOL) will have any pending claim denied once they are dropped from the rolls (DFR). The denial letter will be mailed to the claimant's last known civilian address.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.165  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims cognizable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following are nonexclusive examples of categories of damage to or loss of property that may be considered by claims approval and settlement authorities as having been sustained incident to service. Note that a loss unconnected with the performance of duty, particularly a loss occurring outside of normal duty hours, would often not be deemed incident to a civilian employee's service, even though the same loss might be deemed incident to a soldier's service. This is particularly true if the civilian employee is a local foreign national employee. A claims approval or settlement authority will ask the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, USARCS for an advance opinion prior to adjudicating a claim that is deemed incident to service but does not fall within one of the following categories:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Losses in quarters or other authorized places. Damage to or loss of property by fire, flood, hurricane, or other unusual occurrence, or by theft or vandalism may be considered, while located at_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Quarters, wherever situated, which are assigned to the claimant or otherwise provided in kind by the Government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Quarters outside the United States, which are occupied authority but are neither assigned to the claimant nor otherwise provided in kind by the Government. However, a claim is not cognizable when the claimant is_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A civilian employee who is a local inhabitant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A U.S. citizen hired as a civilian employee while residing abroad or after moving to a foreign country as part of the household of a person who is not a proper party claimant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A family member residing outside the United States while the soldier is stationed in a different country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) A local inhabitant of a U.S. territory who is in that territory at the time of a loss when he or she is in the ARNG either Full Time-National Guard Duty (AGR) or on active duty under title 10, or in the USAR on active duty for any reason.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Any place of lodging wherever situated, such as a hotel, motel, guest house, transit billet or other place, when occupied by claimant while in the performance of temporary duty or similar authorized military assignment of a temporary nature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Any warehouse, office, hospital, baggage holding area, or other place authorized or apparently authorized by the government for the reception or storage of personal property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Transportation losses. Damage to or loss of property incident to transportation or storage pursuant to orders or in connection with travel under orders or in performance of military duty may be considered, if not the result of a mechanical or structural defect. This includes property in the custody of_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A common or contract carrier or any other commercial concern, either pursuant to a Government Bill of Lading (GBL), Government contract, or the commuted rate method (Joint Travel Regulation (JTR) Vol II, paragraph C8001(4)). With respect to mobile homes, it is the owner's responsibility to place the mobile home and its tires, tubes, frame, and other parts in fit condition and to load the mobile home to withstand the stress of normal transportation, at his or her own expense, prior to shipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An agent or agency of the Government, to include property mailed at Government expense in the custody of the U.S. Postal Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The claimant or appropriate personnel while the claimant is traveling in a private or public vessel, vehicle, aircraft, or other conveyance in performance of military duty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The claimant or appropriate personnel while the claimant is traveling aboard a military vessel, aircraft, or vehicle in performance of military duty or pursuant to orders authorizing travel, including travel pursuant to leave orders on a space available basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Losses due to enemy action, evacuation, hostile acts, or public service. Damage to or loss of property may be considered which is a direct result of_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Enemy action, or threat thereof; combat, guerrilla, or other belligerent activities, whether or not the United States was involved; or unjust confiscation by a foreign power or its nationals of property belonging to soldiers or U.S. national civilian employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Acts of mob violence, terrorist attacks, or other hostile acts directed against the United States or its officers and employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Action by the claimant in an attempt to quiet a civil disturbance or alleviate a public disaster.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Efforts by the claimant to save a human life or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Government property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Evacuation from a foreign country on the recommendation or order of competent authority. This subsection provides payment for property belonging to soldiers and civilian employees and their command-sponsored dependents, with entitlement to shipment at Government expense, which is abandoned during an evacuation and not recovered, or damaged by an incident of political unrest or hostile act prompting or following such evacuation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Loss of money delivered to a Government agent. Loss of funds neither applied as directed by the owner nor returned may be considered when the funds were delivered to and accepted by Government personnel authorized or apparently authorized to receive them for such purposes as safekeeping; deposit in savings deposit program; transmission by personal transfer account; purchase of U.S. bonds or postal money orders; or conversion into military payment orders, Government checks, or into another kind of currency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

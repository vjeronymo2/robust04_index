			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Singer and Friedlander to market funds in Europe SINGER AND Friedlander, the investment banking firm, has formed a unit trust company to market investment funds in Europe and take advantage of new legislation easing cross-border sales. Mr Tony Fraher, managing director of Morgan Grenfell Asset Management's unit trust arm and eight other sales, marketing and management staff will run the new Dublin-based venture. Fund management services will be provided by Singer and Friedlander and its own stockbroking venture, Collins and Stewart. Mr Fraher was a director of MGAM and its management committee and was responsible for setting up Morgan Grenfell's unit trust operations which now have Pounds 360m under management and several top performing unit trusts. He said: 'We will be taking advantage of the UCITS directive to sell marketable securities throughout the EC and the Far East.' Most Asian countries were prepared to authorise non-domestic investment funds for sale in their own countries if the fund had met EC requirements, Mr Fraher added. Under UCITS legislation, trusts based in any EC country may be automatically marketed in any other country without special permission. However, cross-border sales of UCITS throughout the EC have stayed low, due mostly to the inability of non-domestic funds to tap into effective distribution networks. In most European countries, investment funds are sold through banks who are keen to push their own products. Mr Fraher said he would seek to overcome distribution problems by forming a series of joint ventures with domestic distributors. The firm was keen to purchase the assets of a mutual fund company, and would consider a non-UK fund.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Technology: Aerosol industry tries to clear the air - Now that CFCs have gone, manufacturers are phasing out other harmful ingredients If you cannot be bothered to shine furniture, just spray the polish in the air and the boss will believe you have done the job. This practice is one of the many reasons why people love aerosols. Except for Swedes and Finns, who prefer to roll on their deodorants, all leading world markets are showing increased aerosol sales. The UK alone produced 935m aerosols in 1993, up 6.25 per cent on the previous year, according to the British Aerosol Manufacturers' Association. There was a small dip in aerosol sales in the late 1980s as consumers became more aware of the effect of CFCs. The drop was sufficient to prompt the industry to look at alternative propellants. 'Our research across Europe confirms that since CFCs were removed from aerosols, consumers are largely unaware of any remaining environmental issues, such as recyclability, flammability, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and amounts of packaging,' says Paul Scott, environment consultant with Dragon International, a corporate reputation consultancy. 'But the aerosol industry is addressing all the environmental issues and some new products will show significant improvements in VOC emissions and the ratio of packaging to usage,' he says. VOCs are the vapours given off by a range of volatile chemicals used in industry, such as solvents, and contained in consumer products, such as house paint, petrol and those aerosols which use hydrocarbons (for instance, butane) as a propellant or as part of the formula. VOCs collect in the atmosphere and react with sunlight to form photochemical smog and low-level ozone. These city smogs, which also drift into rural areas, affect breathing and can be particularly harmful to young children and the elderly. European countries have signed a UN treaty to reduce VOC emissions by a third of 1988 levels, by 1999. Industry is also looking at ways to reduce its VOC emissions. SC Johnson, the multinational that owns leading cleaning, polishing and hygiene brands such as Pledge, Glade and Mr Muscle, has taken a lead by replacing butane propellant with compressed air in its Pledge polish spray. The company is committed to reduce the ratio of VOCs to its raw materials by 25 per cent between 1990 and next year. This will help the company meet the UN target. Aerosol dispensers create a fine spray by propelling the liquidised product through a small hole. The propellant is usually a liquid gas which occupies the same space in the canister, sometimes separated from the product, sometimes mixed, depending on the formulation. Press the release valve and the pressure exerted by the gas forces the product up the spout and through the nozzle. The gas evaporates, leaving the product to settle. CFCs - non toxic and non flammable - were the ideal propellants until it became known that they damaged the ozone layer. Hydrocarbon gases, such as butane, were established propellants before CFCs were invented and they were generally used to replace CFCs in household and industrial aerosols. Other benign gases, such as nitrogen and nitrous oxide, are used in food and personal hygiene products, but are unsuitable or too expensive for more general use. In the late 1980s various technologies were offered to provide aerosol delivery without gas propellants. Few have been taken up. Most new technologies required the reformulation of the products because CFCs and hydrocarbons were integral to their performance, helping to disperse or foam the product as it came out of the can. Much hope was placed in compressed air. There were two possibilities: pressurise the container when filling it, or provide a pump for the customer to create the pressure for each spraying session. Hairsprays using the pump-and-spray technology were launched in the late 1980s. But after an initial take-up customers tired of pumping and reverted to traditional aerosols. The aerosol industry points to the market's rejection of pump-and-spray as an endorsement of liquid-gas propellants. But cynics suggest that the industry has failed to promote and develop the technology sufficiently and is using the market's reaction as an excuse to use options that are less environmentally acceptable. Johnson argues that the customer will not tolerate any reduction in quality. It has therefore taken the technically more complex route and used compressed air in a pressurised container to propel its Pledge furniture polish in much the same way as with butane. Johnson set about overcoming the known problems of using compressed air, especially the gradual reduction in pressure as the container empties. The product was also re-formulated to work with the new delivery system. Solvent is still used, but VOC emissions have been reduced by a third overall. After five years of research and development Johnson perfected the technology and converted its Dutch factory filling line, which serves Europe. Compressed-air Pledge was launched in Italy and is being introduced to other countries this year. Philippe Darquier, vice-president, group director for Europe, says compressed air will become the dominant propellant in the future. This is good for the environment and Johnson's business. 'We see great commercial advantage from being the first in,' he says.</p>

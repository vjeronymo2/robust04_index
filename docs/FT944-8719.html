			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Brussels tests Britain's power to block foreign takeovers The European Commission has turned the tables on Britain's Conservative government by accusing it of being over-interventionist in its defence of a controversial piece of legislation framed by the Labour government in 1975. Brussels has opened proceedings against the UK over part of the 1975 Industry Act - drawn up by Mr Tony Benn, the then Labour industry secretary  -which allows the government to prevent foreign takeovers of UK manufacturers. The commission argues that the provision is incompatible with European Union rules on the free movement of capital and, even if rarely used, acts as a deterrent to foreign investment in the UK. However, the department of trade and industry said yesterday the government felt there was still a role for the secretary of state for industry to play 'in protecting the national interest'. Clause 13 of the act - much of which has been repealed by the Conservative government - states that the industry secretary has the right to prohibit a foreign takeover if it appears that there is a 'serious and immediate' probability of a change of control which would be contrary to the interests of the UK. This goes further than EU laws that allow national governments to intervene on health and security grounds, and actively breaches rules which foresee no restrictions on capital movement and direct investment. The insistence from the commission that the provision be dropped or at least altered is politically embarrassing for Mr John Major's government which has frequently harangued the commission for taking an over-interventionist approach to industrial policy. 'It is really remarkable that this piece of legislation has survived all these years of Conservative rule,' said a British official in Brussels yesterday. UK industry officials said the clause had been kept 'just in case'. 'There has been speculation from time to time about the risk of UK business falling into foreign hands. The government accepts that the legislation is otiose, but it may be needed one day,' said an industry official. The issue of national ownership is politically sensitive, particularly in the UK. When Rover, the car maker, was acquired by BMW of Germany earlier this year, there was widespread dismay among the British public. 'This issue has touched a political nerve. A large number of voters feel rather worried when they see British industry threatened,' said a UK official. The DTI said the commission complaint was not directed at the government's 'golden share' holdings in certain companies which limit foreign ownership, but rather at the general principle of the 1975 law. The official added that the UK was hoping to come to an 'amicable' agreement with the commission.</p>

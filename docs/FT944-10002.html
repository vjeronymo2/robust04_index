			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Perspectives: The positive side of NO - The Nature of Things / Clive Cookson looks at a simple, unassuming little molecule that can both kill and cure Some things are so small and unobtrusive that you fail to notice their presence, even though they are doing useful work all around you. The most striking example in science is nitric oxide - NO - which was regarded until recently as a boring and insignificant little molecule but is now known to be one of the most important of all natural chemicals. Scientists used to think of NO just as a polluting gas emitted by power stations and car exhausts. But over the past seven years they have discovered that NO performs an astonishingly wide range of biological roles, from laying down memories in the brain to controlling blood pressure, from killing germs and cancer cells to preventing premature birth. Indeed this simple molecule - one oxygen atom joined to one nitrogen - is probably both the smallest of all biologically active substances and the most diverse in its functions. This makes it rather embarrassing for science that biological NO remained undiscovered for so long. One reason is that for decades molecular biologists had been finding more and more complexity in living systems. They were trained to look for large organic molecules whose functions were determined by their shape - the classic image is the chemical key fitting into a lock - and they did not imagine that a simple inorganic gas such as NO could play such an important role. No one individual can take credit for revealing the significance of NO. This has emerged from the convergence of research into several distinct phenomena, including the expansion and contraction of blood vessels, cell killing by the immune system, and chemical signalling in the brain. NO was first proved to be produced by living systems in 1987, when scientists at the Wellcome Research Laboratories in Kent detected tiny 'puffs' of NO, given off by cells in the lining of blood vessels to make the vessel walls contract. Subsequent research has shown that NO plays a wide role in controlling blood pressure and in maintaining the health of the heart and blood system. It is also a general-purpose muscle relaxant in the body. These observations cleared up several mysteries in pharmacology. One was the action of the nitrate drugs used since the 19th century to treat angina. It turns out that the nitrate breaks down in the body to release NO, which dilates the arteries and allows more blood to reach the heart. New applications for NO's muscle-relaxing powers are already emerging. One is a nitrate-releasing skin patch which delays the onset of labour in women who would otherwise give birth prematurely. In the immune system, NO plays a quite different and far more aggressive role. It is the long sought toxic agent released by macrophages - mobile blood cells that kill invading germs and proliferating cancer cells. Macrophages give off much larger puffs of NO than cells in blood vessels. The process does not normally harm the human host because NO acts over a very short range and dissipates rapidly, lasting no more than a few seconds in the body. But it can kill someone who is overwhelmed with a bacterial infection, releasing a huge excess of NO that reduces blood pressure to a lethally low level. This is now believed to be the mechanism by which people die of 'septic shock'. Excessive release over a longer period may also cause trouble. Scientists are beginning to blame NO for the damage inflicted by auto-immune diseases such as diabetes. NO's third main theatre of activity, in the brain and nervous system, involves the smallest puffs of gas. Its role as a neurotransmitter - sending chemical signals between nerve cells - is the most recently discovered and is still far from being well understood. Scientists believe, however, that NO plays an essential part in laying down memory through 'long-term potentiation', a poorly characterised process by which neural pathways change through repeated stimulation. In the brain, as elsewhere, NO is a Jekyll-and-Hyde molecule. Under the right conditions, it not only acts as an essential neurotransmitter but also protects nerve cells against stress. When things go wrong, NO poisons the brain. It is implicated in a wide range of neurological disorders, including senile dementia, Parkinson's disease, stroke and epilepsy. NO research has not been going long enough for scientists to know what tilts the balance between Jekyll and Hyde, let alone how to intervene in Dr Jekyll's favour. It is not just a matter of a little NO being good and too much being bad; other factors, such as the acidity of its surroundings, affect the molecule's behaviour. Now that NO's importance is universally acknowledged, thousands of scientists are working on it. Academics are elucidating its fundamental mechanisms of action while pharmaceutical researchers try to develop drugs, either to deliver more NO to cells where there is too little or to inhibit its formation where there is an excess. Although some of the first drugs designed with a knowledge of NO are beginning clinical trials, the timescales of the pharmaceutical industry mean that they will not make a big impact on medicine for several years. The immediate lesson of NO is that biologists should not be so obsessed with interactions between complex and highly specialised molecules that they ignore the work done by simple gases. NO may not be the only one with unsuspected biological functions. Ethylene (CH) is a ripening hormone in plants and may play a role in animals too. And there is recent evidence that carbon monoxide (CO) acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain. More generally, NO shows again how scientists can be so caught up by the prevailing paradigm that they ignore important evidence that is, in retrospect, obvious. In practice, though, there may be no other way for science to proceed, without changing human nature.</p>

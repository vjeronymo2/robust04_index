			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> EL CAJON COUNCIL VOTES TO SUE STATE ON SPRAYING;  </P> <P> MALATHION: MAYOR TELLS CAPACITY CROWD THAT THE CITY WILL WAIT UNTIL FRIDAY TO  HEAR FROM THE GOVERNOR.  </P> <P> The El Cajon City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to sue the state of  California unless Gov. George Deukmejian heeds its request to call off the  aerial malathion spraying that is planned over a 16-square-mile residential  area.  </P> <P> After an hour of discussion and a brief closed meeting, the five-member council  adopted a resolution to condemn the aerial spraying and urge the governor and  state officials to stay the plan, which now calls for three applications of the  pesticide over a four-week period beginning as early as Monday. The council  authorized the city attorney to begin litigation if the governor does not grant  the request.  </P> <P> "I will not sit idly by and let the governor proceed with this if I can prevent  it," Mayor John W. Reber said, prompting applause from a standing-room-only  audience of about 200 El Cajon residents. "If we don't hear from the governor  by Friday morning, a lawsuit will be filed."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Gary A. Reece, chief of agriculture services for the county  Department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures, said the state appears to be  moving ahead to begin spraying Monday evening.  </P> <P> "As far as we know, it's Monday at 9 p.m.," Reece said.  </P> <P> Today, county officials were expecting to receive formal announcements from the  state to be distributed to residents in the affected area, Reece said. "As far  as I know, that's all falling in place."  </P> <P> The malathion spraying plan is a response to a suspected infestation of the  Mexican fruit fly, or Mexfly. Since April 25, three Mexflies -- one mature male  and two egg-bearing females -- have been trapped within a quarter of a mile of  each other in a residential area near John F. Kennedy Park, just south of  Interstate 8.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, however, Reber noted that not a single Mexfly has been found since  May 5, despite increased trapping efforts in the area.  </P> <P> "That tells me this is an isolated area, and we have it under control with  voluntary spraying," he said, referring to a ground-spraying program that began  May 8. "I think the governor is overreacting at the present time."  </P> <P> What had been scheduled as a council "discussion" quickly turned into a mass  venting of anger, as several El Cajon residents said they felt ambushed by the  state's decision and outraged by their inability to affect it.  </P> <P> On Monday, the governor declared a state of emergency, eliminating the need for  public hearings on the spraying plan. Tuesday afternoon, residents made it  clear they resent being muzzled.  </P> <P> "This is not hurt feelings; this is an extreme feeling of frustration," said  Peggie Willbanks. "You must pay your taxes, and you must obey your government,  but when it comes down to dumping a poisonous pesticide that will affect our  children, our pets and everything else, we have nothing to say. We are being  bombarded."  </P> <P> Some people expressed themselves silently, wearing gas masks and other  protective gear. Dan Tarr, an El Cajon resident and member of the San Diego  Greens, an environmental group, wore a white protective outfit, complete with  booties and hood.  </P> <P> "This is the Henry Voss collection for spring," he said, referring to the  director of the state Department of Food and Agriculture who gave the order  Friday to approve the spray plan. "What the well-dressed El Cajoner will be  wearing."  </P> <P> Other people took the podium, supporting the council's action as they predicted  the ills that will befall El Cajon if the spraying goes forward. Ken Horton, a  resident of East County since 1936, said he had firsthand experience with  malathion when he interviewed agriculture workers for the state in the 1960s.  </P> <P> Horton said the workers he met wore heavy, long-sleeved clothing in the fields  even on the hottest days. They told him they had to bundle up to protect  themselves from malathion, which gave them rashes and infections. Horton said a  "sunburn-like prickling" and rash soon prompted him to don heavy clothes as  well -- but that even that wasn't enough.  </P> <P> "It penetrated my shirt," he said, explaining that he found he had to change  clothes and take a shower after each visit to a sprayed area.  </P> <P> Barbara Moran, an El Cajon resident and spokeswoman for the Sierra Club, warned  that malathion will kill butterflies and bees as well as Mexflies, while  letting stronger and more adaptable pests, such as fleas and ticks, survive.  Moran drew cheers when she said that, if the spraying begins, "I would urge the  people of El Cajon to boycott produce grown by California agribusiness."  </P> <P> Because of time constraints, only a handful of people were allowed to speak,  prompting boos from the crowd.  </P> <P> "I live right in the middle of this stuff and I want to speak about it," yelled  Vicki Miles, a mother of two young children, when she was informed she would  not have a turn at the microphone. Later, outside the meeting, she said that,  on Sunday, unbeknown to her or her neighbors on Melody Lane, the state sprayed  in her area.  </P> <P> "My windows were wide open and the spray came right in," she said. "I don't  want it dropped. I don't want it sprayed. I don't want it in my house."  </P> <P> Reber, at a loss for how to accommodate such a large crowd, urged residents to  send telegrams and letters to the governor.  </P> <P> Before the vote, Stephen M. Eckis, deputy city attorney, had warned the council  that the type of litigation they were considering is one "at which no one has  been successful to this point." But he added that he believes "the facts are  different" in San Diego County than in other California counties that have  sued.  </P> <P> For example, when Voss issued his decision on the spraying plan, he failed to  list non-pesticide alternatives to the spraying, as required, Eckis said. Eckis  also said that, if the El Cajon spraying is to be carried out as it has been in  other counties -- via helicopters, flying in formation about 300 to 500 feet  above ground at 75 m.p.h. -- it may violate Federal Aviation Administration  rules. He also said that some endangered species may be affected by the plan.  </P> <P> Before the meeting, environmental groups held a press conference on the steps  of the council chambers to challenge the state's contention that the malathion  spraying would be harmless.  </P> <P> "The state has been lying to you -- malathion is a carcinogen," said Sharon  Taylor, the pesticide reduction coordinator for the San Diego Environmental  Health Coalition. "They told us DDT was safe. They told us Agent Orange was  safe. And asbestos. Do you believe them?"  </P> <P> State and county officials have scheduled an educational public meeting at  Granite Hills High School at 7 p.m. Thursday. Two hot lines have also been  established to answer questions about the use of malathion. For health  questions, call 1-800-439-6359. For agricultural questions, call  1-800-427-6359, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.  </P></p>

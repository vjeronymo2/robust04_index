			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: TIPS;  </P> <P> 300 YARDS ACROSS THE SEA  </P> <P> THIS JUST MIGHT be the best transportation bargain around. Far more scenic than  a ride on the RTD, and much less crazy-making than getting a cab, it's the  ferry ride between Balboa peninsula and Balboa Island.  </P> <P> On the four-minute crossing, riders are treated to a stunning panorama of the  Balboa waterfront. The Balboa Island Ferry runs daily, and tickets cost 65  cents for car and driver, 25 cents for adults and 10 cents for kids.  </P> <P>  Catch the ferry on Palm Street on the peninsula, and Agate Avenue on the  island; (714) 673-1070.

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / N Korea-US deal eases fears: Breakthrough will end suspicions of bomb development International fears over North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons programme abated yesterday in the wake of a deal that will open the country to inspections and improve ties with the US. The agreement is a sign that Mr Kim Jong-il, the new North Korean leader, is prepared to broaden his country's international contacts. It also raised hopes that he will accelerate the opening of the country to foreign investment. Mr Han Sung-joo, the South Korean foreign minister, said the agreement 'goes a long way' to removing a potential North Korean nuclear threat. A US State Department spokesman said: 'What we've got is an agreement that made a very dangerous place in the world at a very dangerous moment a lot safer.' Mr Robert Gallucci, head of the US delegation in the tortuous negotiation, announced a breakthrough in talks with North Korean officials in Geneva at midnight on Monday. Chief negotiators made clear that although the agreement had to be approved by their governments, they were confident it would be signed on Friday as scheduled. Mr Kang Sok-ju, North Korea's first deputy foreign minister and head of the delegation to the Geneva talks, said the planned replacement of North Korea's existing graphite-moderated nuclear reactor programme with light-water reactor technology would 'completely eliminate and dispel' suspicions about Pyongyang's alleged development of nuclear weapons. The agreement is linked to the gradual improvement of bilateral relations between Washington and Pyongyang, which Mr Kang said, would 'make a significant contribution to greater peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world'. The deal apparently provides for a delay in inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency to determine whether North Korea has already reprocessed plutonium for nuclear weapons. South Korean officials had expressed concern that such a delay would give Pyongyang more time to produce a bomb from plutonium it is suspected of having reprocessed five years ago. There were also doubts in Seoul about providing North Korea with international aid that could revive its troubled economy when it appears to be heading towards collapse. But officials yesterday acknowledged that they had little choice but to accept the accord concluded by the US, South Korea's main military and economic ally.</p>

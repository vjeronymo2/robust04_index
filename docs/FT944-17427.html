			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Howard will fight on basis of past record Mr Michael Howard will next week try to draw a line under what has been an immensely difficult year by portraying himself to Tory activists as the home secretary who has delivered. With his competence increasingly under question after a string of mishaps Mr Howard's speech at next week's Conservative conference in Bournemouth is expected to draw heavily on the traditional Tory home secretary's pledges to crack down on crime and promote law and order. But it will also focus on his record in the past 12 months, pointing out that he has already implemented the vast majority of the 27 law and order initiatives he unveiled at last year's conference. In response to Tory grass-roots concern about the nature of sentences handed out to some offenders, the speech is likely to contain a passage on the importance of punishment, arguing that prison conditions should be 'decent but austere' and that prisoners' privileges must be earned. This theme was highlighted yesterday in a speech on community sentencing by Lady Blatch, the Home Office minister, in Scarborough. She emphasised that sentences in the community should be an effective form of punishment and not a reward for offending. Mr Howard's difficulties this year included the savaging in the House of Lords of two major pieces of Home Office legislation and the discovery of Semtex at Whitemoor prison. Conference managers have done their best to shield him from excessive media exposure, scheduling his speech for Thursday afternoon during what looks set to be conference's most packed day. But such is the opprobrium heaped on his recent performance, both from within Tory ranks and outside, that it appears unlikely that strong competition from cabinet colleagues Mr Kenneth Clarke, Mrs Gillian Shephard and Sir Patrick Mayhew will be enough to keep Mr Howard off the Friday's front pages. There is a growing feeling among some observers that Mr Howard could be in danger of the same fate as Mr John Patten, the former education secretary, who was in effect left to soldier on as a lame-duck minister before being ousted in the ministerial reshuffle last July. Anything less than an enthusiastic reception from delegates would be seen as another step down this slippery slope.</p>

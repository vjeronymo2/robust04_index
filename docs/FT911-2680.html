			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Seoul death leads to fall of minister PRESIDENT Roh Tae Woo of South Korea has sacked his home minister in an attempt to defuse anger over the death of a student at the hands of riot police. Mr Kang Kyong Dae, a 20-year old economics student, died on Friday night after being beaten by police during a demonstration against the arrest of a student leader at Seoul's Myungji University. This was the first death of a student in a clash with riot police since 1987 and will increase social tensions at a time when the annual wage-bargaining and student protests are getting under way. It prompted demonstrations in Seoul at the weekend, Riot police used tear gas and water cannon to block a protest march towards central Seoul on Saturday afternoon. A spokesman for the ruling Democratic Liberal Party said that the government 'whole-heartedly apologises to the nation'. He said that Mr Ahn Eung Mo, home minister, would be superseded by Mr Lee Sang Yeon. However, opposition groups said that the government's response, and the issue of arrest warrants for the four policemen believed responsible, was not enough.</p>

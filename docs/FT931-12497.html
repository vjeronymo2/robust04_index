			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / People: Fenhalls puts on running shoes Richard Fenhalls, who is stepping down as chief executive of Henry Ansbacher, the merchant bank acquired by First National Bank of South Africa, has taken up his first outside appointment, as a non-executive director of Hi-Tec Sports. The sports shoe designer and distributor has seen its share price collapse in the past nine months after fierce price wars in its UK backyard. A fortnight ago, it announced that Sir Michael Edwardes was joining the board as a non-executive director. Hi-Tec chairman Frank van Wezel says that Fenhalls, who is, like Edwardes, a South African by birth, came warmly recommended by his compatriot, who has been a long-standing business associate. 'He is a keen ocean-racing yachtsman and one of the first questions he asked was whether we have a line in deck shoes,' added van Wezel. 'When we said we did, under the Bad Boys brand, he was happy.' Fenhalls, 49, is credited with turning round Henry Ansbacher since he joined in 1985. Previously, he had been deputy chairman and chief executive of Guinness Mahon, and before that had worked at American Express Bank and Marine Midland. Another announcement is expected in about four weeks' time of a position he will be taking up in the City, but no further details are yet available. Meanwhile Fenhalls is replaced at Henry Ansbacher by Peter Scaife who is on secondment from First National Bank. Scaife becomes managing director of the holding company and chief executive and a deputy chairman of the merchant bank, Henry Ansbacher &amp; Co Ltd.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Tourism given promotion boost The government has increased funding for the promotion abroad of tourism to the UK, and reduced proposed cuts in the budget of the English Tourist Board, which encourages UK residents to take holidays in England. Government funding of the British Tourist Authority - which promotes Britain to overseas visitors - is to rise from Pounds 32m in 1993-94 to Pounds 34m in 1995-96, Pounds 500,000 higher than government projections published a year ago. The English board, which aims to improve facilities, is to see its funding fall from Pounds 13.9m in 1993-94 to Pounds 10m in 1995-96. However, this figure is Pounds 1m higher than previous government plans. The authority and the board yesterday said the increases were 'mildly encouraging'.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Budget rethink urged for EC A RADICAL rethink of European Community finances is needed to meet fast-growing expenditure demands, senior Commission officials said. Speaking on the day that the draft budget for 1992 was unveiled, two officials suggested that a summit of EC heads of government was likely to be called. The latest draft is the last to be prepared under the five-year accord reached by EC heads of government in February 1988 which doubled regional spending but limited the overall budget within a ceiling of 1.2 per cent of Community GDP. The European Commission suggested spending of Ecu65.2bn (Pounds 45.3bn) in 1992, a rise of only 11.3 per cent on this year, compared with a 19 per cent increase last year. But this comes as individual member-states face severe squeezes on their own finances, with national budgets rising by an average 6.3 per cent. Almost the entire increase is in the farm budget, theoretically set to rise 10 per cent to Ecu34.7bn - against a 30 per cent rise this year - and spending on backward and industrially declining regions, which would be up around 25 per cent to Ecu19bn if east Germany is included. These two sectors - along with the Community's growing external commitments in east Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, the rest of Africa, Latin America and Asia - are the ones likely to need significantly more funds when the 1988 agreement runs out. The Commission does not yet know whether it can contain within its proposed 10 per cent extra spending the current explosion in farm spending, caused by overproduction. But it is clear that the radical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy it plans to detail in June will increase costs. The extent of this rise will depend on the level of compensation to farmers for severe price cuts and for taking land out of production, and how much is spent on alternative rural development. Regional spending also seems set to cost more. Spain wants a Community fund for budget transfers to help the rest of the EC catch up with the north before it agrees to economic, monetary and political union. Madrid rejects a compromise brokered by the Commission and the Luxembourg presidency of the EC, which foresees more money for existing regional programmes, new standby funds for structural reform, and a loosening of restrictions on how the funds can be applied.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Row fear on Scots reforms CABINET ministers yesterday approved a limited package of constitutional reforms for Scotland but are likely to face a barrage of opposition next Tuesday when the details are announced. Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, faces protest for not giving locally elected representatives more say in Scottish government. There is also concern among opposition MPs over the proposed moving of civil service jobs from London to Scotland. One option the prime minister and his colleagues were discussing was that the Scottish Grand Committee - comprising all 72 Scottish MPs but augmented by non-Scottish Tories to reflect the government's Commons majority - may be given a wider remit than its at present role, which is entirely subservient to government policy. Yesterday's discussion was the culmination of a promise given by the prime minister during last year's general election in the face of the Scottish National party's demand for total separation and Labour's plans for new regional assemblies, including a powerful Scottish parliament. Mr Major agreed to look at various options. But he has made clear he is an unflinching supporter of the union between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom and would not contemplate any action that put it at risk. The Labour party yesterday ordered a shake-up of its operations in the political heartland of party leader Mr John Smith. A Labour inquiry into the running of local parties in the Monklands area of Lanarkshire said the district council had left itself 'open to criticism' by the way staff were appointed. Mr Smith is MP for Monklands East and Mr Tom Clarke, the shadow Scottish secretary, represents Monklands West. The inquiry team has also rewritten the standing orders of the local parties in what appears to be a dismantling of an old-style political machine. However the inquiry report - ordered by Labour's Scottish executive last September - was muted in its criticism and insisted the changes were simply an updating of antiquated local procedures. The report said that 'those who suggest that improper actions have taken place should put those charges in the hands of the appropriate authorities or desist from making the allegations'.</p>

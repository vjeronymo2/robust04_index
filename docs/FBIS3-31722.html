According to the ministry, the Albanian diplomat was  informed  about the Yugoslav Government's deep concern and was told that  such moves on the part of the Albanian Government were  aggravating tensions in the region and presented a threat to the  security of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.    The Albanian Government was demanded to re-examine its  decision on the stationing of U.S. spy planes and placing its  territory at NATO's disposal, in the interest of peace,  stability, and the normalization of Yugoslav-Albanian ties.</p>

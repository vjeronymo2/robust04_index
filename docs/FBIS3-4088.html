Speaking at a rally today marking the Second Annual World  Day  for Water, the minister said that China's per capita share of  water reserves has been decreasing.    In China it amounts to 2,400 cubic meters per head, only  about one fourth of the world's average and ranking 88th in the  world, said the minister.    He attributed the booming economic and social development,  population growth and pollution to the decrease.    According to the minister, China took the lead in the world  by mapping out "China's Agenda 21", a national strategy for  sustainable social and economic development, which gives  priority to protection and efficient use of water.    The strategy was drafted in response to the call made by the  United Nations Environment and Development Conference held in  Brazil, which stressed protection of natural resources and  sustainable development.    China has been investing heavily, and will continue to do  so,  in water conservancy projects, he added.    Work on preparatory projects for the huge Three Gorges Water  Conservancy Dam on the Chang Jiang River is in full swing. The  scheme will create the world's most powerful hydro-electric  plant and a huge reservoir.    Work on other large water conservancy projects, such as  Xiaolangdi and Wanjiazhai, which it is estimated will cost  billions of U.S. dollars, has begun or is soon to start.    Another costly diversion project has been listed on the  agenda of the Chinese Government. It is designed to divert  water from the Chang Jiang River northward to Beijing, Tianjin,  Hebei Province and Henan Province, which are suffering from  water shortages.    Romulo Garcia, acting resident representative of the United  Nations Development Program (UNDP) in Beijing, said that in  recent years UNDP had been involved in a number of initiatives  to assist the government in its water related programs.    The programs include the northern China water management  project, the rural water supply and sanitation in poor and  remote areas project, and the assessment of China's water sector  in Guizhou Province and master plan for the development of water  resources in northern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.    The United Nations General Assembly resolved last year to  have March 22 observed every year as the world day for water.    The United Nations estimates that 1.2 billion people still  do  not have access to safe water, he said.    Niu Maosheng added that over 50 countries or regions have a  shortage of water, and water shortage has become a universal  problem for cities all over the world.</p>

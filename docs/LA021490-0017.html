			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG OVERDOSE WASTES COURTS  </P> <P> As a group, chief justices are more inclined to understate than exaggerate. So  California now has more than enough warning -- not just from one top jurist but  from two -- that drug cases are threatening to swamp the federal and state  justice systems.  </P> <P> The latest warning is from Malcolm M. Lucas, chief justice of the state Supreme  Court, who said Monday that California's trial courts "are close to foundering"  in a flood of drug cases. And Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist recently said  roughly the same thing about the federal court system.  </P> <P> But the politics of drug control as they are practiced these days make it  certain that the situation will get worse before it gets better, that  legislators will plow a great deal more barren ground before they discover that  there are no easy answers to drugs.  </P> <P> Lucas told a joint session of the California Legislature that courts should be  among the last resorts in the fight against drugs, something to which people  turn after they have tried education, treatment, early intervention and  research. Lucas is absolutely correct, but such wise counsel is considered  "soft" stuff, and politicians are more comfortable sounding tough on drugs.  </P> <P> Why are drug cases soaring? One reason is that legislators love to rattle  missiles on drugs and keep stipulating longer prison terms, stripping judges of  the right to issue lighter sentences if defendants plead guilty. More  defendants choose a full trial because a defendant must serve the same time for  a guilty plea as for a conviction, and at least there is a chance of beating  the case in court.  </P> <P> Yet in both Washington and Sacramento, the emphasis is still on more police,  more prisons and tougher sentences. Bills calling for longer prison terms keep  getting introduced and passed, because challengers can use nay votes as weapons  in the next election.  </P> <P> But all such easy answers come to no good. Lucas warned Monday that drug cases  are crowding out important civil cases involving "the environment, civil  rights, the economy and other important aspects of our lives," because there  are not enough judges or courtrooms to try both and criminal cases have  priority.  </P> <P> So far, policy makers in both Washington and Sacramento seem to have it in mind  that taxpayers are happy to pay for prisons but not for new courtrooms. The  politicians should not count on it, now that the voters have been given fair  warning not just by one chief justice but by two.  </P></p>

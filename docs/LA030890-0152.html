			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PATHE TO BUY MGM/UA IN $1.27-BILLION DEAL;  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD: THE SURPRISE SALE AGREEMENT PUTS STILL ANOTHER MAJOR STUDIO IN  FOREIGN HANDS.  </P> <P> MGM/UA Communications Co. agreed Wednesday to be sold for about $1.27 billion  to Pathe Communications Co. in a deal that will put yet another Hollywood  studio in the hands of foreign owners.  </P> <P> Pathe is controlled by Italian businessman Giancarlo Parretti and other  European investors. MGM/UA will become the third major studio sold to foreign  interests, after 20th Century Fox, which is owned by Australian-based News  Corp., and Columbia Pictures, which is owned by Sony Corp. of Japan.  </P> <P> The surprise sale agreement apparently will end investor Kirk Kerkorian's  20-year involvement with MGM/UA. The secretive businessman, who is 72, bought  his first stake in the Culver City movie and television studio in 1969, after  building a fortune with various airline and Las Vegas real estate and gambling  ventures.  </P> <P> The sale comes just two months after Kerkorian said he was dropping his  long-running attempts to sell the studio in order to concentrate on movie and  television production.  </P> <P> MGM/UA shares, which had traded as low as $10.75 in the last year, shot up  $3.75 to close at $17.75 in heavy trading of 1.3 million shares Wednesday on  the New York Stock Exchange. The purchase agreement is valued at $20 a share  for both common and preferred stock. Pathe would also assume nearly $400  million in MGM/UA debt.  </P> <P> The companies said Pathe would begin a tender offer for all MGM/UA shares in  five days.  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear how Pathe planned to raise financing for the  billion-dollar acquisition, which is scheduled to close June 29.  </P> <P> But the MGM/UA board -- which had approved a similar acquisition by  Australian-based Qintex Group last year, only to see the deal collapse for lack  of financing -- extracted heavy guarantees against a similar collapse.  </P> <P> According to both parties, those guarantees include a $200-million "security  deposit" to be placed in four equal installments of $50 million into an escrow  account at Security Pacific Bank each month beginning March 9.  </P> <P> In addition, Pathe has pledged to MGM/UA $75 million in net proceeds from  MGM/UA's release of three Pathe-produced films, which include "The Russia  House" and "Quigley Down Under." MGM/UA declined to identify the third picture  against which proceeds have been guaranteed. MGM/UA Chairman Jeffrey C.  Barbakow said Pathe would get back the $75 million from movie advances if the  deal is consummated.  </P> <P> MGM/UA's agreement to distribute Pathe films appeared to conflict with a  separate agreement under which Time Warner's Warner Bros. unit was supposed to  distribute the same movies.  </P> <P> A Time Warner spokeswoman insisted Wednesday that Warner Bros. had four years  remaining on a five-year distribution agreement with Pathe. The spokeswoman  said she did not believe the conflict would lead to litigation, but she also  disavowed speculation that Warner Bros. was somehow involved in financing the  deal for Pathe, perhaps by buying some rights to the 1,000-film United Artists  library, which appears to be MGM/UA's principal asset.  </P> <P> Richard Berger, president of MGM/UA's film group, said his company has a  written agreement to distribute the movies, but he acknowledged that Pathe  Co-Chairman Alan Ladd Jr. had previously agreed to release the films through  Warner Bros.  </P> <P> "In Laddie's mind, I think the movies were committed to Warner Bros. But if  Pathe bought a company with distribution, they had the right to move (the  deal)," Berger said. Both Ladd and a spokesman declined to comment.  </P> <P> In an interview, MGM/UA Chairman Barbakow, a former Merrill Lynch investment  banker, said the move will end Kerkorian's involvement with the studio, which  has undergone repeated restructurings and attempted mergers or sales during his  long tenure.  </P> <P> "He is selling 100% of his position. He's out," Barbakow said.  </P> <P> Kerkorian's private holding company, Tracinda Corp., owns 71.7% of MGM/UA's  outstanding stock. Another 9.9% was donated by Kerkorian last year to the Lincy  Foundation, a Beverly Hills-based charity.  </P> <P> In 1985, Kerkorian agreed to sell MGM/UA to Turner Broadcasting System for $1.5  billion, but he subsequently bought back, in separate deals, the United Artists  division and the "Leo the Lion" logo along with the MGM movie production and  television production and distribution assets.  </P> <P> Since then, a dizzying number of potential buyers have surfaced, including  financier Burt Sugarman, Columbia Pictures co-heads Jon Peters and Peter Guber,  Qintex, Rupert Murdoch, Sony, cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. and, again,  Turner.  </P> <P> Last year, Kerkorian agreed to sell the studio to Qintex for $1 billion, a bid  that was later topped by Rupert Murdoch, who dropped his offer when Qintex  sweetened its bid to $1.5 billion. But financially strapped Qintex was unable  to finance its aggressive bid and the deal fell apart, leaving Kerkorian  without a buyer. (News Corp., which is controlled by Murdoch, is based in  Australia, but Murdoch has become an American citizen.)  </P> <P> In January, Barbakow said Kerkorian was no longer seeking a buyer and pledged  that MGM/UA would spend about $185 million, provided by both cash flow and bank  lines of credit, to resuscitate its anemic film production and distribution  operations.  </P> <P> Executives close to the situation said Wednesday that MGM/UA had actually been  investigating the possibility of buying another entertainment company in order  to speed its own growth in an industry that is undergoing an intense period of  consolidation. But a conversation about a possible distribution agreement with  Pathe several weeks ago led Parretti to make an offer to buy the Culver City  company outright, officials said.  </P> <P> Barbakow said current MGM/UA officers will continue to run the company while  the deal is pending, in sharp contrast to the agreement under which Qintex  officers had run MGM/UA for months while they sought financing.  </P> <P> There is skepticism among some observers, given the history of both of the  companies involved, as to whether the proposed deal will ever be completed, at  least under the sketchy terms announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst with Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co. in Los Angeles, said  he is not sure whether Parretti has the resources to buy MGM/UA. "It's very  difficult looking at Pathe's balance sheet or their cash flow to understand  where in the world the money is going to come from to finance this  transaction," he said. He added that anybody buying MGM/UA "should have the  capital to rebuild the studio, which would take a minimum of $500 million over  the next two years."  </P> <P> Still, Logsdon, says he is satisfied with the $20-per-share price because, he  said, "if this thing had to trade on fundamentals, it would be trading at $7 to  $8 per share or lower."  </P> <P> One individual close to Pathe said: "These things have a way of not happening  when it pertains to MGM/UA." The executive, however, said he believed Parretti  would not have trouble raising the financing for the acquisition by the  deadline. "Don't underestimate Giancarlo. He has his own brand of major  financial clout," the executive said.  </P> <P> Asked whether Warner Bros. might yet purchase some interest in the United  Artists library, MGM/UA executive Berger said: "I think they probably have some  interest in doing that." But he said he did not know details of any arrangement  that might be pending.  </P> <P> Barbakow said he plans to stay with the company for the foreseeable future. In  addition to his $1-million annual salary, Barbakow could realize about $30  million from the sale of MGM/UA, according to the company's proxy statement.  </P> <P> Although the companies said MGM/UA and Pathe would be run as separate entities,  Barbakow acknowledged that Parretti could move in the future to merge the two  operations. MGM/UA employs about 900 people, he said.  </P> <P> If that were to happen, it would be a psychological victory of sorts for Ladd,  the highly regarded and well-liked former MGM/UA film head who left the studio  in a bitter dispute with Kerkorian 18 months ago. Ladd now runs Pathe's  filmmaking division.  </P> <P> An executive close to Ladd said it was not yet clear what his precise role in  the combined companies would be, although it appears likely he will oversee the  movie operations, which include Pathe's movie unit, along with MGM/UA's  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer unit and the near-dormant United Artists unit.  </P> <P> Presumably Kerkorian would use proceeds from the sale to feed his expanding  interests in Las Vegas, where he has announced plans to build a hotel and movie  theme park, and elsewhere. "I think Kirk wanted to get away from the headaches  and concentrate on his hotels, theme park and airline," one MGM/UA executive  said.  </P> <P> RELATED STORIES: D1, F1  </P></p>

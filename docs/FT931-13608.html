			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: St Gobain downturn due to economic slowdown SAINT GOBAIN, the French glass and building materials group, yesterday announced a drop in net profits to FFr2.37bn (Dollars 438m) last year, a 5.5 per cent drop from the previous year's performance. The fall is in line with the lower expectations of the depressed construction sector. The effect of the economic slowdown was evident in the group's turnover, which fell by 1.6 per cent to FFr73.9bn last year, despite full incorporation of the activity of St Gobain's newly-acquired German glassmaking subsidiary, Oberland. Without Oberland, the drop in business would have been 4 per cent. St Gobain described business as poor everywhere except the US, which had shown a marked pick-up in activity in the last months of 1992, putting pressure on prices. Extraordinary items, including asset sales, had provided some buoyancy to last year's results, the company said. Earlier this month, the group sold 24 per cent of its stake in Coverland of France to Redland, the UK construction group and sold two companies in Italy. As a result, its net debt fell from FFr20.5bn at end-1991 to FFr18.4bn at end-1992.</p>

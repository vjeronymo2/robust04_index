He voiced his concern at a meeting with presidential  regional  representatives on Monday saying that "the balance of political  forces in local polls can resemble the results of elections to  the Federal Assembly (Parliament)".    Filatov's deputy Sergey Krasavchenko added that there are  two  reasons for the fears.    The first one is the difficult economic situation in regions  "which sometimes makes voters support not well-drafted  programmes, but those who promise to quickly solve all  problems", he said referring to Zhirinovskiy.    The second reason is the split of democratic forces,  according to Krasavchenko who proposed to introduce the second  round of elections in the regions to help democrats unite in  case they face a failure after the first round.    He also urged the representatives to control the fulfilment  of the decisions of the president and the government so that  people could see that reforms become more socially-oriented.</p>

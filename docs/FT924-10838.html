			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Daewoo Motor plans luxury car DAEWOO Motor said yesterday it planned to produce a modified Korean version of Honda's luxury car Legend by the end of 1993. Mr Kim Woo-choong, Daewoo chairman, met Honda officials this week in Tokyo to discuss details about the possible production of the Legend for the Korean market. Daewoo said yesterday it could not confirm whether a licensing agreement had yet been signed. Daewoo, South Korea's third largest car maker, would become the third competitor in the country's luxury car market. Hyundai has produced its top-of-the-range Grandeur since 1986, in conjunction with Mitsubishi of Japan, while Kia Motors in May launched the Potentia, which was developed in co-operation with Mazda, to compete against the Grandeur. Daewoo, an unlisted company, recorded an estimated loss of Won50bn (Pounds 37m) in the first half of this year and has an enormous debt/equity ratio of over 2,000 per cent. Daewoo last week formally ended its joint venture with General Motors by buying the US carmaker's 50 per cent shareholding in the company for Dollars 170m. The joint venture ended because GM was concerned about Daewoo's profitability. Honda, Nissan and Suzuki of Japan have been mentioned as possible partners with Daewoo in joint ventures. Daewoo already has a technical licensing agreement with Nissan on compact cars.</p>

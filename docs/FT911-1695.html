			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / US envoy will take up an uncertain special relationship MR Raymond Seitz arrives in London today as US ambassador to Britain, facing greater uncertainty in transatlantic relations than appears on the surface. The conventional view in London is that, after a tense period during the first 15 months of the Bush administration, relations between the US and Britain have improved considerably. Since last November Mr Bush and Mr John Major have worked well together, especially during the war in the Gulf. All this is true - and Britain played its loyal ally card to the full during the war. But it should not be exaggerated in the way that some anti-European Conservatives are apt to do in celebrating an alleged return to the 'special relationship'. Americans prefer to talk about the Atlantic Alliance. Valued as Britain is on defence matters, especially non-Nato ones, Washington views the UK as part of Europe. As Mr Seitz pointed out in his confirmation hearings last month, Britain has decided that much of its future lies with Europe, and it faces the challenge of maintaining a strong alliance with the US while also being 'good Europeans'. The tilt by the Major government towards the EC occurs at reassessing its broader relations with Europe. As assistant secretary for European and Canadian affairs for the past two years, Mr Seitz is well placed to act as an interlocutor at a time when transatlantic relations are at their most uncertain since the late 1940s. He is the first foreign service officer to be US ambassador to Britain, in more than 200 years. He knows British politics well from his period as deputy chief of mission in the late 1980s, so his appointment has been widely welcomed both among State Department officials and in Whitehall and Westminster.</p>

The land will sell its stakes in the "Neue Maxhuette"  and the "Lechstahl" enterprise to Max Aicher, a construction and  steel industrialist of Freilassing. This Cabinet decision was  announced by Minister President Edmund Stoiber, of the Christian  Social Union, in Munich on Tuesday [15 March]. "The future of  the Maxhuette is thus safe," Stoiber said. The looming  bankruptcy has been avoided, and Sulzbach-Rosenberg will be  preserved as a steel center and a significant part of jobs in  Maxhuette will also be saved. However, to attain this  objective, Bavaria must provide another 140 million German  marks. Stoiber also announced that in the coming week, the  Bavarian Government will resign from the German Aviation and  Space enterprise Dasa.</p>

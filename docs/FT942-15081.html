			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Arts: Salzburg tunes in to Abbado - This month sees the start of the music festival season. Our critics report / This year the festival emerged with a new identity Salzburg's Easter Festival is dead. Long live the Salzburg Easter Festival] Five years after the burial of Herbert von Karajan, its founder, the festival has finally emerged from mourning with a new identity  - less personal perhaps, but more modern and more ready to take risks. This Easter saw several 'firsts'  - the first with Claudio Abbado as artistic director; the first to be supervised by a foundation working for the festival's long-term future; the first with a series of inexpensive contemporary music concerts; and the first to divide its audience, judging by the storm of boos at the final curtain of Boris Godunov. Karajan must be turning in his grave. To reassure the faithful, Karajan's widow Eliette is chairing the festival foundation, applauding the Mortier revolution at the summer festival and speaking of the need to avoid a museum culture. With Abbado at the helm, there is little danger of that. Nevertheless, his hand is constricted: to settle the bills he depends on 4,000 conservative subscribers, mostly inherited from the Karajan era. Paying up to Sch13,200 (Pounds 780) each for a block of three symphony concerts and one opera, they take a week's holiday and make the Easter Festival part of their social calendar. Mass disaffection would bankrupt the festival. How, then, does Abbado intend to assert his progressive credentials? What does he want from Salzburg? It is now virtually the only place where he conducts opera. After this year's Boris, to be repeated in the summer with cast changes, there will be a new Elektra in 1995. Last year's fall-out with Mortier over co-production plans has left the Easter Festival needing a partner for Elektra, but both sides have compromised over the following two years. A new Otello in the summer of 1995 will be revived at the 1996 Easter Festival, an unusual case of Abbado taking over a production premiered by Riccardo Muti. One wonders how Easter subscribers will enjoy paying higher prices to see a second-hand production, albeit with Domingo replacing Ben Heppner in the title role. The Easter Festival is back in the driving seat for the 1997 Wozzeck. For diehard conservatives, who saw the Easter Festival as a refuge from Mortier's summer experiments, some of this will be unsettling  - as will plans to bring the concert repertoire into the 20th century with a programme devoted to Shostakovich and Lutoslawski next year. This year's chamber music series at the Mozarteum, Kontrapunkte (Counterpoints), which picked up the Russian theme of the festival but with a modern slant, was well attended and enthusiastically received. The big discovery for me was Sofia Gubaydulina's Trio for harp, double-bass and percussion (1988), in which she explores this unusual instrumental combination in delicate half-tints, avoiding the self-conscious sound games of several other works in the series, notably by Schnittke. Kontrapunkte may be crumbs from the rich man's table, but when they are as well planned and executed as this (with the Berlin Philharmonic's chamber ensembles in full array), they merit their place. This year's main festival programme produced uneven results. Georg Solti and the Berlin Philharmonic remain a mismatch: the orchestra sounded too plush for Solti's coiled-up account of Shostakovich's Ninth Symphony, while the conductor turned the third movement of Tchaikovsky's Sixth into a breathless Stalinist march, giving the music a driven, demonic quality to the bitter end. Abbado, whose Pathetique last summer blazed with integrity, was less successful with the same composer's Fifth Symphony. Boris, however, has long been one of Abbado's key works. In the hands of the Berlin Philharmonic, Musorgsky's original music may not sound austere, but Abbado makes it seethe with dramatic urgency. The stage director, Herbert Wernicke, used simple ideas writ large to make a bleak statement about the exercise of power. The back wall was a three-tier portrait gallery of Russian rulers, from the historical Boris to the present Kremlin incumbent. The magnificent chorus, 240-strong, began as caged prisoners and ended up a bestial rabble in the Kromy Forest. Anatoly Kotcherga was an almost charismatic Boris. Tall and thick-set, he held the stage well in his tormented monologues, using his powerful lyric bass and a tearful tremolo to expressive effect. Philip Langridge was the slick, slippery, subversive Shuisky  - a masterful performance.</p>

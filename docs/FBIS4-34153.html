			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Leticia Robles de la Rosa] </F>   [Text] Mexico will not allow the United States to meddle in  domestic matters, unless it involves narcotics and only through  the Drug Enforcement Agency, to prevent our sovereignty from  being violated, Leandro Arellano, director general of Commercial  Relations for Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific of the  Foreign Relations Secretariat, has stated. He said our  country's world image has not deteriorated, despite recent  incidents of violence.    The Mexican Government has enough maturity to resolve its  domestic problems without anyone's help. It is not necessary,  therefore, for the United States to interfere to end the acts of  violence we have experienced.    He stated the above during a brief interview after  participating in the 19th international spring colloquium where  he said that, although Mexico is renowned internationally today  as an intermediate and very dynamic economy, the social cost of  economic reforms has been considerable because the number of  poor people has increased, which represents a pending and a  priority debt.    He added that the plight of poverty cannot be resolved if  the  distribution of income is not modified and if a tax reform and a  wage policy adjustment are not carried out, which will permit  the benefits of the country's growth to not further increase the  gap between the wealthy and poor sectors.    He also said that financial discipline, monetary prudence,  economic openness, market development, and concentration of the  state only on strategic areas are part of the guidelines that  must be followed in the near future and whose results will be  evident in the coming years. "As a result of these efforts,  Mexico is renowned internationally today as a very dynamic  intermediate economy," he stated.    Leandro Arellano said that sharing a common border of over  3,000 km with the biggest military power on the planet and the  principal promoter of some of the situations that reflect our  reality in the nineties, "obliges countries such as ours to make  diversification the key element of our international strategy."</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Insurers warn on Pool Re 'panic' INSURERS COULD be on a collision course with the government over moves to increase premium rates for terrorism insurance after last month's Bishopsgate bomb. The Association of British Insurers, the industry's trade association, yesterday said the government was stepping up pressure on Pool Re, the new government-backed reinsurer, to increase rates. Describing any rise as 'premature' and warning against 'panic reaction', the association said a rates review should be left until later this year. The association believes higher rates will be offset by a diminishing take-up by businesses of terrorist cover, undermining the effectiveness of Pool Re. The Department of Trade and Industry said negotiations with industry were continuing. No final decisions about increases had been taken but a detailed review of rating was under way. 'The original rates were set at great speed,' it said. A report by Bacon &amp; Woodrow, the consulting actuaries, submitted to Pool Re this week, could form the basis for the change in rating. The report is understood to recommend steep increases in rates for businesses based in London. Some companies could face rate rises of 300 per cent. Those in safer areas could benefit from reductions. Pool Re was set up earlier this year when insurers withdrew terrorist coverage from standard commercial policies after last year's mainland bombing campaign by the IRA.</p>

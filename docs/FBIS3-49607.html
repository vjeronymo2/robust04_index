			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 11 January (MTI) -- Yesterday's NATO  summit decision gave reassurance to the security questions of  East-Central Europe, Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky  told a press conference at the Foreign Ministry today. The  leaders of the 16 permanent-NATO-member countries opened the  road for filling the security policy vacuum in the region, and  promised that the countries accepted now as partners would be  admitted to NATO as full members later. The minister said that,  after a long wait, the problems, security and future of  East-Central Europe have again come into the focus of western  interest. Jeszenszky denied that Russia or the Pacific rim  would squeeze out this region from American thinking. He  recalled that yesterday President Clinton confirmed U.S.  commitment to Europe, saying that Central Europe was of vital  interest for the United States.    What the NATO summit and tommorrow's meeting in Prague  between Clinton and the leaders of the Visegrad countries offer  is not the reconstruction of an iron curtain somewhat east of  the old one. The NATO summit promised more: Partnership  offered for Russia is a reassuring solution even for the smaller  East-Central European states.    Hungarian diplomacy regards the Partnership for Peace scheme  as a straight road to NATO. The scheme itself is an enormous  step forward and we have no reason to underestimate this, the  Hungarian foreign minister said. Partnership for peace promises  a chance of consultation for the countries accepted as partners.  The consultations can be regarded as a kind of guarantee. So  can the fact that NATO is prepared to connect its security with  that of East Central Europe, he said. Hungary is aware that the  road to full NATO membership is long. We are prepared to take  part in the evolutionary process of partnership for peace.  Hungary's security policy-makers now face the fundamental  questions of when and how, Jeszenszky said.    This afternoon the Hungarian foreign minister is to leave  for  Prague, where U.S. President Clinton will meet tomorrow with  heads of state and foreign ministers of the Visegrad countries  (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia). Jeszenszky  feels that the forthcoming meeting will strengthen cooperation  between the Central European states, something to which Hungary  has attributed great importance since 1989.    From Prague, the Hungarian foreign minister will leave on  Friday [14 January] for Warsaw, to meet with his Polish  counterpart and survey topical issues of bilateral relations.  They will also discuss the latest international developments in  the region, and tasks stemming from the Brussels summit of NATO  and the Prague summit of the Visegrad countries.    Replying to questions, Jeszenszky said that, due to the  considerations of the Czech premier, the participants would not  issue a joint statement on the Prague talks, but the protocols  to be drawn up on the bilateral meetings will include everything  that a common protocol signed by all parties would have  contained. Asked about Slovakia's role in the Visegrad  cooperation, Jeszenszky said, "although this cooperation would  work even without Slovakia, it would be much more effective with  its participation." He lauded the Slovak prime minister's recent  assertions of the western orientation of his country.</p>

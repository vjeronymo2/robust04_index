			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Heavy brigade under assault: The greatest test of China's commitment to reform lies in rationalising loss-making state enterprises When Mr Zhu Rongji, China's senior vice-premier in charge of the economy, visited the north-east heartland of China's ailing state-owned heavy industry this month he must have appeared like the grim reaper to hard-pressed provincial leaders and factory bosses. Mr Zhu, who has made enterprise reform a priority in this latest phase of China's economic transformation, delivered an unpalatable message: that cheap bank credits for capital spending would cease, and that more strenuous efforts must be made to clear a backlog of debt before incurring new liabilities. It was a bold gambit for China's leading reformer who is under heavy pressure from a powerful state sector lobby. It suggests Mr Zhu's credit squeeze is threatening the very survival of state enterprises that are the backbone of the economy and, worse, risking social unrest. Figures released by the State Statistical Bureau for the first quarter of the year confirm that tight credit policies instituted last year to dampen runaway growth are biting. State sector output grew by just 2.2 per cent, compared with 32 per cent for small township enterprises and 80 per cent for joint ventures and privately-owned businesses. The credit squeeze is hitting companies which are already experiencing difficulties. Nearly 50 per cent of state enterprises, including the 10,000  -11,000 medium and large state-owned businesses nationwide, were in the red in the first quarter compared with about 32 per cent a year earlier. Losses to March amounted to Yn15.6bn (USDollars 1.8bn), up 80 per cent on the same period last year. Contributing to the parlous condition of state enterprises is an ever-expanding 'debt chain' under which they are unable to pay each other for raw materials or finished products. This has left many enterprises critically short of working capital. The question, in light of the grim outlook for the state sector which now accounts for less than 50 per cent of total industrial production, is whether Mr Zhu has the nerve, and more important, the support of his senior colleagues to press on with enterprise reform in the face of rising criticism and street protests by jobless workers. In the industrial city of Wuhan on the Yangtze in central China (see accompanying article) scarcely a week passes without busloads of redundant workers arriving at the gates of the municipal headquarters to protest at being laid off by enterprises that have either been turned into slimmed-down joint ventures or have run out of money to support a bloated workforce. These patterns of protest are being repeated across China as the leadership tries to come to grips with its greatest test - reform of state enterprises. Inevitably the process is proving messy, but the reformers know that further progress in transforming China's socialist-era economy requires that they confront the challenge. A deepening of state enterprise reform is crucial to dealing with a range of problems, including the need to make more efficient use of scarce resources, chronic budget deficits, inflation fuelled by lax money supply policies due to the continued heavy demands of state-sector funding and a banking sector awash in a sea of non-performing loans to state enterprises. Real reform of the state sector, as opposed to the timid efforts of the past, is in turn throwing up a range of problems: not least of these is the need for a government-supervised social welfare net in place of the work-unit cradle-to-the-grave system of the past. Even the more successful state enterprises, such as Wuhan iron and steel works, are not in a position to continue shouldering the burden of providing education, health care and pensions for their workforces, their families and a growing number of pensioners. China's life expectancy matches that of the west. But Mr Zhu and the reformers in the government, while under siege from vested state enterprise interests, will also be mounting some strong arguments in defence of continuing the squeeze on the least productive enterprises. These measures have seen the state sector's share of total industrial production shrink from about 80 per cent in 1978, the year that China formally turned away from rigid Maoist policies, to the less than 50 per cent now. Among the advances since China turned its attention in 1984-85 to revamping its stodgy state-run enterprises has been the establishment of a framework for reform, and perhaps more important, ideological barriers have gradually been dismantled. The third plenary session of the 14th Central Committee, the Communist party's policymaking body, last November laid down a blueprint for change which, while upholding the party's commitment to the state sector as the 'mainstay' of the economy, left the way open for a range of creative solutions to the problems of loss-making enterprises. These include 'corporatisation', a Chinese half-way house to privatisation whereby overt state interference in the management of enterprises is eliminated; the formation of joint stock-holding companies; mergers; takeovers; and the sale or lease of state-owned businesses to collectives or individuals. Merger activity, for instance, has accelerated in the past 18 months following China's 1992 formal embrace of a market economy at its 14th Party Congress. Since late-1992, some 3,000 Chinese companies have been merged or sold, according to the official China Daily newspaper. Chinese companies are also beginning tentatively to use the stock market to launch takeovers and mergers, although the authori-ties have reacted nervously to this form of aggressive capitalism. China is also taking time to come to terms with bankruptcy under a 1988 law. Chinese officials frequently threaten bankruptcy proceedings against chronic loss-making enterprises, but the law has been used sparingly. Along with the faltering transformation of the state sector has come an appreciation of the advances. Mr Peter Bottelier, the World Bank's chief representative in Beijing, says that while 'unquestionably huge problems' remain, western economists have 'given insufficient attention to the progress made'. 'The whole process of asset-stripping, which has attracted a good deal of criticism locally, is not necessarily economically disastrous,' he says. 'Unlike Russia, eastern Europe and Latin America, where the proceeds were siphoned off, in China it has led in many cases to a reallocation of resources to much more productive enterprises.' The World Bank official would like to see the Chinese make more creative use of state enterprise assets, such as property, to create welfare funds for laid-off workers or for setting up retraining programmes. China's state railways, for example, is the biggest landowner in the country. But the management and evaluation of assets, such as land, remains one of China's most contentious issues. As a recent World Bank study* noted: 'The major, unsolved problem of enterprise reform is how the state, as owner of state assets, can effectively supervise the operation and management of state assets.' Since its inception in 1987, the State Asset Management Bureau has 'not played an effective role', added the study. Indeed, persistent reports of corruption in the divestiture of state assets are bedevilling enterprise reform. An official of the bureau reported last week that estimated 'losses' of state assets, mostly by undervaluation, amounted to Yn500bn in the past decade. He also revealed that a survey last year by the bureau showed that two-thirds of state-owned businesses setting up joint ventures with overseas companies had not properly evaluated their assets. Criticism flowing from these inadequacies of the reform process will not make Mr Zhu's task any easier; nor will the fact that his attempts to deepen enterprise reform also coincide with a testing phase in which he is being obliged to slow down an overheating economy, beset by inflation. China's reformers are facing a moment of truth: they are now seeking to tackle the rump of the problem, which includes defence industries in the north-east that have had limited success in converting from making arms to consumer goods. But Mr Zhu understands that the credibility of the government's broader reform programme rests on tackling the bloated state sector. Opposition to rationalising the enterprises, accompanied by threats to social stability, will test the leadership's nerve in the short-term as much as its longer-term commitment to its reformist goals. *China: Managing rapid growth and transition (World Bank Report no 11932, June 30 1993)</p>

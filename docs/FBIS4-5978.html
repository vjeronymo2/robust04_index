			<p>BFN     [Text] Regarding the accusations made recently by various  leaders of the Royal Cambodian Government on Thailand's  assistance to the Khmer Rouge, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  wishes to make the following points:    1. The Royal Thai Government categorically denies the  accusations that Thailand has helped certain Khmer Rouge leaders  to escape into Thailand and that Thailand has given support, in  whatever form, to the Khmer Rouge to launch attacks on the  Cambodian Government troops.    2. Thailand is surprised and disappointed by these  continuing  groundless accusations, because the Thai Government has clearly  and consistently stated to the Cambodian leaders that it  recognizes and fully supports the elected Cambodian Government.  At the same time, we have firmly stated that we shall not  interfere in the internal affairs of Cambodia nor do we wish to  become involved in the internal fighting of that country.    3. It is certainly not in Thailand's interest to assist the  Khmer Rouge or to support a continuing military conflict in  Cambodia. As an advocate of peace in Cambodia and a signatory  to the Paris Peace Agreement, Thailand wishes to see durable  peace and prosperity in Cambodia. This fact is reflected in  Thailand's untiring support for the peace process in Cambodia  and in our substantial aid and assistance in the rehabilitation  and reconstruction of Cambodia. We strongly support the noble  guidance of His Majesty Phreahbat Samdech Norodom Sihanouk that  there should be genuine national reconciliation. Continued  conflict in Cambodian would only erase the gains and  achievements for which Thailand and ASEAN, together with the  international community, have worked so long and hard.    4. The Royal Thai Government wishes to refer to the  discussion between the prime ministers of the Kingdoms of  Thailand and Cambodia during the official visit of His  Excellency Mr Chuan Likphai to Cambodia in January 1994. We  recall that the two sides agreed not to resort to the media, but  would utilize established diplomatic channels to clear any  misunderstandings or settle any issues which may arise.    5. It is regrettable that the Cambodian Government has not  approached the Royal Thai Government to seek any clarification  concerning the alleged Thai assistance to the Khmer Rouge but  instead chose to make unfair and unfounded accusations against  Thailand through the press. Continued accusations by the  Cambodian Government could adversely affect the good relations  and understanding between the two countries and peoples, to  which Thailand attaches great importance. We wish to stress  once again to the Cambodian Government that the agreement  reached by the prime ministers of the two countries should be  strictly implemented and we would welcome any proof or concrete  evidence from the Cambodia Government in support of the  accusations.    6. The Royal Thai Government is seriously concerned over the  border situation as a result of the continued fighting along the  Thai-Cambodian border. The fighting has in many ways affected  the safety and livelihood of the Thai villagers along the border  areas. Therefore, we wish to urge the Cambodian Government to be  especially vigilant regarding the following matters:    6.1 Not to allow its troops to intrude into Thai territory.  There have been many confirmed reports on intrusions by  Cambodian Government forces over the past several months in  several border areas.    6.2 Not to fire into Thai territory. Shellings by the the  Cambodian Government troops' artillery have on many occasions  landed on Thai territory causing injuries to Thai villagers and  damage or destruction to their property.    6.3 Suppress and eradicate illegal and criminal activities  on  the Cambodian side of the border.</p>

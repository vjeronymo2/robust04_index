			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Council severance pay under scrutiny DISTRICT AUDITORS in England and Wales are to study recent local authority redundancy payments to decide whether they are lawful, in the light of the test case High Court ruling on North Tyneside council's enhanced severance scheme. The Audit Commission confirmed yesterday that Mr Tony Childs, its solicitor, was preparing guidance to be sent to all district auditors within the next month, to enable them to decide whether any enhanced payments made by councils exceed their statutory powers. The commission said that since last October's ruling councils had 'fought quite shy' of offering enhanced redundancy terms. Now that the judgment had been upheld after subsequent legal challenge from North Tyneside, the commission was to issue advice on this complex area. 'It will set out under which circumstances auditors may advise that local authorities should seek repayment,' he said. Payments made since October 1991 would be studied.</p>

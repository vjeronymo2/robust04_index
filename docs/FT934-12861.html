			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Plans for ID cards attacked THE government is considering the introduction of identity cards to help crack down on social security fraud totalling more than Pounds 1bn a year, but has come up against strong opposition from civil liberties groups. Although other European countries such as France and Germany have ID cards, any discussion of their introduction in the UK has raised Orwellian visions of the all-seeing, ever-prying state. However, a recent poll carried out for the Police Federation showed that a majority of Britons favoured some form of ID card system to help combat crime. Responding to weekend reports that Mr John Major, the prime minister, favoured such a scheme, Liberty, the civil liberties group, said ID cards could be used to discriminate against some sections of society. Mr Jeremy Corbyn, a Labour MP on the Commons social security committee, said that the idea was part of the government's obsession with cutting social security spending. He added: 'It is another smack of the Big Brother state.' The Department of Social Security said there were no plans to bring in an ID card system to help beat fraudsters, although this was being looked at as one of a range of measures. The Home Office, whose interests in any ID scheme would cover its impact on crime, terrorism and immigration, also said nothing was planned immediately. The DSS is tightening up anti-fraud procedures for payment of benefits. These include redesigning books for each type of benefit to make these harder to forge, and encouraging electronic transfer of funds directly into bank accounts. The DSS believes the last method, known as automatic credit transfer, is the most effective against fraud; it is also cheap to administer. But recent government proposals to highlight this option more clearly on benefit books raised strong concern about the possible closure of local Post Offices.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amendments of 1992 provide that an institution may not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impose any penalty on any student because of the student's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inability to meet his or her financial obligations to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution as a result of the delayed disbursement of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> title IV, HEA program loan due to compliance with statutory and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory requirements for the Title IV, HEA programs, or delays  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attributable to the institution. The statute specifies that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those prohibited penalties include the assessment of late fees,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the denial of access to classes, libraries, or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutional facilities, or the requirement that the student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrow additional funds. The Secretary proposes to clarify that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the restriction that institutions may not require a student to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrow additional funds would apply only to funds for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest or other charges are assessed. Therefore, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision would not apply to any interest-free loans that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution might require the student to borrow until other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources of aid are available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amendments of 1992 provide that an institution may not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial aid to any persons or entities engaged in any student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recruiting or admission activities. An institution also may not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide such an incentive payment to any persons or entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engaged in making decisions regarding the awarding of student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial assistance. The statute specifies that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement does not apply to the recruitment of foreign students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residing in foreign countries who are not eligible to receive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal student assistance. The Secretary proposes to extend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this provision to require that institutions also may not contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with entities that improperly provide, any commission, bonus, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other incentive payment as delineated in the statute. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes that this provision is necessary to implement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more rigid restrictions than were seen in the past on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices of ``commissioned salespersons.'' The Secretary proposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to repeat the language of the statute with the addition of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change. The Secretary believes it is clear that this statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement places rigid restrictions on the practice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recruitment, admission activities, and the awarding of student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary is aware that some institutions pay incentives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to recruiters or admissions office employees based on the success  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of those persons in enrolling students, provided that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrolled students maintain satisfactory progress for and remain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrolled in the institution for a specified period of time. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary considers this practice, which commonly is referred to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as an incentive based on ``retention,'' to be an example of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity that is prohibited by the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the negotiated rulemaking sessions, the Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiator requested further examples of prohibited activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A non-Federal negotiator offered the following examples that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes are not permitted by the statute. (1) An  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution might offer payments or gifts to students for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referring other prospective students for admission to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution. (2) An institution might offer payments or gifts to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students on the condition that persons whom the students referred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the institution were actually admitted and remained enrolled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the institution for a specified period of time. (3) An  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution might present gifts to alumni, such as coffee mugs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sporting events tickets, or contributions in their name for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referring students to the institution for admission. (4) An  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution might pay bonuses to Directors of Admissions (or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other management personnel) based on the number of enrollments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received during a particular academic year or the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students who, after enrolling, remained at the institution until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all financial aid had been received. The Secretary specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comments on these examples and others that might serve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as useful guidelines in these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amendments of 1992 require that an institution comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with applicable requirements established by all members of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``triad''; i.e., the Secretary, State postsecondary review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities, and nationally recognized accrediting agencies pursuant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to part H of title IV of the HEA. The Secretary considers this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision to be self-explanatory and proposes to add this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory requirement to the regulations without substantive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] today  guaranteed that the peace process timetable as well as the  demobilization and formation of the national single army will be  fulfilled. The assurance was given in Maputo by Renamo leader  Afonso Dhlakama in a meeting with the delegation of U.S.  congressmen, who will conclude a two-day visit to the country  today. Moreover, Dhlakama guaranteed that if Renamo loses  elections scheduled for October, it will remain in the  opposition. Regarding this, Dhlakama appealed to the  international community to guarantee the holding of free and  fair elections. He also appealed to the international community  to assist Renamo financially, to enable it to transform itself  from a political armed movement to a political party. The  Renamo leader expressed concern over the reduced number of UN  police and appealed [words indistinct] to assist the Mozambican  police in guaranteeing law and order and to instruct them on how  to act in a state of law. Afonso Dhlakama said at present the  police are operating as an instrument of the Mozambique  Liberation Front Party.</p>

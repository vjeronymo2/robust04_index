			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the provincial flood control  headquarters, yesterday the flood peak appeared in the middle  and lower reaches of the Xiang Jiang, arriving at Changsha at  1400, where the water level rose to 39 meters -- 65 centimeters  higher than the highest level ever reported. Due to their  height and magnitude, the flood waters exceeded the flood  control project's capability to withstand the resulting strain,  and Hengyang, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, and Changsha suffered serious  losses. According to yesterday's statistics, embankments  collapsed in 66 places along the Xiang Jiang, submerging  approximately 450,000 mu of land. Flood waters broke through  the western embankment of the Xiang Jiang in Changsha at 1100  yesterday, creating a 50-meter hole and submerging seven  villages, 300,000 mu of land, and some universities and colleges  in Yuelu Township, causing at least 100 million yuan in direct  economic losses. The whereabouts of some people remain unknown.  After the disaster occurred, party, government, and Army  leaders at all levels went to the front lines of the  flood-fighting effort and organized and guided flood fighting  and relief work.    The province has sent more than 100,000 cadres and 2 million  people to fight the floods. Yesterday afternoon, the provincial  flood control headquarters once again created an emergency plan  to utilize every available means to meet the flood peak head-on.  Troops stationed in Hunan have dispatched personnel from four  battalions to Hengyang, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, and Changsha to do  relief work and move people stranded by the floods to secure  areas. Armed police and public security police officers and men  are using all their strength to plunge into the work of fighting  the floods and distributing relief.    The provincial party committee and government urged the  broad  masses of cadres and people in the Xiang Jiang basin and Army  personnel and civilians across the province to put the general  interest ahead of everything else, fight in unity, and strive to  overcome the catastrophic flooding of the Xiang Jiang. The  low-lying areas along the banks of the Xiang Jiang, which cannot  fight the floods, must try their best to relocate people and  ensure their safety.</p>

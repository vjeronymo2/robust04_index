			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan in Fuzhou] </F>   [Text] Communist Party stalwart Chen Mingyi was yesterday  elected governor of Fujian province, replacing Jia Qinglin who  takes over as the chairman of the law-making body, the Fujian  People's Congress. Mr Chen, 54, was deputy party secretary in  Fujian and has been Mr Jia's right-hand man since 1985.    The reshuffle was confirmed unanimously by 464 delegates at  the provincial people's congress. Speaking to reporters after  his election yesterday, Mr Chen said he would continue to put  Taiwan affairs at the top of his agenda. He said that, in  particular, he would focus on protecting Taiwanese investment in  Fujian and would push for early direct links with the Kuomintang  stronghold. Despite repeated overtures from Beijing, the  Taiwanese Government has steadfastly refused to open direct  communication, transport and government contacts with the  mainland.    The new governor also pledged to work closely with Mr Jia to  further improve the economy. Fujian, in spite of its close  proximity to Taiwan, has lagged far behind economically booming  Guangdong, a fact sources attribute to a lack of co-operation  among the province's top officials.    On other matters, both Mr Chen and Mr Jia said they would  continue to crack down on the smuggling of illegal workers from  Fujian to the United States. But they admitted Fujian's long  coastline made anti-smuggling efforts difficult.    Meanwhile, sources said the provincial leadership had  decided  to postpone the election of two vice-governors due to  differences of opinion at the top. They said the original plan  was for congress delegates to elect two vice-governors to fill  the vacancies left by Mr Chen and another vice-governor, Li  Mingkang, who was expected to retire soon.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. I/M-Based Recall Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The I/M aspect of the enhanced in-use compliance program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (also referred to as the I/M-based recall program) proposed today  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applies only if a significant portion of vehicles do not meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced in-use I/M standards. The enhanced I/M test equipment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test procedures, and other physical elements of the program will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remain unchanged from that described in Section III.D.2.c. of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this preamble or from any equivalent program adopted by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California. All 1999 and later model year California LDVs, LDTs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and MDVs covered by the enhanced in-use standards described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section A.(2) above will be included in this program, regardless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of fuel type. (See section III.D.2.c. of this preamble for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> description of I/M for non-California vehicles.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Overall, the enhanced in-use I/M program does three things.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, it implements a more stringent set of I/M emission levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (hereafter referred to as the enhanced in-use I/M standards).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, it creates a maximum fraction of any particular exhaust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission engine family which can fail the more stringent enhanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in-use I/M standards without consequence for the manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (hereafter referred to as the liability threshold). Third, once  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the failure rate of the enhanced in-use I/M standards exceeds the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability threshold, it initiates a selective recall and makes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the vehicle manufacturer liable for the repairs resulting from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequent I/M failures. As described above, the purpose of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program is to encourage manufacturers to place a high design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priority on in-use vehicle performance and ease of repair in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to ensure that vehicles comply with their certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards in-use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The sequence of events at a typical enhanced I/M test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility will be as follows. Vehicles brought for testing will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be measured against two sets of standards: the conventional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> I/M standards described in Section III.D.2.c. of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble and the lower enhanced in-use I/M standards described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below. Unless a significant portion of vehicles in any engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family have failed the enhanced in-use I/M standards, vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owners will only be required to repair their vehicles if they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fail the conventional enhanced I/M standards. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of vehicles failing the more stringent enhanced in-use I/M  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards will be tallied. If the percentage of a specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine family failing the enhanced in-use I/M standards exceeds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the liability thresholds described below, two events occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, future vehicles of this particular engine family failing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the more stringent enhanced in-use I/M standards now must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repaired and retested. Second, the manufacturer, and not the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle owner, will be responsible for the repairs for vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> still within their statutory useful life which have not obviously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been abused or tampered with in a manner likely to affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions (i.e., an I/M-based selective recall). As described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below, the enhanced in-use  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> I/M standards are numerically higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than the enhanced in-use FTP emission levels. Thus, as long as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles are performing close to the standards to which they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified, only the conventional enhanced I/M program will apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and there will be no post-manufacturing consequence for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer of the enhanced in-use  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> I/M program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The sections below describe the nature of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced in-use I/M program including testing, enhanced in-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I/M standards, threshold for manufacturer liability, tracking of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced in-use I/M test results, repair responsibility,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographic coverage, and other administrative aspects of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Testing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   As discussed in more detail in Section III.D.2.c. of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble, three types of I/M tests will be performed on light-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and medium-duty vehicles. First, exhaust emissions will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured using the I/M 240 test. Second, purge and pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests will be performed to establish the evaporative system's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functionality and integrity. Finally, a visual inspection will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be performed to check for missing canisters, catalysts, etc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which would indicate that obvious tampering or abuse has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurred. Vehicles with obvious tampering or abuse which fail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the enhanced I/M 240, pressure, or purge tests will require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repair at the owner's expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes to include post-1998 model year diesel- and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative-fueled (CNG and LPG) vehicles in enhanced I/M  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing, as well as gasoline vehicles. Evaporative system checks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be revised where appropriate for alternative-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles, since some fuel types (e.g., diesel fuel and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressurized fuels) produce little or no evaporative emissions as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long as their fuel tanks are not ruptured. Diesel-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles are currently exempt from most I/M programs, because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their HC emissions are inherently low and their historical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions has not depended on technologies that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deteriorate significantly over time. Alternative-fueled vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been exempted because of their low numbers. However, as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards applicable to post-1998 model year vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be very stringent regardless of fuel type, EPA is proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that every vehicle be tested under the enhanced I/M program,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regardless of fuel type. EPA requests comment on the testing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diesel- and alternative-fueled vehicles in the proposed enhanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in-use I/M program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

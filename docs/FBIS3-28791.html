			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry  issued a draft fiscal investment and loan program for fiscal  1994 Thursday [10 February] that earmarks higher outlays to  revive the sagging economy and upgrade living standards.    Ordinary "zaito" investment programs mainly to finance  housing projects, public works and projects by  government-affiliated financial institutions are allocated  39,147.9 billion yen for the year starting April 1, up 7.0  percent from the original fiscal 1993 zaito budget.    The ministry budgeted 10,186.5 billion yen for  housing-related projects, an investment category believed to  underpin the Japanese economy amid the long slump, up a sharp  22.6 percent. In fiscal 1993, such spending growth was set at  10.4 percent.    Outlays of 5,979.0 billion yen, up 10.1 percent, go to  lending and other programs for struggling small companies, the  ministry said.    It allots 7,949.4 billion yen, up 12.2 percent, to local  public organizations and local public financial institutions as  a way to improve livelihood-related infrastructure in regional  areas.    The 7.0 percent growth in ordinary zaito programs compares  with a 13.4 percent gain in fiscal 1993 and a 10.8 percent rise  in fiscal 1992.    But including 994.9 billion yen in fiscal investment newly  secured under the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993,  the sum will total 40,142.8 billion yen for a growth of 10  percent.    The extra budget to fund the government's record 15.25  trillion yen pump-priming package, released Tuesday, was adopted  Thursday.    Next year's zaito program should have maximum effects when  combined with the extra zaito program for the current year, a  ministry official told a press conference. The concept reflects  the need to ensure continued budgetary implementation for 15  months from January 1994, he said.    The official said the ministry set out an economy-boosting  zaito program for the fourth consecutive year.    It appropriated a 5.1 percent increase to 48,097.9 billion  yen for overall zaito investment, or a sum including programs  managed by the ministry's Trust Fund Bureau. The growth  compares with a 12.2 percent gain in fiscal 1993.    The draft for the fiscal investment and loan program, often  called the second national budget, was shown to ministries and  agencies concerned after getting the cabinet's approval Thursday  afternoon.    Of the housing-related budget, the ministry set aside  8,763.2  billion yen for the Housing Loan Corp., up 26.9 percent. Under  this program the corporation would, for example, raise its basic  lending amount for an individual home purchaser by 200,000 yen  to 8 million yen.    Housing investment for fiscal 1994 accounted for the  highest-ever 33.4 percent of the total ordinary zaito program,  eclipsing the preceding record rate of 32.6 percent in fiscal  1991.    Loan programs for small companies include an 8.3 percent  gain  to 4,089 billion yen by the People's Finance Corp. and a 9.4  percent growth to 2,852.5 billion yen by the Japan Finance Corp.  for small business.    The ministry earmarks 156.0 billion yen in loans to  manufacturers striving to launch new businesses under  restructuring efforts, up 15.6 percent.    The zaito program secured a lending quota of 620 billion yen  for the Japan Development Bank for urban infrastructure  improvement projects, up 9.9 percent, and a quota of 277 billion  yen for the same bank for information and telecommunications  infrastructure, up 20.4 percent.    Outlays of 6.5 trillion yen for local public organizations,  up 14.0 percent, are intended to upgrade sewerage, disposal and  health facilities.    The ministry increased by 26.0 percent to 325 billion yen  the  allocation for lending by the Export-Import Bank of Japan as a  way to expand Japan's exports of manufactured goods.    The official said fiscal investment and loan programs for  livelihood, culture and small business-related areas represented  a record 72.9 percent of the total ordinary zaito program, up  from last year's 68.8 percent and the previous high of 71.4  percent in fiscal 1991.    The zaito program does not include stock investment under  new  "shiteitan" accounts, a portfolio with no investment limits on  stocks, the official said. New shiteitans were created in 1992  as a means of spurring the sluggish stock market.    Whether or not new shiteitan will be financed in the fiscal  1994 zaito has yet to be decided, the official said.    The draft is scheduled to be formalized by the government  next Tuesday after negotiations between the Finance Ministry and  other ministries and agencies seeking restoration of budget  allocations the ministry deleted from their original requests.</p>

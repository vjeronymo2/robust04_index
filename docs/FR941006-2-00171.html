The Meeting will be broadcast by satellite up to ten downlink (receiving) sites across the country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The sponsors of the Meeting are seeking proposals from (a) State and local courts or (b) community groups, other non-profit organizations, universities, and other applicants collaborating with courts, that are interested in conducting a local, State, or regional meeting at a downlink site in conjunction with the National Meeting. Each site will receive several hours of programming from the uplink (originating) site, prepare its own program, and report back to the uplink site about its plans for future collaboration between courts and communities to enhance public confidence in the courts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Objectives. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As approved by the Institute's Board of Directors, the objectives of the project are to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Raise the level of awareness of both the court community and the public about the need to work together to improve public trust and confidence in the courts;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identify strategies for improving court and community collaboration at the local and State level;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Promote a diverse group of effective local approaches to improve the relationship between courts and the communities they serve; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Develop national goals rooted in local experience that will encourage courts and communities to work together more effectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

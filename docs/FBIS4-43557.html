			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["bsc" report: "Economic Development in Eastern Germany </F> Tangibly Recovering"]    [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main -- In the view of the Bundesbank,  the economic development in eastern Germany is tangibly  recovering. In particular the processing industry has recovered  -- by 21.5 percent during the first quarter compared with the  same period last year. In its monthly report for June the  Bundesbank assesses this as a sign of the increasing  competitiveness of eastern German products -- but only on the  domestic market for the time being. There, however, orders by  German customers have risen by 26.5 percent within a year,  because foreign business has not yet been able to find a  replacement for the losses on the markets in East Europe: The  share of export business in overall turnover has shrunk to about  10 percent.    According to the Bundesbank, the construction sector remains  an essential factor of economic recovery: Not only in the  public and industrial sector but also in housing construction  has there been a strong expansion in building activities. At  the moment, new buildings are also being ordered in increasing  numbers, in addition to the improvement and renovation of  apartments.    The guardians of the currency see a glimmer of hope for the  working people: Despite the still "alarmingly high"  unemployment of 1.16 million people at the end of May, the  reduction of personnel in the processing industry has come to a  standstill. However, apart from structural problems, a "wage  policy that is little appropriate for the actual conditions" has  so far worsened employment prospects, the Bundesbank notes  reproachfully.

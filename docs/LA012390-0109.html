			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> Some .250 hitter or .500 pitcher signing for $1.5 million a year bothers me  more than Will Clark signing for $3.75 million a year. . . .  </P> <P> And who can begrudge Jim Everett, maybe the third-best quarterback in football,  his mere $2.2 million a year? . . . .  </P> <P> John McEnroe's expulsion from a Grand Slam event was about a decade overdue. .  . .  </P> <P> Forum fans will find Tomas Sandstrom, the Kings' new acquisition, to be  unusually chippy for a player from Europe. . . .  </P> <P> Nearly all the old-timers who performed in the Heroes of Hockey game Saturday  in Pittsburgh still didn't wear helmets. . . .  </P> <P> When the Calgary Flames play to 13 ties in their first 50 games, you know the  five-minute NHL overtime period isn't long enough. . . .  </P> <P> Agent Gene Short is sizing up business opportunities for Kent Desormeaux at  Santa Anita, meaning the record-setting jockey likely will switch operations  from Maryland to Southern California. . . .  </P> <P> If Willie Shoemaker's final mount at Santa Anita Feb. 3 is scratched, he will  get his choice of any other horse in the race. . . .  </P> <P> It will be great for golf if Bob Hope Classic winner Peter Jacobsen, a favorite  with fans and players, finally lives up to his potential. . . .  </P> <P> Remember when encroachment was offsides? . . . Jackie Sherrill's contract at  Texas A&amp;M must have been as lucrative as reported. He now is co-owner of a  car dealership in suburban Houston. . . .  </P> <P> San Francisco 49er back Roger Craig on the Super Bowl: "Our backs will be  against the wall." . . .  </P> <P> In Las Vegas, you can get 5-1 odds on Denver winning the game. . . .  </P> <P> Blair Thomas' strong showing in the Senior Bowl will help to make the Penn  State running back a high first-round draft choice. . . .  </P> <P> The Dallas Cowboys were shut out three times last season and twice during the  29-year reign of Tom Landry. . . .  </P> <P> One reason USC Coach Larry Smith won't take an NFL job is that he doesn't  follow the pro game closely. . . .  </P> <P> Highlight of Super Bowl weekend may be the UCLA-Oregon State basketball game  Saturday afternoon at Pauley Pavilion. . . .  </P> <P> Oregon State star guard Gary Payton orally committed to St. John's as a student  at Skyline High in Oakland four years ago, but the Redmen backed out when they  gave scholarships instead to Boo Harvey and Michael Porter. . . .  </P> <P> USC Coach George Raveling on Payton: "In my 15 years in the conference, no  guard has done what he has.  </P> <P> He's carried his team." . . .  </P> <P> LSU guard Chris Jackson said his all-time favorite movie is "The Fish That  Saved Pittsburgh," starring Julius Erving. . . .  </P> <P> Jackson was held to 11 points Sunday by Alabama's Keith Askins, who also  stopped Mississippi star Gerald Glass last week and may be the Michael Cooper  of the 1990s. . . .  </P> <P> Dick Vitale said last week the best coaching job in the country was being done  by Billy Tubbs of Oklahoma, which promptly lost two games. . . .  </P> <P> If Bobby Cremins coached as well as he recruited, Georgia Tech would be a  national contender every year. . . .  </P> <P> ESPN's move of "Sportslook" from 11 p.m. to midnight was its worst programming  decision since hiding "Home Run Derby" in the wee hours of the morning. . . .  </P> <P> Dan Dierdorf of ABC and Bob Trumpy of NBC should stick to football commentary  and forget about boxing blow-by-blow. . . .  </P> <P> An average of 211.4 points is being scored in NBA games this season, down 10.2  points from five years ago. Is it defense or expansion? . . .  </P> <P> I still can't get used to the sight of Manute Bol trying a three-point shot. .  . .  </P> <P> Coach Larry Brown of the San Antonio Spurs covets New York Knick guard Rod  Strickland, but would he be willing to give up Sean Elliott or Willie Anderson  in a trade?. . . .  </P> <P> Dallas Maverick center James Donaldson, who was born in England, enjoys a spot  of tea before tipoff. . . .  </P> <P> Only three NBA teams -- the Lakers, Utah and Boston -- have winning records on  the road. . . .  </P> <P> Seattle might trade third baseman Jim Presley to Boston, allowing the Red Sox  to deal Wade Boggs. . . .  </P> <P> Times staff writer Ross Newhan will be presented the Bob Hunter Award Feb. 11  at the 33rd annual awards banquet of the Los Angeles-Anaheim chapter of the  Baseball Writers Assn. of America. The dinner will be held at the Hyatt-Regency  Hotel in Long Beach. . . .  </P> <P> Yankee pitcher Tim Leary flashed midseason form Sunday at Jackie Robinson  Stadium, where the UCLA Bruin alumnus struck out four of the seven varsity  batters he faced. . . .  </P> <P> "The great trouble with baseball today is that most of the players are in the  game for the money that's in it -- not for the love of it, the excitement of it  and the thrill of it." -- Ty Cobb, 1925.  </P></p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Travel: Valetta by knight It is easy to see why the less youthful British tourist finds Valetta so cosy. English is a second language; post and telephone boxes in scarlet stand sentry at street corners. But Valetta is not like anywhere in Britain. It remains essentially the handsome, homogenous and devoutly Catholic stone citadel conceived by the Knights of the Order of St John after the great siege of 1565 and built in anticipation of the infidel's next visit. On paper, Valetta appears a perfect piece of Italian Renaissance military engineering and town planning, a rigid grid of streets and squares girded by massive walls and bastions. A map does not prepare you for the roller-coaster of its streets. Reminders of the knights are impressed on every street. To them Malta owes its great cathedral, churches, national library and theatre. Belying the military severity of Valetta's facades are some of the most glorious interiors and works of art in Europe. The Holy Infirmary, begun in 1574, must still boast the grandest - and largest - ward of any hospital. The Manoel Theatre, built for the 'honest recreation of the people' by Grand Master Manoel de Vilhena in 1731 and still in use, is a rococo confection of pale green, turquoise and gilt, the tiered boxes of its intimate oval auditorium garlanded with fruit, flowers and musical instruments. Open the door to St John's Cathedral, the conventual church, and there is the first complete expression of florid High Baroque. Everything, from the illusionistic painting on the barrel-vaulted ceiling to the arabesques of the side chapels, was masterminded and partly executed by one man, the Calabrian Mattia Preti. There is no surface that he did not cover with paint, gold leaf, marble or carved stone. There are any number of altarpieces of varying merit - and two remarkable Caravaggios. It is worth going to Malta for these alone. Caravaggio was the 'excellent painter' invited to the island and made Brother and Knight of Obedience in 1608. High up in the chapel of the Italian langue hangs an impressive St Jerome, while dominating the Oratory of St John is his masterpiece, The Beheading of St John the Baptist, his largest and only signed work. This is a canvas to chill the blood. All the action is compressed into a harshly-lit corner of an otherwise gloomy prison yard. Caravaggio chooses the moment when the executioner, who has already half-severed the Baptist's head, grasps his hair to get a good purchase before finishing his job. Nothing masks the reality of this brutal death. The goaler impassively directs the executioner to put the head on the charger, held by a young, bare-armed girl who is surely Salome. Only her maid looks on in horror. Caravaggio left his name in the oozing blood. By 7pm, Valetta is deserted. There is hardly a soul on the street to appreciate the floodlit fortifications or the church domes spangled with light bulbs. The middle classes are off home to Sliema, and the tourists pursue the nightlife offered along the island's carelessly developed shore. Valetta evenings are best spent admiring the panorama over Marsamxett harbour from the roof-top dining room of Giannini, the island's best restaurant, or in the 16th century cellars of the Hotel Castille, savouring pizza Maltese-style made with local sausages and the pepper-bound goat's cheese made on Gozo. By night one must see Mdina. While Valetta is quiet, the old capital of Malta is silent and haughtily aristocratic. Its narrow, angular medieval streets are lined by the blank, excluding walls of still-inhabited palaces and monasteries. Carved Norman portals and Baroque cornices are thrown into exaggerated relief. Under the wraps of darkness the town is hushed and histrionic. By day, the poetry is lost amid the clatter of the Zimmer frame and the glare of the acrylic cardigan. Susan Moore travelled with Air Malta and stayed at the five-star Hotel Phoenicia at Floriana, just outside Valetta's city gate. Civilised long weekenders should bear in mind that tour groups to Malta tend to start their week in Valetta.</p>

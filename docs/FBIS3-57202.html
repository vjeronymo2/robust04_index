The Supreme Soviet's presidium discussed this issue in Kiev  on Monday.    Leader of the Ukrainian parliament's working group on  preparations for ratification of the START-1 treaty, Environment  Minister Yuriy Kostenko, said on Monday that he saw neither  economic and military "interests of Ukraine" nor guarantees for  security in the statement.    He believes that "due to this the Moscow statement should be  considered properly and receive a juridical evaluation."    Kostenko explained the fact that the document was signed in  a  form of a statement requiring no ratification by the parliament  as "juridical intriguing" and demanded that deputies determine  "whether the Moscow statement was useful for Ukraine."    He added that the Moscow trilateral statement proposed "in  fact a new scheme for Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, which  differs from the one worked out by the parliament."    "We are moving towards a non-nuclear status. However, we do  this in conformity with the interests of Ukraine. The events in  Moscow represent not only a military but also an economic and  political split within the country rather than nuclear  disarmament," the minister believes.    He also stated that Ukraine had already withdrawn to Russia  tactical nuclear weapons together with approximately 10 tons of  high enriched plutonium and 90 tons of high enriched uranium.  In his words, 1 kilogram of plutonium will cost about $1 Mn and  1 kilogram of uranium up to $100,000 on the world market.    "This means that today Russia is Ukraine's debtor and not  vice versa. Russia must compensate Ukraine for the tactical  nuclear weapons with account taken of the equivalent exchange of  the cost of uranium for oil and gas."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Mikhail Stetsyuk for TASS] </F>   [Text] Sevastopol June 29 TASS -- The results of elections  of the city mayor and deputies to the Sevastopol City Council  were discussed at a session of the Electoral Commission on  Tuesday. The mandates won by 50 deputies and chairman of the  executive committee Viktor Semenov were recognised valid.    Viktor Semenov, in his first address as the city mayor, said  that the new power would be tough and its goal would be to  improve the life of city residents. Semenov pledged to suspend  the activities of the Ukrainian president's mission in  Sevastopol on the very first day when the newly elected city  council comes into office, saying that organs of state  administration would begin to operate in accordance with a  regime of the executive committee of the city council of  people's deputies.    Semenov intends to put problems, pertaining to the  possibility of Sevastopol's integration into the Crimean common  economic space, on the agenda of the first session of the city  council. In this connection, the city council shall appeal to  the president and the parliament of the autonomous republic in  order to apply the banking, currency and customs policy pursued  by the Crimean authorities, on the city's territory.    The new mayor intends to endorse the city's emblem and its  anthem at the first session of the city council.</p>

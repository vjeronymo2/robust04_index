Over the past couple of years, the port city has been  building itself into a "garden port".    The area where three rivers which run through the city  converge has been transformed into a greenland densely covered  with trees, bushes and grass, from the scene of ruin and  desolation it presented only seven years ago.    While the focus of the greening project was on the river  banks, trees have also been planted along more than 240 roads.  Small greenery has also been added at more than 40 street  corners.    There were only five little parks in 1978. Now the city has  17 parks, including a zoo.</p>

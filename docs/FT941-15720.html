			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Lisbon investigates Banesto link Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese prime minister, said yesterday that Lisbon authorities were investigating the possibility that Banesto, the troubled Spanish bank, may have acted illegally in acquiring its holding in Banco Totta e Acores (BTA), Portugal's leading private bank. Banesto's former chairman, Mr Mario Conde, implicitly recognised that the Spanish bank might have contravened a Portuguese law limiting foreign ownership of BTA to 25 per cent, when he said on Tuesday that Banesto controlled about 50 per cent of the Portuguese institution. He said about half the equity was held directly and the remainder indirectly. Mr Cavaco Silva said Banesto would be required to reduce its shareholding in BTA if the authorities found that Banesto had infringed Portugal's investment regulations. Mr Conde was ousted from Banesto's board when the Bank of Spain intervened on December 28.</p>

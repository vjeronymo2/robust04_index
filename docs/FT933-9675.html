			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Actress named to chair US arts agency PRESIDENT Bill Clinton made his first big move in arts policy at the weekend by nominating award-winning actress Ms Jane Alexander to chair the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), the government agency which issues grants to performing and visual artists. The chair has been vacant since January when Ms Anne-Imelda Radice, a conservative Bush appointee, stepped down; it has been filled in the interim by Ms Ana Steele, a longtime NEA employee, who said Ms Alexander was 'a superb choice'. The Endowment, which has a budget this year of Dollars 174m (Pounds 117m), has been under heavy attack in recent years from members of Congress and conservative religious organisations who question the government's use of public funds to support artists who treat sexual and religious material in an outspoken manner. In a statement on Saturday Mr Clinton said: 'The Endowment's mission of fostering and preserving our nation's cultural heritage is too important to remain mired in the problems of the past.' Ms Alexander is currently starring in the hit play The Sisters Rosensweig on Broadway. She has performed in 40 films and over 100 plays in New York and the regions.</p>

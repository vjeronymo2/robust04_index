			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: LIN Broadcasting to spin off TV station business LIN Broadcasting, the cellular telephone company in which McCaw Cellular Communications owns a 52 per cent stake, is to spin off LIN Television, its TV station business, to shareholders in a tax-free distribution of shares. The company also announced an agreement to buy WTNH-TV, an affiliate of the ABC network in Connecticut, from Cook Inlet Communications for about Dollars 120m in cash and 11.5 per cent of LIN Television common shares. The two moves, expected to be completed by the end of this year, will create a publicly-quoted company which owns seven television stations affiliated to the three big US broadcasting networks. Public shareholders would own 42 per cent of LIN Television and McCaw would hold 46 per cent. The business had pro forma 1993 revenues of Dollars 160m and broadcasting cashflow of Dollars 80m. Cities served by its stations include Dallas, Texas, Indianapolis, Indiana and Norfolk, Virginia. Mr Craig McCaw, chairman of both McCaw Cellular and LIN Broadcasting, said television and cellular were two fundamentally different businesses and should be managed separately. 'We believe the spin-off enables LIN Television to continue to do acquisitions like WTNH-TV, and feel there is a substantial opportunity for an independent, highly-focused television business to grow rapidly,' he said. AT&amp;T, the largest US long-distance telephone group, has agreed to buy McCaw, the nation's largest cellular telephone company, for Dollars 12bn. The deal, however, is still subject to a prolonged regulatory review. If that deal goes through, many analysts expect AT&amp;T to buy out minority shareholders in LIN Broadcasting to strengthen its market position in cellular.</p>

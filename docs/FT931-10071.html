			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (30): Drop-outs show change in fortunes - High real interest rates, a fall-off in demand and an increase in supply have taken their toll in one of the worst hit sectors / Property PROPERTY is one of the worst hit sectors in the latest survey of Europe's top 500 companies, reflecting the industry's sharp reversal of fortunes since 1991. In the 12 months to last September, the number of property companies in the FT500 fell from 14 to just five, as high real interest rates, a fall-off in demand and an increase in supply took their toll. Deflation has followed a decade of soaring values. In the five years to 1990, rapidly increasing occupier demand and low vacancy rates drove average office rents in Europe up by an average of 14 per cent a year and capital values up by 18 per cent a year, according to Jones Lang Wootton, property consultants. After peaking in the first quarter of 1991, Europe's office rents fell by an average of 11 per cent from their peak; capital values fell by an average of 23 per cent. But the timing of the decline has varied significantly between cities. Starting in London in late 1989, the property recession has rolled its way around Europe, and has now reached Germany, hitherto the strongest of Europe's large property markets. Only a handful of markets, such as Brussels and Hamburg, bucked the trend and increased office rents in 1992. A casual glance at FT500 ratings can provide only a partial guide to the strengths and weaknesses of Europe's property markets. For example, Germany, one of Europe's most important property markets, has no representation, as property is largely in private hands. Moreover, the UK and France, two of the worst hit markets in Europe, are still the best represented countries in the FT500, each with two property companies. The French companies, which are in the relatively robust residential sector, actually improved their rankings. Likewise, Rodamco, the Dutch property concern which is the largest property company in Europe, has gone up in the rankings from 132 to 130. Even though it has large exposures to some of the worst affected property markets in the world such as the US, the UK and France, its large cash reserves lent it some resilience. As well as difficulties in comparing Europe's property companies, generalising about Europe's property markets is complicated by the different structures of each countries' property markets and the predominantly local factors that govern them. Nonetheless, there are several common causes of the escalation of property prices across Europe, and their later collapse. One of the factors influencing the rise in rents in most European capitals was the rapid expansion of corporate activity ahead of the creation of a barrier-free European market in 1993. At a time when the expansion of international companies has slowed, markets are driven by mainly domestic companies which are looking carefully at their costs. Likewise, there was a sharp upturn in international investment at the end of the 1980s, as funds flowed into the European Community, particularly from Japan and Sweden, and investment restrictions were lifted within EC countries. But international investors largely retreated as recession bit and they became burdened with problems in their home markets. The surge in rents and investment triggered an upturn in construction, encouraged in several cities by a relaxation of planning rules. Across Europe, office vacancies rose to 6 per cent and are expected to rise further during 1993, according to Jones Lang Wootton. The UK commercial property market, which has experienced one of the longest and deepest recessions in Europe, has seen the greatest decline of any country in its representation in the FT500. Three companies, Hammerson, Slough Estates and British Land, have left. Only the UK's two largest property companies, Land Securities and MEPC still make the grade. Most UK property companies are heavily exposed to offices, the worst-affected market, which has seen values halve in the past three years. As they mostly entered the downturn with relatively high gearing, their market capitalisations have fallen drastically over the past three years. That said, sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism, which lowered interest rates and heralded potentially higher inflation pushed property shares up by 30 per cent. Whereas the London office market may be over the worst of its decline, concern about Paris is intensifying. Rents have fallen sharply and are likely to continue to do so as the supply of office space coming on to the market peaks next year. Now the government has been asked to put forward some measures to support the market, by the insurance companies and banks, which have been forced to make heavy provisions on their loans to property developers. The ravaged state of the French commercial property market is not evident from the performance of its largest property companies. The only French company to drop out is Unibail, which has four-fifths of its portfolio in the office sector. The remaining French companies went up in the rankings. Sefimeg, for which residential property accounts for three quarters of its portfolio, went up from 369 to 343.</p>

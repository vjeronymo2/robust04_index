			<p>BFN     [Text] Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana spoke to the  Foreign Affairs Committee in Congress about various matters  pertaining to his department, particularly the situation in the  Maghreb and in Equatorial Guinea.    According to Javier Solana, relations between the European  Union [EU] and the Maghreb are of fundamental importance.  Javier Solana:    [Begin Solana recording] The strategic importance of the  region for the Community is obvious. But if I had to underline  it further, I would highlight three aspects: It is its third  trading partner, with 8 percent of all its trade. [sentence as  heard] This fact should be remembered, I think.    The area is vital for the Community's energy supply. And in  third place, and to add another touch to this general picture,  nearly 5 million of its citizens live on EC territory. There go  three factors, so one can understand the strategic importance it  has for us.    Furthermore, as we all know, these countries face very  serious problems, economic ones, political ones, high foreign  debt, high trade deficit -- sadly very high -- increasing  demographic pressure, environmental problems, fundamentalism,  etc. All of this means that they are increasingly complex  countries.    The data I have just mentioned to you explains that Spain  very forcefully wants the EU to review its Mediterranean  relations in general, and EU-Maghreb relations in particular.  We believe they should be higher on the EU agenda. We should  manage to anchor their economies to Europe by increasing  cooperation in all areas of development. [end recording]</p>

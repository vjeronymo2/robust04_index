			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE LEAGUE;  </P> <P> WESTERN MISSES 12 OF 16 FREE THROWS IN LOSS TO SAVANNA  </P> <P> If free throws really are free, then why couldn't Western High School buy one  Wednesday night in its Orange League opener against Savanna?  </P> <P> Western made only 4 of 16 free throws in a 54-50 loss.  </P> <P> "I don't have an explanation," Western Coach Greg Hoffman said. "We work on  shooting free throws as hard as anybody. We're shooting 68% as a team, and we  can't make a free throw in our own gym.  </P> <P> "We've lost every ballgame this year because we couldn't hit a free throw. We  played well enough to beat them, and if we make the free throws, we win  easily."  </P> <P> Western (10-4, 0-1) took a 24-11 lead in the second quarter but went cold from  the field and eventually trailed, 25-24, early in the third quarter when Jim  Priest scored for Savanna.  </P> <P> Priest continued to make the big plays for Savanna, hitting a 3-point shot that  tied the score, 35-35, early in the fourth quarter and then padding Savanna's  lead to 45-40 on a jump shot with 2:38 remaining.  </P> <P> Priest and teammate Tim Tillman each scored 17 points for Savanna (15-1, 1-0).  Sam Sabbara led Western with 24 points but made only 3 of 9 free throws.  </P> <P> "Over the last 10 games, Jim Priest has been our leader, and I thought he did a  super job on (Joe) Romero," said Tom Gregory, Savanna coach.  </P> <P> Romero, averaging 18.6 points per game, scored only 8. The 3-point specialist  made 1 of 5 shots from 3-point range. No other Western player scored in double  figures as the Pioneers were limited to their lowest scoring output of the  season.  </P> <P> "It was an ugly win, but then it's always an ugly game when you play Western,  and that's a compliment to them," Gregory said. "Nobody plays harder than they  do, and I knew we'd have problems handling their press."  </P> <P> Savanna, which has routinely produced excellent point guards over the past 8  years, is a team in need of a ballhandler. The Rebels committed 22 turnovers  against Western's press.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda 41, Valencia 33 -- Aaron Chamberlain scored 11 points and Matt  Chamberlain 10 to lead Brea-Olinda (12-5, 1-0) at Valencia. The Wildcats  trailed, 22-20, after three quarters but outscored the Tigers, 21-11, in the  final quarter. Rudy Lopez scored 10 points for Valencia (3-7, 0-1).  </P> <P> Magnolia 50, Anaheim 47 -- Jurry Jones scored 11 points to lead a balanced  Magnolia attack at Anaheim. The Sentinels (7-6, 1-0) trailed, 37-20, at  halftime. However, they outscored the Colonists, 30-10, in the second half.  Danny Castro scored 17 points and Jude Barbito 14 for Anaheim (7-7, 0-1).  </P></p>

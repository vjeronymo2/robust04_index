			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, April 26 (AFP) -- The UN Protection Force  said Tuesday that the Bosnian Serbs were making progress in  withdrawing their heavy weapons from around the Moslem enclave  of Gorazde ahead of a 0001 GMT deadline set by NATO.    "Generally we are satisfied with the progress that is taking  place on the ground," said UNPROFOR spokesman Michael Williams.  "The Bosnian Serb Army is withdrawing heavy weaponry from the  20-kilometre exclusion zone and the general trend is positive."    He said that the United Nations' special representative to  ex-Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi had sent a letter overnight Monday  to NATO's secretary general Manfred Woerner telling him that he  was satisfied by the Serb progress and was hopeful that they  would comply with the deadline.    Earlier in London, US Secretary of State Warren Christopher  said that the Serbs had begun withdrawing their heavy weapons  from around the battered enclave but not enough to avert the  threat of NATO air strikes. "Today will be an important day.  There has been some movement, but not enough," Christopher said  after meeting with British counterpart Douglas Hurd.  Christopher was to leave later Tuesday for Geneva and a meeting  with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev.    As he spoke, a four-sided working group began meeting in  London in search of long-term solutions to the Bosnian conflict.  Hurd said Monday there would be "no hesitation" in ordering air  strikes if Serb troops and weapons were not withdrawn beyond a  20 kilometre (12 mile) radius from the centre of the Moslem  enclave by 0001 GMT Wednesday.</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Major seeks to unite Tories in aftermath of reshuffle BEDROCK Conservative values will be reaffirmed by Mr John Major this week, as the prime minister seeks to dispel the sour aftermath of last week's reshuffle and to focus the party on an agenda that will unite it. Mr Major's efforts to reassert his authority after Mr Norman Lamont's departure from the Treasury have so far been hampered by public divisions among Tory MPs about whether there should be tax increases in the November budget, and whether the reshuffle should have been more extensive. Officers of the Tory backbench finance committee are to seek an early meeting with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to discuss how he will approach his task of reining in public borrowing. The prime minister's speech to the national Conservative women's conference at the end of this week is seen as an opportunity to restore the party's fortunes by concentrating on policies such as widening ownership, extending individual freedoms and lightening the burdens that government imposes on business. The need to find an approach that the entire party can support has been highlighted during the weekend by the sensitivities about how the balance between left and right in the new cabinet will work in practice. Senior party managers will spend this week judging how the reshuffle has been received in the constituencies and take that into account in deciding when to hold the Christchurch by-election. Although no decision has been reached, Tory strategists appear since the reshuffle to have leaned towards mid-July rather than the autumn for the contest, where the Conservatives are defending a 23,000 majority. But fresh sniping at Mr Major himself helped to put the government on the defensive. Downing Street dismissed as not worth comment the call by Lord Rees-Mogg, a former editor of The Times, for Mr Major to resign. It also sought to play down criticism by Lord Lawson, the former chancellor. Writing in the London Business School's latest international economic outlook, Lord Lawson said the government made a mistake in joining the European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990 at a central rate of DM2.95 to the pound without obtaining Bundesbank support. Britain joined the ERM when Mr Major was chancellor. He also said the credibility of the ERM and European exchange rate stability could only be restored if the Maastricht treaty and its plan for a single European currency were abandoned. Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, defended Mr Major, highlighting the prime minister's role in winning the general election for the Conservatives, and emphasising that the return of sterling into the ERM was 'not on the agenda'. Mr Hunt's comments follow his remarks over the weekend about the desirability of stable exchange rates, and underline the delicate balance which ministers are keen to strike over economic policy in particular. As part of that balance, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, will serve on the main economic cabinet committees. Some rightwingers suggest, however, that the combination of Mr Clarke, Mr Hunt, and Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, leaves the government's economic strategy firmly in the hands of the 'interventionists'.

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Barratt back in the black at Pounds 11m SIR LAWRIE Barratt, who 14 months ago came out of retirement to rescue Barratt Developments, Britain's third largest housebuilder, yesterday announced that the group had turned a Pounds 105.9m loss into a Pounds 11.3m pre-tax profit during the 12 months to the end of June. The turnround occurred in spite of extremely difficult trading conditions, said the Barratt chairman. Sir Lawrie appealed to the UK prime minister to cut base interest rates to 6 per cent, end stamp duty on house sales, raise the ceiling for mortgage tax relief and provide capital allowances to encourage the private rented market. Barratt's share price rose almost a third yesterday to 67p following the announcement that the group was to pay a final dividend of 2p. Earnings per share were 7.8p. Sir Lawrie said the group had achieved its twin targets of returning to profits and dividends and reducing gearing to below 50 per cent. Net debt including off-balance sheet finance had fallen from Pounds 205m to Pounds 71m over the 12 months cutting gearing from 120 per cent to 39 per cent. This had been achieved largely through improved housekeeping, said Sir Lawrie. Savings of almost Pounds 60m arose from reducing Barratt's stock of unsold and part-exchange houses held for sale. Sale and leaseback of show -homes had provided another Pounds 38m of savings. The group had also benefited from Pounds 14m of commercial property disposals. The group said the return to profits had been achieved in spite of difficult trading conditions in the UK and US housing markets. The group, which builds homes in southern California, reduced its US losses from Pounds 39m to Pounds 6.7m and expected to break even in the current year after closing two of its three subsidiaries there. In the UK the group sold 4,706 homes - 5 per cent fewer than the previous year. Sir Lawrie said this was a creditable performance given that most of Barratt's developments in southern England had been closed at the beginning of the year. Barratt made a further write-down of Pounds 6.1m against its UK housing land. This compared with a write-down of Pounds 84m the previous year. Sir Lawrie did not expect to make any further provisions as he believed that UK house prices had stopped falling.

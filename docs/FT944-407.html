			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / London council bodies to merge London's local authorities are to form a single association for the first time since the abolition of the Greater London Council in 1986. The Labour-controlled Association of London Authorities is to merge with the London Boroughs Association, which was Tory-controlled until this year's elections. The associations are the result of a split after divisions over the abolition of the GLC. The merged association aims to be operating from April 1.</p>

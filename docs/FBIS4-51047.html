			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 24 (XINHUA) -- Moscow's key  policy-making body, the Russian Security Council, was expanded  today to include Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the Lower House of the  Parliament, as its ninth member under a decree of President  Boris Yeltsin.    The Presidential Press Office announced the order to the  ITAR- TASS NEWS AGENCY this morning and said the decision was  based on the country's constitution.    Many of Russia's important policies have been worked out  with  the counsel of the Security Council, which is directly under  Yeltsin's leadership. Since a Yeltsin-proposed reshuffle in  February, the council had had eight members including ministers  of defense, foreign and home affairs as well as heads of the  country's intelligence departments.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Observer: Know-all What an ideal local government ombudsman Edward Osmotherly will make. A top mandarin at the Transport department, he was progenitor of the infamous 'Osmotherly rules' that govern the appearance of civil servants in front of parliamentary select committees. The rules say that since it is ministers rather than civil servants who are answerable to parliament, civil servants should tell MPs only what the minister wants them to know. Professor Peter Hennessy, the doyen of Whitehall watchers, describes the rules as 'the 60 ways of saying 'I can't answer that question' on which Whitehall relies to see off the curious'. Knowledge of such procedural wheezes should prove invaluable in Osmotherly's new task of exposing maladministration in local government.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The ANC has suspended its application to the  Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] to have the election  results in KwaZulu/Natal set aside.    IEC chairman Judge Johann Kriegler and vice-chairman Dikgang  Moseneke said yesterday the ANC's lawyers had asked that the  application be "put on ice" after earlier serving papers on the  IEC's Special Electoral Court. The ANC has until the  dismantling of the IEC at the end of next month to reopen the  matter, if it so chooses.    Kriegler declared the elections substantially free and fair  in the face of an ANC request that the results in Natal/KwaZulu  be declared null and void after widespread claims of voting  irregularities in the area. IEC sources indicated that the  ANC's application would have little chance of success.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 7 TASS -- The Russian Government should  use the 1994 budget revenue reserves to solve the most acute  social and economic problems, Chairman of the State Duma  Committee for Budget, Taxes, Banks and Finances Mikhail Zadornov  told a news conference here today in view of the Duma's second  reading of the draft 1994 budget.    These problems include financial support to Federation  subjects, defence spending, fundamental science, education and  preservation of cultural monuments, said the deputy. In his  opinion, such distribution of budget means will help to preserve  the defence, scientific and cultural potential of Russia.    The money can be found as the "Russian Government has  envisaged a number of reserves in the draft budget," he said.  At the same time, the reserves should not exceed the limits of  the Duma-approved spending, revenues and the budget deficit.    For instance, 1,500,000,000,000 rubles can be received from  cuts of the domestic debt payment. Another 3,000,000,000,000  rubles can be taken from the reduced amount of foreign drawings.  It is also necessary to cut by 15 per cent the spending on  state management structures, whose size has increased by eight  times as compared to last year, said Zadornov.</p>

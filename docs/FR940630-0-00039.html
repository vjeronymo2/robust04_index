			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to: a) the State's lack of specificity in proposing to extend eligibility to sites mined and abandoned prior to November 5, 1990; and b) the State's plan to extend emergency eligibility to sites mined after August 3, 1977. OSM notified Alabama of these concerns by letter dated January 27, 1994 (Administrative Record No. AL&hyph;508). Alabama responded in a letter dated April 5, 1994 (Administrative Record No. AL&hyph;509), by submitting a revised amendment. The revised amendment includes specific language describing those sites eligible for abandoned mine land reclamation. The proposed change of date in Alabama's emergency program section of the AMLR Plan was withdrawn. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the revisions to the proposed amendment submitted by Alabama, OSM reopened the public comment period in the June 1, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 28302). The public comment period closed on June 16, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Director's Findings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 884.14 and 885.15, are the Director's findings concerning the proposed amendment submitted on October 1, 1993, and revised on April 5, 1994. Revisions not specifically discussed below concern nonsubstantive wording changes, or revised cross-references and paragraph notations to reflect organizational changes resulting from this amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Procedures for Ranking and Selecting/Landowner's Guide to Reclamation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Alabama is proposing to revise its ranking and selection procedures for abandoned mine land reclamation projects and right of entry procedures as provided in the reclamation guidelines for landowners by extending abandoned mine land eligibility to sites mined after August 3, 1977. Those sites would include: a) sites mined during the period beginning on August 4, 1977, and ending on or before May 20, 1982, for which funds for reclamation or abatement pursuant to a bond or other form of financial guarantee or from any other source are not sufficient to provide for adequate reclamation or abatement; or b) sites mined during the period beginning on August 4, 1977, and ending on or before November 5, 1990, and for which the surety of the mining operator became insolvent and there were not sufficient funds to provide for adequate reclamation or abatement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed State revisions pertaining to ranking and selection and landowner's guidelines to reclamation are substantively identical to section 402(g)(4)(B) (i) and (ii) of SMCRA. Therefore, the Director finds the proposed State rules no less effective than the Federal rules at section 402(g)(4)(B) (i) and (ii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Senate Bill 162_Definition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In section 9&hyph;16&hyph;121 of Senate bill 162, Alabama revised the statutory definition of ``abandoned mine lands'' to include certain lands affected by the mining of coal prior to November 5, 1990. In section 9&hyph;16&hyph;124, Alabama defined lands and water eligible for reclamation or drainage abatement expenditures as those which were mined for coal or which were affected by the mining or coal mining processes, and abandoned or left in an inadequate reclamation status prior to November 5, 1990, and for which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility under existing State or Federal law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Federal rules do not contain a definition of ``abandoned mine lands,'' section 404 of SMCRA defines eligible lands and water. Further, section 402(g)(4) of SMCRA specifies certain criteria which sites must satisfy in order to meet AML eligibility requirements. Although Alabama's statutory language lacks the specificity of section 402(g)(4) of SMCRA, the Alabama Plan is being revised, as discussed in Finding 1, to include the more restrictive language provided by SMCRA. Therefore, the Director finds the revised definitions in Senate Bill 162 not inconsistent with the Federal rules at sections 402(g)(4) and 404 of SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

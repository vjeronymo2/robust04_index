			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Canadian unease over Nafta fuelled by recession and US trade disputes RECESSION and a series of high-profile trade disputes with the US have heightened the Canadian public's unease over the creation of a North American free-trade area (Nafta), Bernard Simon writes from Toronto. However, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has so far shown no sign of bowing to pressure to withdraw from trilateral talks with the US and Mexico. Canadian government officials say the talks give Ottawa an opportunity to clarify and improve the rules of origin in the 1989 US-Canada free-trade agreement (FTA). They also contend that current disagreements over Canadian lumber and automotive exports to the US underline the importance of the dispute settlement mechanism, which has been one of the most successful features of the FTA and is likely to be adapted to the Nafta.</p>

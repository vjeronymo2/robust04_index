			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Czechoslovakia told to halt dam EC mediators told Czechoslovakia on Thursday it had 15 days to stop building the controversial Gabcikovo dam project on the Danube as Hungary accused its neighbour of wreaking ecological havoc along the frontier river, Reuter reports from Brussels. The European Commission, called in to defuse a bitter feud over the project, said the work should go on for now to avert the risk of flooding but that it had to stop by Nov 21. Environmentalists warned of a disaster as thousands of dead fish bobbed along Danube tributaries. Czechoslovakia said it would co-operate fully with the EC in the search for a solution.</p>

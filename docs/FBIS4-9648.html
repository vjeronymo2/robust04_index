			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bernard Besserglik] </F>   [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 28 (AFP) -- A group of special  foreign envoys held talks Thursday [28 April] with UN Bosnian  commander General Sir Michael Rose amid controversy over his  remarks castigating Bosnian Moslems for trying to drag the UN  into the war in Gorazde. Envoys from the United States, Russia  and Europe -- a special contact group which has been given a  week to look into ways of resuming the bogged down Bosnian peace  talks -- held talks with Rose, UN civil affairs coordinator for  Bosnia Viktor Andreyev and his counterpart for the whole  ex-Yugoslavia, Sergio Vieira de Mello, a spokeswoman said.  [passage omitted]    Envoys from the special contact group here were named as  Charles Redman and two assistants, Nick Lang and Hoyt Yee,  representing the United States, Alexey Nikiforov, deputy to  Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian envoy to former Yugoslavia, David  Manning and David Ludlow of Britain, Michael Steiner of Germany,  and French envoys Jean-Pierre Masse and Jacques-Alain de Sedouy.  The envoys had not yet drawn up an agenda. The Bosnian  authorities had been in touch for possible contacts, the  spokeswoman added. An UNPROFOR spokesman said earlier that the  envoys were operating individually and dispersing around the  city.    The envoys were also to travel to Pale, the Bosnian Serb  stronghold some 15 kilometres (10 miles) east of the city, for  talks with separatist leaders who hold 70 percent of Bosnian  territory and have proclaimed a breakaway republic. The  international community is attempting to create impetus for  negotiations following a NATO ultimatum that obliged Serb forces  to withdraw from the immediate vicinity of Gorazde and pull back  their heavy weapons to a distance of at least 20 kilometres.

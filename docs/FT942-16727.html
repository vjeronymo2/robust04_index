			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Development Securities buys portfolio of London properties Development Securities, the revamped Clayform Properties headed by Mr Martin Landau, the property entrepreneur, has acquired a Pounds 92m portfolio of primarily office properties. The company, which will assume Pounds 64m of debt with the portfolio, is raising Pounds 19.3m through a placement to partly fund the Pounds 29m net purchase price. Since Mr Landau joined the board of Development Securities last June, the company has issued Pounds 80m of new shares and built up net assets of Pounds 83m following this latest transaction. Mr Robert Ware, joint managing director, said: 'We're now at a size where we can grow organically.' He pointed out that the company would not issue more equity for at least a year. The latest purchase comprises 17 properties, mainly in the Greater London area. They currently produce net rental income of Pounds 7.3m, representing a yield of 7.9 per cent. Development Securities will pay Pounds 1m in cash and issue 10m shares at 30p. The remaining Pounds 22m will be paid via a loan note or cash. It paid Pounds 3m for an initial option on the properties, which were purchased from private companies controlled by Mr RJ Livingstone. The company will raise Pounds 18.3m net of expenses from the placement of 64.66m new shares, priced at 30p. There is a clawback for existing shareholders on a 3-for-10 basis.</p>

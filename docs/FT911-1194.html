			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Jefferson Smurfit There is obviously more to packaging than cardboard boxes. Ireland's biggest industrial company outperformed the bulk of its worldwide rivals on the trading front last year. But what stands out from yesterday's results is the impact of the previous year's complex financial restructuring in the US. The profit and loss account gains from a much reduced tax charge - 24 per cent instead of 41 per cent - and a small but creditable advance in earnings per share; the balance sheet remains awash with net cash and, due to deconsolidation, is unaffected by the Dollars 2.6bn of non recourse debt being supported by JSC. Smurfit's decision to lower its stake in North America was inspired mainly by fiscal and strategic considerations. The timing now looks pretty clever too, with IPounds 800m of cash extracted at the top of the cycle. The group is better balanced geographically as a consequence and is well placed to pick up new acquisitions while the paper industry is in the doldrums. This year will again be difficult and pre-tax profits and earnings - notwithstanding another relatively light tax charge - could be off by as much as 10 per cent. Smurfit's prospective multiple of just below 13 might seem a touch grudging. The company's financial wizardry, however, leaves just a lingering suspicion over the quality of earnings and the increase in shareholders' funds.</p>

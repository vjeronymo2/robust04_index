			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 170.02 regarding how specialists can ``reliquify'' a dealer position. When reliquifying, a specialist is reducing a large inventory position in order to be able to fully participate on the contra side of the market during periods of substantial buying or selling interest. The amended rule would permit a specialist, when reliquifying, to sell ``long'' inventory stock on a zero minus tick, or purchase stock to ``cover'' a ``short'' position on a zero plus tick, without Floor Official approval. In addition, the Amex proposes to amend Rule 170.02 to emphasize the specialist's affirmative role in providing stabilizing dealer participation to the marketplace, especially during periods of volatile or unusual market activity, involving significant price movement in a security, where reliquification may be required to facilitate the maintenance of a fair and orderly market. In this regard, Rule 170.02 would be amended on a one year pilot basis to provide that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Liquidations involving the principal selling of any <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  specialty stock on a direct minus tick, or the purchasing of such stock on a direct plus tick will require Floor Official approval, and should be effected only in conjunction with the specialist's re-entering the market on the opposite side of the market from the liquidating transaction where the imbalance indicates that the immediate succeeding transactions would result in a lower price following the sale (or higher price following the purchase). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During volatile or unusual market conditions involving significant price movement in a security, the specialist should re-enter the market following a liquidation transaction which was effected by selling stock on a direct minus or zero minus tick, or purchasing stock on a direct plus or zero plus tick and, at a minimum, participate as a dealer to the extent of his or her usual level of dealer participation in the subject security. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During such periods, a series of such liquidating transactions effected within a brief period of time should be accompanied by the specialist's re-entry in the market and effecting transactions which reflect a significant degree of dealer participation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange believes that its proposed amendments to Rule 170.02 will provide specialists with the ability to respond to periods of extreme market volatility, particularly those characterized by high volume and selling pressure, by permitting him or her to liquidate large dealer positions acquired as a result of such selling pressure. In addition, the Exchange believes that the amendments would reinforce the specialist's affirmative obligation to maintain a fair and orderly market by providing stabilizing dealer participation to the marketplace, and would reinforce his or her negative obligations in that a specialist would not be able to liquidate in the absence of a large dealer position, but could only do so if reasonably necessary to maintain a fair and orderly market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange proposes to implement the proposed rule change as a one-year pilot, and will monitor compliance with the requirements of the Rule through existing surveillance procedures. In particular, the Exchange stated that liquidation transactions effected by specialists on direct plus or minus destabilizing ticks will initially be reviewed as to whether the requisite Floor Official approval was obtained, and will be subjected to a further review with respect to the specialist's dealer participation levels, re-entry into the market in terms of timing and support, and whether the transactions were counter to the market trend. The Exchange stated that it would provide the Commission with a report summarizing the results of its surveillance prior to the conclusion of the pilot period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest, by enabling specialists to facilitate orderly and continuous markets during periods of unusual volatility of price changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with sections 6(b) (5) and 11 of the Act. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  The Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market, and, in general, protect investors and the public interest. The Commission also believes that the proposal is consistent with section 11(b) of the Act and Rule 11b&hyph;1 thereunder, <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  which allow exchanges to promulgate rules relating to specialists in order to maintain fair and orderly markets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f and 78k (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 240.11b&hyph;1 (1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

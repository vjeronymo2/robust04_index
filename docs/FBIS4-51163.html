			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, May 24 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese  delegate said here today China is expecting diplomatic relations  with Palau.    "China is willing to develop friendly relations and  cooperation with an independent Palau on the five principles of  mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual  non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal  affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence,"  said Zhang Yan, one of the Chinese delegates attending the 61st  session of the UN Trusteeship Council.    A target date of October 1, 1994 has been set for  implementation of the compact of free association between Palau  and its administering authority, the United States, the  Trusteeship Council was told by representatives of those two  governments as the council began today its sixty-first session.    According to the compact, which was signed by Palau and the  U.S. in 1982 but only approved last November, Palau will become  an independent and sovereign state.    Kuniwo Nakamura, president of Palau, said the next time  Palau  stood before the United Nations, he hoped it would do so as a  sovereign and independent country and as a member state.    Zhang Yan said China has all along supported the people of  the trust territories in their efforts for national  self-determination and their aspiration for national independent.    "The Chinese people cherish friendly sentiments towards the  Palau people, we are looking forward to Palau becoming an  independent member of the international community and embarking  on the road of economic development and building up the country  at an early date," he said.    Palau is situated in western Pacific, one of important  waterways to the Southeast Asia from the West.    Now it is the only one UN trusteeship land. In November,  1993, there was a successful plebiscite in Palau, which approved  the compact of free association.</p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUND DECISIONS ON WATER  </P> <P> Water wars do not always have to end in blood on the barroom floor with one  party, or more, sorely aggrieved. In recent weeks, there have been two notable  decisions that promise to end long, rancorous disputes with relative amity. One  is in Northern California, but is likely to have an effect on the entire state.  The other is in Nevada, but also is of interest to Californians. Each outcome  provides strong environmental protection while continuing necessary supplies to  traditional users.  </P> <P> In Alameda County, Superior Court Judge Richard A. Hodge relied heavily on the  state's evolving public-trust doctrine in reaching a preliminary decision on  conditions under which the East Bay Municipal Utilities District could import  water from the American River watershed to its Oakland-area service territory.  Although East Bay has had a contract with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation for  the water, environmental organizations and the County of Sacramento have  battled the utility in the courts for 17 years, wanting to force the diversion  from the Sacramento River rather than the American. The opponents contended the  project would severely deplete flows in the lower American, damaging fish and  wildlife and recreation opportunities. East Bay argued that the Sacramento  River -- from which Southern California gets much of its supplies -- was too  contaminated.  </P> <P> Hodge overruled the environmentalists by allowing East Bay to take the water  from the American. At the same time, however, he set strict flow standards that  prevent the utility from diverting any water during dry periods in order to  keep plenty of water in the river for spawning salmon and for recreational  uses. The judge discussed at length the merits of the public trust doctrine,  which was ratified by the state Supreme Court in the Audubon Society suit  against the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power over depletion of Mono  Lake. The doctrine provides that societal demands for water must be balanced by  protection of natural in-stream uses such as fisheries. While Hodge refused to  make the East Bay take water from the Sacramento River, where there was less  danger of environmental degradation, he said that the "public-trust doctrine  occupies an exalted position in any judicial or administrative determination of  water-resource allocation."  </P> <P> While neither side was entirely happy with the decision, both indicated they  could live with it. Further details are to be negotiated before the judge  renders a final decision.  </P> <P> The Nevada agreement, orchestrated by Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, appears to  settle court battles stretching back half a century over use of the Truckee  River, which rises at Lake Tahoe and ends in Pyramid Lake north of Reno. The  pact will provide water to the Pyramid Lake Indians to maintain their fishery,  which is a critical part of the tribe's economic base, and also will give the  Westpac utility new reservoir storage that will protect its service to the Reno  area during droughts. The Reno Gazette-Journal described the agreement as a  "truly monumental achievement."  </P> <P> Perhaps such cases will encourage other warring parties to see the benefits of  negotiation. In Alameda County, Judge Hodge said he hoped to produce a decision  that would allow all sides to declare victory. While he seemed to succeed in  that goal, he also achieved an even higher priority: "The intention of this  decision is to protect the river."  </P></p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / International Company News: Production cuts at Thyssen Stahl PRODUCTION cuts are intensifying at Thyssen Stahl, Germany's largest steel producer, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. Speaking at yesterday's annual meeting, Mr Heinz Kriwet, chairman of the Thyssen group, said sales for the steel division were 20 per cent lower for the five months ended February compared to the same period last year. Crude steel production fell by 22 per cent. But long products suffered the greatest setback with five-month production falling 50 per cent. The group will lay off 9,000 workers, mostly in its steel divisions, by the end of 1994 - up 1,000 from planned cuts announced earlier this year. Mr Kriwet said the principal cause of the European steel crisis was the continuing subsidies enjoyed by Italian and Spanish steel producers. He also blamed 'unfair' competition from east European producers. For the full Thyssen group, sales for five months fell by 10 per cent.</p>

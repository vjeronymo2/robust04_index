			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: European sector weakens as profit-taking continues Profit-taking continued to weigh on European government bond markets yesterday, and dealers said trading would remain range-bound and directionless until there were new fundamental factors to inspire them. Prices in Europe opened on a softer tone after US Treasuries had weakened overnight, and continued to slip throughout the day. However, 'there hasn't been a lot of selling pressure - we're in a consolidative phase,' said Mr Paul Campayne, bond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets, adding: 'The markets moved up sharply in a short period of time, and now they're taking a breather.' German government bonds once again set the pace, slipping by nearly 1/2 point after the December bund future breached key technical support at 90.50. It fell as low as 90.20 before closing around 90.42, down 0.40 point on the day. A break of the next key support level at 90.00 could open the way to 89.80 or lower, traders said. 'In the last two days, we've lost all the gains seen in the wake of the German elections,' said Mr Andre de Souza, international bond strategist at PaineWebber. 'Now we're awaiting M3 for further direction.' Rumours that September M3 money supply growth, expected to be published late this week or early next week, would not be as low as expected also made the market nervous. After an August growth rate of 8.2 per cent, analysts have been calling for a September rate between 6.9 per cent and 7.5 per cent. However, talk yesterday was of a number of about 8 per cent. 'In the wake of these rumours, a number below 7.5 per cent would probably support bunds,' said a dealer. UK gilts shadowed bunds lower yesterday, with profit-taking reinforced by slightly disappointing retail sales numbers. 'In the pre-auction phase disappointing news is often used as an excuse for the market to cheapen up,' said Mr Chris Anthony, gilt analyst at ABN Amro Hoare Govett. The Bank of England is due to auction Pounds 2.5bn of 8 per cent gilts due 2000 next Wednesday. Dealers reported some shifts by investors into the 10-year sector from the ultra-long end of the yield curve. Moreover, they said there had been active two-way dealings in the new gilt which is trading on a when-issued basis. While Swedish bonds eased in line with most other markets on continued profit-taking, most traders were looking to today's meeting of the new Riksbank policy-making council. 'Following the inflation report, the odds have shortened for a tightening at this meeting,' said Mr de Souza at PaineWebber. On Monday, the central bank published a report warning of rising inflationary pressures, and market participants have been gearing up for another interest rate hike in the coming weeks. US Treasury bonds gave ground yesterday in the face of a weak dollar and higher commodity prices. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/4 lower at 95 1/2 , with the yield rising to 7.887 per cent. On the short end, the two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 23/32 , to yield 6.636 per cent. The negative tone which had been established the previous session carried over into yesterday's opening. Bonds across the yield curve were showing modest losses before the Commerce Department's latest figures on trade. The report held no big surprises, but bonds failed to respond in kind. The August deficit in goods and services came in at Dollars 9.74bn, close to what economists had been forecasting. The figure represented a narrowing of July's trade gap, revised upward to Dollars 11.19bn. However, the data itself was less important to the bond market than its effect on the value of the dollar. Traders were worried that a weaker dollar would diminish the attraction of US-denominated securities. In the event, the US currency slipped against the D-Mark and the yen. There was concern that Japanese imports had reached record levels in August. A jump in commodity prices was no help to inflation-sensitive bonds, either. The KR-CRB index rose sharply on higher prices for meat, industrial products and precious metals. The late afternoon brought a favourable development, however. Traders were relieved to learn that the Treasury next week would auction Dollars 11bn in new five-year notes and Dollars 17.25bn in two-year securities, the normal size of such issues. Earlier, traders had feared the sale of an extra Dollars 1bn in five-year notes at a time when the market's ability to absorb the extra supply was questionable.</p>

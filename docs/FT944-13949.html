			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Late-closing bourses lose their early inspiration The dollar's inability to hold on to hard-won gains in Europe yesterday afternoon, and Wall Street's weak midsession after an encouraging start left late-closing bourses bereft of inspiration, writes Our Markets Staff. Most indications were that bourse turnover was low, or very low. It was described as 'pathetic' in some quarters. PARIS started the new account firmer but by the close had lost all the early gains as Wall Street and the dollar weakened. The CAC-40 index closed down 0.50 at 1,841.59, after a session high of 1,865.00. Turnover was about FFr2bn. Bollore Technologies rose FFr25.80 to FFr452.80 after a year's high, during the session, of FFr457.90. The diversified industrial group registered one of the day's best performances following news that it was to make a further round of asset sales worth FFr2bn, while some brokers moved to raise their recommendations on the stock. Hoare Govett noted that the group had been a beneficiary of a strong exposure to the economic recovery, while other brokers expected further outperformance as the company took firm restructuring measures in an effort to reduce its debt burden to some FFr4bn by the end of the year. Docks de France, the retail group, moved up FFr13 to FFr709 after announcing a gain in nine month sales to the end of September while, on the opposite tack, Accor dipped FFr21 to FFr509 ahead of today's first half figures which are expected to show a sharp fall. Axa, which is due to release its six month results tomorrow, slipped 50 centimes to FFr239. FRANKFURT steadied after last week's 4 per cent decline, the Dax index easing 3.16 higher to 2,025.38 in turnover down from DM7bn to DM4.7bn. The recovery was minimal compared with the session fall of 47.73, or 2.3 per cent last Friday, and it almost disappeared after hours; the Ibis-indicated Dax closed the afternoon at 2,022.64. Mr Jens Wiecking at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf noted that the dollar was relatively stable, that the bond market had traded in a narrow range and that inflation statistics from Baden Wurtemnberg and North Rhine Westphalia were regarded as good news. However, there was nothing really to enliven the market, and the main feature in blue chips was a selection including the big three chemicals, Deutsche and Bayernhypo in banks, and Linde and Preussag in engineers recovering some of last week's sector rotation losses with gains of 1 per cent and upwards. There was a bigger recovery in Weru, the window frame manufacturer, which rose DM45 to DM870; this followed a slide on broker downgrades from DM1130 last Tuesday. AMSTERDAM maintained its composure and the Aex index finished with a rise of 1.48 at 401.33. There was interest in DSM, up Fl 2.20 at Fl 144.00, ahead of third quarter results due next Monday. Reviewing the group's prospects, Goldman Sachs said that it had raised its nine month forecast for the company to Fl 290m, compared with a loss of Fl 24m in the same 1993 period. Another chemical group, Akzo Nobel, due to report on November 2, added 10 cents to Fl 202.70. Goldman commented that the shares had been underperforming the market recently on worries that a major shareholder might sell stock after November 7 when a 'standstill agreement' expires. Nedlloyd remained unsettled following Friday's 4 per cent fall with the shares rising to Fl 49.80 before closing off 40 cents at Fl 48.50. ZURICH, closing earlier than Paris, or Frankfurt's Ibis system, was lifted by renewed interest in dollar-sensitive shares and the SMI index closed 16.6 higher at 2,625.2. Among chemical shares, Ciba-Geigy rose SFr17 to SFr737; brokers called this a technical rebound and pointed, too, to support from SBC's launch of a new series of covered warrants on Ciba registered stock. Union Bank led active stocks with a rise of SFr11 to SFr1,250 while, in insurers, Winterthur rose SFr17 to SFr644 and Swiss Re by SFr13 to SFr748. MILAN made modest forward progress, but traders suggested that the gains were mainly due to technical trading and volume remained low. The Comit index closed up 4.30 at 621.79. Fiat, depressed by speculative selling last Friday, recovered L105 to L6,135. Brokers saw buying among telecommunications stocks, with Telecom Italia rising L155 to L4,070 and Stet L115 to L4,495. RAS, the insurance group, lost L180 to L18,910 ahead of a press conference today. MADRID's heavy weighting in banks and utility stocks stood it in good stead for once, the general index closing 0.10 higher at 293.24; but turnover was only Pta11.9bn, one of the lowest figures this year, and brokers said that the day's performance was no measure of sentiment in a market which is still generally bearish. Santander led banks with a rise of Pta60 to Pta4,980 while the obviously weak links were in construction where Cubiertas fell Pta320 to Pta7,900 and Uralita Pta25 to Pta1,285. ISTANBUL fell 3.6 per cent, the composite index losing 898.38 at 23,905.07 as expectations for a rate rise in today's three-month T-bill auction, and fears of higher foreign currency prices ahead of Wednesday's L29,000bn bond maturity discouraged buyers. WARSAW's recent pessimism was strengthened by Friday's decision by the lower house of parliament to introduce a 0.3 per cent stock transaction tax from January. The Wig index fell 341.2, or 3.8 per cent to 8,637.8.

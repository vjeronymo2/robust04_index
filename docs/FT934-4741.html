			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Huntingdon falls to Pounds 8.79m Severe price competition and weak demand in some areas saw pre-tax profits at Huntingdon International, the life sciences and engineering services company, fall from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 8.79m in the year to September 30. The board remained confident about long term prospects but expected 1994 to be another difficult year. Earnings growth in the second half of 1993 was unlikely to continue through the first quarter of 1994. A maintained final dividend of 1.9p is proposed for an unchanged total of 2.775p. Earnings fell to 7.4p (11.5p). Sales, net of subcontracting costs, rose to Pounds 156.1m (Pounds 139.8m). Operating profits were Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 16.7m). Mr Christopher Cliffe, finance director, said the company had endured 'one of the most difficult years in its history'. There was a Pounds 3m exceptional charge for restructuring the US engineering and environmental business which forced the company to make a trading statement in March. However, the company's strongest business, life sciences, had seen growth in confirmed contracts net of cancellations for the first time in three years. The division had resisted price pressure, margins had held up and even improved, Mr Cliff said. The first full year contribution from Travers Morgan, the construction-related project management company bought in December 1991, had been struck during a year of survival in the midst of fierce competition in its largest UK market. Net debt rose to Pounds 44.5m (Pounds 39.7m) partly because of the large amount denominated in dollars. Gearing at the year end was 69.9 per cent (70.9 per cent). For the second year in a row the company saw a net cash outflow, of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 4.6m). In 1992 Huntingdon paid Pounds 11m for Travers Morgan.</p>

			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Looking to the long term - The Professional / Joanna Slaughter sums up her series on private client fund managers The investment managers profiled over the past 10 weeks differ on asset allocation, stock-picking, the use of derivatives and the management of a private client relationship. But none would dissent from the view that Big is Beautiful. Indeed, size is their most seductive sales pitch. Certainly, it bestows benefits that more modest investment houses cannot provide. There is much advantage to be had in pointing out that the portfolio managers who look after private clients draw on the same research and global investment resources as the managers who run billions of pounds of institutional money. Size also provides a great degree of security for the assets of private clients, along with capital resources for the systems and manning levels needed to provide customers with the attention they want. After all, those who go to the investment equivalent of Savile Row expect both a bespoke suit of financial clothes and first-class service. Accordingly, many of the largest firms are able to devote considerable resources to matching the client to the fund manager, and to ensuring that an administrator is a lead player in the private client team, not a tail-end Charlie. As David Rosier, the chairman of Mercury Asset Management (the investment management arm of the SG Warburg Group), put it: 'People can understand that you don't always get that extra bit of performance, but they can't understand if you don't spell their name right or if they don't receive their dividend cheques.' Although the investment styles of the large fund management firms vary, private clients will find that a top-down investment approach is common. Most managers view the right asset allocation as central to managing portfolios - and asset allocation processes are highly disciplined. The investment management of private client portfolios also tends to be controlled tightly, and many management firms run white and black lists of stocks. The freedoms allowed to individual managers within these lists vary but, overall, most firms might well agree that their investment style was long-term, cautious and conservative. Although portfolio management starts from the premise that the client is king, not all firms allow their clients to be absolute monarchs. Indeed, in flexibility, some of the blue-chip investment management outfits compare badly with more modest rivals. Some accept clients only on a discretionary basis, and the use of collective funds for overseas and specialist investments is universal. At Schroder, any private client with less than Pounds 500,000 is directed to the Schroder World Fund unit trust, and assets of Pounds 2m are needed for a managed portfolio of equities. Of course, controlled investment management, underpinned by huge research capability, is of little benefit unless it produces performance - but relative performance is not easy to gauge with bespoke portfolios. Alastair Begg, chief investment officer of Kleinwort Benson Investment Manager, says: 'There is no answer that is likely to be right for more than one client.' Some managers run model portfolios, however, and firms increasingly are offering a unit trust that replicates the portfolio of a private client portfolio. This fund acts both as a shop window for the firm's investment skills and a way of appealing to the smaller investor market. The big question is whether the intimate relationship between client and manager; the services offered; and the investment results achieved by the private client division of a huge investment house are enough to justify what are, in some cases, very high minimum investment requirements and stiff management fees. Certainly, exclusivity can come at a price that only a niche market of investors can afford. Tim Keown, director of Pounds 125m Ely Fund Managers, points out that many of the leading investment managers are declining to consider large numbers of private clients if they are looking for managed portfolios of equities. Keown adds: 'There is a large chunk of the private client market where the average family or individual has investment capital of Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 400,000. They want a discretionary service and a genuinely reliable personal relationship at partnership level.' In the main, that certainly is not the market that the big investment managers are chasing. They want to attract more investors into their unit trusts; but most believe that future expansion of their private client numbers will come from 'new' money - the fruits of entrepreneurial activity  -and from overseas clients.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Investment managers: factfile  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Portfolio Manager    Minimum portfolio    Minimum                      investment           annual fee                      (pounds '000s)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Schroders            2,000                20,000 Mercury                300                 2,000 BZW                    250                 1,500 discretionary                                            2,000 advisory Kleinwort Benson       200                 1,500 Fleming                100                 1,500 fee basis                                              250 discretionary,                                                  commission basis Cazenove             No fixed minimum            commission basis Barings              No fixed minimum     10,000 James Capel            100                   750 Rothschild             500                 5,000 Credit Suisse          100                 1,000  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Portfolio Manager    Private client funds                      under management                      (pounds m)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Schroders            1,300 Mercury              2,900 BZW                  1,300                      1,300 Kleinwort Benson     2,600 Fleming              2,700                      2,700 Cazenove             3,000 Barings              2,300 James Capel          4,500 Rothschild             694 Credit Suisse        1,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

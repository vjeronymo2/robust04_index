			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Arts: The Lion - Fringe theatre Another political play has opened on London in the last few days, apart from David Hare's The Absence of War, and is much more fun. For all its liveliness, it is no less serious than the work at the Royal National Theatre. The Lion, by the Guyana-born Michael Abbensetts, is about a deposed Caribbean despot in exile in England called Ramsay James. After independence, he was first prime minister of his island, then president for life before his fall in a coup. Since he was educated at an English university, he is not exactly a stranger in the land to which he returns. James (Stefan Kalipha) is a ranter and a raver, an opportunist who has ultimately sought to stamp out the opposition, also English-educated, by force. Measured by the standards of some third world leaders, the portrait of him is probably too kind. He is accused of killing 19 people, though he has acted indirectly through his bodyguard, Hendricks. The bodyguard, played by David Webber, is a wonderful figure who practises obeah (a form of voodoo) but is equally at home in more conventional methods of applying the frighteners. There is also an illegitimate daughter left behind by James in England and an estranged (very black) wife who has become rich with at least three elegant houses. But forget about the plot. The remarkable fact about The Lion is the style. It is almost entirely English, adapted for the Caribbean. The principal influence is Noel Coward. The rich black lady imperiously played by Madge Sinclair could step straight out of one of his works. It is drawing room comedy which towards the end turns more into a thriller. No-one should say you cannot make jokes about race or degrees of black and whiteness. The Lion is full of them, and very funny a predominantly ethnic audience found them. Equally appreciated are the jokes about third world dictatorship and a lust for power. There are snipes at Britain too. The exiled prime minister is quite used to turning up at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for talks with intelligence. He lies to them, they lie to him, he says. But when the FCO decides he has no chance of returning to power, he is dropped and becomes 'just another black man'. A more moving line comes from a young black who was born here. 'I'm a black Briton,' he says. 'But what are you to the British?' comes the response from another black. Directed by Horace Ove, the performance on the first night by the Talawa Theatre Company was slightly under-rehearsed; by this week, however, The Lion should look like a winner. Cochrane Theatre until October 23. (071) 242 7040</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Bosnians agree safe passage for aid LEADERS of the three warring factions in Bosnia yesterday promised to end interference with United Nations humanitarian aid supplies on which over 3m people depend for survival. They signed a 'joint and solemn commitment' to allow safe passage for UN convoys, after Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, called them to Geneva in what was described as a 'last ditch' effort to unblock the UN aid effort in Bosnia. This has been increasingly paralysed by fierce fighting between Bosnian Croats and mainly Moslem government forces in central Bosnia, and by deliberate attempts on the part of all sides to hinder supplies getting through, including attacks on UN workers. The UNHCR has also been concerned at the refusal of local militias to let through clothes, fuel and shelter materials. The accord calls for a suspension of hostilities along aid supply routes when convoys are passing, free and unconditional access to the best routes, safety for UN and other humanitarian workers, the right of the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross to decide what supplies should go to whom, and respect for international humanitarian law. At a news conference afterwards, Mrs Ogata described the accord as 'the minimum' required to avert disaster this winter, but added that without peace 'I don't know whether a humanitarian catastrophe can be avoided'. Mindful of the many broken promises in the past, she earlier told the meeting she was 'not asking for new promises, but for deeds'. The accord was signed by Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and Mr Mate Boban, for the Bosnian Croats, who were accompanied by senior military commanders. The high commissioner said that, significantly, it was the first time all three parties had signed a joint assurance on security for aid deliveries. Mrs Ogata said she would immediately recommend a resumption of UN aid convoys into central Bosnia, suspended nearly four weeks ago after a Danish driver was killed and nine other UN personnel wounded in what seems to have been a deliberate attack by Bosnian Moslem forces. In a toughly worded opening address to the meeting, which was also attended by the head of the ICRC, Mrs Ogata told the Bosnian leaders that they alone bore the responsibility for the suffering in their country.</p>

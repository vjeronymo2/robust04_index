			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SOUND OF BRITISH CHURCH BELLS FADES  </P> <P> The sound of Sunday church bells in Britain is fading.  </P> <P> A survey published Sunday showed that a third of the nation's church bells do  not peal on the Sabbath because modern distractions have taken a toll among  those trained to ring them.  </P> <P> About 400,000 Britons know the ropes of bell-ringing but only 40,000 still pull  them, said the study commissioned by the Central Council of Church Bell  Ringers.  </P> <P> "When I learned to ring 35 years ago there was not much else to do in the  village where I lived," said Ron Johnston, a university professor who carried  out the survey.  </P> <P> "The church was a closer-knit community, and if you were a bell-ringer you felt  obliged to turn up," he said.  </P></p>

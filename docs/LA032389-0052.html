			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR FAMILY TREE!: MYERS COMES FROM MANY SOURCES  </P> <P> Question: Could you tell me something about the surname Myers? I know that many  people of different nationalities have this name, but my line came from  Maryland and I have them traced back to the early 1800s.  </P> <P> Answer: You are correct about the name having several origins. However, Myers  or Myer frequently came from Germany. It means an overseer or head servant and  later meant a farmer -- thus its popularity as a surname. It also is an English  surname, sometimes spelled Mires. It derived there as a locality surname  meaning "at the mire (swampy, low-lying land, or bog)." In England it was a  north-English surname. In America, the name could have come from ancestors from  this area in England or from German or German-Jewish ancestors.  </P> <P> In Jewish names with a combination of "Meyer," such as Meyeroff, they are  usually an elaborated form of Meir (meaning "light" in Hebrew, according to  some sources). Some forms of this surname would be: Meyerfeld, Meyerheim,  Meyers, Meyerstein, Meyerhardt and Meyersicht; many may have been shortened to  Meyer. According to Dan Rottenberg in his "Finding Our Fathers, A Guidebook to  Jewish Genealogy," he lists Meyers, Meier, Meyerowitz, Meierovics, Meyerson,  Myer, Myers, Myerson and Meir as Ashkenazi names taken from the Hebrew word for  "wise" or "scholarly."  </P> <P> Q: I am interested in finding an authentic copy of my family coat of arms.  Could you recommend a reputable company from which I could obtain this?  </P> <P> A: Coats of arms were not granted to families, but rather to individuals and  only diligent research and careful documentation will determine whether you are  entitled to such. The Augustan Society, P.O. Box P, Torrance, Calif.  90507-0210, offers a search of coats of arms for a fee of $15. You will need to  know the name and the primary residency.  </P> <P> The research department of this society will make photocopies of as many  references as found to arms for individuals bearing the surname you give, but  it will not undertake to prove your genealogical connection to the individuals  who have borne the arms of any it locates.  </P> <P> There are several commercial companies that market reproductions of coats of  arms to Americans. However, just because there is a coat of arms with the same  surname as yours does not mean that you are related to the person who bore  those arms.  </P></p>

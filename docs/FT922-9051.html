			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Travel: Toasting the dead at the end of the earth - Nicholas Woodsworth finds a warm welcome among the fearsome Svans of Georgia WHEN NINO Ivanishvili was 18 and studying English at the University of Tiblisi, she spent her summer vacation in an isolated village high in the Caucasus mountains. It was here, one sunny afternoon, that she was kidnapped by a young man driven half-mad by the sight of her bathing in a nearby mountain stream. Without knowing it, throughout the summer Nino had been under the constant observation of the son of one of the peasant families in the village, a young man of few words and strong passions. Normally she would have been safe from such attentions, for the code of social conduct in these mountains is strong. But this is also an area of fierce and enduring blood feuds. The fact that Nino was the guest of a family engaged in a vendetta with the young man's family made her fair game and an object worthy of theft. Had it not been that Nino's screams were heard by her hosts as the young man threw her on to a horse and galloped into the hills, Nino today might be a mountain man's unwilling wife rather than a professional translator. A mounted chase ensued, rifle fire was exchanged, and the young man eventually relinquished his prize and retreated. Nino subsequently made a rapid return to the city. 'What is the name of the place where this happened?', I asked Nino when she had finished telling me this story one afternoon not long ago. We were sitting in a gloomy restaurant off an exhaust-choked street in Tiblisi. For months the Georgian capital had been an unhappy place, beset by political violence, shortages and insecurity. But up above the level of the street, over the smog and strained faces, I could see a serene blue sky, and imagined it set against snow and high mountain passes. 'It is called Svaneti', she replied. 'It is far into the Caucasus, and very difficult to get to. There probably isn't even enough petrol available these days to get there.' Immediately I wanted to go to Svaneti, and persuaded Nino to take me there, petrol or no petrol. Anywhere where such reckless, medieval robbery could still take place must, I reasoned, be well worth a visit. Svaneti, in the high Caucasus of north-western Georgia, is indeed a remote and inaccessible area, and it took us 14 spine-jarring hours in a Russian-built jeep to get there. We were not the first to go by motorised vehicle - rough, unpaved roads first began replacing mountain trails there in the late 1930s - but Svaneti continues to be four-wheel-drive country, the wildest and least developed region in the trans-Caucasus. In fact, what little I had been able to pick up about the Svans, a proud and fiercely independent people with a reputation for violence, left me hoping that 50 years of socialism had at least had some calming effect on their character. Certainly pre-communist Svans had little liking for outsiders. In the late 19th century, I learned, Puta Dadeshkeliani, a feudal lord from the Georgian lowlands, foolishly tried to extend his influence into Svaneti. The Svans invited him to a meeting in front of one of their churches, whereupon the entire congregation helped pull a string attached to the trigger of a rifle, thus giving each present the pleasure of killing the intruder. Perhaps the Svans had been right to resist foreign intrusion; Soviet socialism has left ugly traces on the face of Georgia. Heading westward over the plains towards the Black Sea, we drove past factories where chimneys belched toxic green smoke on to adjacent vineyards, past concrete housing developments hunkering in the middle of vegetable plots, past state co-operatives where cannibalised tractors and farm machinery littered the fields. But communism has had a tougher time making marks on one of the world's great mountain ranges. From the sub-tropical plantation town of Zugdidi, near the Black Sea coast, we saw the Caucasus rise with little warning, dark and massive, above citrus groves and long alleys of tea bushes. Half-an-hour later we were into the hills, and had left the world of socialist reconstruction behind. This is a wild, rough land. The higher we climbed, the more rugged and unfinished-looking the mountains became. 15,000 ft summits left the road in shadow. Boulders the size of houses were strewn through river valleys. Great chunks of fallen mountainside sat battered and raw at the bottom of deep canyons. Wherever wide swathes of pine forest had been knocked down by avalanches, bare rock and torn soil lay exposed. In the Caucasus, it seems as if the work of creation is still in process. Even the people we passed had a rough, primitive air. Riding stocky Caucasian ponies, their bristly, unshaven faces surmounted by caps of brown felt, the men looked like brigands. Their women, dressed in black woollen skirts, trudged along the roadside bent double under the weight of heavy backpacks. Some of the locals, apparently, had not even discovered the wheel, or at least disdained its use - they were dragging tons of firewood along the muddy road on sleds of heavy wooden runners. 'What are those shrines?', I shouted to Nino as the jeep bucketed round hairpin bends under the direction of Otar, our maniacal Georgian driver. I pointed to a curious roadside construction, something like a telephone box, where inside, on a little shelf, I could see a framed photo, flowers, a bottle and two glasses. 'They mark places where people have been killed in road accidents', Nino shouted back. 'When friends or family pass by, they stop and toast the dead with a drink.' Judging by the number of shrines and empty bottles piled beside them, crashing cars and toasting the dead are equally popular activities in these mountains. Upwards through the Svan homeland we drove, until we could drive no further, and stopped at Ushguli. At 7,200 ft it is the highest permanently inhabited village in Europe, and feels like the end of the earth. The 19th century English traveller Douglas Freshfield described the Svans as 'the most savage and dangerous-looking set of people I have ever come across.' Entering Svan villages, he encountered inhabitants who, 'yelling and jabbering, barred the way, while others brandished swords, daggers and pistols.' But unlike Puta Dadeshkeliani or Douglas Freshfield, we skidded up through the manure-sodden lanes of Ushguli unarmed and without hostile intent. In return, the villagers brandished nothing at us but smiles. In no time at all we were comfortably installed in a kitchen full of the odours of good things cooking, and warming ourselves with the help of a cast-iron stove and glasses of mead made from alpine honey. Our host, Kolia Nijaradze, may have looked like a wild-eyed bandit, but a rough demeanour hid only a gentle cattle farmer. Perhaps it is their demanding environment that makes the Svans look so tough. Winters in Svaneti last eight months, with temperatures often dipping below -30`C. Snowfalls are extremely heavy. When a Svanetian tells you he is frequently cut off from the outside world, he does not merely mean that the roads are blocked, but that he cannot get out of his front door. Snow is sometimes so deep that the houses of Ushguli disappear entirely. In times like these, and when avalanches roar down the slopes of the surrounding mountains, Svanetians retreat to their 100-ft watchtowers. Built in the middle ages of granite and slate, the strength of the watchtowers remains something of a mystery. Russian chemical engineers analysing the composition of Svaneti mortar claim egg yolk was an essential ingredient. But Soviet science was never able to explain how the Svans managed to amass enough eggs to build over 60 of these tall towers. Now it never will. But if the Svans lead a rigorous life in their mountain fastness, their isolation has given them a special attitude to the rare visitors who do happen by. Caucasian medieval tradition has it that guests come from God, and should be treated accordingly. If family feuding ranks high in the Caucasian code of honour, generosity, friendship and hospitality towards strangers ranks even higher. The only real danger a visitor to Svaneti runs is cholesterol over-dose from the food and drink with which he is plied from morning to night. The sun shone, the birds sang, the snow above us glittered in the thin mountain air. Nino, Otar and I wandered among the cows and goats scattered on the alpine pastures surrounding the village. We climbed watchtowers and visited the church where Puta Dadeshkeliani came to a sticky end. We gorged ourselves on a suckling pig killed in our honour. We listened to stories about bear hunting, mountain trout fishing and killer avalanches. We were toasted in vodka that ran like water. We sang Georgian counterpoint in three-part harmony. We did, in fact, just about everything that pleased us, with one exception. When Otar and I suggested a swim in the clear mountain stream that ran through the hills not far from the village, Nino, for reasons of her own, declined to join us.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Hypo-Bank in one-for-10 issue BAYERISCHE Hypotheken-und Wechsel Bank, the Bavarian bank, is making a one-for-10 rights issue to raise DM678m (Dollars 406.6m). The new shares are being issued at DM350, compared with a closing price yesterday of DM451. The Hypo-Bank said the decision to go ahead with the issue had been taken following a year of strong growth in both profits and business volume. The bank will publish its full figures for 1992 in two weeks. In December it reported that partial operating profits - which exclude income from own-account trading - had climbed by 23.2 per cent to DM1.27bn in the first 10 months of the year.</p>

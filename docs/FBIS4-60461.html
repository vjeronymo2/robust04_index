			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] General Antoine Lahd, accompanied by Israeli  North Region Commander General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, Ground Army  Commander Emmanuel Saqr, and Liaison Unit Commander Gabi  Ashkenazi, visited al-Bayyadah yesterday to wish a happy 'Id  al-Adha to Druze religious leaders. General Lahd hoped the next  year will bring happiness and peace and that all foreign armies,  including the Israeli and Syrian armies, will withdraw from  Lebanon. But he noted that the Israelis are deployed on a  particular part of the Lebanese territory for their security  needs. The objectives and motives of the Syrians are known to  all.    Mordekhay offered his 'Id congratulations and said that the  region is enjoying security, thanks to the efforts of its sons,  especially members of the South Lebanese Army. He said the  Israeli soldiers have been ordered to be careful after  information that sabotage elements are trying to kidnap them.  He said he currently has no information about any specific  reaction by the sabotage organizations in Lebanon to the  kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani. He said the Israeli Army is  prepared for any eventuality. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Empirical issue in need of research Sir, Does Michael Prowse ('Market v state in Education', May 16) really think that Financial Times readers are unfamiliar with the simple textbook theory as to why markets work best, so that we need a patronising fable about books to explain it to us? To be able to say, as Prowse does, that 'greater choice of school is indisputably a good thing', one must be embracing a myriad of assumptions about information, externalities, economies of scale, income distribution, accompanying social policies and so on. All of these are questionable. Let's be frank: most people want a good school round the corner from their home, not a theoretical choice of 100 schools, especially when the transport implications of going anywhere but the nearest of them rule most out, and when the good schools have no space and so in reality they choose their pupils (and parents) rather than the other way round. So in order to work, the choice argument has to claim that, by offering choice and competition, not only will the average level of education rise, but we will not end up with a split between geographically concentrated good schools and sink schools. It must also be shown that the effort made by schools to differentiate their product (maybe no more than school versions of advertising - a largely deadweight cost to the economy) and the search costs that must be undergone by parents are all outweighed by the anticipated benefits. As in so many other areas, these issues must surely be empirical ones that should be opened up to piloting and research - like the OECD study of parental choice of schools. Simple ideology based on hopeful models of how the real world works may suit Prowse, but should not sway serious policy makers.

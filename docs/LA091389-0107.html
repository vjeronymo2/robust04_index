			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREVIEW;  </P> <P> INTER-LEAGUE CONFRONTATIONS HOLD THE LIKELY KEY  </P> <P> For the majority of the decade, with respect to City Section 4-A Division  football in the Valley, two teams have been as immovable as Jimmy Johnson's  hair. Granada Hills and San Fernando, a combined 110-67-3 in the 1980s, usually  finish the season wrestling Carson and Banning in the playoffs while other area  teams are spending Friday night at home fiddling with the remote control.  </P> <P> Heading into the second season of Northwest Valley Conference play -- an  eight-team alignment composed of 4-A teams in the North Valley and West Valley  leagues -- the power brokers remain in firm control. And the rest? Even though  three teams from each league qualify for the playoffs, most still feel like  hounds fighting for scraps at the dinner table.  </P> <P> Taft Coach Tom Stevenson, throwing Kennedy into the equation, concedes that the  North Valley League's terrible triumvirate should again whomp and stomp its way  into the postseason. Last season, Taft finished 2-2 against North Valley foes.  A repeat performance is unlikely, Stevenson said.  </P> <P> "For anybody to split against the other side is a great goal, but it's not very  realistic," he said. "The Big Three -- Granada, Fernando and Kennedy -- are  just far above the rest of us."  </P> <P> Stevenson said last month that any team that emerged as a West Valley contender  would have to play .500 ball against North Valley teams. He has since redefined  his objectives. His new goal? To beat teams that are, well, in the same league.  </P> <P> "It would be great if we went 2-2 against them, as we did last year," he said.  "But I think we have to be more concerned about beating the teams in our own  league."  </P> <P> A West Valley inferiority complex is understandable. Granada Hills and San  Fernando were a combined 12-2 against the rest of the conference and 7-1  against the West Valley during the regular season in '88. Because league  records include games against conference opponents, it's no small wonder  coaches in the West Valley just want to break even without breaking their  necks.  </P> <P> Only Taft (6-5) had a winning overall record. Cleveland, El Camino Real and  Canoga Park were a combined 16-24 overall.  </P> <P> Taft, which won the league title with a 25-22 victory over Cleveland in the  regular-season finale, was bombed by Dorsey, 37-7, in the first round of the  playoffs. Cleveland, which finished second, was beaten, 27-17, in the first  round by Kennedy. Third-place El Camino Real was beaten by San Fernando, 16-0,  in the first round.  </P> <P> Playing the role of the scrappy upstart appeals to at least one coach, though.  </P> <P> "It's an attitude you have to take," said Cleveland Coach Steve Landress, whose  team pulled off the conference upset of the year when it beat eventual North  Valley champion San Fernando, 20-10, on the road. "They all have excellent  coaching and an abundance of speed and talent. If we were in the 3-A, we'd be  an instant contender, but I like playing the good teams.  </P> <P> "But with those teams, it's like fighting Tyson -- there's always the chance  you'll get knocked out before you break a sweat."  </P> <P> Yet while West Valley coaches generally expect the North Valley dominance to  continue, they also believe West Valley teams, as a group, are stronger this  season.  </P> <P> Cleveland lost All-City selection Sean Burwell but replaces him with Pat  Bryant, an All-City baseball player. Landress says that Bryant is as good as  any player he has ever coached, which covers a lot of ground. Landress coached  Washington State running back Steve Broussard when both were at Manual Arts  High. Broussard led the Pacific 10 Conference in rushing last season.  </P> <P> Cleveland also has considerable size up front, and three-year letterman Curtis  Hudson (6-foot-1, 255 pounds) is the anchor. The Cavaliers are also  well-stocked at linebacker with starters Frank Diana and Will Johnson  returning.  </P> <P> Taft's chances of repeating received a shot in the arm over the summer when two  talented transfers entered the picture. Irving Carter, a transfer from Antelope  Valley, is expected to help replace graduated running back Kelvin Byrd (1,480  yards, 13 touchdowns). Linebacker-wide receiver Darnell Hendrix, a transfer  from Jefferson, might be the best all-around player in the league.  </P> <P> Taft is also set at linebacker with returning starters Greg Bernard and Steve  Lockridge, who will be joined by Hendrix. Taft's main hurdle: no returning  starters on the offensive line for a team whose trademark is its up-the-gut  ground game.  </P> <P> Unquestionably, the league's best quarterback is Dave Erhardt of Canoga Park  who passed for 795 yards last year and made quite an impact on opposing  coaches.  </P> <P> "Any time you can throw the ball like he can," El Camino Real co-Coach Mike  Maio said, "you can equalize a lot of stuff."  </P> <P> Canoga Park is also a year older and wiser, Coach Rudy Lugo said.  </P> <P> "Last year, I knew we were in for some tough times," he said. "We only had five  returning starters and we'd just been moved up to the 4-A level. We're still a  young team with some real raw skill, but we'll be more competitive.  </P> <P> "When you have a quarterback that throws as well as Dave does and is as good an  athlete as he is, you can score any place, any time."  </P> <P> El Camino Real won four games last season, more than in its three previous  seasons combined. After years of struggling with low-player turnout, there has  been an upturn, although the Conquistadores are not a team large in stature.  </P> <P> Any move toward the playoffs will be led by skill-position players and defense.  Jamal Anderson and Lejon Carr return at running back and Ryan Marine also will  play in the backfield. Kennard Durr gives the team outside speed at receiver.  Quarterbacks Tony Bordwell and Evan Howland are new, but at least they are  members of a large league fraternity: Taft and Cleveland also will start  untested quarterbacks.  </P> <P> Juniors Troy Snyder and Chris Griggs, both returning starters, are back at  linebacker, which seems to be a league strong point.  </P> <P> Anyone for predictions?  </P> <P> Said Landress: "It's flattering that some people think we're the team to beat .  . . But I kind of like Canoga."  </P> <P> Said Maio: "If everything goes like everyone says, I'd say it's up for grabs. I  don't see any team being as dominant as last year."  </P> <P> Said Lugo: "Taft is pretty good and Cleveland always has good size . . . At  this point, I'd say it's anybody's league."  </P> <P> Said Stevenson: "Actually, if a couple of things work out like I hope they do,  I like our chances."  </P> <P> Hmmm. Disparity in the conference, parity in the league. Could be a close race.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WEST VALLEY LEAGUE  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.66IN:2.00IN:2.88IN:2.88IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL

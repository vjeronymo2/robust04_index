			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS / SIERRA MADRE CITY COUNCIL;  </P> <P> 7 CANDIDATES SHARE SINGLE VIEW ON MOST ISSUES  </P> <P> Residents of this small town of 11,000 may find it hard to choose among the  seven candidates for three City Council seats.  </P> <P> All seven candidates in the April 10 election vow to protect the hillsides from  development but to preserve private-property rights. All seven pledge to boost  downtown revitalization but keep the small-town atmosphere. All seven want city  services improved but not at the cost of higher taxes. And all seven believe  Orange Grove Boulevard along the Arcadia-Sierra Madre border should be repaired  but not widened as proposed by Arcadia officials.  </P> <P> "Most of the views are the same on the major issues," candidate Richard Freeman  said at a recent political forum. "It's not really an election that can be won  or lost on our views of the issues since they're not too different."  </P> <P> Still, all the candidates have been gamely attending fried-chicken lunches and  Women's Club forums, most of them devoid of political controversy or  excitement. Thus, winners this year may be those who succeed in presenting  themselves as more qualified, sincere, dedicated and informed on city issues  than their opponents.  </P> <P> By these criteria, incumbent Clem Bartolai, 53, may be a front-runner.  Bartolai, an administrative manager for J. B. Engineering in Monrovia and a  30-year Sierra Madre resident, was elected to the council in 1980 and in 1986.  He has also served on the city's Parks and Recreation and Planning commissions.  </P> <P> Bartolai stresses his accessibility to voters. As a councilman, he said, he  initiated a hillside building moratorium, worked to get a gate installed on the  Chantry Flats road to cut down on late-night traffic entering the Angeles  National Forest and supported hiring a full-time city employee to enforce  building codes. He estimates he has raised $2,500, the largest amount of any  candidate so far.  </P> <P> Bartolai is the only incumbent in the race. Mayor Bruce Crow and Councilwoman  Lisa Fowler are not seeking re-election. The top three finishers in the April  10 election will join the City Council, which will elect a new mayor from among  its five members.  </P> <P> Gary Adams, 50, a 22-year Sierra Madre resident, also may have an edge. Adams  has been elected before, to the City Council in 1976 and to the Pasadena City  College board of trustees in 1980. Early fund-raising garnered him $1,150,  according to his Feb. 27 campaign disclosure statement.  </P> <P> Adams, general manager of 49er Shops Inc., at Cal State Long Beach, holds a  master's degree and doctorate in public administration from USC. He said his  blend of education and business experience gives him an understanding of how to  run the city in a businesslike fashion.  </P> <P> Freeman, 27, vice president of sales and marketing for San Diego-based Boat  Kare Products Inc., is making his first run for political office. He is trying  a rare approach to politicking, accepting no campaign contributions and  promising to spend no money. Instead, he urges voters to donate the money they  would give to candidates to charities or churches. The 12-year Sierra Madre  resident hopes to convince voters that he is sincere and dedicated. Like  Bartolai, he stresses his accessibility.  </P> <P> MaryAnn MacGillivray, 42, marketing vice president and founder of Health Craft  International Inc. of Pasadena, is also a political newcomer. She said she will  run a low-budget campaign of less than $1,000.  </P> <P> An 18-year Sierra Madre resident, she has been a frequent speaker at City  Council meetings, where she has supported protecting the hillsides against  development. MacGillivray believes the city's administrative procedures should  be streamlined and efficient and the city's recreational, cultural and  educational facilities improved to establish a "high community profile' for  Sierra Madre.  </P> <P> Stockbroker Larry Peal, 45, a 21-year Sierra Madre resident, despite being a  political newcomer, speaks with ease on a variety of local issues. They include  improving communication between the council and city management; revamping the  city's unpopular proposed tree-trimming ordinance to apply only to new  projects; and limiting the number of new city ordinances, which he believes are  overburdening city workers. He estimates he will spend $450 on the campaign,  with some family contributions of services. Peal is vice president of A. G.  Edwards in Pasadena.  </P> <P> Aksel Pedersen, 60, a 23-year Sierra Madre resident, is making his first try  for public office because, he said, he owes the city his services. A former Los  Angeles County deputy sheriff and investigator with the Los Angeles District  Attorney's Office, Pedersen is now a vice president with Progressive Savings  Bank in Pasadena. Pedersen said he plans to spend less than $1,000 on the  campaign.  </P> <P> Pedersen wants to expand the downtown business district to include Montecito  Avenue, the site of Sierra Madre's largest employer, Scott Aviation. He also  wants the Chamber of Commerce and the Main Street Program to merge for more  effective downtown revitalization.  </P> <P> William Tice, 52, a self-employed gardener and 14-year Sierra Madre resident,  is taking a folksy approach. At one political forum, Tice stretched a tape  measure 18 inches to emphasize that building inspectors should take accurate  measurements in order to avoid hitting gas lines. His suggestions for upgrading  the central business district include cobblestone paving and landscaping. Like  Freeman, Tice is not accepting campaign contributions, but a friend has printed  flyers on his behalf, which constitutes an in-kind campaign contribution.  </P> <P> A candidates forum is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at City Hall, 232 W.  Sierra Madre Blvd. The forum will be broadcast live on local cable television.  </P> <P> In addition to choosing among the seven candidates, Sierra Madre voters must  also decide on two ballot measures.  </P> <P> One measure, introduced by Bartolai, would limit council members to two  consecutive four-year terms in office. After an absence of two or more years,  former council members could run again. The vote is an advisory measure that  the council could enact later if it passes by a majority vote. No arguments  against the measure were submitted for the sample ballot.  </P> <P> The second ballot measure asks city voters to raise their property taxes 8.5  cents for every $100 of assessed value to help pay for paramedic service to  supplement the volunteer Fire Department's emergency medical technicians. The  measure requires a two-thirds vote for approval.  </P> <P> Opponents insist that the city's current emergency medical technicians provide  adequate service. They say the cost, estimated at $450,000 the first year and  $350,000 annually thereafter, is too high. Supporters believe that residents  should pay to upgrade the city's emergency medical care.  </P></p>

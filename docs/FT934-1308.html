			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Venice Should your business be fortunate enough to take you to Venice, and should you arrive by air, you will be faced with the question of how to make the watery transit to the city itself, writes David Lascelles. For the well-heeled, the answer is simple: jump in a water taxi and enjoy one of the most romantic city arrivals possible. But be prepared to be charged over 120,000 lire (Pounds 50) for the pleasure, though you may be able to cut this by bargaining. For those on tighter budgets, there is a water bus costing only 15,000 lire (Pounds 6). But departures are spasmodic, and the trip goes via the Lido, taking more than an hour. The real bargain is the Venetian municipal bus service which runs half hourly (hourly at week-ends) and costs a mere 1000 lire (40p). Admittedly, it deposits you at the Piazzale Roma, leaving you to take the vaporetto on to your hotel. But this only costs 2,500 lire (Pounds 1) and can be a joy in itself.</p>

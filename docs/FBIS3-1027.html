The minister of  information and culture, Professor Jerry Gana, gave this advice  at a news conference in Abuja. Gbenga Onoiga was there:    [Begin recording] [Onoiga] Recounting efforts made by the  Federal Government to resolve the dispute amicably, Prof. Gana  reiterated the readiness of government to protect the lives and  property of Nigerians. He urged the people, particularly those  living in eastern states and the border areas with Cameroon, to  be security conscious and be ready in the event of any problem  arising from the Bakassi conflict. Prof. Gana also advise the  public to ignore some pamphlets now in circulation aimed at  misinforming them about the dispute.    [Gana] We appeal especially for Nigerians living in the  eastern states and the border areas with Cameroon, to be  particularly security conscious. It is therefore my  responsibility to plead with the Nigerians to ignore a number of  assaults which we have reason to believe are [words indistinct]  people outside Nigeria who are trying to confuse Nigerians and  knock their heads together in order to provoke internal division  at this very critical time.    [Onoiga] The minister said the pamphlets, which tended to  [word indistinct] to tribalize our religious sentiments, were  completely false. He said the minister of foreign affairs was  to prepare a document concerning a full historical record on the  Bakassi issue. The document, Prof. Gana explained, will be used  by his ministry to educate the public on the facts of the  matter. He maintained that the present administration will not  make the mistake of the past by abandoning Nigerians to  molestation and humiliation by neighboring countries,  particularly Cameroon. In the words of the minister, since  Nigerians live in Bakassi, they must be protected by the  Nigerian State. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (15): Scarcity of stock fuels vibrant sector - Real estate OUTMODED technology, dubious management and changing demand means that east European state enterprises can often be marginal investments at best. By comparison, a scarcity of hotels, offices, shops and good quality housing and rising western demand has created a vibrant real estate sector. Rents are often higher than in western capitals and companies are prepared to pay for accommodation in hard currency. As a result, property development is often the subtext of privatisation and the scent of asset stripping hangs in the air. As company privatisations grind on, the importance of real estate is becoming clearer. Like the UK in the 1980s, state companies and local authorities find themselves short of cash resources at a time when their most attractive assets are in land. The result is a scramble to sell, or more often, create joint ventures with western companies to release the capital tied up in their real estate assets. The process has not always been smooth. Armed with the experience of UK privatisation in the 1980s, UK based accountants initially swept into the vacuum created by the fall of communism. It was not long before real estate problems checked their progress. In 1990, a celebrated deal was struck for the privatisation of Hungar Hotels, the Hungarian state hotel chain. On instruction from the then inexperienced and recently formed State Property Agency (SPA) the chain was valued by a western consulting company as a going concern. However, the suggested price led to a furore about alleged asset stripping by foreigners after Quintus, a Swedish-Dutch company paid the requested Dollars 90m for a 50 per cent stake in the chain. The courts rescinded the deal after the public outcry. This and similar early deals involving former communist managements lead to a tightening up of evaluation and sales procedures. Hungary now has possibly the most rigorous monitoring policy in real estate disposal with the SPA vetting all disposals. Privatisation, once hailed as a universal panacea for the East's economic ills, is now under more careful scrutiny as the novelty of change wears thin. It is no longer enough to slap a privatisation label on a transaction. Concern about exploitation by western property developers and investors has led to a new emphasis on competition. However, in practice, the new rules often act act as a deterrent to competition with western developers being put off by the terms of open competitions where the costs of competing are not matched by the chance of success. Arguably the single most successful privatisation policy in the UK was the sale of council houses to their tenants. The scope for this is enormous in eastern Europe as virtually every town and city is surrounded by vast pre-cast concrete estates. The risk of delinquency and social unrest cannot be overestimated in the period of hardship stemming from the economic transition. In the UK, proprietorial pride following sale to tenants is transforming the estates, sometimes reversing their degeneration into virtual ghettos. Repeating the process in the East however requires setting up building societies and other credit systems. The World Bank has responded to this issue and has taken up a pioneering position in Poland. It is contributing Dollars 200m to a mortgage fund expected to total some Dollars 570m. The Polish government is to match the World Bank sum, Polish banks are expected to contribute Dollars 100m with a further contribution expected from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Initially the fund will provide credits for both construction and purchasing but the emphasis will be on new low-rise buildings at the top end of the Polish market. In the face of high inflation the fund is expected to utilise a novel repayment formula which utilises a repayment ceiling derived from the difference between wage and price inflation. When the ceiling is reached the term of loan is extended. Local authorities and state companies in the UK became increasingly sophisticated in their dealings with developers during the 1980s and this would appear to be the pattern for privatisation in the East. Preferential tax environments, joint ventures, small business encouragement and development corporations are just a few of the routes ahead. There is wide scope to make more of inner city sites which include prime office, hotel and retail locations. Such sites give local authorities the opportunity to attract the development skills necessary to access the variety of funding sources needed for urban renewal. Schemes which integrate commercial elements with provision for small local business and housing are likely to build a political momentum of their own in the tough environment which is expected to continue for some time.

			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAVING THEIR CAKE  </P> <P> The article and recipe for the "secret-ingredient cake" was interesting. But  it's still a very high-fat and high-calorie dessert. I believe it might be  possible to make a very good-tasting, low-calorie, low-fat cake with these  revisions:  </P> <P> Instead of 3 eggs, use 6 egg whites.  </P> <P> Cut the sugar amount from 1 3/4 cups to 1 1/2 cups. Instead of using 1 1/4 cups  of oil, use 1 1/4 cups of applesauce. Delete the 1 1/4 teaspoons of salt from  the recipe.  </P> <P> I've analyzed both recipe versions with Nutritionist III software. You'll note  that the calories are reduced by 53% (283 to 133 calories), and cholesterol is  eliminated completely. Only a tenth of a serving/exchange of vegetables (3  calories) results from the addition of the beans -- I'd be tempted to sneak in  double that amount at least.  </P> <P>  -- JIM GRIZZELL, M.A., health educator, California State Polytechnic  University, Pomona  </P></p>

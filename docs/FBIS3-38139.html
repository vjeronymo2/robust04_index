			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In his opening address at the "Italian Socialist  Party (PSI) General Assembly", party chairman (Labor Minister  Gino) Giugni was applauded when he told the 6,000 delegates in  Rome that "the old Socialist Party leadership does not live here  any more." He added: "That leadership" was responsible for "a  destructive moral pollution" and for "a series of hastily taken,  wrong political choices."    Before the assembly, Party Secretary (Ottaviano) Del Turco  met Giorgio Bogi of the Democratic Alliance (AD). He told him  that the PSI intends to stand together with the AD in the  progressive alliance in the forthcoming general election.</p>

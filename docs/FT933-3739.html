			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Cookery: Marriage made in Scotland THE AULD alliance may still be going strong but Scotland is forging new bonds with Spain. This gastronomic union was celebrated recently with a banquet at Loch Fyne Oyster Bar, near Cairndow in Argyll. The Spaniards brought nearly two dozen fine sherries, ranging from Sanlucar manzanilla, with its salty fresh tang, to the super-rich syrup-of-figs slurp of a well aged Pedro Ximenez. The Scottish team produced a magnificent array of fish and shellfish (including velvet crabs, creel-caught langoustines, oysters, queen scallops, eel, fresh, hot- and cold-smoked salmon, and herrings marinated in various ways), smoked and marinated venison, a few cheeses and desserts. The idea was that the guests, a handful of food and wine writers, should act as marriage brokers trying to forge the best partnerships between the foods and the wines. The party assembled the evening before the banquet was due to take place, meeting and staying at Ardkinglas, John Noble's imposing Lorimer pile on the fringes of Loch Fyne. I had not been there since my teens, but nothing seemed to have changed. We arrived in typically Scottish weather: a fine drizzle which later gave way to a watery sun veiled by gauzy mist. The welcome was warm and generous with massive log fires and piping hot bath water the colour of whisky. And the mood was jolly as we sat down to the inaugural dinner. An auspicious start to the feastings, this included lobster, three-year-old wether mutton from the estate and several bottles of Cune Rioja Imperial Gran Riserva 1975. Do not look for this vintage in the shops: we drank the last of it. If, however, you press me to tell you what I enjoyed most, it was breakfast. This was a full-scale affair, not the paltry sassernach offering of cornflakes and toast. Before we retired for the night we had each been given a breakfast menu. 'Please tick those items you would like: porridge, fresh grapefruit juice, fresh orange juice, Loch Fyne kippers, Finnan haddock, eggs (poached, scrambled, fried or boiled), black pudding, Ayrshire bacon, pork sausage, grilled tomato, mushrooms, home-made bread and girdle scones.' Most of us could not resist ticking almost all of these items. And we were right to. The citrus juice, which was freshly squeezed by the master of the house himself in the pantry alongside the dining room, came by the jugful. The girdle scones and bread lived up to the Scottish reputation for fine baking. The bacon was frazzled and flavoursome, not weeping pathetically. The kippers were excellent and the Finnan haddock, which I watched our host and his niece poach in milk, was the best I have ever eaten. FINNAN HADDOCK MOUSSE (serves 8) Three fish will yield more flesh than is needed for this recipe. Use the surplus, depending on how much of it there is, to make a creamy fish soup, omelette Arnold Bennett or kedgeree. If you are nimble-fingered and want to dramatise the look of the mousse, you can decorate the sides of it, after unmoulding, with a 'fence' of lightly steamed and cooled French beans, sticking them into place with a light smear of mayonnaise or fromage frais. A shallow bowl with sloping sides makes a better mould than a straight sided souffle dish for this purpose. 3 finnan haddocks; 1 1/2 pt creamy milk; 1 carrot; 1 shallot; 2 bay leaves; 1 1/2 oz butter; 1 1/2 oz plain flour; 3 tablespoons manzanilla or fino sherry; approximately 1 tablespoon gelatine powder (see method); 2 1/2 -3 fl oz single cream; 2 egg whites; 6 black peppercorns and a little cayenne pepper. Choose a pan that will hold the fish snugly. Put into it the milk, chopped shallot, carrot, bay leaves and peppercorns and bring slowly to scalding point. Add the fish, pushing it down into the liquid, and top up if necessary with just enough water to cover the fish. Bring back to simmering point, switch off the heat, cover the pan and leave for 10 minutes. Strain the liquid from the smoked haddock and use  3/4 pt of it, together with the butter and flour, to make a fishy flavoured bechamel sauce. Add the sherry and 1 lb of the skinned and flaked haddock. Simmer, uncovered, over a heat-diffuser for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile soak then dissolve in 3-4 tablespoons of the leftover fishy milk some gelatine (1 1/2 tablespoons of gelatine if the mousse is to be unmoulded; less if the mousse is to be served in the dish in which it is set). Away from the hob, stir the melted gelatine thoroughly into the fish. Add the cream and season with cayenne, black pepper and salt to taste. Turn the mixture into a large bowl and set it aside until cold and beginning to thicken. Then whisk the egg whites, fold them into the mousse and spoon it into a souffle dish or bowl or individual ramekins. Cover and chill until set.</p>

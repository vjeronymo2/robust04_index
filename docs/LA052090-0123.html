			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> WITH FREE-LOVE GURU DEAD, INDIA COMMUNE GOES MAINSTREAM  </P> <P> Buffeted by the recent death of its god and a drop in donations, the commune of  the late free-love guru Osho Rajneesh is trying to save itself by going  mainstream.  </P> <P> Emphasis has shifted from mystical sex to meditation exercises. Primal  screaming was banned after neighbors complained of the noise. Deals have been  signed with prominent companies for distribution of videocassettes.  </P> <P> "We are mellowing," said Swami Tatahgat, an Indian board member of Rajneesh  Foundation, the trust that controls the commune. "Before, we used to wear our  rebelliousness on our sleeves."  </P> <P> It appears to be a kinder, gentler commune now than at Rajneeshpuram, Ore.,  where, according to commune residents and spokesmen for the Poona press office,  members administered barbiturates and other drugs to rivals they considered  "negative." Rajneesh called himself Bhagwan, or God, in those days.  </P> <P> No longer do disciples prance half-naked through the halls of the local  five-star hotel, the Blue Diamond. The hotel recently welcomed them back, but  only for meals.  </P> <P> The lush 11-acre campus, with its miniature waterfalls, outdoor Japanese  restaurant and high-tech workout rooms, seems more like a summer camp for  adults than a focus for worldwide revolution in consciousness.  </P> <P> All visitors are required to produce the results of an AIDS test no more than a  month old. Westerners seen groping at one another's bodies on Poona's streets  may get a dressing down by other followers.  </P> <P> Osho meditation is taught at the Tata Management School, a Poona business  college. The commune has a contract with CBS/India to distribute videotapes of  Rajneesh's lectures, and another with Pocket Books to publish his writings.  </P> <P> Day breaks at the Osho International Commune.  </P> <P> Disciples gather for a meditation session in Lao Tzu Hall, where the guru's  ashes are housed in a small vault kept on his marble bed.  </P> <P> Pattering into the house, they pass through a marble room furnished only with a  plush dental chair.  </P> <P> "This is where Osho had his teeth fixed," Swami Subhuti, a commune spokesman,  intones reverently. He used to be Peter Waight, a newspaper reporter in London.  </P> <P> Inside the mausoleum, once Rajneesh's bedroom, disciples move close to the  vault containing his ashes. "Never born, never died," reads the epitaph on  black marble.  </P> <P> A stocky guard flicks a remote-control switch. Lights in an ornate glass  chandelier dim. A chime rings and meditation begins.  </P> <P> Osho Rajneesh, the mesmerizing guru of quick-fix enlightenment, died Jan. 19.  At the height of his popularity, the 58-year-old former teacher of Sanskrit  amassed 500,000 followers, 87 Rolls-Royces, diamond-studded watches, and gowns  fashioned from gold thread.  </P> <P> Rajneesh started his movement in India in the late 1960s, preaching a blend of  Eastern mysticism, free love and pop psychology. Among his 650 works are such  titles as "Take It Easy" (Volumes I and II) and "Ya-Hoo."  </P> <P> He changed his name numerous times, adopting Bhagwan, Zorba the Buddha and  finally Osho, "the one the heavens shower with flowers."  </P> <P> In the early 1980s, Rajneesh moved his band of red-robed followers to a  64,229-acre ranch in the hills of central Oregon.  </P> <P> Rancho Rajneesh disbanded after the master was kicked out of the United States  in 1985 for immigration fraud, and the American movement degenerated into a  miasma of poisonings and costly court cases.  </P> <P> Ma Anand Sheela, Rajneesh's former chief aide, was sentenced to 4 1/2 years in  prison for arson, attempted murder and masterminding a food-poisoning outbreak  that made 750 townspeople ill. Other aides avoided prosecution by cooperating  with police.  </P> <P> Rajneesh advocated breaking with all social conventions through meditation, as  he defined it.  </P> <P> Through meditation, he said, his followers could destroy the family, the church  and the state, structures he said were destroying humanity.  </P> <P> He developed or synthesized several techniques, including one in which  followers jump up and down, yelling "Hoo, hoo, hoo!"  </P> <P> Unlike gurus who demand that disciples reject worldly goods, Rajneesh  encouraged his followers to revel in sensual pleasures, including sex, drugs  and good food.  </P> <P> "Only by this way will you ever rise above them," he said in one of his famous  discourses, which he peppered with bathroom humor and intriguing riddles.  </P> <P> Those who succeeded in meditation, the guru said, would attain "Buddhahood," or  enlightenment; they would be able to live in the world unaffected by its  changes.  </P> <P> "What Osho taught is that the next jump for humanity is not changing the shape  of your nose or face, but changing the shape of your inner space," said Swami  Amrito, a British doctor who was with Rajneesh when he died.  </P> <P> Rajneesh returned to India in 1986, and problems followed the movement home.  </P> <P> After his death, the Indian press speculated that Rajneesh was murdered or died  of AIDS. His followers denied the claims and accused the United States of  poisoning their god while he was in jail.  </P> <P> Indian newspapers claimed that Westerners were trying to seize control of the  movement. The commune also rejected that claim.  </P> <P> A mysterious team of 21 people, called the "Inner Circle," runs the commune. An  American, Swami Jayesh, and the British doctor, Swami Amrito, are believed to  be in charge.  </P> <P> Negative publicity has hurt donations, which routinely reached millions of  dollars a year.  </P> <P> Swami Tatahgat, the Indian board member, said the commune does not plan to  expand its campus because "we don't have the funds." Last year, the commune  lost a court case and was forced to pay the Indian government $2 million in  back taxes.  </P> <P> "Be there or be square," says a Californian with pigs riding surfboards on his  shorts.  </P> <P> The meeting of the White Robed Brotherhood is the centerpiece of meditation at  the commune. Every evening, hundreds of followers don cotton robes and gather  in the Gautama the Buddha Auditorium.  </P> <P> Disciples pass a metal detector, then a duo of sniffing women whose job it is  to detect those who are wearing perfume or haven't bathed.  </P> <P> "Osho doesn't like weird smells," says one olfactory guard. Like other  followers, she speaks of Rajneesh in the present tense.  </P> <P> His empty chair sits on a marble stage between two air-conditioners set at 52  degrees Fahrenheit, his preferred temperature.  </P> <P> A screen drops and a video of the master is shown.  </P> <P> As the discourse ends, a young Frenchwoman whispers: "He is still with us."  </P></p>

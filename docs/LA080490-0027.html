			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MESSAGE OF 'SEALS'  </P> <P> While Feigen has fought against the stereotypes women are burdened with, she  has not discovered that men are also the victims of society's most violent  stereotypes.  </P> <P> Does she care that some young men will see "Navy SEALS" and decide that they  must join so they can prove their worth? Does she care that innocent women and  children would undoubtedly be killed in an attack such as depicted in "Navy  SEALS"? No. She only cares that the one white woman in the film is depicted  well.  </P> <P> DON HAYASHI  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

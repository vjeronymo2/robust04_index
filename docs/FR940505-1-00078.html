			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An evaluation of the environmental, economic, socioeconomic, and other impacts of Rule 1125 requirements can be found in the SCAQMD staff reports for Rule 1125 (February 2, 1979 and October 13, 1989). Evaluations of these impacts are also presented in CARB's RACT/BARCT Determination for Metal Containers, Metal Closures, and/or Metal Coils. Both of these evaluations are applicable to this proposed FIP rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described in the technical support document, uncontrolled VOC emissions from affected facilities are projected to total 2.09 tpd in 1999 and 2.34 tpd in 2005. Implementation of this proposed rule is projected to reduce those emissions by 0.26 tpd and 0.30 tpd respectively at a cost savings of $540 per ton of VOC removed (1990 dollars). A cost savings is projected in part because CARB and the Districts have identified compliant coatings which are less expensive than high-VOC coatings currently in use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Commercial Bakeries (Sacramento). Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(f) controls VOC emissions from commercial bakery ovens in the Sacramento nonattainment area that emit VOCs while baking yeast-leavened products. The proposed rule requires that certain bakeries install and operate a VOC pollution control system to reduce VOC emissions by at least 95 percent by weight. The following four yeast-leavened dough processes are affected: sponge dough, straight dough, liquid ferments, and no-time dough. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Facilities with a combined rated heat input capacity of all ovens less than 2 million British Thermal Units (Btus) per hour and facilities with ovens used exclusively for baking products leavened chemically (without yeast) are exempt from all of the proposed rule requirements, including recordkeeping and test method provisions. Facilities which emit less than 6.5 tons of VOC per year are exempt from the standards and compliance schedule requirements, but still must observe the recordkeeping and test method requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule is based largely on SDCAPCD proposed Rule 67.24 (Bakery Ovens), as presented in Workshop Draft form on September 17, 1992. Portions of the proposed rule are based on SCAQMD Rule 1153 (Commercial Bakery Ovens) as adopted on January 4, 1991 and BAAQMD Regulation 8, Rule 42 (Large Commercial Bread Bakeries) as adopted on September 20, 1989. Evaluations of environmental, economic, socioeconomic, and other impacts of the proposed rule can be found in EPA's ACT Document for Bakery Oven Emissions (EPA&hyph;453/R&hyph;92&hyph;017, December 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described in the technical support document, uncontrolled VOC emissions from affected facilities are projected to total 1.28 tpd in 1999 and 1.40 tpd in 2005. Implementation of this proposed rule is projected to reduce those emissions by 1.22 tpd and 1.33 tpd respectively at a cost of $1,200 per ton VOC removed or 0.2 cents per pound of bread (1990 dollars). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Municipal Waste Landfills (Sacramento). Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(g) controls emissions of non-methane organic compounds (NMOC) from certain municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills in the Sacramento nonattainment area by collecting and processing the landfill gases evolved from decomposition of organic material in MSW landfills. Emission reductions are achieved by requiring collection of 90 percent of the landfill gases produced, and destruction of 98 percent of the NMOCs collected. By controlling NMOCs, VOCs are also controlled because NMOCs include, but are not limited to, VOCs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The substantive requirements of the proposed rule apply to MSW landfills that have received more than 500,000 tons of decomposable solid waste during their operational lifetime. The following types of landfills are exempt from some or all requirements of this proposed rule: facilities that have accepted only hazardous waste; facilities issued an Authority to Construct permit from the applicable air quality management district or air pollution control district prior to April 1, 1995 and that have an NMOC control device in place with at least 90 percent efficiency; and facilities that demonstrate a low concentration of landfill gas (i.e., less than 500 ppm by volume total organic compounds measured as methane) at all points near the surface of the landfill. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(g) is based largely on VCAPCD Rule 74.17 (Solid Waste Disposal Sites), as adopted on September 17, 1991. Evaluation of the environmental, economic, socioeconomic, and other impacts of that rule can be found in VCAPCD's ``Final Staff Report for Rule 74.17,'' dated September 17, 1991. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is in the process of developing ``Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources and Guidelines for Control of Existing Sources: Municipal Solid Waste Landfills'' (``MSW Guidelines''). This proposed FIP rule is also based on work performed in development of the ``MSW Guidelines.'' Upon publication of the ``MSW Guidelines'' in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , it may be appropriate to revise the FIP rule for consistency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described in the technical support document, uncontrolled VOC emissions from affected facilities are projected to total 0.94 tpd in 1999 and 1.08 tpd in 2005. Implementation of this proposed rule is projected to reduce those emissions by 0.60 tpd and 0.69 tpd respectively at a cost of $18,000 per ton of VOC removed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Livestock Waste (Sacramento, South Coast, and Ventura). Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(h) controls VOC emissions from livestock waste operations. Livestock waste emission sources include cattle, hogs, sheep, and poultry operations. VOC emissions are created during the anaerobic decomposition of livestock wastes. Although methane emissions are estimated to make up 70 to 80 percent of the total organic gases (TOG) created, VOC emissions account for approximately 10 percent of the TOG. Livestock waste operations account for approximately 7.7 tpd of VOC emissions in the Sacramento area, 34.4 tpd in the South Coast, <FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>  and 3.8 tpd in Ventura. Although livestock waste operations have traditionally not been the subject of VOC regulation, they are now under consideration because of the magnitude of livestock waste emissions and the need to achieve reductions from all FIP area emission VOC sources, most of which have previously reduced or will soon be required to reduce their VOC emissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 41 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> These estimates do not include methane and ethane emissions. Because limited information was available regarding the fraction of poultry operations within Riverside, San Bernardino, and Los Angeles counties which are located in the South Coast Air Basin, the 34.4 tpd estimate includes the total poultry population found in the three aforementioned counties. As a result, livestock waste emission estimates may be slightly overestimated for the South Coast Air Basin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As proposed, the rule would only apply to dairy cattle operations of 400 head or greater. These operations are estimated to represent approximately 1.8 tpd of VOC emissions in the Sacramento area and 10.8 tpd in the South Coast. Ventura County currently does not have any dairy operations of greater than 200 head of cattle and, as a result, dairy operations would not be affected in Ventura. Although other livestock waste operations (e.g., chicken, hogs, sheep facilities) are not being proposed for regulation at this time, EPA will continue to investigate potential options for reducing emissions from other livestock waste operations as appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emissions from livestock waste are determined by the quantity of manure produced, how it is handled, and the temperature at which it is handled. The manure management system employed is very important. Wet management systems, such as liquid or slurry based systems (e.g., lagoons), convert large portions of the carbon to methane and other gases. Dry management systems, which rely on placing the manure in storage piles, also result in methane and other volatile organic compound emissions created by the anaerobic conditions within the storage piles. The primary emission reduction strategies available to reduce VOC emissions include utilizing methane recovery systems and/or promoting enhanced aerobic conditions in manure storage areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

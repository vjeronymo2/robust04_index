			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Survey of Nottinghamshire Coalfields Regeneration (5): A way of life transformed - A look at the effects pit closure have had on Cotgrave When the last tower was blasted from the Cotgrave colliery pit two months ago, a crowd gathered on the grassy knoll overlooking the scratched earth below. Vernon Coaker, vice-chairman of the town council in this village, about six miles south-east of Nottingham, remembers one man saying: 'What an unbelievable act of industrial vandalism.' When the pit was closed, 609 miners - 218 of them from Cotgrave - lost the jobs they had been promised would last through their grandchildren's lifetime. Many are still unemployed and those who have found work have often taken pay cuts as a result of a move into unskilled labour. 'You have a lot of people with engineering and mechanical skills who are just not using them,' said Mr Coaker. 'It is such a waste of talent and experience.' At the height of its production, the colliery employed 2,000 miners. More than 35 per cent of the town's families have relatives who worked in the mine at some time during its life. The coming of the pit transformed Cotgrave. Sitting incongruously in the middle of Nottinghamshire's Green Belt in the heart of the constituency of Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, the colliery attracted miners from pits which had closed down in Scotland and the north of England. After the pit was opened in 1964, Cotgrave transformed a rural population of 300 into a mining village of 8,000. Within 18 months of the colliery's first shift, a housing estate for the miners had been built up in an arc around the old village. Mining, as the only industry in the village, gives Cotgrave its identity. 'The pit was the social glue of the town,' said Mr Coaker. 'Everything revolved around the pit. People lived, worked and socialised together. It was a total commitment to a way of life.' Today, more than a year after Cotgrave's colliery shut down, the town is still a close-knit community where ex-miners tease each other in the Miners Welfare bar and neighbours call out friendly greetings to each other on the streets. But subtle changes have left concerns that the atmosphere created by the pit is deteriorating. 'We have a lot of commuters moving in who do not take part in the village,' said Alan Brown, an ex-miner and a town councillor. It is not just harmony within the village that is threatened. Individual families are suffering as well. 'One woman from a young couple told me that since her husband left the pit, they have done nothing but argue,' said Bryan Barrodale, Rector of the Cotgrave Anglican Parish. For many wives of ex-miners, having their husbands out of work upsets dynamics in the home. 'A lot of families were adjusted to living with three shifts at the mine,' said Sheila Newham, wife of an ex-miner and former head of the Cotgrave Women's Action Group, which campaigned to keep the pit open. 'Suddenly having their husbands at home all day is a big change. That is probably one reason why many women have gone to work.' Several Cotgrave women have taken jobs or started child minding. 'Men are becoming house husbands and women are becoming the bread winners,' said Ken Stobbard, another ex-miner from Calverton, a nearby pit, and a county councillor who is unemployed while his wife works. The pit's closure has also highlighted Cotgrave's lack of services, such as a secondary school, cheap shops, and now, a bank. TSB closed down Cotgrave's only branch in April. Some local officials believe the speed of the pit's arrival may have distracted attention from plans to bring such resources to the village. 'The pit cut across a lot of long term planning schemes, and the town never got a lot of the resources it deserved,' said Eric Woolsey, a town and borough councillor. Another problem is that Cotgrave - traditionally surrounded by affluence - has not been eligible for assisted area status or EU funding. Officials are determined to take advantage of government money that is available in the wake of the pit closure. 'If one good thing will come out of the pit shutting down it will be that we will get some of the services we should have had but never did,' said Mr Coaker. To date, the town has received Pounds 400,000 from the government's Coalfield Area Fund. With the money, Rushcliffe Borough Council has built six industrial units on the edge of the village which have been let to small businesses. Nottinghamshire County Council will use a portion of the money to build an additional four units on to the town's leisure centre, which is now being renovated. The county council is also funneling money into Cotgrave through the 'New Deal for Nottinghamshire', a county-wide response to pit closures in the area. The council has set aside money for training, traffic management, environmental improvement and job creation. A month after the pit closed, Greater Nottinghamshire Tec opened an Opportunities Advice Centre to help the miners who had been made redundant and other local unemployed residents to find jobs and get training or further education in new fields. It also provides a Citizens Advice Bureau service once a week. Benefit advice is by far the most sought after. When the centre opened, 577 people were registered unemployed in Cotgrave. Of these, 252 have been placed in jobs, leaving unemployment in the village running about 9 per cent, with 30 miners still using the centre's services. It has also helped some of the town's long-term unemployed to find jobs. Government funding for the Opportunities Advice Centre will cease in May of 1995. Carl Leonard, Special Projects Manager for Greater Nottinghamshire Tec, said: 'We will have an exit strategy. We won't just pull out the plug and go.' Coaker believes the centre is doing a good job, but arrived too late. 'Why did they build a lifeboat when the ship was sinking?' he said. While training people for new jobs is an immediate response to the pit closure, local officials want to bring new industry on to the pit site. British Coal and Rushcliffe Borough Council have produced a development brief for the colliery, where they hope one industrial or leisure developer will take over the whole site. Local officials believe the site's rural location, and proximity to rail lines, makes it an ideal site for a large factory or leisure park. In 1995, the A46, which runs near the former colliery, will be turned into a dual carriageway and officials believe it will provide the infrastructure for industry. Mr Coaker says: 'Whatever happens here it won't produce the same amount of jobs that the pit did. However much you do you will never replace what has gone.' However, for ex-miners, what is important is the thought of a job. If new industry was built on the pit site, Peter Newham, a former miner from Cotgrave, says: 'I would be one of the first on the door step applying for a job'.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Observer: Swizz Cottage London Underground's Customer Charter works, but madly. A colleague has received from the Tube two letters, delivered simultaneously, in response to a claim for a delayed journey in February. One letter apologised but said as the delay was caused by a possible bomb at Cannon Street station, there would be no refund, as security alerts are beyond the Tube's control. The second, signed by the same person, regretted the same delayed journey - and contained a voucher for Pounds 1.30.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Top US retailer curbs gun sales Wal-Mart, the discount retailer which is one of the two biggest sellers of guns in the US, is to stop stocking handguns in its stores from next February. It will continue to sell the weapons through catalogues, though; and rifles and shotguns will still be available in the 700 of its 2,000 stores across the country which currently sell firearms. Wal-Mart said the decision to take handguns out of its stores reflected unease among customers. 'The majority of them feel uncomfortable with being in a store that sells guns,' it said. The decision, which the company says was taken 'three or four months ago,' comes after a handful of lawsuits against Wal-Mart and discount retailer Kmart, the US's other biggest seller of guns. These allege negligence in the sale of guns by staff who have not been properly trained. 'You might be selling mens-wear one day and firearms the next,' said the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, one of several pressure groups which have targeted campaigns against discount stores in recent months. The decision also follows the killing of six passengers on a Long Island commuter train last month, which has added to pressure for stronger gun controls in the US. Last weekend, two people were killed with an assault rifle in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Oklahoma. Wal-Mart and Kmart sell between a fifth and a quarter of all rifles and shotguns in the US through their national chains. Figures for handgun sales do not need to be reported, but the discount retailers' market share of such weapons is believed to be broadly similar. Wal-Mart said that while taking handguns out of its stores, it was not making any changes to the paperwork or other procedures involved in selling the weapons. The change meant there would now be a longer delay between the time a handgun is purchased and when it is delivered, however. Wal-Mart faces a lawsuit brought this month by the relatives of a mentally ill man who shot his parents using a handgun bought from one of the company's stores. In a landmark decision in October, Kmart was ordered to pay the victim of a shooting Dollars 12.5m (Pounds 8.3m) after it was found to be negligent in selling a rifle to an intoxicated man.</p>

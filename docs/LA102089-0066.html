			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRONT-RUNNER DINKINS FACES STORMY WEATHER;  </P> <P> MAYORALTY: N.Y. DEMOCRAT COMES UNDER SCRUTINY OVER STOCK TRANSFER TO HIS SON  AND A CONTROVERSIAL PAYMENT TO A COMMUNITY ACTIVIST.  </P> <P> Manhattan Borough President David N. Dinkins has built a big lead in public  opinion polls as he pursues his bid to become New York's first black mayor. But  less than three weeks before the election, his campaign suddenly is facing its  first sustained stretch of politically stormy weather.  </P> <P> Reporters are questioning a stock transfer to his son and his campaign's  payment of $9,500 in primary day "walking around money" to a controversial  community activist with a criminal record.  </P> <P> Even Mayor Edward I. Koch, who has pledged to support Dinkins, said Thursday  that the issues being raised were legitimate.  </P> <P> Koch, who was defeated by Dinkins in the Democratic primary and whose  constituency Dinkins badly needs in the general election, also called on  Dinkins to release an official city report by the Department of Investigation  examining Dinkins' failure to pay income taxes two decades ago. Dinkins, who  subsequently paid the taxes with all penalties, has apologized for his failure  to file.  </P> <P> In a move to deflect criticism and regain momentum, Dinkins released a highly  unusual personal letter Thursday, attacking his GOP opponent, former U.S. Atty.  Rudolph W. Giuliani, and his media adviser Roger Ailes, a key consultant in  President Bush's winning White House bid.  </P> <P> "I am determined not to let your consultant Roger Ailes do to me what he has  done to other Democrats in other races, slandering their records and playing  upon fear," Dinkins charged.  </P> <P> "I am challenging you one last time to stop the gutter politics. . . . You and  Mr. Ailes may have bullied people in the past. But if you persist on your  present course, you will learn something I learned in the Marine Corps: Marines  aren't very good at picking fights, but they certainly know how to end them."  </P> <P> Giuliani's advisers said Dinkins' decision to play the "Ailes card" -- to seek  to make the controversial media adviser an election issue -- was a sign that  Dinkins' campaign was in difficulty.  </P> <P> Peter Powers, Giuliani's campaign manager, labeled the letter a "subterfuge"  and charged that Dinkins was canceling public appearances and news conferences  to duck the media.  </P> <P> "I would suggest that he is adopting a bunker mentality," he said. "Our  television campaign has nothing to do with his current financial problem, and  it is dishonest for him to even suggest that is the case."  </P> <P> Giuliani has been airing a tough television commercial stressing, among other  things, Dinkins' past tax troubles and his campaign's recent controversial  payment to the community activist, including the tag line: "David Dinkins: Why  does he always wait until he's caught?"  </P> <P> On Thursday, Dinkins was scheduled to appear with Koch and other city officials  at a building dedication in Brooklyn. But after being pressed by reporters at  an earlier stop on the details of the stock transaction, the candidate skipped  the ceremony.  </P> <P> On Thursday, New York Newsday reported that Dinkins' 588 shares of privately  held stock in Inner City Broadcasting Co. were worth at least $2.5 million when  he sold them to his son for $58,000 in 1986. The paper said that by  undervaluing the stock, Dinkins potentially could have avoided paying a  substantial capital gains tax.  </P> <P> A lawyer for Dinkins said the candidate believed at the time that the value put  on the stock was fair.  </P> <P> But in an interview with the New York Times published in today's editions,  Dinkins admitted that he had once placed a value of $1 million or more on the  stock in a confidential form he filed with New York state in 1983. On a public  disclosure document he filed with New York City the same year, he estimated the  stock's value at between $20,000 and $60,000.  </P> <P> When asked about the discrepancy, Dinkins replied: "I really don't know."  </P> <P> Dinkins said he was consulting with advisers on how to handle any potential tax  problems and had selected the lower value without talking to lawyers or  accountants.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, after he canceled a news conference, Dinkins issued a statement  saying it was a mistake for members of his staff, sitting in for him at Board  of Estimate meetings, to vote on two occasions on issues relating to the  broadcasting company. Dinkins, an early investor in the company, had been  advised by the New York City Board of Ethics not to vote on any issues  involving the company.  </P> <P> The issue of his payments to community activist Sonny Carson escalated Thursday  when Carson called a news conference.  </P> <P> Carson, who was once convicted on a kidnaping charge and who organized a  violent demonstration that forced police to close the Brooklyn Bridge last  month, said the money he received was designed to help get out the vote and was  not a payment to dampen down volatility.  </P> <P> Carson angrily told reporters he wasn't anti-Semitic. "I'm anti-white," he  said.  </P> <P> That remark prompted a quick rebuttal from Dinkins.  </P> <P> "Sonny Carson's comments represent the kind of bigotry and intolerance I  utterly reject and have fought against my whole life," Dinkins said in a  statement. "Had such comments come to my attention, he never would have played  any role in my campaign."  </P> <P> Giuliani's strategists hope Dinkins' difficulties will begin to be reflected in  the polls, which would make fund-raising easier. Even though President Bush  raised $1.5 million at a dinner for Giuliani last week, finding substantial  additional money has been hard.  </P> <P> With less than three weeks before Election Day, various polls show Dinkins with  a lead ranging from 19 to 24 points.  </P></p>

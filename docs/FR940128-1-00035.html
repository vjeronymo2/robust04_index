			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Corrective Actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA is proposing in &sect;123.7 to require that deviations from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical limits trigger a prescribed series of actions by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor or importer, including determining the significance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the deviation, taking appropriate remedial action, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documenting the actions taken. This proposed provision is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the HACCP principles enunciated by NACMCF (Ref.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 34). First, under proposed &sect;123.7(a)(1), any critical limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deviation will require the segregation and holding of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected product until the significance of the deviation can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined. This step is necessary to ensure that products that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be injurious to health do not enter commerce until the impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the deviation on safety has been determined, and the safety of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the product assured. Second, under proposed &sect;123.7(a)(2), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor or importer must actually determine the effect of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deviation on safety, and third, under proposed &sect;123.7(a)(3), it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must take whatever corrective actions are necessary with respect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to both the affected product and the critical control point at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the deviation occurred, based on that determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some deviations, especially if they are caught quickly, will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not adversely affect safety. For example, if a refrigeration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit fails, but product being stored there is moved to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functioning unit before any appreciable warming of the product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can occur, safety will not have been affected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.7(a)(2) that the safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination be made by an individual who has successfully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completed training in HACCP principles (see proposed &sect;123.9).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has tentatively concluded that this requirement is necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ensure that the person who is reviewing the significance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the deviation understands the possible consequences of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing deviation and knows how to take appropriate measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in response to a deviation. FDA does not expect that a processor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or importer will be able, without assistance, to determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public health consequences of every possible deviation. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required training will, however, provide the processor or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importer with information about when and how to obtain the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance of an analytical laboratory, outside expert, State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory authority, or FDA district office in determining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proper course of action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.7(a)(4) and (a)(5) that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processor or importer review the process and the HACCP plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine whether the deviation reveals the need to modify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process or the plan, or both, and to make such modifications as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be needed. It is critically important that a processor or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importer learn as much as possible from the occurrence of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deviation and take steps to ensure that it will not be repeated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The plan should be a living document that the processor or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importer should modify and update as circumstances warrant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These proposed requirements will ensure that the processor and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importer connect day-to-day processing and other operations to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the plan. Each modification is required to be noted, dated, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained as part of their HACCP records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.7(b) that when a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor or importer receives a consumer complaint that may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to the performance of a critical control point or that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may reflect a critical limit deviation, it take appropriate steps  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine whether a deviation or other system failure has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurred that warrants remedial action and take such remedial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action that appears to be warranted under &sect;123.7(a). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importance of consumer complaints has been discussed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA recognizes that segregation and holding of the affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product will not always be feasible or warranted in response to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer complaint. In many cases, there will be no product to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hold because all of the product in question will already be in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commerce. In other cases, a processor or importer may be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine very quickly whether a deviation has actually occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing in &sect;123.7(c) to require that processors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and importers clearly document all of the steps that they take in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response to a critical limit deviation or a consumer complaint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and include that documentation as part of their HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records. FDA has tentatively concluded that the processor, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importer, and FDA will benefit from this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Documentation helps processors and importers to think the whole  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process through in a thorough and methodical way and to establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to their own satisfaction that they have taken proper steps.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Documentation enables the regulatory agency to determine whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processor or importer is able to regain control once a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deviation occurs and to ensure that potentially unsafe products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are being prevented from entering commerce or at least quickly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removed from commerce.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The documentation that FDA is proposing to require of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor's or importer's response to the consumer complaints  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by &sect;123.7(b) will enable the processor, the importer,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and FDA reviewers to determine whether those consumer complaints  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are receiving appropriate attention in a timely manner. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation should be clear enough to allow a determination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the nature of the complaint and of the time it took from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt of the complaint for processor or importer to review it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and to take any necessary corrective actions. FDA may choose on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occasion to review a limited number of consumer complaints to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> match against the documentation maintained by the processor or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the importer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

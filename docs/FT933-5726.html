			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / West German industrial production up in July Industrial production in west Germany rose a provisional 0.5 per cent in July. Manufacturing output rose 1 per cent, more than compensating for a 2.5 per cent drop in mining and a 3.2 per cent fall in construction, the Economics Ministry said yesterday. However, it warned that following an upward revision of the June month-on-month figures, it expected a downward revision for July. The region's seasonally-adjusted index of industrial production stood at 111.6 at the end of July, compared with 110.6 in April and the second quarter average of 111.0. Aggregate figures for June and July, compared with the April and May total (a measure considered less subject to short-term distortions) also showed a 0.5 per cent improvement.</p>

But he said heavy overnight rains which fell over the  Lesotho capital appeared to have caused the lull, adding it was  believed the two factions were still in their positions.    Mr Marais confirmed a report that South Africa had been  asked  to send troops to the mountain kingdom more than a week ago,  saying his minister, Mr Pik Botha, had since been in direct  contact with United Nations Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali and Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka Anyauko.  He said no decision had yet been taken as whether to send  troops.    Mr Marais said Mr Botha still maintained his advice to South  Africans not to travel to Maseru.</p>

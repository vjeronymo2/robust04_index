			<p>930423 FT  23 APR 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Damaged goods sent packing 'Damaged in transit' is an all too frequent expression, but for many small valuable items, such as china or electronic components, it could soon become redundant. Rapida Pak, of Bedford, has developed a packaging system that suspends delicate items in a flexible film inside a sturdy double-walled corrugated cardboard frame. A sheet of the bio-degradable film, developed by Wolff Walsrode, in Germany, is stretched across the two halves of the cardboard frame. When the item is placed inside and the box closed around it, the film stretches to the shape of the product, holding it tightly in place. Rapida Pak: 0234 214896.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: KOP to spin off mergers division KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, plans to transfer most of its investment banking operations to a new associated company to be half owned by management. The company, Prospectus, will have a FM4m share capital and concentrate on new issues, mergers and acquisitions, and corporate restructuring and advice. It will have a staff of eight. Capital market operations which require greater capital strength such as underwriting, bond trading and equity positions, will remain within KOP. Prospectus will be 50 per cent owned by KOP and 50 per cent by its executive management and is scheduled to start business on January 1. Mr Peter Fagernas, the company's managing director, said KOP was hoping to broaden its customer base with a more arms-length investment banking unit. Last year, Union Bank of Finland, KOP's main domestic competitor, spun off its investment banking operations into a unit called Mandatum. KOP's aim is to defend the bank's market position in new issues, where it has traditionally had a market share of around 50 per cent, and build up its position in corporate restructuring and advisory work. This year its share of new issues has been a strong 70 per cent due to its involvement in a number of internationally-directed issues for companies such as Metsa-Serla and Repola. KOP said it was ahead of its target to halve last year's FM3.7bn loss, as it disclosed a lower deficit of FM777m for the first eight months. This compares with a FM2.53bn loss in the same 1992 period. Falling interest rates and reduced credit losses have improved the bank's performance. Total income rose 58 per cent to FM3.35bn, while credit losses fell 18 per cent to FM1.96bn from FM2.39bn. Non-performing loans at August 31 amounted to FM8.1bn, FM985m higher than at the end of 1992 but FM115m down from the end of April. Mr Pertti Voutilainen, KOP chief executive, said: 'The crisis is not yet over but the worst seems to be past. We believe it will be possible to return to profit in 1995, assuming the Finnish economy gains momentum as expected.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vittoria Sivo: "We Must Fight the New Right"] </F>   [Text] Rome -- The Berlusconi-Bossi-Fini axis is "a serious  threat to democracy." Thus, led by Bruno Trentin and backed by  its powerful apparatus and the weight of its 5 million members,  the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor] is deploying  in mass against the "new right" and its "destabilizing and  subversive" plans.    A further sign of the difference between the upcoming  elections and previous ones is the unprecedentedly clear-cut way  in which the largest of the three trade union confederations has  taken sides. Has the sacred rule of trade union autonomy been  dispensed with?    Not at all, answered the trade union leaders at Corso Italia  [CGIL headquarters], because, contrary to other trade unions,  "we are not fighting for this or that party or coalition," but  rather "against" the bloc "made up by the League, Forza Italia,  and the former fascists."    This is a "duty," Trentin explained in the course of a press  conference, because this new right "is endangering the  individual and collective rights which our democracy -- despite  all its limitations and distortions -- has guaranteed over the  past 40 years." What is at stake is a heritage of democratic  conquests which "must be defended, enriched if anything, but  never called into question."    The CGIL's dislike for the coalition "that wants to organize  a right which is much more radical even than Thatcher or Reagan"  is so intense that a hardened Bruno Trentin has sent a copy of  the CGIL's electoral platform to all parties except to the  opposing group, just as in the past the trade union excluded the  parties that were outside the so-called constitutional spectrum  from the list of its interlocutors.    Illustrated by CGIL Secretary Angelo Airoldi, the CGIL's  document -- which is closer to a political appeal addressed to  its own activists than to a traditional list of priority social  and economic issues to be raised in the new parliament -- sets  out the "distinguishing criteria, regarding values and  alignments" which the trade union considers to be essential.    To begin with, antifascism, understood also as  "uncompromising opposition to those forms of authoritarianism,  racism, and contempt and aggression targeting those who are  weaker"; in the second place, "the defense of national unity, as  a concrete and necessary area" for effectively exercising  solidarity. "The CGIL urges its own members and workers in  general to follow these two criteria in the electoral campaign  and when casting their vote."    In referring to the referendums promoted by [Radical leader]  Marco Pannella, Silvio Berlusconi, and Umberto Bossi, the CGIL's  secretary general did not hesitate to define the right's aims as  "destructive" (albeit confused). Such aims range from the  request to abolish at-source taxation on employees' income  ("which would have devastating consequences in terms of being  certain of revenue levels from taxation"), to the abolition of  unemployment benefits ("a revenge against the weaker"), to  denying workers the right to chose their own trade union through  delegates.    A constant comparison was drawn between the new conservative  bloc and the practice of "social egoism, based on the denial of  solidarity" which is today expressed through "a wave of  neofascist group violence, directed at immigrants in particular."    Trentin referred to the recent attack in Ostia, and called  for stricter penal and civil provisions to punish this kind of  offense, including sexual offenses.    In this same vein, the CGIL is asking for immigrants to be  given voting rights in the local elections.    Many of the social and economic priorities listed in the  CGIL's platform are also shared by the CISL [Italian  Confederation of Trade Unions] and the UIL [Italian Federation  of Trade Unions]. The CGIL leader was keen to emphasize these  points in common, denying that the CGIL's initiative was to be  regarded as running counter to unity.    Regarding the controversial question of taxing treasury  bills, the Confederation is not siding either with [Democratic  Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto or Berlusconi, but  aims to adopt an autonomous position, as it has in the past. It  is in favor of making newly issued bills nominal -- "the  Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry] also  agrees" -- and gradually bringing all forms of income under the  taxation system. It is also in favor of reforming income tax on  financial operations and on the interest from treasury bills, by  abolishing the current proportional contributions and making  them progressive under the IRPEF [personal income tax] system.    In order not to penalize small savers, a tax-free income and  savings bracket should be introduced.    As regards employment, Bruno Trentin's trade union  confederation has not given up the idea of a "national  solidarity loan" which, instead of generic treasury bills to  cover the public debt, would offer bills with long-term, assured  returns. These would benefit from tax relief and be used to  constitute a development and job creation fund.</p>

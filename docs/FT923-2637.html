			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Exports might exceed last year's level ALUMINIUM exports from the CIS are expected to run at last year's level of 843,000 tonnes - but, depending on movements in the world price, might exceed this figure by 100,000 tonnes. Ivan Prokopov, president of the Russian state-owned aluminium concern covering smelters and refineries in Russia and the CIS, said the concern would 'be selling as much (aluminium) abroad as necessary for us to buy raw materials, equipment and spare parts'. At an aluminium conference in St Petersburg on Wednesday, Mr Prokopov denied Russian responsibility for a decline in aluminium prices, which the West attributes to a sharp increase in Russian exports. He blamed cheap aluminium from Brazil, Venezuela, Australia and Canada. However, Mr Prokopov admitted that independent CIS traders had contributed to the price fall. Mr A Stephens Hutcraft jnr, president of Kaiser Aluminium, said the western aluminium industry could barely operate at the current level of world prices. He said that world prices now stood at Dollars 1,300 a tonne. 'The unexpected export of 900,000 tonnes from Russia (in 1991) caused prices to drop by around Dollars 450 a tonne as the year progressed,' he said. He said tariffs and dumping claims were not an answer to this 'new reality' and called for inter-government talks. According to Mr Hodgcraft, the West will have to accommodate Russian exports of primary and scrap aluminium - 'and it means we in the West must balance supply with demand while assuming for the near term an annual range of 500,000 - 750,000 tonnes exported from Russia' The industry had lost 'something close to Dollars 7bn' in 1991 because it did not accommodate the pressures. Mr Valery Gazman, the deputy director of the International Fund for Privatisation and Foreign Investment in Russia, hoped Russian exports would become controlled once the new system of exporting strategic materials was enforced. Under this system, 13 organisations were granted the right to export aluminium from September 1. Mr Gazman also said the Russian government wanted a reduction of export tariffs for aluminium, from ECUs 200 - 75 a tonne. Mr Prokopov said that after a decline in production of aluminium in the CIS last year, this year's output would stay on the 1991 level of 3.25m tonnes - 85 per cent of that produced in Russia. He said that domestic demand could be increased by 15 to 20 per cent from 2.3 - 2.4m tonnes.</p>

Estimates are given of the possible changes which may  occur with an increase in global temperature by 1-2 and  3-4C. Predictions made at the State Hydrological Institute  on the basis of paleoclimatic reconstructions of warm epochs of  the past are used as climatic scenarios of the future. A model  with a monthly computation time interval was used for conversion  from the climatic parameters to hydrological characteristics.  The increase in temperature and precipitation in the Yenisey  basin which began in 1975 indirectly confirms the conclusion  that there has been a global warming of climate. At the present  time the rate of increase in temperature and precipitation in  this region exceeds the computed values for the Earth. However,  the increase in the mean annual precipitation has not resulted  in a change in annual and seasonal runoff. Under all scenarios  of change in the climatic situation runoff in the Yenisey basin  will substantially increase. With a climatic warming there will  be a seasonal redistribution of runoff and the duration of  winter will substantially decrease. The study was made without  allowance for the influence of permafrost on the hydrological  regime of rivers in the Yenisey basin under conditions of a  climatic warming, which would be especially significant with a  temperature increase &gt;  2-3C.

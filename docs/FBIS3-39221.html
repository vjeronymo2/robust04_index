Summing up a diplomatic marathon which ended with a meeting  of the Atlantic Council in Brussels Wednesday, Andreatta said  that on a political level one could say that "the trigger has  been pulled." This is the only way to see to it that the  cannons and heavy arms surrounding Sarajevo are eliminated,  Andreatta told the Senate foreign affairs committee this evening.    When a Communist Refoundation [Communist Renewal] spokesman  objected to his reference to a pulled trigger, Andreatta said if  ever there was an occasion in which the arms of the European  Union and of NATO could be used for a universal goal of  international justice it was the present need to lift the siege  of Sarajevo.    Andreatta reported that he had sent a message to the U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher Monday in which the  Italian position was reiterated. Italy is convinced of the  urgent need to stop the lethal shelling of Sarajevo and backs  the idea of using air power to force the withdrawal of all heavy  artillery from the hills around the city, he stressed.  Nevertheless, the basic goal is to issue a stern warning to all  sides to go all out to find a negotiated solution to the  conflict in Bosnia, he said.    The Croatians must exercise the greatest flexibility when it  comes to ensuring the Muslims access to the sea and Zagreb must  "without delay" proceed to the withdrawal of its military forces  from Bosnia, he said. Andreatta remains convinced that an  agreement between the Croatians and the Muslims is fundamental  to reaching any overall agreement on Bosnia.    The Italian foreign minister also insisted on the need for  greater involvement on the part of the United States, Russia and  the Islamic countries. He felt that Russian reservations about  the "juridicial legitimacy" of any UN request for intervention  in Bosnia, were too narrow. Andreatta also urged that the  United States throw its full support between the European  Union's action plan.    U.S. Secretary of Defense William J. Perry today contacted  Italian Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri by telephone to discuss  the Bosnian crisis following the NATO decision to put a halt to  the siege of Sarajevo. The two sides confirmed their  determination to follow up on actions agreed upon along with the  United Nations. Italy would provide logistical support for NATO  air forces standing ready to carry out missions in Bosnia.  [passage omitted]    The Vatican daily OSSERVATORE ROMANO said that the West's  commitment relaunched concrete prospects for an accord and  offered concrete hope to the people of Sarajevo.

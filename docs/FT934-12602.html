			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Arts: Old hippie cool - Concert Jackson Browne made a rare visit to London at the weekend: when a man's got a new album to promote, no sacrifice is too great. In a way he has always been a distant voice rather than a solid body - the voice that spoke for a generation of soulful romantic 1970s students who indulged their broken hearts and painful ideals by listening to his songs of tortured relationships and fractured hopes. No handsome, intelligent, sensitive millionaire can have suffered so much at the hands of women. For someone roughly handled by fate, and whose body has been rigorously exposed to the Californian drug culture, Browne looks in remarkably good shape: much better than his audience. The lank of bonny brown hair still sets off a sensitive, slightly hungry looking face; the voice remains high and yearning; the band is as accomplished as only a West Coast folk-rock combo can be. And the new songs, generously aired at the Cambridge Theatre, London, suggest Browne still has trouble with women, is still searching for personal fulfilment in a better world. But 'My Problem is You' and 'I Hear Your Heart Beating Everywhere' have a softer, almost Fleetwood Mac-ish undertone: it is the laid back sound of California, the legacy of old hippie cool. Browne is not so pitiful now. Indeed some of my favourite Browne songs of the past, guaranteed sobbers like 'Here Come Those Tears Again' and 'Fountains of Sorrow', were squeezed out of the programme. This was an up-beat Browne, glad to be here and intent on putting on a professional show for the BBC, which was recording the concert. This meant that the tricky vibrato at the end of 'Linda Paloma' had to be repeated to make sure the note was hit. Browne was a bit fussy generally, although he still managed to drawl away down conversational side roads. Browne has promised a quick return visit. It is needed. This was a pleasant evening, but while he may have outgrown some of the great emotional ballads, for his fans the old days were still probably the best days. Some of the memory jerkers were performed. 'The Pretender' now sounds pretentious but 'Before the Deluge' powerfully evokes the fears of those dear dead days, and 'Running on Empty' is now a classic rock standard. No one was better at stretching clever metaphors over long pounding chords to voice the preoccupations of an era. Musically Browne has progressed little: this concert could have been preserved in aspic from two decades ago. But he now enjoys the carapace of a survivor, and has gone gentle.</p>

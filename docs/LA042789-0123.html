			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CITY SECTION CANCELS GRANT-RESEDA GAME IN WAKE OF BRAWL  </P> <P> The City Section has canceled today's Valley Pac-8 Conference baseball game  between Grant High and Reseda as a result of a bench-clearing brawl that ended  Tuesday's game between the same teams in the fifth inning.  </P> <P> In addition, the status of Tuesday's game, won by Grant, 13-1, in five innings,  remains in doubt pending a decision by City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness.  </P> <P> Under City Section rules, the game could be ruled a loss for both teams or be  rescheduled. In addition, the City could suspend players who participated in  the fight for the remainder of the season. Harkness declined comment Wednesday,  saying he will rule after examining written reports submitted by both schools  and the game umpires.  </P> <P> The fight began at the conclusion of the fifth inning at Reseda after Grant's  Stanley Spancer and Reseda's Rod Stricklin exchanged words. Grant is 11-4  overall and 8-3 and tied for second place in the East Valley League with Poly,  a game behind Sylmar. Reseda is 4-11, 1-10.  </P></p>

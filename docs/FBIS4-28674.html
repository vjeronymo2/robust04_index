			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "A Bellicose Outburst Aimed </F> at Crushing the Fellow Countrymen"]    [Text] According to a radio report from Seoul, the puppet  Kim Yong-sam clique chaired a so-called National Security  Council meeting on 8 June. He made bellicose and absurd remarks  at the meeting under the pretext of our so-called nuclear issue  that strong steps should be taken to resolve the nuclear issue  through UN sanctions, and that there is no other alternative but  sanctions to resolve the issue. This shows that the South  Korean puppets are pursuing what is called multinational  sanctions against us with the backing of outside forces.  Therefore, their acts are antinational criminal acts that can  never be forgiven.    Furthermore, the puppet clique is crying about the  inevitability of sanctions against the same fellow countrymen at  a time when the UN Security Council has recently issued an  extravagant presidential statement against us and the United  States and its followers have openly plotted to impose sanctions  on us, thus making an issue of our Republic's peaceful use of  nuclear energy. We cannot repress our rising indignation  regarding this.    As has already been reported, the U.S. warmongers have  recently run amok with a commotion of military pressure against  us, while openly babbling, under the pretext of our nuclear  issue, that a preemptive strike [sonje konggyok] against North  Korea remains an option.    The U.S. imperialists have put their troops occupying South  Korea on a 24-hour alert against us and, at the same time, have  deployed the large aircraft carrier Independence to waters where  it can participate within a few days in a operation of a  northward invasion. Also, they have continued their warmanics  by saying that they will change the location of the Rimpac war  exercise to the waters off the East Sea of Korea.    Several days ago, the U.S. imperialist aggressive forces  occupying South Korea even conducted a so-called noncombatant  evacuation operation in Pusan, which entails preparing select  U.S. soldiers and their dependents for a quick departure from  South Korea if an emergency situation occurs on the Korean  peninsula. Such an act by the U.S. imperialists shows that  they, by setting a northward invasion war as their goal, are  more viciously sticking to commotions to crush [apsal] us.    At this juncture, the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique is loudly  babbling about so-called sanctions, playing into the hands of  the U.S. imperialists, their masters. This clearly shows that  the South Korean puppets -- who are thoroughly colonial servants  -- as well as the antinational groups -- who are madly playing  for the sake of the interests of outside forces -- are not  considering the destiny of the nation.    Actually, the South Korean puppets are running amok with war  preparations to provoke a northward invasion war as demanded by  their masters, the U.S. imperialists. Also, they are madly  carrying out their fascist-oriented suppression -- which is  their usual way [sangnye] to provoke the northward invasion war  -- upon the reunification and democratic forces.    They have inspired a war atmosphere by placing the puppet  army on around-the-clock alert posture and, also, have attempted  to suppress and exterminate the South Korean people's spirit for  the anti-U.S., antigovernment, and antipuppet struggle, thus  placing the police throughout South Korea under emergency duty  orders and kicking up a commotion of check and search. The  events now taking place in South Korea can only be seen as the  eve of a war. These also vividly prove the South Korean  puppets' attempt to push, without fail, our nation into the  disaster of a nuclear war.    The Kim Yong-sam groups, who commit criminal acts against  the  nation, should be sternly punished by the nation. We have urged  the Kim Yong-sam group to immediately stop committing the  criminal act of making the land of our fatherland become the  place of outside forces' nuclear war, thus warning it as much as  it can accept [padadulrilmankum kyonggo hamyoso] that the  so-called sanctions, which the imperialists plan to impose under  the pretext of the suspicion of our nonexistent nuclear  development, mean a war, and that there is no charity [chabi] in  war. The Kim Yong-sam group, however, held the National  Security Council meeting by ignoring our warning and have  brought about the black cloud of nuclear war, thus more loudly  babbling about the sanctions.    The Kim Yong-sam ring, treacherous group, who regards the  interests of outside forces as more important than a warning  from the same fellow countrymen, can never be safe. If the Kim  Yong-sam ring wants to achieve their dirty political goal by  carrying out sanctions in collusion with outside forces against  the fellow countrymen, thus not considering the interests of the  nation, it will be a big miscalculation. The Kim Yong-sam ring  should be clearly aware that if they embark upon the road of  adventure, their civil government will come to an end.</p>

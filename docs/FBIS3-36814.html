Security Council.    The Yabloko group adopted a statement saying that "the  drawing of the NATO military-political bloc into an armed  conflict outside the NATO boundaries is fraught with the  upsetting of a military-political balance in Europe." They  stressed that such involvement in the Yugoslav crisis "runs  counter to the national and state interests of Russia."    The Yabloko group is sure that the search for a peaceful way  of settling the Yugoslav conflict should be supported and  continued. The Yabloko group urged Russia to play a more active  political role in that conflict and, at the same time, warned  against being drawn into it. In the opinion of its members, "a  gradual peaceful settlement may be reached by the tested  methods, suggested by the London Conference."</p>

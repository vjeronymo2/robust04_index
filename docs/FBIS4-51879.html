In his work Comrade Kim Chong-il set forth the highly  important tasks to build, strengthen and develop the trade  unions including the tasks to push ahead with the three  revolutions, ideological, technical and cultural, further  enhance the role of trade union organizations in the socialist  construction, firmly build up the trade union ranks and enhance  the militant function of the trade union organizations.    Referring to the validity and vitality of the work, the  article says:    They are evidently manifested in the fact that continued  innovations and upswing are being effected in the socialist  construction because, with the three revolutions successfully  carried out, the Korean working class has been well prepared as  faithful ranks which hold in esteem the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il in one mind of loyalty and filial piety, and the  leading and vanguard role of the working class has been enhanced.    Technical and cultural revolutions, along with the  ideological revolution, have been pushed ahead among the working  class and trade union members. As a result, their technical and  cultural standard is constantly increasing and their sense of  duty and role in carrying out the technical revolution is  growing more and more.    With the promotion of creative cooperation between workers  and scientists and technicians, scientific and technical  problems arising in putting the national economy on a  chuche-oriented, modernized and scientific basis have been  satisfactorily solved. Thus, the chuche character and  independence of our industry have been consistently strengthened  and production is going up at a fast speed.    Through the efforts to implement the idea and theory and  policies set forth in the work, the party's economic policy  propaganda and economic agitation have been activated and  various forms of mass movements and socialist emulation drives  have been dynamically conducted by the trade union organizations  to powerfully encourage the working class and union members to  the socialist economic construction.    In the flame of the socialist emulation drives our working  class and trade union members made big innovative achievements  in the fulfilment of the third seven-year plan and successfully  carried out large-scale projects for the everlasting prosperity  of the country.    The validity and vitality are also expressed in that the  trade union ranks have been firmly built up and their militant  function and role enhanced considerably, the article says.</p>

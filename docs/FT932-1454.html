			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (3): A golden prize worth having - Ian Hamilton Fazey examines the pros and cons of bidding for the Olympics and analyses the experience of other cities - Economic Impact IS IT worth it? An analysis by Tim Johnson of KPMG Peat Marwick says it would be, with more than Pounds 4bn of extra spending power injected into the regional economy and more than 11,000 jobs created if Manchester's bid for the Games succeeds. But is it worth it to bid and fail? 'Manchester's bid is already bringing significant economic benefit to the north-west region,' says Mr Johnson, an accountant specialising in urban regeneration and partnership between public and private sectors. 'The international image of Manchester and north-west England was improved during the 1996 bid. It has been enhanced by the 2000 bid, which is seen as even stronger and more exciting,' he says. He estimates that about Pounds 200m of expenditure, supporting 480 jobs, will be created in the region as a result of the capital investment in new facilities - such as the velodrome and arena - which support the bid. Bidding is therefore already adding value to the regional economy. The real prizes, however, come with the Games themselves, and this is proved by the 1984 Los Angeles Games. A study by Economic Research Associates revealed substantial benefits to the local economy. This was estimated at Dollars 2.4bn of spending at 1984 values and 7,560 jobs. The payroll was worth Dollars 1.3bn, most of it going to local people. Less than half of the spending was associated with the primary impact of the Games - about Dollars 1.5bn and 5,000 jobs arose from the effect of the Games on the more general economy around them. About 90 per cent of all added value was estimated to have occurred in the local economy. Los Angeles, however, did not need to build many facilities. Seoul, which followed in 1988, did. The Korea Development Institute claims 33,600 jobs were created by the Games, nearly two-thirds of them in the five years from 1982, when stadiums, arenas and other facilities were being built. It estimates about Dollars 3.6bn of spending which South Korea would not otherwise have had. Barcelona's actual figures have not yet been finalised but Mr Johnson quotes figures from the Ajuntament de Barcelona's report on the economic impact of the 1992 Games. These suggest about Dollars 6.7bn of investment to stage them, but more than half of this went on infrastructure improvements to roads, hotels, the airport and telecommunications. However, the Olympics appear to have been responsible for generating more than Dollars 8bn of total spending, with 128,000 jobs created in the Spanish economy as a whole between 1987 and 1992. Total expenditure during these years was equivalent to about 0.9 per cent of annual gross domestic product. There was also a stream of less tangible but nevertheless important effects. The Games stimulated technological innovation. Improvements to the infrastructure will help the Catalan economy for decades to come: new sporting facilities were built in more than a dozen towns in the region; depressed areas of Barcelona were regenerated and its waterfront transformed; and the airport improved its international capability. KPMG Peat Marwick and the University of Georgia have carried out an initial study on the likely economic impact. As with Los Angeles, there is already a range of pre-existing facilities. A total impact of about Dollars 3.5bn is expected from Games-related and Games-induced spending. Mr Johnson says about Dollars 1.1bn of earnings should be generated, supporting nearly 84,000 full-time and part-time jobs. Atlanta will also try to maximise the impact through monitoring, measurement, control and management. At other Games it was assumed there would be benefits - and they did flow. The accountancy firm and the university are now assisting in a long-term programme to develop a co-ordinated strategy to identify and monitor accurately the channels of impact of the Games upon the local economy. The aim will be to make them as beneficial as possible. It is against this background that Manchester is searching for its own bonanza. Mr Johnson's study suggests capital investment for the Games, coupled with operating and visitor spending, would support about Pounds 4.1bn of regional spending, generating 111,450 person-years of employment, which by convention equates to 11,145 full-time equivalent jobs. This converts to about Dollars 6.4bn for comparative purposes with Atlanta's Dollars 3.5bn, Barcelona's Dollars 8.3bn, Seoul's Dollars 3.6bn and Dollars 2.4bn in Los Angeles. Manchester and the north-west would have to build a main stadium and several other significant facilities - some of which are already under construction  -but what is already in place is the north-west's outstanding infrastructure. Its network of motorways allows most of the region to be traversed in well under an hour from whatever starting point; the railway network is almost complete, Metrolink, Manchester's super tram system, will be comprehensive by 2000, running to Trafford Park and the main Olympic sites; and its airport - already a thriving hub - will probably by then be about the 12th largest in the world league table. The KPMG Peat Marwick study suggests the cumulative impact of the Games, if Manchester wins, would be worth about 10 per cent of north-west England's present annual gross domestic product. The direct capital investment programme needed - mainly for facilities - would be Pounds 1.5bn. Although this sounds a lot of money, however, it should be put in a wider context. It is about equal to the aggregate investment of north-west manufacturing industry in a non-recession year and is about one-third of total annual investment within the region by all industries and the public sector. Longer-term benefits could be confidently expected from new inward investment and investment retained in the region. The latter is important: holding on to what you already have is crucial in economic development, especially with other areas in Britain and the rest of Europe offering various temptations to persuade businesses to relocate to seemingly greener pastures. The Games' legacy would also be an infrastructure of world-class facilities and associated commercial developments. These would have to be positively managed to prevent their becoming white elephants. The Olympic village, however, would be needed anyway: Manchester's network of universities and colleges have already turned the city into the largest campus in Europe and accommodation is a perpetual problem. A less tangible benefit would be the effect on morale. The Games would greatly enhance north-west England's image and self-belief. Mr Johnson reckons there would be much economic development from new opportunities for partnership between private, public and voluntary sectors and a great deal of additional, but permanent, economic activity. This could generate more than Pounds 400m of additional tax revenue for government. There are, of course, risks. In Montreal, Olympic-induced debt has outweighed the benefits of the 1976 Games. Japan's capital investment in the 1964 Tokyo Olympiad was a burden on the whole economy and adversely affected the balance of trade during the years of run-up. However, lessons have been learned, most notably from Los Angeles in 1984, when the Games were saved by good management, television revenues, and the combined efforts of public and private sectors. With UK government support and the north-west public and private sectors in concert, Manchester is hoping to come out well ahead financially, whatever happens in Monte Carlo in September.</p>

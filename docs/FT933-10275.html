			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / OFT wants credit trade deregulated SUBSTANTIAL deregulation of the marketing of consumer credit is suggested by the Office of Fair Trading in a discussion document published yesterday. The OFT also suggests deregulating credit agreements and lifting some of the criminal law's sanctions against the credit industry. The document is part of the OFT's review of the 1974 Consumer Credit Act, requested by the Department of Trade and Industry under the government's deregulation initiative. Mr John Mills, OFT director of consumer affairs, said yesterday that he wanted to explore the scope for greater self-regulation by the credit industry. The Consumers' Association expressed concern over the proposals 'given the track record of self-regulation' in the financial services sector. The OFT stresses that protection of consumers is paramount but says that the act and its regulations - which govern credit agreements up to Pounds 15,000  -might be imposing greater burdens on providers of credit than are necessary for effective consumer protection. It says the current system of licensing credit providers is not up for review, but the OFT is considering setting tougher conditions for the granting and retaining of licences, while relaxing detailed regulations. The discussion document invites comment on specific areas where the OFT believes regulations might be cut. It has asked for comment on whether the detailed regulations on credit advertising deliver high standards in practice and suggests that credit advertisements could be subject to self-regulation by the Advertising Standards Authority or a similar body. The OFT also questions the effectiveness of 'health warnings' in credit advertisements - such as the requirement for mortgage adverts to warn of the danger of loss of the home if payments are not kept up. It invites local authorities and trading standards officers to estimate the cost of enforcing the credit act and asks whether criminal sanctions are the appropriate way of enforcing the rules. The OFT says deregulation would reduce costs for the lending organisations. The Consumers' Association said the OFT's thinking was weighted too heavily in favour of lenders. Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the association, said: 'All our research and evidence suggests that much tighter control of marketing is needed.' She added that the OFT was wrong to rely on the licensing system which is not an effective policing mechanism. The Consumer Credit Act prescribes a range of monetary limits for which the act's provisions apply. The OFT suggests that the limits - which were last revised in 1982 - should be reviewed so that the act applies to credit agreements up to Pounds 30,000. Lending and hiring to business customers is not discussed in the consultation document, although the government's deregulation task forces have suggested removing such agreements from the act. The OFT has advised the government against such a course and plans to publish a discussion document in the autumn on the treatment of business customers under the act. The deadline for responses to the document is October 20. Public hearings will be held in London on October 27-28 and in Leeds on November 2.

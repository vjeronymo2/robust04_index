			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Italy rallies on hopes of cut in budget deficit EUROPEAN markets were generally firm yesterday, with a strong rally in Italy following a parliamentary vote in favour of the government's deficit-reducing budget proposals. The upper house of the Italian parliament approved a package of budget measures covering health and pensions reform by an overwhelming majority. Analysts said the vote was a positive sign that the government of Mr Giulio Amato will be able to reduce the budget deficit next year. On Liffe, the 10-year BTP bond contract closed at 91.25, from an opening level of 90.15. Sentiment was also buoyed by an easing of money market interest rates, increasing speculation that the authorities will soon cut the discount rate. Call money rates fell from 14.23 per cent to 13.97 per cent following Bank of Italy repurchase operations. GERMAN government bonds opened higher following Wednesday's easing of money market interest rates, but the positive mood was not sustained. On Liffe, the 10-year bund future closed at 91.35, below the day's opening level of 91.45. The Bundesbank switched to variable rate repurchase operations this week - rather than supplying liquidity at a fixed rate - allowing money rates to drift lower. Yesterday, call money was mostly traded at 8.75 to 8.85 per cent. However, analysts dismissed hopes of an immediate cut in the discount or Lombard rates. Ecu bonds held on to gains made earlier this week, encouraged by government measures to improve market liquidity. The French treasury announced plans to establish a Ecu700m stock lending fund for Ecu bond marketmakers. Bond prices were little changed yesterday. However, 10-year bond yields have fallen by 40 basis points over the last week. UK government bonds moved higher, encouraged by a narrowing of the trade deficit during September. The best gains were at around the 10-year maturity, although short-dated stocks closed about  1/8 of a point up on the day. The UK's visible trade deficit narrowed from Pounds 1.15bn during August to Pounds 1.06bn last month. The value of both imports and exports fell. Analysts said the figures underlined that there was little hope of an export-led recovery prior to sterling's effective devaluation. The devaluation should boost the competitive position of UK exporters, although the value of imports will also rise. The 9 3/4 per cent gilt maturing 2002 closed at 109 9/32 , up  1/4 of a point from the opening, for a yield of 9.03 per cent. On Liffe, the December bond future fell back from an opening level of 99.19 to 99.12 by the close. Volume was subdued at 30,000 contracts. JAPANESE government bonds closed higher yesterday, following a better-than-expected auction of 10-year bonds and continued anticipation of lower interest rates. The benchmark government bond No 145 closed on a yield of 4.77 per cent, from an opening level of 4.845 per cent. The Bank of Japan's regular monthly auction stock saw Y80bn 5 per cent bonds sold at an average bid price of 100.24. The good response to the auction drove prices higher in the secondary market. Hopes of an interest cut were fuelled by a speech by Mr Yasushi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, who said any economic recovery in Japan would be slow. US Treasury prices were weaker yesterday but above their early morning lows, when an unexpected decline in jobless claims and heavy selling on the Chicago futures and options market had sent bonds tumbling. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/16 at 95, yielding 7.611 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down  1/16 at 99 9/16 , to yield 4.219 per cent. Prices were little changed at the start, but fell on news of a 15,000 fall in weekly jobless claims. The market then dropped sharply following a big sale of December bond futures in Chicago. The sell order, which was accompanied by a order to buy December bond puts, sparked further declines in the cash markets and attracted a lot of attention. There were reports that the trades may have violated the rules of the Chicago Board of Trade, but some sources later indicated that the trades had been due to a mistake. Once the futures market had settled, prices in New York recovered.</p>

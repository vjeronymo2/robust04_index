			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Spain and VW reach agreementon Seat SPANISH political leaders and Volkswagen, the German automotive group, reached broad agreement yesterday on a plan for VW to rid itself of the Barcelona factory of its lossmaking Seat subsidiary, while protecting Spain's government from the political fall-out of heavy job losses in Catalonia. Further talks will be held soon, to include union leaders, to decide the fate of the outdated Zona Franca works and the 10,500 employed on the site, VW said last night. A solution is expected before the end of the year. Ideas proposed yesterday are believed to include converting the factory into an industrial park and establishing a state-owned employment company to deal with those who lose their jobs. The deal was agreed during talks in Madrid and Barcelona led by Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW group chairman, Mr Narcis Serra, deputy prime minister, and Mr Jordi Pujol, leader of the Catalonian government. The agreement sees a significant relaxation of the conditions under which Seat is to be given a DM1.5bn (Pounds 600m) cash injection. Ownership of the Spanish company's Pamplona factory, used exclusively to build VW Polo models, will not now be transferred to the German parent. Although operations will be 'steered' by VW, it will remain under Spanish management. The government said Mr Piech and Mr Serra had agreed to find a solution which involves an increase in productivity for Seat to recover its competitiveness. That is likely to mean VW will insist on the loss of most of the jobs at Zona Franca, although some workers may be found places at Seat's new plant at Martorell, around 30km from Barcelona.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Exchange Rule 958 sets forth the obligations of Traders when they initiate options transactions on the floor of the Exchange for accounts in which they have an interest. These obligations include, but are not limited to, contributing to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, bidding and offering within prescribed parameters and, when establishing or increasing an options position, initiating such transactions on the floor of the Exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange now proposes to establish an additional requirement that at least 25% of a Trader's transactions and contract volume during each calendar quarter be executed in person and not through the use of orders given to a floor broker or left on a specialist's book. The Exchange believes that establishing such a requirement will result in better, more liquid markets because Traders will be available in trading crowds to contribute to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to make competitive bids and offers, and to trade for their own account when there exists a lack of price continuity, a temporary disparity between the supply of and demand for options contracts or a temporary distortion of the price relationships between options. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Exchange believes an in person requirement of 25% is appropriate at this time, it is further proposed that the Exchange be given the authority to increase the in person requirement above 25% should such action be deemed necessary by the Exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange also proposes to extend favorable capital and margin treatment to certain opening orders entered by Traders from off the Exchange floor provided at least 80% of their total transactions and contract volume is executed in person during any calendar quarter. These off-floor orders shall also be subject to Rule 958 and may be effected only for the purpose of hedging, reducing the risk of, or rebalancing a Trader's open positions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, pursuant to Exchange Rule 958, only transactions initiated on the floor of the Exchange can count as Registered Trader transactions. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  Only on-floor transactions qualify for favorable capital and margin treatment, even if such orders are entered to adjust or hedge the risk of a Trader's positions that are the result of on-floor market making activity. Because Traders cannot, according to the Exchange, effectively adjust positions or engage in hedging or other risk-limiting opening transactions from off the Exchange floor without incurring a significant economic penalty, they must be either physically present on the floor at all times while the market is open, or face significant risk of adverse market movements during those times when they must necessarily be absent from the trading floor. The Exchange believes that the imposition of these costs on such risk-adjusting transactions prevents Traders from effectively discharging their market making obligations and exposes them to unacceptable levels of risk. The Exchange believes that the proposal presents a more appropriate and realistic treatment of Traders' transactions initiated from off-floor than is currently provided by Exchange rules. Extending favorable capital and margin treatment to off-floor transactions to those Traders who satisfy an 80% in person requirement will, in the Exchange's opinion, increase the extent to which Traders' transactions contribute to liquidity and to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets by providing for a greater degree of in person trading and by enabling Traders to better manage the risk of their market making. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amex Rule 958, Commentary .01. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III.

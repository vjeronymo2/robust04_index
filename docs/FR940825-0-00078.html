			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following OMB Circular A&hyph;110, we have organized the structure of part 74 into a more ``user friendly'' format that follows the sequential steps of the normal awards management cycle: Pre-award, post-award, and after-the-award or closeout. In addition, HHS has elected to continue to have special additional rules, which currently appear at subpart AA, that apply only to awards to commercial organizations. The amended part 74, therefore, has six subparts as follows: subpart A_General; subpart B_Pre-Award Requirements; subpart C_Post-Award Requirements; subpart D_After-The-Award Requirements; subpart E_Special Provisions For Awards to Commercial Organizations; and subpart F_Disputes. As noted above, a new appendix A has been added to part 74_Contract Provisions. What follows is a general presentation of the change from the current part 74 that have been made to align the rule with the organization and standards of Circular A&hyph;110. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Like its predecessor, the revised subpart A, General, includes provisions covering Purpose and Applicability, Definitions, and Deviations; however, these provisions have been revised pursuant to the Circular. All references to ``OPAL'' here and elsewhere in the current rule have been deleted since that Office no longer exists in HHS. The current provision regarding Appeals, &sect;74.5, is deleted as being unnecessary in view of the provisions on Termination and Enforcement at revised subpart C and the Dispute provisions at revised subpart F. The current provision on special grant or subgrant conditions, &sect;74.7, is removed as modified by the Circular to the revised subpart B, Pre-Award Requirements, &sect;74.14.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised &sect;74.1(a)(3), Purpose and Applicability, expressly recognizes part 74's longstanding applicability to the entitlement programs identified at 45 CFR 92.4 (a)(3), (a)(7) and (a)(8), subject of course to any statutory provision that may preempt a particular part 74 regulation. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 53 FR 8078, 8079 (Mar. 11, 1988).) Also, in keeping with the current exemption of these programs at &sect;74.100 (a) and (b) from application of the existing subpart L, Programmatic Changes and Budget Revisions, the revised &sect;74.1(a)(3) makes clear that &sect;74.25, Revision of program and budget plans, of the revised subpart C does not apply. In addition, because the government recipients of entitlement program awards do not use the conventional application forms when seeking HHS funds, we have also made &sect;74.12 of the revised subpart B inapplicable to these programs. HHS, OMB, and the Department of Agriculture intend in the future to propose either a separate new regulation for the entitlement programs or a complete revision of OMB Circular A&hyph;102 common rule (45 CFR part 92 for HHS). When that effort is completed, either a new separate regulation or an amended part 92, but not this part, will apply to the entitlement programs; until that time, part 74 remains applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions of the current &sect;74.4(a)(2), which make certain provisions of part 74 applicable to grants made under programs other than the entitlement programs, are eliminated because we have determined that it is no longer necessary to make these provisions applicable to governmental recipients of HHS funds. They are largely out of date or their significance has diminished considerably from when they were first promulgated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A new provision is included at &sect;74.5, Subawards, which establishes the general rule that this part applies to all subawards made under awards that are subject to this part unless a particular provision specifically excludes subrecipients from coverage. This rule departs from the current part 74 approach to identifying when provisions apply to subrecipients. Whereas the current &sect;74.4(b) provides that the language of the various provisions that followed would indicate whether a provision applied to subrecipients, the new &sect;74.5 serves as a single umbrella provision bringing all applicable subawards under Part 74 coverage. The current &sect;74.7(c), 74.24(b), 74.97, 74.100(c), 74.102(b), 74.116, 74.143, 74.163, and 74.176, which contain specific rules regarding subgrants, are, therefore, eliminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another new provision is added, Effect on other issuances, at &sect;74.3 to make clear that part 74, as amended herein, is the authoritative statement of HHS award administration policy subject only to any statutory overrides or deviations approved by OMB or deviations applied on an award-by-award basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised subpart B sets forth the rules that apply in the pre-award process covering pre-award policies, application forms, debarment and suspension, special award conditions, and certifications and representations. In keeping with the Circular, two new provisions have been added covering application of the Metric Conversion Act, as amended, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, &sect;&sect;74.15 and 74.16, respectively. Section 74.10, Physical segregation and eligibility, of the current subpart B is removed as modified by the Circular to the Financial and Program management provisions of the Revised subpart C, Post-Award Requirements, &sect;74.22(I). Major changes have taken place in the method that the Federal government uses to transfer Federal funds to recipients of Federal awards. Section 74.11, Checks-paid basis letter of credit, of the current subpart is eliminated because it has been overtaken by these changes and thus, no longer applies. Provisions that reflect the new payment methods and systems appear at the revised subpart C, &sect;74.22, Payment. Section. 74.12, Minority-owned banks of the current subpart B is removed as modified by the Circular to add coverage of women-owned banks to the revised subpart C, &sect;74.22(j).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

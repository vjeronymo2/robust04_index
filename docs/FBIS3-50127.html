			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky: "Partnership </F> for Peace -- Slow Return to the West"]    [Text] In the period of the cold war, most Hungarians --  including me -- saw NATO as the symbol of hope that communism  would not prevail in the West and, as a result, we would also  one day regain our freedom. For 45 years, NATO has successfully  preserved peace and the Euro-Atlantic system of values, and it  introduced the spirit of cooperation in a Western Europe torn  apart by war.    These achievements should also spread to the eastern part of  Europe. Hungary and other Central European countries would like  to see guarantees that the changes of 1989-1990 are irreversible  and that their return to the western world is taking place in an  institutional framework, and not only through momentary,  economic and political relations. Given the fact that there are  no chances of gaining full membership in the European Union  before the end of this decade, NATO is the only organization  that can facilitate a rapid and secure implementation of our  goals. Today, Central Europe can be compared to some kind of  no-man's-land where, in addition to the threat of  neo-imperialism, which cannot be totally excluded, economic and  environmental security are not guaranteed either. Hungary must  join the well-functioning Western structures to encourage  foreign investments and an increase in the number of tourists,  and to strengthen confidence in Hungary. We are at most halfway  through the implementation of these goals.    At the Copenhagen summit held in June 1993, the Council of  Europe set out the goal of opening up toward the East. Six  Central and Eastern European countries signed partnership  treaties with the European Union; two of them, the treaties  signed with Hungary and Poland, will come into force as from 1  February 1994, and the ratification of the other treaties is  currently under way. A similar decision emerged at the NATO  summit in Brussels on 10 January 1994: The "Partnership for  Peace" program makes it clear that the countries that are  successful in this cooperation could hope for NATO membership.  At his meeting with the Visegrad four on 12 January 1994, U.S.  President Bill Clinton confirmed that the security of Central  Europe is also vital for the security of the United States.    I think this view is not completely in harmony with the  spirit of the Partnership for Peace program. Although  Washington mostly accepted Moscow's position, the decisions made  in Brussels and Prague offer more advantageous opportunities for  Central Europe than a mere relocation of the former Iron Curtain  more to the East. Our region, which was the scene of two world  wars, does not want to be a border area or a battle ground  again. A partnership relation between NATO and Russia is much  more important for us than mere NATO membership for Hungary and  having to face an big enemy power. Therefore, it is better to  wait, although this also has its risks.    As for the various criticisms regarding the Partnership for  Peace plan, this peace partnership does not refer to everyone:  While the "self-selection system" awards the pioneers and the  good students, it is also an encouragement to those who have  fallen behind. The Brussels decision helps both Ukraine and  Russia, and we are particularly glad that the recent  Russian-U.S.-Ukrainian agreement on nuclear weapons received a  new impetus in Hungary on 18 December 1993, when Leonid Kravchuk  and Al Gore met here on the occasion of the funeral of the late  Hungarian prime minister.    The meeting in Prague strengthened the Visegrad and Central  European cooperation, something that has had priority for  Hungary since 1990, and the recent U.S position also  strengthened this.    The other argument against expanding NATO says that the  conflicts between some countries that want to join NATO would  weaken the alliance. This excuse is unfounded. Organizations  like the national minority chief commissioner of the Council of  Europe or the CSCE are capable of coping with this problem, like  the tensions deriving from the situation of 3.5 million ethnic  Hungarians living on the territory of our neighbors, people who  feel that the majority of the population shows hostile feelings  toward them and their rights are not guaranteed. Together with  the European Union and the Western European Union, NATO will  contribute to the development of a more favorable atmosphere, to  the solving or at least the easing of these tensions. At the  same time, if the behavioral norms prevailing in Western Europe  since the end of World War II spread to Central and Eastern  Europe and penetrate the political elite, the armed forces, and  the youth, the existing tensions might decrease considerably.    We think that the Partnership for Peace program is the way  that leads directly to NATO, and we are striving to make use of  every opportunity for cooperation, whether political,  diplomatic, consultative, military, logistic, or any other  opportunity. We admit that full membership must be preceded by  a long preparatory process, but we are convinced that we will  fulfill the NATO demands in a few years. Our commitment is  clear. From this moment, what have become the basic questions  of our security policy are when and how.</p>

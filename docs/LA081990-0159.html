			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN;  </P> <P> DENVER IS A LOGICAL SITE FOR NL EXPANSION  </P> <P> With the National League scheduled to add two expansion teams in 1993, Denver  enthusiasts were a mile high, literally and figuratively, after voters in a  six-county tax district Tuesday approved a 0.1% sales tax that will help fund a  $140-million, open-air stadium seating about 40,000 and patterned, to an  extent, on the intimacy of Boston's Fenway Park and Chicago's Wrigley Field.  </P> <P> The tax kicks in only if Denver gets a team, but the 55%-45% approval is seen  as eliminating the expansion hopes of stadium-less Phoenix and assuring Denver  of one of the two '93 franchises, providing the NL, as many believe, is seeking  untapped markets and intending to expand on an East-West basis.  </P> <P> The Rocky Mountain corridor, with a regional population base of about 12  million to 15 million, would provide the NL with a bridge between St. Louis and  the West Coast, and a geographical complement to either Orlando or Tampa-St  Petersburg, Fla., one of which is expected to receive the other franchise.  </P> <P> The new stadium will not be ready until 1995, meaning a Denver team would have  to share Mile High Stadium with the NFL's Broncos, as Denver's American Assn.  team does. But the NL's expansion committee has said it can live with a minor  league arrangement, providing an alternative is on the drawing board.  </P> <P> The next step for Denver is finding an owner or group of owners willing to pay  the National League franchise fee of $95 million and another $50 million in  estimated start-up expenses.  </P> <P> A meeting of interested parties in Denver Friday led to the belief that a  syndicate including members of Denver's cable television industry (the area is  known as the Cable Capital), the Coors Brewing Co. and the Scripps-Howard  newspaper chain (which owns the Rocky Mountain News) is likely.  </P> <P> Interested groups from the various cities must make a presentation to the  expansion committee by the end of September, though Denver will be given leeway  because of the late stadium vote.  </P> <P> The NL has also said it will be flexible on the $95-million franchise fee,  willing to offer a payment plan and friendly terms.  </P> <P> There is no formal or ongoing investigation, but the inquiry into Dave  Winfield's relationship with Howard Spira and the $15,000 check Winfield gave  to Spira in 1981 is not entirely closed, according to deputy commissioner Steve  Greenberg.  </P> <P> The commissioner's office, Greenberg said, has an open mind regarding any and  all material or testimony it receives on (a) the Winfield-Spira relationship  and (b) allegations that Winfield has gambled. But it has received nothing to  indicate that further action is warranted or that Commissioner Fay Vincent  erred in clearing Winfield during the investigation of the New York Yankees'  George Steinbrenner.  </P> <P> Greenberg said Vincent would like to talk with Spira in an effort to establish  if Winfield knew Spira was a gambler when he gave him the $15,000 check, but  Spira will not talk to the commissioner until the extortion case, generated  mainly on the basis of Steinbrenner's charges against Spira, is over.  </P> <P> Jeff Klein, Winfield's attorney, was reached at his New York office and  reiterated that Spira never worked for the Winfield Foundation, as he has  claimed, and that Winfield was unaware of Spira's gambling or the possibility  that Spira needed $15,000 to cover gambling debts.  </P> <P> According to Klein, Spira at that time worked for a company being formed by the  late Al Frohman, Winfield's agent. Frohman asked Winfield to lend Spira the  money, Klein said, and Winfield did it because he owed Frohman money on his  agent's fee and believed Frohman would pursue Spira if a question of repayment  ever developed.  </P> <P> A source close to the commissioner's office said it is generally believed that  Frohman knew Spira gambled, but it has not been established that Winfield knew.  </P> <P> Of Vincent's ongoing interest, Klein said: "I'm not aware of it and I've heard  nothing to indicate Dave should have any ongoing concerns."  </P> <P> Let's see if we have this right:  </P> <P> Two of the Yankees' limited partners have filed a suit seeking to overturn  Vincent's decision regarding Steinbrenner, who insists that he opposes the  suit. So do almost all of the limited partners, including Robert Nederlander,  who, 24 hours before the suit was filed, was selected unanimously by the  partners to replace Steinbrenner as managing general partner.  </P> <P> Contradictory and confusing? There's more.  </P> <P> Since the federal courts consistently support the commissioner's authority and  have previously ruled that due process does not necessarily apply to private  organizations (i.e., the NCAA vs. Jerry Tarkanian), legal experts give the suit  little chance of succeeding, but that does not foreclose the possibility that a  preliminary injunction may be issued at Monday's hearing in Cleveland.  </P> <P> What would that do? Well, under Vincent's ruling, which he has agreed to,  Steinbrenner must officially resign by Monday. An injunction would allow him to  remain in power. Otherwise, Jack Lawn, former administrator of the Drug  Enforcement Administration, has been named by Steinbrenner to run the Yankees  on an interim basis.  </P> <P> And what about Nederlander? According to Greenberg, baseball's ownership  committee has decided that Nederlander cannot serve on an acting basis. He must  be investigated by the committee and approved by American and National League  owners before serving in any capacity other than that of limited partner.  </P> <P> Thus, between the time Steinbrenner steps down (providing an injunction does  not buy him time) and Nederlander is voted on (which may be mid-September),  there is a feeling that the Yankee operation will become even more disorganized  and paralyzed.  </P> <P> Yes, co-general managers Pete Pederson and George Bradley remain in place, but  also in limbo, since it always came down to Steinbrenner calling the shots.  Steinbrenner liked to talk about his "baseball people," but he really was  talking about himself.  </P> <P> So, what you have is a circus devoid of a ringmaster, with the partners split  and embarrassed by the suit and the attorney for the plaintiffs accusing  Vincent of polling and threatening those partners who would not oppose it.  </P> <P> Send in the clowns.  </P> <P> In San Diego, where booing Eric Show and Roseanne Barr has been the highlight  of a disappointing summer for Padre fans, Manager Greg Riddoch won admirers  with his response to (a) Show's request to be traded and (b) Show's accusations  that he was undermined and back-stabbed by pitching coach Pat Dobson.  </P> <P> "If he wants to sit in the corner and cry," Riddoch said of Show, "he can cry  there alone."  </P> <P> The winningest pitcher of the 1980s, Jack Morris, is 10-15 with a 5.08  earned-run average and admittedly embarrassed -- by himself and the  disintegration of his Detroit Tigers.  </P> <P> "Maybe I stink, but how do you know around here?" Morris said, accusing the  Tigers of complacency, an absence of pride and "no light at the end of the  tunnel."  </P> <P> The Tigers, Morris said, need to clean house.  </P> <P> "It won't take just one move," he said, "it'll take 10."  </P> <P> Speaking of moves, the Pittsburgh Pirates made 10 transactions involving 18  players in a 25-day span through Thursday and may not be through. Neal Heaton,  1-7 in his last 10 starts after going 9-1 in his first 12, has been nursing a  sore shoulder and finally may be replaced in the Pirate rotation.  </P> <P> Manager Jim Leyland continues to operate by committee. He has received  victories from 18 pitchers, and eight pitchers have at least one save.  </P> <P> Mike York, a rookie summoned to face the Cincinnati Reds in one game of a  Friday night doubleheader, became the 12th Pittsburgh starter. He returned to  Buffalo on Saturday.  </P> <P> The move that best illustrated the win-now Pittsburgh philosophy came the other  day when the Pirates sent a package of pitcher Scott Ruskin, a highly regarded  27-year-old left-hander; outfielder Moises Alou, their No. 1 choice in the June  1986 draft; and shortstop Willie Greene, their No. 1 pick last year, to the  Montreal Expos for left-hander Zane Smith and his 45-66 career record.  </P> <P> Of the steep price, Leyland said: "You don't get that many chances to win. The  people out there care about 1990, not 1994."  </P> <P> Injury of the week: Gary Sheffield of the Milwaukee Brewers left Wednesday  night's game against the Tigers because of numbness in his feet. The cause:  Shoelaces on his high-top cleats were tied too tightly.  </P> <P> The Reds are bidding to become the first team since introduction of the  162-game schedule in 1961 to lead every day of the season. The 1970 Reds came  close, leading every day but one in early April.  </P> <P> Said Manager Lou Piniella: "I've thought all along that the only team the  Cincinnati Reds had to beat was the Cincinnati Reds."  </P></p>

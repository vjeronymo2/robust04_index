			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The government will take forceful measures to  confront the transportation strike that was declared by the  Single Union of Independent Vehicles and that threatens to  completely stop transportation services on 13 June. Vicente  Briceno filed a report:    [Begin recording] [Briceno] Interior Minister Ramon Escovar  Salom made this statement as he walked out of the Security  Cabinet meeting, which was supposed to be held on 9 June but  instead was held on 8 June due to actions by the transportation  union and pressure reportedly exerted by the public in light of  the ever-increasing crime rate.    The interior minister and Caracas Mayor Aristobulo Isturiz  agreed that the dispute between two rival factions within the  union because of different party affiliations is the reason for  this strike.    Although Escovar said that military buses will be used for  public transportation, he refused to say whether the concessions  granted to drivers will be revoked. However, he hinted this  possibility is being considered.    [Escovar] We cannot let a union decide the fate of a city of  four million people. The government will not accept it. This  move to declare a transportation strike lacks the complete  support of all workers. The government will respond with  forceful measures nevertheless.    [Briceno] He also reported that the Security Cabinet  analyzed  the issue of burgeoning crime and delinquency rates. He added  that among the solutions, he studied the possibility of sending  smaller high-risk delinquents to separate rehabilitation  centers, and the Juvenile Delinquents Law being applied to other  delinquents, depending on the felonies they commit.    It is worth noting that in addition to the Caracas governor  and the justice, foreign affairs, and defense ministers, who  make up the Security Cabinet, attending the meeting, Family  Minister Mercedes Pulido de Briceno was also present.

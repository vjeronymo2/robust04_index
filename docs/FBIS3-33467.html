			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Part two of two-part article by Reinaldo Antonio Tefel] </F>   [Text] Some people's concept of renewal is similar to that  of the revenge-minded extremists who belonged to what was known  as UNO [National Opposition Union]: the ostracizing and  destruction of adversaries. They do not share the culture of  dialogue and consensus. Others conceive of unity as a  "straitjacket" to prevent renewal; they are mired in the past,  having turned into pillars of salt.    Neither concept is acceptable. Both seek the destruction of  Sandinism and any other group, as is happening with the former  UNO. This dichotomy must disappear and give way to a sincere,  dialectic, and transparent relationship based on the founding  element, on new and 100-percent democratic bylaws, and, above  all, on observance of these bylaws.    The founding element that unites us all is the historic  legacy of Sandino, an element that belongs to all Nicaraguans,  not just Sandinists. This historic Sandinist legacy leads us to  the ongoing civic struggle for the "effective democracy with  social justice" that Sandino dreamed of. The new program that  the Special Congress will pass must interpret and update  Sandino's dream.    Today I will attempt to outline some basic ideas for the new  democratic structure that could be embodied in the new bylaws if  the Sandinist people and the Special Congress reach a consensus  on them.  <H5>  The Current Congress, Out of Step </H5>   The first issue that arises can be seen in the major  question  that Erick Aguirre posed in EL SEMANARIO: "A new Congress in an  old bottle?" We all know that the current Congress is out of  step and that some of its members are not involved in politics.  Is this Congress capable of undertaking sweeping renewal?  Wouldn't it be better if the Sandinist Assembly passed the new  bylaws provisionally so that they could ultimately be passed,  rejected, or amended by the Special Congress? If this were  possible, all of its structures could be completely renovated,  from top to bottom, in accordance with the provisional bylaws.    If the feeling is that legally this cannot be done or that  there is not enough time to do so, then the new national  authorities that are chosen at the Special Congress should serve  only during a transition period ending at the Regular Congress  of 1995. I raise this possibility for debate at the Sandinist  grass roots.    Now then, what do I think are the basic ideas for achieving  democratic renewal amid unity through the bylaws and through the  election of national authorities?  <H5>  Suggestions </H5>   1. A transparent, fair electoral process in which all  Sandinists take part and in which it is impossible to hand-pick  representatives must be guaranteed. The elections must be public  and held in jurisdictions of appropriate size: in small  municipalities and in districts in large municipalities.  District and municipal authorities, Departmental Congresses, and  the National Congress must be chosen at this election. There  ought to be overseers for the slates of candidates. Elections by  "clubs" or "covens" must not be allowed. Small groups must not  be able to usurp representation of the entire Sandinist people  in a district or municipality. If we were able to hold the  freest general elections in the history of our country and of  all Latin America, the ones on 25 February 1990, why can't we  hold such elections among ourselves?    2. In order to achieve a more balanced representation of  differing views across the various segments of society, besides  within territories, it would be politically prudent to elect the  representatives to the Congress as follows: half directly in the  districts and municipalities and the other half in Departmental  Congresses. Rank and file leaders would tend to be chosen at the  former, and national political, social, economic, and cultural  leaders at the latter. The Congress would thus represent all  segments and viewpoints of the Sandinist people.    3. Since the National Leadership has already played its  historic role effectively, in keeping with a period of history  other than the present and while exercising predominant  influence, the bylaws must establish a new collective and  democratic political leadership in the form of two complementary  bodies.    3.1. The Sandinist Assembly, as the delegate body of the  Congress and, therefore, as the highest authority while the  Congress is in recess, would consist of 125 members, plus the  departmental political secretaries, broken down as follows: 100  members directly elected as such by the Congress and the 25  members of the Sandinist National Council. The Sandinist  Assembly would be chaired by its own, annually elected Board and  would hold regular sessions every four months and special  sessions when a third of its members so request or when an  absolute majority of the members of the Sandinist National  Council so resolve.    3.2. The Sandinist National Council would be the executive  body and would consist of 25 members elected by the Congress. It  would meet once a month in regular session and would be chaired  by its Standing Committee, elected from among its members and  made up of seven national secretaries with specific functions.  It could hold regular sessions weekly and would submit monthly  reports on its activities to the Sandinist National Council,  which would in turn be answerable to the Sandinist Assembly.    4. It would be strongly advisable from a political  standpoint  to establish a proportional system for electing the two highest  party authorities in the Congress. The various schools of  thought within the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front]  would thus be functionally integrated. I can find no other  system that insures true, not rhetorical unity based on genuine  democratic renewal. Exclusionary, hegemonic systems that lead to  party rifts must be avoided.    On another occasion I will discuss the system for choosing  the party's various candidates for the general elections.</p>

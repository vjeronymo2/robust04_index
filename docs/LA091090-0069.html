			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUSSEIN MAY SEE SIGNAL THAT U.S. WON'T ATTACK;  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS  </P> <P> Ever since Iraq invaded Kuwait five weeks ago, the Bush Administration has been  striving to make sure that Saddam Hussein goes to bed every night not knowing  whether he will wake up to the thunder of U.S. military force.  </P> <P> At their otherwise harmonious summit meeting Sunday, however, President Bush  and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev differed sharply on that approach,  with Gorbachev insisting at a joint press conference that Moscow is firmly  opposed to the military option.  </P> <P> "We may have a difference on that," Bush conceded.  </P> <P> The dispute is primarily a tactical one. Bush and Gorbachev agreed to maintain  -- and if necessary increase -- the economic and political pressure on Iraq.  But Gorbachev's reluctance to sanction the use of force may be taken by Hussein  as a signal that he faces no immediate danger of attack. That could cause him  to dig in his heels and wait out the United States and its allies.  </P> <P> Of course, Gorbachev may change his mind if economic sanctions prove to be  inadequate. But it seems clear that the Soviet president wants to give the  trade embargo and other political measures a very long trial.  </P> <P> Delay costs Gorbachev nothing. But the United States, with more than 100,000  military personnel already in the region, can ill afford a prolonged standoff.  Although Saudi Arabia and the exiled government of Kuwait have agreed to pay  much of the $1-billion-a-month cost of the deployment, the United States would  find it difficult to keep such a large force in place if the conflict becomes a  stalemate.  </P> <P> Although Bush stressed repeatedly that he, too, favors a peaceful resolution to  the crisis, he said it would be wrong to tip off Iraq by closing out the  military option.  </P> <P> "I did not say that if Iraq does not withdraw peacefully, we're going to have  recourse to military methods," Gorbachev said. " . . . Our country and the  United Nations . . . (have) a whole range of possibilities of finding a  political solution to this problem. Therefore, I would limit ourselves to  that."  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III, talking to a small group of reporters  after the Bush-Gorbachev news conference, insisted that Washington is satisfied  with the words of the joint statement in which Bush and Gorbachev promised to  consider additional measures "consistent with the U.N. Charter" if the present  embargo does not force Iraq to withdraw.  </P> <P> Baker said the charter does not prohibit the use of force in all circumstances.  </P> <P> "You might conclude from the press conference that the Soviets are not on board  yet on the use of force," Baker said. "But you have a joint statement that  doesn't rule it out.  </P> <P> "I don't think he (Hussein) will take any joy out of reading this statement,"  Baker added.  </P> <P> American officials conceded that Bush and Gorbachev did not go significantly  further in their condemnation of Iraq than Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister  Eduard A. Shevardnadze did in a statement issued the day after the invasion.  </P> <P> But Baker said the reaffirmation of Moscow's stand against Iraq was significant  in itself. He noted that on Saturday, Hussein had called on Moscow to "act like  a superpower" and repudiate the U.S. position.  </P> <P> Bush and Gorbachev also disagreed publicly over a Soviet proposal for a Middle  East peace conference to consider both the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the  festering Arab-Israeli conflict.  </P> <P> "Everything that is taking place in the Middle East is a matter of concern to  us -- of equal concern," Gorbachev said.  </P> <P> For his part, Bush said that the U.N. resolutions calling for Iraq to withdraw  from Kuwait "should be implemented on their face without trying to tie it in to  some other unresolved dispute."  </P> <P> At the same time, Bush said he would support a renewed effort to implement a  23-year-old U.N. resolution calling for Israel to withdraw from the West Bank  and Gaza Strip "to secure and recognized boundaries."  </P> <P> "It is important that that (Israeli-Palestinian) question eventually, and  hopefully sooner than later, be resolved," Bush said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRINGLE ACCUSED OF PAYING HIS ATTORNEYS IMPROPERLY  </P> <P> A Democratic opponent of Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) Monday  accused the freshman legislator of improperly paying lawyers nearly $50,000 to  defend him in a federal lawsuit out of a fund set up for a different purpose.  </P> <P> The Democrat, Jerry Yudelson, who ran unsuccessfully against Rep. Robert K.  Dornan (R-Garden Grove) in 1988 and says he plans to challenge Pringle in 1990,  asked for an investigation of Pringle's campaign finances in a complaint sent  Monday to the Fair Political Practices Commission.  </P> <P> Pringle's campaign statements "show a cavalier disregard" for new  campaign-financing rules established under Proposition 73, which was passed by  voters in last year's primary election, Yudelson said in a statement.  </P> <P> Sandy Michioku, an FPPC spokeswoman, said Yudelson's complaint had not reached  the commission and added: "We'll take a look at the complaint when we receive  it."  </P> <P> Pringle acknowledged Monday that, on his lawyers' advice, he paid them out of  funds from a committee established to defend him against a recall attempt. The  lawyers, however, are defending him in a federal lawsuit aimed at overturning  his election last November. Pringle defended his action, saying he felt that it  was "quite justified" because both the lawsuit and the recall attempt stemmed  from the same issue.  </P> <P> "There is a direct and specific corollary between those two things," Pringle  said.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, which is pending in federal court, claims that Pringle, his  campaign manager and the Orange County Republican Party posted uniformed  security guards at 20 Santa Ana polling places in the 72nd Assembly District.  The lawsuit contends that the presence of the guards unconstitutionally  intimidated first-time Latino voters.  </P> <P> Republicans have defended hiring the guards, saying they had heard rumors that  Democrats might attempt to bus in illegal voters to the precincts in order to  tip the hotly contested, $1.6-million race between Pringle and Democrat  Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach. Thierbach lost by only 867 votes out of about  67,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dropped Recall Plan  </P> <P> Orange County Democrats had planned to try to recall Pringle, citing the  poll-guard incident, but they later dropped the idea.  </P> <P> Michioku said Pringle had set up his recall-defense committee under guidance  from Kathryn Donovan, legal counsel to the FPPC. Donovan advised Pringle in a  March 14 letter that the committee must be separate from those established for  his reelection and that "no funds collected by this committee may be used for  your other election campaign or office-holder expenses," Michioku related.  </P> <P> According to campaign statements filed with the FPPC for the period of Jan. 1  through June 30 of this year, Pringle raised $59,461.13 to defend himself  against a possible recall. Most of the money came from two $25,000 loans, one  from investor Joseph Tuttobene of Brea and the other from Security Pacific Bank  and secured by Dean Thomas of Fullerton, owner of Delst Chemical &amp; Research  Co. of La Habra.  </P> <P> Pringle used $49,098.94 from his recall-committee funds to pay the firm of  Wyman, Bautzer, Kuchel &amp; Silbert of Irvine, according to campaign  statements. David A. Robinson and Thomas R. Malcolm of that law firm are  defending Pringle in the federal suit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Setback for Pringle  </P> <P> Pringle received a setback in his defense of the lawsuit when the FPPC ruled in  July that money for his defense came under the same restrictions as his other  campaign funds. Under Proposition 73 limits, individual donors can give $1,000  and political action committees can give $2,500 in each elective cycle.  </P> <P> A few months earlier, however, Pringle had good news from the FPPC, which ruled  that he could raise and spend as much as he needed to defend himself against a  possible recall. For this reason, Democrats backed off from their plan to try  to recall Pringle, according to county Democratic Chairman Mike Balmages.  </P></p>

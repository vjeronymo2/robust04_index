			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / International Press Review Malaysia In the present circumstances, many British companies might question whether the members of the British media have anything in their heads at all. Not so Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister. He says the British have brains. The only trouble is the British media have a 'colonial brain', which assumes the leaders of developing countries such as Malaysia are corrupt and could be corrupted anytime. 'USDollars 50,000 for the prime minister and you can get a contract worth Dollars 1bn . . .' ponders Dr Mahathir. The New Straits Times, Malaysia's largest selling English language daily, reports Dr Mahathir as being in a state of disbelief at the idea. The government in Malaysia does not control the media - it more or less owns them. A company closely connected to Dr Mahathir's United Malays National party (UMNO), the country's dominant political party, controls the New Straits Times Press group, the largest publishing house. UMNO's influence also stretches into other publications. All have been solidly behind Malaysia's action against Britain. Utusan Malaysia, the biggest selling Malay-language newspaper, says Dr Mahathir is teaching the west a new lesson. 'We support the strong and uncompromising stand to close the door on British firms - this is an effective way to deal with people arrogant with freedom and power which they claim to possess.' The editor of Malaysia's New Sunday Times (no relation) is in despair about what he says are the sagging standards of the British press. '. . . The British media, particularly the print component, has degenerated as a result of the country's stagnating economy and growing competition . . . while the tabloids, famous for their bare-breasted voluptuous Page Three girls, make no pretence about their sensation-orientated reporting, the broadsheets are fast becoming smear sheets on the pretext of telling the truth.' The truth is also very much on Dr Mahathir's mind. Asked what he feels the British media should do now, the prime minister tells New Straits Times reporters that the whole thing is simple. The British must report the truth. But, says Dr Mahathir, this is one thing they cannot do - 'They have never understood what is meant by truth.' And did Dr Mahathir want the British media to apologise? 'I don't want any apology. Apology is not good enough.' Back to you John Major - or Rupert Murdoch. Britain The British press, which so upset the Malaysian prime minister last week, was characteristically unrepentant about the affair this weekend. Several papers, indeed, seemed intent on twisting the knife by delving further into British deals with Malaysia. The Independent reported on Saturday that the UK made an advance payment of Pounds 49m to Malaysia's government in 1986 to pass on to a company controlled by members of one of its nine royal families. The scheme it was destined for was scaled back, but no repayment ever made. The Sunday Times, the main object of the Malaysians' fury, retorted with a story that it had documents showing a specific commitment was made in 1988 by Mr George Younger, then UK defence secretary, to tie directly the amount of aid awarded to Malaysia to negotiations for a Pounds 1.3bn arms deal. The Observer claimed Malaysian officials had long been accusing British companies of trying to 'rip off' their government on large contracts. Recent UK press reports were no more than the 'last straw'. But if the UK's deals with Malaysia gave investigative reporters a field day, then Malaysia's response gave leader writers ample scope to write about one of the subjects closest to their hearts: the sanctity of the free press. Some chose direct attacks on the Malaysians for daring to challenge that principle. The Guardian thundered that press freedoms 'have to be defended and fought for. Dr Mahathir is out of world order (sic). We have to sit tight and tell him so.' The Sunday Times accused Dr Mahathir of having a 'well-honed anti-colonial chip on his shoulder'. While it would be a 'shame' if British jobs were lost because British newspapers were doing their job, it was entirely legitimate that newspapers should seek to publicise government misdeeds. But several papers pointed out to the Malaysians that much of the worst criticism was reserved for the British government. As The Daily Telegraph commented, 'Newspapers in a democratic society can hardly be blamed for pursuing revelations which have shown the government to have been breaking its own rules and then doing its best to disguise the fact.'

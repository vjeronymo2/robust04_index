			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 29 March (MTI) -- "If we want Hungary to  become a western-type democracy, we have to continue  privatization, namely the transformation of state assets into  human ones," Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross said in a  speech, closing a two-day conference on privatization held in  Budapest by the Central and East European Christian Democratic  Academy.    Addressing an audience of foreign experts and advisers,  Boross spoke in detail about the historical heritage and  environment that determine privatization in Hungary.    Change in ownership always provides opportunities for  corruption, Boross said, admitting that there had been some  serious abuses of privatization in Hungary, too. He warned,  however, that it would be a mistake to draw general conclusions  from these cases.    The prime minister spoke in favor of consistent pursuit of  privatization and concluded his address saying, "private  ownership will soon prevail in Hungary's economy."</p>

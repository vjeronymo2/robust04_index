			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Executor's files MY brother-in-law died in November 1984 and another brother-in-law and I were named executors. My co-executor died in June 1990. I have the complete record of the liquidation of assets and the final distributions which were made according to his will. The benefactors were all family members. The beneficiaries have gained their inheritances and no query is expected. How necessary/desirable it is for me to continue to hold the records? They are somewhat bulky and I would prefer to dispose of them. We think that you should retain all documentation until at least six years after completion of the administration of the estate. If the final distribution was made in 1985 you could consider disposing of the documents now - otherwise you should wait longer before doing so. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

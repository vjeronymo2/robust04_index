			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The highest representatives of the Visegrad Group  are to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in Prague. Experts from  the ministries of foreign affairs of the four today concluded  all the arrangements for the event in the capital of the Czech  Republic. Defense ministers of the Visegrad Group will meet in  Warsaw on Friday. There will be no more higher level  consultations before the Prague meeting with Clinton.    Budapest had different ideas about the preparations for the  U.S.-Visegrad summit, but acknowledged the will of the Czech  hosts. On the line from Budapest is our reporter Gregor Martin  Papucsek with more details:    [Papucsek] Hungarian President Arpad Goncz and his Polish  counterpart, Lech Walesa, jointly proposed to Czech Prime  Minister Vaclav Klaus during the funeral of Jozsef Antall in  Budapest that the states of the Visegrad Group coordinate their  positions before meeting Bill Clinton. However, Budapest now  notes with a degree of regret that Prague refused to form a  joint platform. Observers point to the fact that Czech politics  views Visegrad cooperation rather skeptically and decisively  rejects all attempts which may lead to institutionalizing  Visegrad Group activity.    It is also observed in Budapest that the Czech  representatives have tried from the beginning to emphasize the  Czech-U.S. bilateral features of Bill Clinton's visit to Prague.  [passage omitted]</p>

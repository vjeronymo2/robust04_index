			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Arts: The Bacchae - Opera John Buller (b. 1927), whose adaptation of Euripides's Bacchae is the latest new opera to be presented by English National Opera, is an extraordinary and peculiarly attractive figure among postwar British composers. He spent much of his working life outside the world of music, as an architectural surveyor, and came to it late, driven by personal need. At least one piece on his short work-list - Proenca (1978), a tautly spun, richly appealing stretch of orchestral song-setting from medieval Provencal poetry - has already achieved international circulation. Buller's broad intellectual interests have fed fertile imaginative inspiration into each one of his artistic conceptions. The Theatre of Memory, the large orchestral work first given at the 1981 Proms, may be seen as the direct ancestor of the new opera in its marriage of ancient Greek theories of memory and Renaissance conventions of drama. Buller's insistence on the original ancient Greek words for his ENO Bacchae  -already widely publicised  - should be seen not as a dotty elitist quirk, but as consistent with an intense artistic response to the 'feel' of language (as shown in Proenca), and with an out-of-time approach to composition. It is no surprise to learn, from an interview in the programme, that previously he had had no desire to write an opera at all, and that the subject of his Bacchae was chosen as a sort of 'just response' to Henze's Bassarids - a very different Euripides opera - as also mounted (in 1978) by ENO. For this, as shown at Tuesday's opening performance, is by no means a straightforward new Bacchae opera to add to the 20th-century list. (Last year Andrew Porter reported on the Stockholm premiere of Daniel Bortz's Backanterna, produced by Ingmar Bergman, and in 1990 Andrew Clark described the 1990 Bielefeld revival of Egon Wellesz's 1931 Bakchantinnen.) My gut reaction, indeed, is that it is not really an opera at all but, rather, a type of enacted Bacchae frieze, expertly arrayed, which may well come to be more fittingly displayed in concert-hall circumstances. It's hard to imagine a more confidently composed frieze. Buller, whose only imposition on the play has been to condense it into an unbroken 100-minute structure, avoids entirely the faults of inexperience - overscoring, over-extension of material, uncertainties of pacing and word-setting - that usually stamp first stage-works. The beguiling sound-world of this Bacchae is its most memorable achievement: Lutoslawski-like in absolute cleanliness of line, beautifully spaced and contrasted for both voices and instruments, never clotted or uncertain of purpose or contour. The work is planned in the form of 17 linked scenes, and marked out in 'realms' of distinct atmospheric texture - by, for example, Dionysus's liquidly trickling celesta and woodwind, Pentheus's fractious brass consort, or the frequent unisons and snapping intervallic leaps of the female chorus. The main characters have their particular vocal styles; Dionysus and Pentheus are both high tenors differently treated (Dionysus, in addition, is the only character to use English, when speaking as a god rather than to the other personages on stage). Exotic, rather Roussel-like streams of modal harmony, motivic influences from ancient Greek scales and a fastidious richness of colouristic detail all aid in supplying the score with its highly individual patina. The treatment of the play is coolly sophisticated, with absolutely none of the Expressionist gesture-thrusting and Grand Opera noise-making that other 20th-century composers have thought fit for Greek subjects. What to my mind this Bacchae lacks is any of the unrepeatable combustion of dramatic subject and music that is the root characteristic of many different kinds of opera. The effect of listening to an opera in a dead language is, as we know from Stravinsky's 'opera-oratorio' Oedipus rex, to repose fullest concentration upon the dramatic workings of the music. (The libretto promises more interventions from a narrator than on Tuesday we were given.) In this case, I felt that the result was to heighten awareness of an oversimplification of the dramatic subject. With its long scenes built upon immobile pedal points and its characterisation devoid of psychological perspective, this seems to me a static Bacchae, whose presentation in a theatre adds nothing 'kinetic' to my understanding of it, or of the Euripides play. By this I mean disrespect neither to the fine, confident musical realisation under Martin Andre nor to the grippingly intelligent, economical ENO staging by Julia Hollander in Hildegard Bechtler's rough-hewn angled-box set and Nicky Gillibrand's bold costumes. The producer has devised a sinuous, startlingly effective kind of sculptural body-language, derived from Indian dance, which Dionysus and the Bacchantes employ to contrast with the bans. This inspires Thomas Randle (Dionysus) to give a sensational performance, glamorously embodied and lustrously sung, that is alone worth the ticket price. Sarah Walker, whose mezzo Agave enters the scene only at the seven-eighth point, sings with moving eloquence; the less obviously grateful roles taken by respectively Graeme Matheson-Bruce, Gregory Yurisich and Richard Van Allan with notable authority, and the singing of the nine-strong female ensemble is thrilling.

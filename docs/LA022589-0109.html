			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TARZANA LAB TO LOSE MEDI-CAL, MEDICARE FOR CANCER TESTS  </P> <P> Federal health authorities have decertified Central Pathology Services Medical  Group -- Southern California's largest Pap smear laboratory -- saying the  Tarzana company has misdiagnosed too many specimens.  </P> <P> The Pap smear is a medical test regularly used by doctors to detect cervical  cancer. Central Pathology processes about 2,600 Pap tests a day.  </P> <P> The company failed to diagnose cervical cancer or said the disease was present  when it wasn't in 45 -- or nearly 4% -- of 1,200 specimens randomly selected by  the federal Health Care Financing Administration, officials said.  </P> <P> "We consider those results to have very serious ramifications," said Harry  Barba, associate regional administrator for HCFA, a division of the Department  of Health and Human Services. Nearly 7,000 women nationwide died of cervical  cancer last year, according to the American Cancer Society.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2 Inspections Conducted  </P> <P> Two inspections of Central Pathology were conducted in January. The inspectors  were members of the American Society of Cytotechnologists, a trade group.  </P> <P> The HCFA said decertification means that Medicare and Medi-Cal will no longer  pay for Pap smears processed at Central Pathology. "This company no longer  qualifies to participate in our programs," Barba said.  </P> <P> Central Pathology spokesman Martin Cooper said the company will appeal the  agency's decision.  </P> <P> "We took the same 45 cases to an independent lab, and their results differed  from those of HCFA," Cooper said. "This is a very subjective business. This is  not a black-and-white issue. You cannot look at a medical slide and say with  100% certainty what you see is A or B."  </P> <P> Medicare and Medi-Cal account for about 10% of Central Pathology's business,  Cooper said. The remaining 90% is paid by private insurance companies, he said.  </P> <P> Barba said Central Pathology is one of more than 15 medical labs nationwide  undergoing inspections because of growing public concern nationwide about the  practices of Pap smear labs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Number of Specimens  </P> <P> The number of specimens that cytotechnologists are expected to review is at the  center of the concern.  </P> <P> In some labs, sometimes called Pap mills, technologists read four times as many  specimens as medical experts recommend to ensure accuracy. Some companies pay  technologists on a per-specimen basis, which can encourage carelessness, health  officials said.  </P> <P> Central Pathology said its technologists average 81 slides a day. But it could  not be immediately determined how that compares with industry standards.  </P> <P> Some studies suggest that technologists miss one of every four cases of  cervical cancer. Experts say thousands of women have died of the disease after  Pap smears indicated that their cervices were free of cancer.  </P></p>

The obstacle was not described and there was no  elaboration.  </P> <P> McMahon, the 67-year-old "Tonight Show" sidekick to Johnny Carson and host of  the "Star Search" talent show, filed for divorce in 1989 after 13 years of  marriage. The couple have an adopted daughter, Katherine.  </P> <P> After a hearing a year ago, Mrs. McMahon's attorney said McMahon had agreed to  child and spousal support of $50,000 a month and shared custody of Katherine.

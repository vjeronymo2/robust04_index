			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: French wine group dips to FFr1.06bn before items Pernod Ricard, one of France's leading wines and spirits groups, yesterday announced net profits of FFr1.06bn (Dollars 180m) for 1993, a slight fall from the FFr1.10bn recorded in 1992. Stripping out exceptional items and the impact of currency effects, profits showed an increase of just under 7 per cent. The exceptional items largely related to gains on the sale of its Societe des Vins de France in 1992. Turnover last year, limited in France by the effects of depressed demand, showed an increase of 3.8 per cent at the group level to reach FFr15.05bn. The company announced an increased dividend of FFr9, against FFr8.5 for 1992. Mr Patrick Ricard, chairman, said the results for 1993, the internationalisation of the group and its solid financial position allowed the company to be 'reasonably confident about the future'. However, there were uncertainties concerning the French spirit market, he added. These related to the depressed level of consumer spending because of the recession last year, and the impact of an increase in alcohol taxes last July. The increase in taxation fed through into spirits prices and, according to analysts, prompted strong buying in the first half of 1992. The effect is likely to distort the sales comparison in the first half of this year. Mr Ricard said the company's financial structure continued to improve in 1993. The gearing ratio fell to 41 per cent from 60 per cent in 1992. In 1990, the ratio was just under 90 per cent.</p>

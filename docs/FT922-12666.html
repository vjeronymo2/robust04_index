			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: US reorganisation sparks recovery at Tie Rack TIE RACK, the specialist tie, scarf and fashion accessories retailer, yesterday reported a sharp improvement in profits and a return to the dividend list. Pre-tax profits in the year to February 2 rose from Pounds 51,000 to Pounds 1.03m on sales up 1 per cent at Pounds 54.5m. Last June's rights issue and a 29 per cent fall in stock levels helped turn net borrowings of Pounds 6.3m into net cash of Pounds 3.2m. Interest charges fell from Pounds 1.75m to Pounds 539,000. The company also enjoyed a sharp reduction in the tax rate, following a favourable ruling by the Inland Revenue that the loss-making US operation was domiciled for tax purposes in the UK. This helped reverse losses of 1.79p to earnings of 1.99p per share. The company is to pay a 0.5p dividend, in line with its forecast at the time of the rights issue, having passed the interim. Mr Roy Bishko, chairman, said the results reflected progress made in reorganising the US business which had not made a profit since it was launched in 1986. The profits increase, after a Pounds 504,00 exceptional charge for reorganisation, reflected tight management control of current and capital expenditures. The group also changed the profile of its businesses during the year. At the year-end, only 78 of 257 shops were franchised, compared with 111 of 253 the year before. While this had removed a number of poor performing franchises from the system, the company was still committed to franchising if the individuals concerned were well financed and fully involved in the running of the companies. On the trading side, the first quarter had been badly hit in the UK by the Gulf war's impact on airport and central London sales. Trading since then had been erratic and operating profits were down from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 2.84m. In the US, the loss fell from Pounds 1.23m to Pounds 856,000 while in non-UK Europe, profits fell from Pounds 1.22m to Pounds 1.08m.</p>

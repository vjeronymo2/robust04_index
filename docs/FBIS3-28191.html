The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il published an immortal  classical work on February 19, 1974, proclaiming the modelling  of the whole society on the chuche idea to be the supreme  platform of the party.    Speakers at the symposium said the revolutionary practice of  the last two decades shows that the supreme platform of the  party is an immortal programme which has brought about signal  changes and a great victory in the party building and activities  as a whole and in all domains of the revolution and  construction, and a great banner which has effected a tremendous  change in the building of press media of the party.    They pointed out that after proclaiming the programme of  modelling the whole society on the chuche idea, the dear leader  published a historical work elucidating the party's chuche-based  idea of publication and news service on May 7, 1974, thereby  performing an immortal exploit in the building of chuche-type  media.    They recalled that the dear leader has led the press media  to  make true contributions to accomplishing the cause of modelling  the whole society on the chuche idea by kindling the flames of  revolutionization of newspapers, news services, broadcasting and  publications.    They stressed the need to make a deeper study of the  profound  idea and theory laid down in the programme of modelling the  whole society on the chuche idea and make new success in the  publication and news service in response to the New Year address  of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the letter sent by  the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il to the participants in the  7th Congress of the Korean Journalists Union.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Letter: Change in attitude to dividends not recognised Sir, The recommendations against dividend cuts by Professor Paul Marsh ('Why dividend cuts are a last resort', August 12) are historically correct and no doubt welcomed by nervous income fund managers. But are they relevant in 1992? The majority of the survey covers a period when dividend cuts were relatively unheard of. The rigours of a long recession are now exposing the weak areas in the operations of many companies, and share prices tend to discount dividend cuts long before any announcement. What the survey fails to recognise is the significant change in attitude by many companies to dividend payments over the past few months. As the prospect of an upturn recedes and strong positions have weakened, the most popular statement in the forthcoming results season could be: 'In order to conserve resources your directors have decided to maintain/ reduce/pass the dividend.' The obviously weak will pass payments, those with fragile balance sheets will reduce, while former stars of dividend growth will decide that a maintained dividend or a modest increase will not only help future investment but probably do little or no harm to their share price in the current climate.

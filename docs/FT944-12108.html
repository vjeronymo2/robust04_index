			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Sihanouk warns off tourists King Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's head of state (left), warned tourists yesterday to avoid his country as the bodies of three western hostages killed by Khmer Rouge rebels were recovered, bound and shot, from graves found near a southern rebel base. Saying Cambodia was 'clearly insecure', he joined foreign embassies in advising tourists to avoid Cambodia. 'I condemn with the greatest severity the contemptible and unpardonable murderers who are responsible for the deaths of these three young gentlemen,' said the king. Mr Serey Kosal, deputy governor of Battambang province, said the Khmer Rouge had kidnapped 71 villagers and then executed 50 of them after a four-day forced march to a guerrilla base.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maria Myles] </F>   [Text] Strasbourg Apr 11 (CNA) -- Nationalist Russian  leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy expressed unreserved support for  the independence of Cyprus and the withdrawal of Turkish troops  form the island.    In a statement to CNA, Zhirinovskiy, who arrived here Sunday  amid controversy over his anti-French statements, said the  20-year Turkish occupation "is a violation of international law".    "The Turkish-occupied part of Cyprus has never been Turkish  and Turkey, although a member of the council of Europe, is an  aggressive country", he told CNA.    The Russian politician, who stressed to CNA that he speaks  for the majority of the people of Russia, said "your island must  be independent, either an independent state of Cyprus or part of  Greece but not a part of Turkey".    Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 and despite numerous U.N.  resolutions calling for respect for the island's independence,  and for the withdrawal of all foreign forces, it continues to  have 35,000 troops occupying the island's northern third.    Referring to Sunday's bombing by NATO forces of Serbian  positions, Zhirinovskiy said he opposed war and violence and  called on the Council of Europe to take a stand on the matter  and indicate its support for aggression or non-aggression. "I  will not only protest but I will warn the Council that one day  we are going to take responsive measures against those countries  which bombed on Sunday", he told CNA.    Replying to another question, the Russian politician said he  opposed the dispatch of Turkish troops to former Yugoslavia as  peacekeepers because, as he explained, "the population there  opposes the presence of Turkish troops". Zhirinovskiy dismissed  suggestions that the dispatch of Turkish troops was decided to  balance the presence of Russian peace-keepers.    Zhirinovskiy, leader of Russia's liberal democratic party,  made the statements to CNA on arrival at the Palais de l'Europe,  where later this afternoon the parliamentary assembly starts.</p>

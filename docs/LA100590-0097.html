			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> ERROR CONCEDED, BUT BALLOT WON'T CHANGE  </P> <P> The county registrar of voters admits he goofed by letting Saddleback Valley  school board appointee Roberta Cline list herself as a "governing board member"  on the Nov. 6 ballot.  </P> <P> But Registrar Donald Tanney said it's too late to change it.  </P> <P> Cline, who was appointed to the school board on July 11, did not inform Tanney  that she was an appointee when she requested the incumbent designation, he  said. But school district officials previously had notified the registrar's  office of Cline's appointment.  </P> <P> "There's no question we made an error here in this department," Tanney said.  "We had knowledge she was appointed; my staff should not have allowed her to  use the governing board member designation."  </P> <P> But with the election just five weeks away, it's too late to reprint the  ballots. The county will issue a public notice correcting the error, and county  lawyers are trying to determine if the county is liable for the error, Tanney  said.  </P> <P> Registrar officials discovered the mistake after school board candidate Charles  Wall charged that Cline had violated district election laws and was falsely  representing herself as an incumbent by using the title.  </P> <P> "Someone who was appointed just a few months before the election should not  have an unfair advantage over the rest of the challengers," Wall said.  </P> <P> But Cline said she had never heard of the ordinance and was told by the  registrar employees to use the title.  </P> <P> "There's no way I want to mislead anyone," Cline said. Ironically, Cline  recently received a joint endorsement along with Wall from the district's  classified employees union. But Cline said she hopes that the endorsement will  not pair her with Wall in voters' minds.  </P> <P> "I want to distance myself from (Wall's) campaign. I'm concerned about a  negative approach from someone who hasn't shown a great deal of involvement in  the schools up to this point." CHERYLANNE BEALER  </P></p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Competitive tendering still holds Sir, We should like to comment on the suggestion inherent in your reports 'Rules on public contract tendering to be eased' (March 1) and 'Conflict alleged on tendering rules' (March 2) that new Treasury guidelines on the tendering of public-sector contracts will imply widespread and radical changes to the current practice. Your report of March 1 acknowledges that the guidelines 'will not involve cases covered by European Union rules requiring competition'. These rules catch most contracts for construction works exceeding Pounds 3,743,203 in value, supplies contracts exceeding Pounds 96,403 and contracts for a wide range of services where the contract value exceeds Pounds 149,728. It can be seen, therefore, that the vast majority by value of central government procurement contracts will fall outside the new guidelines and will remain subject to a requirement of competitive tendering, in which the suppliers from across the EU may participate. Kate Taylor and Mark Cook, Pinsent &amp; Co, 3 Colmore Circus, Birmingham, B4 6BH</p>

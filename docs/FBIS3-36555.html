He said that today there are no countries which have  territorial claims to Ukraine, as was made by the Russian  parliament.    The speaker believes that the territorial claims could be  associated with the election of Yuriy Meshkov as the Crimean  president. However, he said, now Russian-Ukrainian relations  have no grounds for fears.    Plyushch has described as artificial the problem of  Ukrainian  debts to Russia. He believes the problem is blown up by  pro-imperial forces in Russia who rely on a strong propaganda  machine. Plyushch believes that Russia could place some of its  debts as legal successor of the Soviet Union on Ukraine. In  addition, not only the Black Sea Fleet, but the entire former  Soviet navy should be divided, he said.    Plyushch said that following the trilateral statement on  Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, the United States promised to set  aside for the republic some $500 million for dismantling nuclear  weapons.</p>

The 225-issue index fell 17.70 to 20,431.84 after recording the day's low of 20,344.83 in the morning, and peaking at 20,469.85 during the afternoon.

Traders said that uncertainty over the yen's strength had cast doubt over an imminent interest rate cut. Inconsistent comments by ministers over an income tax cut also discouraged investors.

			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> CHEST PAIN SCARE: BIP ROBERTS OK  </P> <P> San Diego Padres third baseman Bip Roberts, complaining of chest pains when he  was carried from the dugout in San Francisco last week, has been cleared to  play after doctors determined the problem was a muscle tear and  gastroenteritis, team officials said.  </P> <P> Roberts was scheduled to rejoin the team in Cincinnati today and could be in  the starting lineup Tuesday when the Padres and Reds open a three-game series.  </P> <P> Roberts, 25, was carried out of the Padres' dugout on a stretcher in  Candlestick Park Friday night, complaining of chest pains. He spent the night  in the cardiac-care unit of San Francisco General Hospital and returned to San  Diego Saturday, where he underwent a battery of tests at Scripps Clinic in La  Jolla. Doctors concluded that the chest pains were caused by a combination of a  muscle tear in the rib cage and gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach  lining.  </P></p>

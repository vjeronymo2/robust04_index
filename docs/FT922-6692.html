			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Alcoa in manufacturing venture with Bahrain group ALCOA, the world's largest producer of aluminium, and Al Zayani Investments WWL of Bahrain are to form a joint venture to manufacture plastic bottle caps for the growing Middle Eastern beverage market. Under the agreement, to be completed next month, the venture, called Gulf Closures, will immediately begin construction of a new plant in Bahrain. The plant is scheduled for start-up in the first quarter of 1993 and will produce over 200m compression-moulded plastic closures by the end of next year. By 1997, it is expected to make more than 550m closures annually. Alcoa Closure Systems International, an Alcoa subsidiary and the world's largest producer of plastic and aluminium closures and capping equipment, will own 49 per cent of the Gulf Closures. Mr Timothy Leveque, ACSI's president, said the decision to go ahead with the joint venture was based on better economic conditions in the Middle East and an improving market for consumption of cold beverages. 'Worldwide beverage companies are targeting the Middle East for market development,' he said. The introduction of advanced packaging systems, including returnable plastic containers, is expected to spur consumption. Per capita consumption of soft drinks is 27 litres a year in Saudi Arabia, 23 litres in Egypt and 18 litres in Bahrain, against US consumption of 180 litres a year. Al Zayani Investments has interests in banking, services tendering, hotels, property and light manufacturing.</p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEEKENDER: SOCIABLE AT BANNING MANSION IS A CHANCE FOR VISITORS TO TURN BACK  THE CLOCK.  </P> <P> Usually, when people visit the sumptuous Phineas Banning mansion in Wilmington,  it's on a tour: A well-informed guide tells them all about the founder of  Wilmington, who built the house in 1864 and lived there with his family.  </P> <P> But on Sunday afternoon, visitors to the home and its lush grounds may find  themselves feeling a little like a Banning guest on a tranquil afternoon more  than 100 years ago.  </P> <P> The Greek Revival house, with its spacious rooms and heirloom furnishings, will  be open as usual. But a woman will be seated on the back porch snapping beans,  and someone will be playing a dulcimer.  </P> <P> On the tree-shaded grounds, a blacksmith will be at work; clog dancers will  perform Appalachian dances, and a barbershop quartet will harmonize. The way  people in the 19th Century made such treats as ice cream and such necessities  as quilts, soap and rope will be demonstrated.  </P> <P> "An Old-Fashioned Summer Sociable," as the event is called, is meant to show  what life was like when the mansion was a family home, according to Julia  Heard, who heads the Banning Residence Museum's volunteers and is chairman of  the event. "We want to show that this was a living house, not a museum," she  said.  </P> <P> Famous for what they called their "entertainments," the Bannings enjoyed  inviting people to their estate and sometimes had dancing and musicians in  front of the house, Heard said. This was the era of ranching, and guests came  from long distances, sometimes staying overnight in the house or in tents  pitched on the grounds.  </P> <P> Sunday's sociable won't be quite as long as the Banning entertainments were,  but museum volunteers -- some of them dressed in period clothes -- plan to  squeeze a lot of events into three hours. There'll even be a tribute to the  patriarch himself. Banning would have turned 160 last Sunday, and the event  will be celebrated with cake and a round of "Happy Birthday."  </P> <P> Besides watching demonstrations of homemaking in the last century, visitors can  try their hand at a few things. They can make rope, soap and clothespin dolls;  crank ice cream, churn butter, and wash clothes on a scrub-board.  </P> <P> Out on the lawn, children may entertain themselves with such 19th-Century games  as rolling barrel hoops with a stick, shooting marbles, engaging in egg and  spoon races and playing pin the tail on the donkey.  </P> <P> Inside the mansion, a collection of 18 quilts, all made before 1900, will be  shown on beds and draped across chairs, as they might have been when the home  was lived in. Victorian hats also will be on view.  </P> <P> Walking through the big door of the Banning carriage house -- which still has  its horse stalls and original sturdy floor -- visitors will encounter 10  meticulously restored carriages, buggies and carts. Included is an authentic  surrey with the fringe on top. According to Heard, the fringe was not for  decoration -- it kept the bugs away.  </P> <P> Don Blanks, a blacksmith and carriage restorer, spent a year and a half getting  the vehicles to look as if they were made yesterday. He'll be giving the  smithing demonstration Sunday, making cowbells and harness hooks, and relating  the history of smithing as he works.  </P> <P> The blacksmith was one of the most important people in town when horse-drawn  wagons and plows reigned supreme, Blanks said. "In small towns, he was sent for  before the doctor was. If the wheels don't roll, the farmer can't farm. He was  the fix-it man of the 1900s," he said.  </P> <P> This Sunday's old-fashioned sociable is the first one that the Banning museum  has sponsored, and there are plans to make it an annual party. The museum has  wanted to hold a summer event and was encouraged by the success of its annual  Victorian Christmas, which usually draws about 1,500 people. That kind of  turnout is not expected for a brand-new event, but the museum is hoping for up  to 400 people.  </P> <P> Heard said: "We want people to go away thinking what life was like in the 19th  Century, yet to know how many traditions we are carrying on, such as the family  getting together and doing chores together."

			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> WATER CONSERVATION MEASURES ON AGENDA  </P> <P> The city of Oxnard today will consider a water conservation ordinance that bans  water-wasting practices like hosing off driveways and would levy fines or cut  off water service for repeat violators.  </P> <P> Although Oxnard has a direct waterline from the state water project, city  officials said the ordinance is proposed to avoid future shortages as the  drought in Southern California enters its fifth year.  </P> <P> The ordinance would also prohibit watering lawns between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.,  prohibit allowing water to run onto streets and sidewalks, and prohibit serving  water at restaurants unless requested by a customer. It would ban carwashes  that do not recycle water, decorative fountains that do not recycle, and broken  or damaged water fixtures that are not repaired within a reasonable amount of  time.  </P> <P> After the first offense, city officials will warn violators. A second offense  within 12 months will result in a fine equal to 25% of the most recent utility  bill or $25, whichever is higher. A third offense within 12 months will result  in a fine equal to 50% of the most recent bill or $50, whichever is higher.  </P> <P> If a fourth violation occurs, the city will install a water restriction device  on the violator's waterline.  </P> <P> The city could cut off water services if a person violates the ordinance more  than four times within 12 months.

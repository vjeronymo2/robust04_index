			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: SB drug should win approval SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, yesterday announced that the US Food and Drug Administration had sent it a letter indicating that its anti-nausea compound Kytril was approvable. The letter does not constitute an approval, but it does indicate that the medicine should soon receive a licence. The news is a relief forthe company which has been plagued by regulatory problems in recent months. Kytril will compete directly with Zofran, one of Glaxo's fastest-growing medicines with sales last year of Pounds 365m, of which Pounds 219m were in the US. Kytril's sales last year were Pounds 32m and are expected to reach Pounds 75m, according to analysts Wertheim Schroder. Last March, the FDA's gastrointestinal advisory committee felt unable to recommend approval for Kytril because of potential carcinogenic and cardiovascular side effects. Wellcome, the UK drugs group, announced yesterday that Navelbine, its anti-cancer compound, had been recommended by FDA's oncology drug advisory committee for use in advanced non-small cell lung cancer either as a single agent or in combination with cisplatin, another chemotherapy product. The committee's advice is normally taken by the FDA.</p>

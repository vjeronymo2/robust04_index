			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hartstone falls Pounds 9.9m into loss - Results worse than expected after exceptional costs totalling Pounds 31m HARTSTONE, the hosiery and leather goods group which has issued three profits warnings in recent months, yesterday stunned the City with Pounds 31m above the line costs, forcing it into pre-tax losses of Pounds 9.86m for the year to March 31. The results, which compared with a profit of Pounds 22m last year, were depressed by Pounds 11.8m in rationalisation charges and write-downs, and a further Pounds 18.7m in exceptional restructuring costs. Before exceptionals there was a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.83m. The shares fell 3p to 36p. Analysts said yesterday it was too early to determine the long-term future of Hartstone, built up by former Albert Fisher chief Mr Stephen Barker through a rapid series of acquisitions. The group, which had breached banking covenants, was in refinancing talks with bankers. Gearing stood at 120 per cent and was expected to rise further. 'The figures were a shambles,' said one London analyst. 'People were expecting a pre-tax profit of almost Pounds 9m. To come in at a loss of that figure . . . leaves one wondering where it all will stop.' Most analysts said any attempts at forecasts for the current year would be futile until talks with the banks became clearer. Meanwhile, the accounts would be prepared on a going concern basis, which depended on the success of the discussions. Mr Shaun Dowling, the non-executive director who replaced Mr Barker as executive chairman in May, was harsh on past management. They had purchased businesses 'unwisely', he said, while some of the smaller acquisitions had lost 'significant amounts of money', leaving large inter-company debts. The board became aware of difficulties in November, Mr Dowling said, when the group moved from quarterly to monthly accounts. However, trading continued to worsen, and the group issued a profits warning in March. Two months and two further warnings later, it was forecasting profits of not less than Pounds 8.7m. However, it had not become clear until the board meeting on Tuesday night that the group would have to take Pounds 18.7m in exceptional charges for further restructuring. Some Pounds 6m of this would be paid in fees to renegotiate financial facilities. Closure costs were estimated at Pounds 10.8m, with Pounds 1.8m in goodwill being written off. On the trading front, Mr Dowling was cautious, but confident. Hartstone, he said, 'has profitable businesses capable of further development'. He announced the appointment of a new finance director to improve reporting procedures, Mr Stephen Oakley, formerly of Macarthy, the pharmacies group. Group trading profits were 10 per cent down at Pounds 21.9m on sales ahead 56 per cent to Pounds 370.3m. A 67 per cent increase in hosiery profits to Pounds 9.47m had not been enough to offset the 34 per cent decline in leather goods to Pounds 12.4m. Hartstone benefited from a Pounds 6.7m gain on currency transactions following the devaluation of sterling. There will not be a final dividend, leaving the 2.8p interim as payment for the year (total 4.875p). Losses per share were 12.4p (earnings 21.1p).</p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: COMANECI SAYS SHE WAS TARGET OF CEAUSESCU  </P> <P> Former Olympic gymnast Nadia Comaneci said her defection just weeks before  Romania's Communist government crumbled had so embarrassed leader Nicolae  Ceausescu that he ordered her hunted down and brought back.  </P> <P> Comaneci, 28, who surprised the world when she fled Romania, said she hopes to  visit her homeland after its crisis ends. Ceausescu, the last of the ironclad  Stalinist leaders in the Warsaw Pact countries, was executed with his wife  Monday.  </P> <P> Comments from Comaneci were included in a release issued in New York announcing  that David Frost's company, David Paradine Television Inc., would produce the  film of her story.  </P> <P> "I hope that through the movie and public statements I can be of more help to  my countrymen than by returning to live in Bucharest," Comaneci's statement  said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by R.W.] </F>   [Text] A week before the self-governmental elections, 60  percent of adult Poles intended to take part in the voting (35  percent of them knew this for certain). Over 40 percent still  had no idea who they would support. The most numerous group of  respondents intended to support nonpartisan candidates; as for  political parties, the most popular was the Democratic Left  Alliance [SLD], followed by the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and  the Union of Freedom [UW]. Almost every sixth respondent did  not know the party to which "his" candidate belongs. The poll  was carried out by the Sopot Public Opinion Research Institute  [PBS] at the request of RZECZPOSPOLITA.    Even though 60 percent of respondents declared that they are  willing to go to the polls, the final voter turnout should be  estimated at a considerably lower level. Opinion researchers  have already often noticed that actual voter turnout is indeed  closer to the number of people whose answer to the question  concerning their intention of voting was "definitely yes."  There are 35 percent of them, so we can expect a turnout of  approximately 40 percent. These calculations are also confirmed  by specialists from the Center for Research on Public Opinion  [OBOP]; this center has obtained almost identical results as the  Sopot institute.    Among those who will go to the polls in the greatest numbers  are people with higher educations (nearly 60 percent of them are  absolutely sure they will vote), the richest people, people  employed in the budget sector, white-collar workers of higher  and medium levels, and parliamentary voters of most of the  well-known parties. This particularly concerns the former  "Fatherland" coalition, of which the Christian-National Union is  the main component, as well as the Union for Real Politics, the  former Democratic Union, and the Polish Peasant Party-Peasant  Accord. More than 50 percent of representatives from these  groups say that they will certainly go to the polls.    The greatest reservations can be observed among poorly  educated respondents, rather poor people, manual workers,  especially unskilled workers, and housewives.    People who declare the desire to vote very frequently do not  yet know which name they will choose on 19 June. Total lack of  knowledge is declared by 44 percent of respondents in this  group; 22 percent have their favorites but are still hesitant.  Only every third respondent knows for certain who he will  support.    Most disorientated are young people, with vocational  education, with low incomes, the unemployed, school and  university students, and those who supported the former  Liberal-Democratic Congress and the Nonparty Bloc in Support of  Reforms [BBWR] in the parliamentary elections. The least doubts  are expressed by respondents between the ages of 40 and 59, with  higher education, well-off individuals, and peasants and  representatives of the managerial cadre.    Every fifth respondent (20 percent) says that the candidate  he is going to support does not belong to any party; every sixth  (17 percent) person is not able to identify himself with any  particular grouping. The rest are going to support a candidate  fielded by one of the political organizations. Most frequently  mentioned are the SLD, the PSL, and the UW (which received much  lower preference ratings than during the parliamentary  elections). Between 1 and 2 percent of respondents are going to  vote for each center-right party.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   A PBS poll for RZECZPOSPOLITA, conducted on 11 and 12 June;  a  1,043-person representative sample of adult inhabitants of  Poland. The OBOP poll, conducted between 20 and 25 May,  consisted of 1,079 interviews conducted with a random sample of  adult inhabitants of Poland.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Are you going to vote in the self-governmental elections?                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Definitely not                        |18 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Probably not                          |16 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Probably yes                          |25 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Definitely yes                        |35 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Hard to tell                          |6 percent                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Which political grouping does the person you are going to support in the sel-|  |f-governmental elections represent?                                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |20 percent                            |Nonpartisan                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |16 percent                            |SLD                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |14 percent                            |PSL                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |9 percent                             |UW                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |5 percent                             |Union of Labor                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |3 percent                             |Independent Self-Governing Trade Unio-|  |                                      |n "Solidarity"                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |3 percent                             |BBWR                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Note: Table includes only those parties that were most frequently mentioned  |  |by respondents.                                                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Coalition Era Is an Excellent Chance </F> To Become Autonomous"]    [Text] The autonomy of the Fair Trade Commission [FTC] is  being questioned over the issue of the arrest of former  Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura, who is suspected of  applying pressure in connection with the "Saitama Doyokai  `dango' [bid-rigging by collusion] incident." Regarding  Nakamura's repeated requests that the FTC withdraw its  indictment, the FTC stresses that it rendered its judgment  independently on the basis of "insufficient evidence." However,  given the fact that the FTC was about to strengthen its  enforcement of the Antimonopoly Law, some voices of apprehension  are heard concerning a decline of its image. At a time when the  United States is demanding stronger competitive measures and  stepping up its criticism of Japan, attention is being focused  on the FTC's role.  <H5>  Despite a Decline in Intervention </H5> "We politicians ourselves must seriously consider how to stop  political intervention in public bidding." SDPJ [Social  Democratic Party of Japan] Diet member Tatsuyo Matsumoto thus  expressed her sentiment in listening to explanations concerning  the public bidding policy offered by the FTC on 9 March to the  coalition parties' project team on reform of the bidding system.    Political intervention in public bidding could lead to  political intervention of the FTC which tries to prosecute  "dango." As a certain Diet member of Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party] insists, "We must eradicate the `dango society'"; the  sense of crisis regarding the problem is growing within the  coalition parties.    According to FTC sources, in conjunction with the transfer  of  ruling power from the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] to the  coalition parties, occasions for the FTC--which is moving toward  a stronger antimonopoly policy--to receive political pressures  are reportedly becoming extremely infrequent. It is said that  "there has been virtually no opposition" regarding the recent  policy which would certainly have encountered some reaction  during the era of the LDP administration with the industrial  circles as a backdrop, or during the on-the-spot inspection of  the Shiseido Company on suspicion of obstructing discount sales.    However, among the coalition parties is the beginning of a  new trend to form Dietmen leagues by industries and to seek  "vested interests." Although "destruction of the  government-bureaucratic-industrial alignment" is the slogan of  the Hosokawa administration, the possibility of renewed strong  pressures toward the FTC cannot be ruled out if the coalition  era lasts for a longer period.    The FTC has steadily achieved results such as the  prosecution  of violations since the Japan-U.S. Structural Impediments  Initiative talks (1989-1990) which advocated stronger  enforcement of the Antimonopoly Law. However, a question remains  as to whether it can respond adequately to the environmental  changes.  <H5>  "Bitter Experiences" of the LDP Era </H5>   A certain FTC veteran points out that he "suffered bitter  experiences a number of times during the LDP era." For example,  when it was decided to exempt certain items from the resale  price system, some cosmetic and pharmaceutical items were  reportedly left intact due to opposition by LDP welfare zoku  Dietmen, although several studies were made for total abolition.    In 1984, the policy on public bidding targeted the  construction industry because of a "dango" incident (1982) among  the construction contractors in Shizuoka Prefecture. The  construction industry, alarmed by the prosecution of the  violations, reportedly negotiated with the LDP construction  "zoku" Dietmen, and the indictment was watered down to omit any  clear reference to any violation of the law. Of course,  regarding such an accusation, one member of the LDP construction  subcommittee at the time declared emphatically as follows:  "Unlike the United States, Japan does not have a climate of  sheer competition. Setting aside decisions on the recipients of  orders and bid prices, some form of coordination should be  necessary. It is not wrong to hold a meeting for simple exchange  of information."    It is said that there was a time when such political  pressure  served as a function to revise the Antimonopoly Law. While the  penalty for violations under the 1992 revision was raised from  the previous maximum 5 million yen to 100 million yen, the FTC  was considering a hike to several hundred million yen. A certain  politician of the LDP Antimonopoly Law Investigation Committee,  who learned about this, reportedly called an FTC executive and  strongly demanded a change in policy.    Professor Toshimasa Tsuruta of Senshu University, who serves  as chairman of the FTC's distribution problems research group,  makes the following appeal: "Although the FTC is trying its best  to strengthen its prosecution administration, it has been the  victim of politics under the LDP's 1955 system. Freedom from  politics is now necessary."  <H5>  Short of a Criminal Indictment </H5>   However, it is true that self-help efforts are demanded of  the FTC itself. Dietman Tadashi Kuranari, who once served as  chairman of the LDP Antimonopoly Law Investigation Committee,  declares: "Indictments in the industry are often limited to  minor cases. Why does it [FTC] not fight against such colossal  evils as the general constractors scandal?" There have been  construction "dango" incidents in Saitama, Yokosuka, and  Shizuoka, but they have all fallen short of being criminally  indicted.    It has been cynically pointed out that, under the long rule  of the LDP, the FTC has been "a watchdog that has been trained  not to bite," rather than "a watchdog that does not bite" (an  FTC veteran). Its true worth as an independent agency which is  not trifled with will be demanded in the future.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Barbara Gillman: "The HWWA Head Fears Budget </F> Cuts by the Hanseatic City's Senate"]    [Text] The president of the HWWA Institute for Economic  Research in Hamburg, Erhard Kantzenbach, fears that in the  future he will have to manage with perceptibly fewer funds, for  the science senator of the city state has set up a drastic  austerity budget. If the land cuts its share of HWWA's basic  funding, the Federal Government may follow suit.    Kantzenbach's worries are well-founded. In Hamburg's Office  for Science and Research, which has jurisdiction over HWWA, it  is said that the Institute "is included in the austerity  considerations." Nothing is final yet, and Kantzenbach hopes for  something definite from the HWWA advisory board meeting in June.  Its chairman, Hamburg's science senator, goes in for large-scale  savings: The university's personnel costs alone are to drop by 7  or 8 million German marks [DM], which amounts to 10 or 15  percent per sector.    If the land cuts the subsidy to HWWA, the Federal Government  will probably also lower its contribution so that the 50:50  financing is preserved. It could even get worse. It is being  pointed out by the Federal Economics Ministry (BMWi) that even  today, one-fourth of HWWA researchers do not work in science,  but rather for the information center. If the importance of  research in the plan is receding, one "must examine" whether the  general agreement between the Federal Government and laender on  joint research funding, according to Article 91b of the Basic  Law, still applies to HWWA. Spelled out: Bonn might withdraw  completely and leave the fate of the renowned HWWA to the  Hanseatic city.  <H5>  The Hamburg Institute Holds Second Place in Basic Funding </H5>   This year, the institute receives DM9.96 million each from  the Federal Government and the land. Only the IfW in Kiel  receives more; all other large economic research institutes must  make do with fewer funds.    Kantzenbach, who has been heading the HWWA since 1989, is  known to any economics student who has even scratched the  surface on the theory of competition. In his dissertation the  Hannoverian, born 1931, proclaimed the thesis that competition  is fiercest among a given group of competitors who manufacture  similar products and have an overview of the market. Economists  call that: "broad oligopoly with limited product homogeneity and  market transparency."    In 1967, Kantzenbach became a professor at the University of  Frankfurt. There the SPD [Social Democratic Party]  member--elected as representative of the liberal wing of  professors and teaching assistants--held the office of president  from 1971 to 1975. Subsequently he moved to the University of  Hamburg. Following tradition, he remained a professor there even  after assuming office at the HWWA.    As a member of the Commission on Monopoly (1974 to 1986) and  its chairman (as of 1979), Kantzenbach criticized the megafusion  of Daimler and AEG, as well as the merger of Daimler and MBB.    For over a year now, the HWWA has had a scientific advisory  board composed of five professors, thus fulfilling an old demand  by the Scientific Council. Presidents of other institutes long  opposed the additional tutelage; now all six economic research  institutes have an advisory council. Kantzenbach makes the best  of it: The advisory board meetings "are interesting for me  personally," and the research departments are forced "to think  about themselves."    One of the first pieces of advice by the external scientists  was to establish a new research group for "regulation,  industrial economics, and competition." It was occasioned by the  reports on the situation of competition in the new laender  prepared for the economics ministry. Competition specialist  Kantzenbach summarizes tersely the essence of the observations:  With the exception of local markets, such as for newspapers and  sugar, competition in Germany "in no way was intensified" by  unification.    In early May, the institute will devote a conference to  Germany as a business location, because this "political slogan"  now stands for a number of economic problems, says Kantzenbach.  In addition to short-term foreign exchange rate problems, it  concerns investment incentives, profitability, research and  development, and employment. The moderate wage agreements,  "economically tenable," must be differentiated more according to  quality, sectors and regions. But tax policy must then balance  social hardships.    Political "crash programs" cannot achieve the link-up with  high technology. Instead of conducting "industrial policy par  excellence" as in the case of Transrapid, the state should put  more funds into the basic research of institutes and  universities. The "miserable" training conditions of students  also need urgent improvement.    The HWWA research departments, "Economy, Money, and Public  Finances" as well as "Economic Structure and Economic Order,"  are nationally oriented. Four of a total of six departments deal  with international issues: "World Economy," "Economic and  Financial Relations Between Industrial Countries," "Development  Policy and Integration of Developing Countries," as well as  "Economic Systems and Relations of East European Countries."    Banks above all work with the HWWA index for raw material  prices. On a daily basis, researchers update the index to the  latest stock market quotations and use it to compute prior work  [costs] and the terms of trade.    The Hamburg institute reports regularly to the BMWi on the  economic situation in the Baltic states as well as St.  Petersburg and Koenigsberg [Kaliningrad]. Information on these  regions encountered lively interest, especially in enterprises.    The HWWA earns annually DM325,000 by this commission--a  small  contribution to the total budget which amounted to DM20.3  million in 1993. Personnel costs alone were DM16.2 million. In  addition to the basic funding, the HWWA had additional revenues  of DM2.1 million through commissioned work. Three-fourths of the  reports were ordered by public authorities, among them the BMWi  alone for DM1.47 million.    If one measures the outside funds ratio against the overall  budget, it amounts to only 10.3 percent. But according to  Kantzenbach's figures, the research budget plus proportionate  costs for administration amounts to only DM9.5 million. Computed  on this basis, the share earned by 53 scientists through expert  opinions increases to 22 percent.  <H5>  Of 221 Staff Members 130 Work for the Info Center </H5>   The remainder of the budget funds, about DM9 million, goes  to  the HWWA Information Center which employs 130 of a total of 221  HWWA staff members. The library houses over a million volumes.  Last year 72,300 people utilized this scientific resource. In  addition, there is the press documentation which stores 17.3  million articles. One of the Info center's tasks is also  advising enterprises. For that, fees of about DM400,000 were  collected in 1993.    The collection of press clippings and books was the  institute's original task when it was founded in 1908 as the  central department of the Colonial Institute in Hamburg. In the  Weimar Republic, it was given the name of "Hamburg's World  Economy Archive" (HWWA). After 1945 it also turned to more  practical research; as of 1970 this was expressed in the new  name, "HWWA Institute for Economic Research-Hamburg."    The institute publishes research results regularly in the  periodicals WIRTSCHAFTSDIENST (monthly), INTERECONOMICS  (bimonthly), and FINANZIERUNG UND ENTWICKLUNG (quarterly).  KONJUNKTUR VON MORGEN appears every two weeks.    To provide the institute with more flexibility, the Hamburg  senate and the BMWi in 1991 wanted to turn the HWWA agency into  a [registered] association. All other economic research  institutes are organized under this private legal form, with the  exception of the university institute, IfW. The staff violently  opposed the plans. They feared deterioration of their working  conditions; furthermore, the institute even as "e.V."  [registered association] would not be granted additional rights.  The protest was successful, and the HWWA remained an agency.</p>

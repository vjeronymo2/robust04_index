			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC import restrictions 'wrong and ineffective' IT WOULD be 'wrong and ineffective' for the European Commission to impose quotas on imports of CIS aluminium, said Mr Igor Prokopov, president of Concern Aluminiy, the holding company for the CIS industry, yesterday. The commission is considering a quota system at the request of some European aluminium producers who claim that their smelters are threatened by an unprecedented surge in CIS exports since 1991. Mr Prokopov pointed out the CIS industry had costs which were among the lowest in the world but all its contracts were related to the world market price established by the London Metal Exchange. Most exports were handled by large, reputable western trading organisations. Also, much of the proceeds from CIS aluminium exports were used to pay for imports of raw materials, equipment and food for the smelters and most of these came from Europe. If the EC forced cuts in aluminium exports from the CIS, its own exports would suffer. In any case, there was no such thing as a 'European aluminium market' - just a world market in which the CIS was playing a normal role. It made no sense to put a fence between Europe and the CIS - 'it would achieve nothing'.</p>

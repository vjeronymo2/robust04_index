DPA was told this by  Bernd-Olaf Hagedorn, Greens spokesman in the Mainz Landtag, on  Sunday. About 50 members of several human rights organizations  had been detained in their hotel in the Kurdish town of Batman  since Friday. The people in question are well; following an  intervention by the German Embassy, they are also permitted to  use the telephone again. However, they refuse to leave the hotel.    A spokesman of the Bonn Foreign Ministry said: "We made very  clear statements to the Foreign Ministry and to the Interior  Ministry in Ankara." In addition, an embassy employee talked to  the authorities in Batman. The spokesman said that the blockade  was due to the nervousness of the authorities in connection with  the elections. Security checks are so strict that it is hardly  possible to move about freely.    The human rights delegations have been in the Kurdish area  since 19 March to observe the local elections on Sunday. On  Monday they wanted to return to Germany. They are accompanied  by six participants from Mainz and Wiesbaden, including Friedel  Gruetzmacher, head of the Greens group in the  Rhineland-Palatinate Landtag.</p>

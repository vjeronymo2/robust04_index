			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: State control still leaves bitter taste - Ukraine's status as a top five sugar producer is in danger, says Jill Barshay UKRAINE'S status as one of the world's five biggest sugar producers is in jeopardy unless the state relinquishes control of the industry. Plagued with financial problems, energy shortages and a dearth of machinery and spare parts, sugar growers cannot count on a repeat of this year's good weather to maintain the country's largest cash crop. Ukraine's sugar beet crop is up 43 per cent this year, at 40m tonnes, but it is still unclear if Ukraine's farmers will be able to harvest the large crop to produce 4.5m tonnes of sugar before the ground freezes in the middle of this month. Only 60 per cent of the harvest was gathered by the end of last week. Heavy September rains delayed the harvesting by two weeks. In a country beset with hyperinflation and a worthless paper currency, Ukraine must barter its resources for imports. With 2.5m tonnes of sugar satisfying the sweet teeth of 52m Ukrainians, the expected additional 2m tonnes is primarily sold to other states within the Commonwealth of Independent States. Sugar exports are Ukraine's primary means of buying desperately needed energy supplies from Russia, to which it already owes Dollars 2.5bn for gas and oil. Ukraine also sells its sugar to Turkmenistan for gas, to Uzbekistan for cotton and tobacco and to Belorussia for consumer goods. Since last year's miserable harvest of 28m tonnes of beets, Kiev's communist-oriented government has been under pressure to stimulate sugar production. Inclined toward command economy formulas, the government issued huge amounts of credits and subsidies to growers over the summer and early autumn. Dismayed that the credits only served to drive up inflation, the government was driven last month to a desperate measure: tentative market reform. Although private farming is almost non-existent in Ukraine, especially in beet production, the Minister of Agriculture, Mr Yuri Karasik, has now given beet growers limited rights to make their own storing, processing and selling decisions. Co-operative and state farms may barter their beets for fuel to power their tractors and harvester. Farmers may also process their beets into sugar for sale to the state at a higher price: while the state still remains the monopoly buyer, farmers are no longer required to sell their raw product immediately. However, beet growers are still hostages of the inefficient state. Obligatory state orders take 96 per cent of the expected harvest, leaving farmers with a mere 4 per cent of their crop to buy whatever they want from whomever they want. Farmers receive a small purchase price from the state which is rendered meaningless by hyperinflation and irregular and obsolete supplies from the shattered state distribution system. Lacking fuel, farms cannot transport beets to storage houses to await processing. Instead, cut beets lie on the soil, losing sugar content. With an initial 15-20 per cent sugar content, cut beets lose one-tenth of 1 per cent of sugar each day they lie on the ground - sometimes more during cold autumn nights. It is not uncommon for state farms to hire elderly women to pick beets off the field. Beyond the immediate energy shortage, there are deeper concerns for next year when the current stock of harvesting machines, which are on their last legs this year, will wear out. The Soviets, with their philosophy of centralised production, decided that all Ukraine's harvesters should be built at a Ternopl factory, which in turn received many parts from the former East Germany. The Ternopl factory is no longer supplied by the Germans and production has come to a halt. Ukraine's sugar beet production research institute, SakharSvyokla, has developed an alternative harvesting attachment for simple tractors, but so far has not been able to find investment for mass production. 'Starting next year, there will be a problem. In the 1994-95 season, there will be a grave deficiency of machinery,' says a SakharSvyokla analyst. In addition trucks and clumsy sorting machines lead to unnecessary losses from transportation and sorting, amounting to 3.5 per cent of the harvest. The final blow to the Ukrainian sugar industry could come from Russia, which is contemplating imposing a 100 per cent customs duty on sugar imports to promote its own faltering sugar industry.</p>

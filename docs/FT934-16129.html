			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Legal moves on waste recycling GERMANY'S ambitious recycling programme for packaging waste faced a new obstacle yesterday after a large dairy company filed a supreme court suit seeking to undermine its key requirements, Reuter reports from Bonn. A spokeswoman for Alois Muller, a Bavarian dairy company, said the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe had said it would hear the case. 'We have been told verbally the case will be accepted, but we do not have an official written confirmation yet,' said spokeswoman, Mrs Marita Rehbein, of Alois Muller's legal department. However, a spokesman for the court said he believed a decision on the case was still pending. The case is the latest gesture of opposition to the programme run by a private company, Duales System Deutschland (DSD), which has been criticised by Germany's federal cartel agency and which narrowly escaped a financial crisis this summer. Alois Muller's challenge also echoed mounting calls from industry and environmental experts, including government members of parliament, for incineration to be given a greater role in flattening the mounting dumps. Alois Muller, which uses mainly plastic containers for milk products it distributes nationally, is challenging a strict 1990 recycling ordinance that requires the private sector to recycle rather than burn or dump most throw-away packaging. 'The main point for us is that incineration must be allowed as an alternative to recycling,' Mrs Rehbein said. She acknowledged it would probably take the court years to reach a decision because of a backlog in cases. Alois Muller's challenge would undermine a clause of the ordinance which requires 80 per cent of disposable packaging made of plastic, cardboard, paper or metal to be collected and 80 per cent of that to be recycled - provisions that will take effect in 1994. Under pressure from the new rules, the three sectors involved - packaging makers, retail businesses and waste management companies - last year set up a national network for collecting the waste from homes and recycling it.</p>

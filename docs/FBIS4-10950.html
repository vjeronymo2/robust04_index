			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Why Weaken DINCOTE?"] </F>   [Text] On 3 February, the National Police Headquarters  ordered the transfer of 200 policemen from the National  Counterterrorism Directorate (DINCOTE) to other police units.  According to a statement made by the PNP's [Peruvian National  Police] general director, Victor Alva Plasencia, this measure is  being applied in a general context of police reorganization, and  is not limited to the DINCOTE.    Nevertheless, there are indications that the changes in the  DINCOTE are attributable to a higher political realm, in which  not even President Alberto Fujimori himself holds all the  decision-making power.    According to unofficial information, the DINCOTE has five  police units called Deltas, each of which has approximately 35  members and is under orders from a commander. Their task is to  support the intelligence work and the operations planned on the  directorate levels.    Concurrently, there is the Special Intelligence Group  (GEIN),  engaged in intelligence work per se, and constructing and  refining its own data base in order to track the leading  suspects. On a certain occasion, the GEIN was divided into one  group devoted to SL [Shining Path] and another devoted to the  MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement].    There are also the BREDET, initials designating the brigades  that follow up reports frequently provided by the public on  suspected houses or persons.    The work of a DINCOTE member is quite arduous. Officers and  some of the subordinate personnel often work for consecutive  periods lasting 12 or 16 hours a day. Moreover, on many  occasions their stint lasts 24 hours, because of the proximity  of an operation.    Despite the intense work and the constant danger to which  each member of the operative groups is exposed, he is not  compensated monetarily.    For example, a captain's pay is from 400 to 450 soles  ($215),  not counting the amount deducted. A junior officer, on the other  hand, earns approximately 300 soles ($140).    A DINCOTE operative member, among those stationed for hours  to spy on a suspect, receives 5 soles of per diem for his entire  long work assignment.    Recently, the DINCOTE personnel had a pay cut. At the end of  January, their annual bonus for hazardous work was reduced.  According to one official, this occurred despite the fact that  the budget allocated to the DINCOTE for 1993 had included this  extra income.    Two days before they were to receive the bonus, the agents  were informed of a 70 percent reduction in the incentive bonus.  Hence, if an officer was supposed to receive 225 soles, he was  given only 65 new soles; whereas a junior officer, who would  have received 160 more than his salary, earned only 40 soles.    According to members of this institution, until General  Ketin  Vidal's administration, "the DINCOTE was far more compact, and  the entire group's motivation was sustained. There were no  objections when it was necessary to engage in any operation."  Furthermore, the operative members had a certain amount of  autonomy for carrying out their missions, without lapsing into a  mechanical job. Now, the situation in the DINCOTE reportedly has  deteriorated in all these respects. There are fewer resources  for operations, and there is more inflexibility in the  instructions.    The National Intelligence Service's [SIN] excessive  interference in the management of operations and personnel has  become another debatable feature of the present-day DINCOTE.    Two copies of every case file or record prepared in the  DINCOTE must be submitted to the SIN, without any reciprocity  implied. Some officers criticize what they claim to be the  unwillingness shown by the chiefs, including their present  general director, to defend their own decision-making power,  unlike what was typical of them until December 1992.    Some of the SIN's intervention in the DINCOTE is backed by  legal regulations stipulating that the SIN shall receive the  support of qualified forces so long as it lacks the necessary  personnel.    However, that support to the SIN is now becoming a virtual  decapitation of the DINCOTE. Recently, the "Sunday Review" news  program on television Channel 4 announced the transfer of 14  DINCOTE officers, including lieutenants, captains, majors, and  colonels, to the SIN. Nevertheless, the number of officers  transferred is said to be even higher.    Among those transferred to the SIN is a colonel who,  according to very well-informed sources, was the real director  of the investigations making it possible to capture Abimael  Guzman and scores of other Shining Path leaders. Another  colonel, the principal expert in the investigations of the MRTA,  was transferred to a province in late 1993.    Moreover, nearly 90 percent of the total personnel  transferred to the SIN were members of the Delta and Special  Intelligence (GEIN) groups. The other 10 percent are assimilated  or administrative personnel.    The objective no longer seems to be merely to obtain  support,  but rather to expropriate intelligence from the DINCOTE, so as  to put its best investigators under the direct control of  military intelligence. The particular goal would be to put them  under the command of Vladimiro Montesinos, President Fujimori's  principal adviser on the subject of subversion, and one of the  SIN's preeminent spokesmen.    Now then, the following question is fitting: Why reinforce  military intelligence so much, at the cost of debilitating the  DINCOTE, which has been the state's real mainstay for repressing  subversion? Furthermore, why do so in a situation wherein  subversion is plummeting?    The most plausible, and perhaps also the most suspicious  response is that such personnel will be assigned to other  investigations dissociated from the countersubversive types.  With the SL decline, other adversaries are taking priority:  others to be located, checked, and neutralized.    The drug traffic? If that were the target aimed at, the  DINANDRO [National Police Counternarcotics Directorate] should  have been the unit reinforced with ex-DINCOTE personnel. Or, in  any event, the SIN would have requested DINANDRO rather than  DINCOTE officers to reinforce it in this mission.    The military and civilian opposition? Therein lies the  explanation. There is no doubt that the La Cantuta case, the  leaks to the press of classified information provided by the  Comaca or Leon Dormido groups, and the charges by certain  officials of generals' being implicated in the drug traffic are  becoming the main factor in the erosion of the current military  commanders and of the government itself.    Hence, one of the adversaries, possibly the principal one,  that should be targeted, is the military opposition. The other  is the civilian opposition which, as the electoral period  approaches, will be as dangerous as the dissidents in uniform,  or more so.    The problem is that three processes detrimental to the  country's democratic order are implicit in all this: the  subordination of the armed institutions to the government's  particular political interest; the military control of the major  police units; and the weakening of the DINCOTE when the Shining  Path terrorist adventure has not yet been totally stifled.    On the other hand, what the country's general interest  requires is the same as what befits forces of order with a  democratic inclination and professional excellence: submission  to the law, clear demarcation of military and police  jurisdictions, and genuine recognition for the merit of the  police units performing their duty.</p>

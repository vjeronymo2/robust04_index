			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Hogg up on HSBC purchase Bid speculation in insurance broker Hogg Group sent the shares racing 24 ahead to 165p, in trade of 1.1m, after an announcement that a subsidiary of international banking group HSBC had taken a 6 per cent stake. Hogg advised shareholders to take no action. News of the move took the market by surprise and came a day after Hogg reported halved profits to Pounds 6.01m, and reduced its dividend. The company's shares have been in the doldrums since January when it surprised the market with a profits warning. The general view among market watchers was that the HSBC move was the first strike ahead of a full bid and analysts quickly moved to work out a possible price. One analyst said: 'There is no reason for this move other than for a bid. There is synergy with HSBC's insurance interests and Hogg would also fit well with several of Midland Bank's operations. Shareholders will have to be made an offer of at least 210p a share.' Another analyst said: 'The management have lost credibility and the major share holders are unhappy. These are the circumstances of a bid.' In an otherwise quiet banking sector, shares in HSBC firmed a penny to 739p.</p>

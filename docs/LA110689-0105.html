			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ROBBINS TO QUIT N.Y. BALLET  </P> <P> Jerome Robbins, regarded as one of the century's finest choreographers, said he  will resign as co-director of the New York City Ballet on Jan. 1.  </P> <P> Robbins, 71, plans to continue writing his memoirs and to develop an  autobiographical theater piece. The ballet company announced his resignation  Sunday.  </P> <P> "It's important at my age to do other things," he said. "I'm resigning from the  New York City Ballet; I'm not retiring from the field."  </P> <P> Though he is stepping down as co-director, Robbins is due soon to begin  rehearsals at the City Ballet for a retrospective of his ballets since 1944.  The Robbins festival is scheduled to be presented next spring.  </P> <P> The choreographer, who has worked with the City Ballet since 1949, has spent  most of the past year working on "Jerome Robbins' Broadway," a medley of  excerpts from musicals he choreographed or directed.  </P> <P> Peter Martins, the City Ballet's other co-director, will be solely responsible  for the company's artistic policy after Robbins' resignation becomes effective.  </P></p>

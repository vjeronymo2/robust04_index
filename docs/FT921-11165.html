			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Prestwick airport sale nears agreement BAA, the former British Airports Authority, is close to reaching an agreement with British Aerospace on the sale of Prestwick airport in western Scotland. A purchase by BAe would secure the future of the runway, which it needs for aircraft-manufacturing operations at the airport. The Ayrshire Community Airport Project (Acap), a consortium representing Ayrshire businesses and local authorities, is also involved in the negotiations. It is understood that BAe would hand over the running of the airport to Acap, which is chaired by Mr George Younger, Tory MP for Ayr. A third bidder for the airport, AAP, appears to be out of the running. Earlier this month the company, headed by Mr Peter Kaye, a businessman with aviation interests based in Scotland, made a cash offer of Pounds 4.75m for the airport. Prestwick has suffered a sharp fall in traffic since March 1990, when the government ended its monopoly on long-haul flights from Scotland and airlines switched operations to Glasgow. The airport made an operating loss of Pounds 4.8m in the year to March 1991 and BAA last year said it was willing to dispose of Prestwick. An article in the FT of January 15 entitled 'BAA is urged to accept bid for Prestwick' ended with the words: 'BAA said it had received the AAP bid, adding that they had failed to reach agreement last August because AAP could not meet guarantees.' Both BAA and AAP wish to make clear that this statement is incorrect and at no time has AAP failed to meet a guarantee in connection with the Prestwick negotiations. BAA had no intention to impugn the financial standing of AAP or its directors, Mr Peter M. Kaye and Dr Gordon Watson.</p>

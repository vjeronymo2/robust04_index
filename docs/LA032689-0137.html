			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOWERS COULD OFFER TEST OF FAITH FOR THOSE AT EASTER SUNRISE SERVICES  </P> <P> The faithful may be tested today -- if only a little -- as cloudy skies held  the chance of light showers for traditional Easter Sunday Sunrise Services in  the Los Angeles region.  </P> <P> "Early risers may get rained on," warned Rick Dittmann, a forecaster for  WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts to The Times. Intermittent,  scattered showers were forecast for the morning, "sputtering out" about noon,  Dittmann said.  </P> <P> Rain will be much weaker than the storm that started late Friday night and  dumped half an inch of rain downtown by mid-morning Saturday, Dittmann said.  Today's high temperatures are expected to range from the high 50s to the low  60s, with overnight lows in the upper 30s and lower 40s, before sunny weather  returns Monday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Change in Rituals  </P> <P> Easter service organizers from Hollywood Bowl to Skid Row anticipated no change  in their plans in rituals born of New Testament accounts of Jesus rising from  the dead.  </P> <P> Organizers of the 69th annual Hollywood Bowl service were anticipating as many  as 15,000 worshipers for a 5:15 a.m. ecumenical program of sermons and song  that was to be telecast locally and beamed by satellite to an audience  throughout the world. The service this year was dedicated to Armenians affected  by last December's devastating earthquake.  </P> <P> Even torrential rains would not stop the Hollywood Bowl service, said producer  Ellen Foster on Saturday, because performers such as Cyd Charisse, Rhonda  Fleming and Robert Guillame would be protected by the stage dome.  </P> <P> More than 11,000 people were expected to attend sunrise services at the four  Forest Lawn Memorial Parks -- in Covina Hills, Glendale, Hollywood Hills and  Long Beach. Other outdoor early morning services were scheduled at Mt. Rubidoux  in Riverside and at Wayfarers Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Downtown Event  </P> <P> Rain could also have dampened the annual Easter brunch at the Fred Jordan  Mission on downtown Los Angeles' Skid Row. Organizers said the 5,000 people  they had hoped to feed outdoors starting at 10 a.m. might have to be moved to  the nearby Midnight Mission, with a line starting at noon. The Long Beach  Rescue Mission was also planning to serve Easter meals starting at 10:30 a.m.  </P> <P> On Saturday night, nearly 4,000 men, women and children lined up in a drizzle  for a holiday dinner at the Los Angeles Mission.  </P> <P> Rather than sit down at tables in the rain, most sought shelter under nearby  store awnings, eating from Styrofoam plates as they stood.  </P> <P> "The rain definitely hinders what we do," said Mike Edwards, associate director  of the mission.  </P></p>

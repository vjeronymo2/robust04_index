			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kazakh </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Republic of Kazakhstan Vice-President Yerik </F> Asanbayev: "Our Turn Towards Independence Began With Our  Declaration of Sovereignty."]    [Text] Among the noteworthy events that placed our  Republic on its road to true independence was, without doubt,  the ratification of a declaration of state sovereignty on 25  October 1990 by the Supreme Soviet.    This document was not just "functional" in that period  alone.  Time has shown that it has provided, simultaneously, the  foundation of the new Republic constitution and opened the way  to sociopolitical and socioeconomic [development] for  Kazakhstan. On the third anniversary of the ratification of this  declaration, reporters of YEGEMEN QAZAQSTAN and KAZAKHSTANSKAYA  PRAVDA asked Republic of Kazakhstan Vice-President Yerik  Asanbayev about the process by which this document was prepared  and the role played by this declaration in Kazakhstan's  achieving its independence.    [Correspondent] Yerik Maghzumuly, you can speak from direct  personal experience about this historic document. You took the  lead in creating the declaration as the then chairman of the  Republic Supreme Soviet and you reported at the session on its  fundamental provisions. For that reason, we think that no one  knows better than you how this document was prepared and how it  was ratified.    [Asanbayev] First of all, you must bear in mind the  situation  in the country at the time when work on the declaration was  begun. The process leading to the path of sovereignty for the  republics had just begun. The way had been opened for the  establishment of direct, horizontal relationships by-passing the  central authority. The first signs were appearing of wasting  away of the Union state. This situation, as is well known now,  had come about because of problems in shaping the Union budget,  and due to inability to resolve international and internal  Soviet conflicts. It is understandable that national movements  aimed at self-government began to gain ground. However, the  ruling structures of the Soviet Union had in their hands  sufficient force; and they had used means to manage the nation,  especially its economic system, with administrative-dictatorial  methods. Powerful quick-reaction forces, above all the military  and industrial complex, remained standing. How could the road to  independence be without cost? The central authority continued to  depend upon Kazakhstan as a raw materials base. It was not  possible to change that in an instant. We were repeatedly  accused openly by name of striving to overthrow the Union. There  were also direct intimidations. I remember how Lukyanov called  and demanded that I carry out the decisions of the central  authority without deviation. He reminded me that if I did not  the situation could become difficult. However, as Lord Salisbury  said, "The most common error in politics is to adhere to an  outdated policy." It was not possible to halt our striving for  sovereignty. In the Soviet state, the real legal basis for  reforming the country had been destroyed. We were near to  completing work on a new Union treaty. In the end, the USSR  showed its impotency.    If now we forget for a minute the conditions under which the  declaration came into being, and if we now try to evaluate it,  we note that it had, in fact, some incomplete features. But it  is well known that one cannot look at an historical document  with the eyes of today.    We set about preparing our Declaration of Sovereignty after  similar documents had been ratified by several union republics.  They began with a declaration of "sovereignty" with respect to  the central authority and followed up with the undertaking of a  few cautious acts leading up to specific political action. For  that reason, believe what I say, working with such documents and  enriching them with specific historical circumstances and with  the content expected by the people was not such an easy thing.  To a certain degree these were uncertain, resolute steps of  heroism by the Republic president and parliament.    The draft of the declaration was prepared by a working group  comprised of the senior council of the Supreme Soviet drawn from  the ranks of people's deputies, representatives of the executive  organs, various sector specialists, including many  scientist-economists, and legal specialists. I am not  overstating it. They did a great deal of work. Hundreds of  suggestions of various kinds coming in from the citizens of the  Republic were reviewed. Drafts and suggestions of the government  and of some social units were discussed. Tens of drafts were  made of the declaration. The [final] draft was reviewed twice by  the senior council and in an expanded session of the  presidential council. Subsequently it was offered to the public  for general discussion. Only after that did it reach the hands  of the deputies.    The ratification of the declaration in a session of  parliament had a democratic quality. After heated discusses and  many hours of arguments on the draft, the Supreme Soviet formed  a special commission comprised of people's deputies to see to  its revision. The commission was headed by member of parliament,  academician, and noted legal expert Salyq Zimanov. Here too  there were broad exchanges of views and various drafts were  suggested. All in all, passionate creative work could not be  achieved in an instant. The revised draft was again discussed in  a session of parliament and there had to be a debate. Every  fourth deputy participated in the debate. In the end, this  document of remarkable fate for Kazakhstan was ratified by a  majority in parliament.    [Correspondent] It would seem to be unnecessary to take the  declaration into account at the time the new constitution was  ratified. How did this happen?    [Asanbayev] It was in fact not easy. I will not present all  the facts but limit myself to just a few. The declaration was  the first document in the history of Kazakhstan which decided as  a totality, and once and for all, all questions regarding the  status of the Republic as a free state and confirmed it through  strict legal means. If you look again at the words of the  declaration, you will find there all characteristics of a  sovereign nation: territory and citizenship entirely under the  control of the Republic; the freedom and totality of state power  within the nation; guidance based solely upon the constitution  and upon laws; our own budgetary and financial system; our own  armed forces; freedom in international relations.    We must not denigrate the importance of the declaration by  saying that through this sanctioned act of law certain  individuals desired to announce who they were to a central  authority. This document drew the outlines of our free country.  It is the support upon which today's independent state of  Kazakhstan is based.    For that reason, the declaration, as is written in its text,  was to be the base for the creation of a new constitution and,  at the same time, it was to open the way for the ratification of  various laws on citizenship, property, foreign investment, etc.,  by a state which had achieved its sovereign status in practice.    It must be stated that many republics ratified declarations  of sovereignty at that time to become the foundations of new  constitutions. For example, the declaration of state sovereignty  in Belarus was given status as constitutional law and its  provisions have been placed above actual constitutional norms.    During work after that on the draft of the new Republic  constitution many provisions of the declaration found direct  expression in its text.    For example, if you compare the prefaces to the declaration  and to the constitution, their primary aims and aspirations are  very similar to one another. Also look at such areas as the  indivisibility of the territory of Kazakhstan in the proclaimed  declaration, Kazakhstan's territorial inviolability, the  division of powers, the right of each to own property of the  various kinds and equality of ownership, the guarantee of the  protection [by law] of property of the various kinds, the legal  equality of all nationalities and nations and of all  nationalities and nations in all sectors of their social life,  etc. All of these things were later put into the constitution  and some were even taken as the basis of the constitutional  structure. That is to say that certain fruitful thoughts within  the principles of the declaration found their complete  reflection in the constitution.    [Correspondent] To be sure, the constitution is an honored  document for all citizens. This is the way that constitutions  are evaluated in every civilized country. Surely this idea was  always dominant in the sessions of the Supreme Soviet? This  being the case, how did you get into an argument with parliament.    [Asanbayev] It was not that way at all. In general, I am  against hasty categorical statements. However, I should offer  some specific examples in this connection. For example, it was  proclaimed in section seven of the declaration that the  government of the state would be carried out according to the  principle of a division between legislative, executive, and  judicial powers. As is generally known to the people, this does  not make clear the advantage and usefulness of the  representational division between those holding the mentioned  powers; but, at the same time, it foresees the creation of an  entire system. Under such circumstances, if we may quote the  words of Thomas Jefferson, one of the fathers of the American  constitution: "Those in power must make government uniform so  that it encounters no powerful stops or counter actions from  other quarters; or that the institutions of governmental power  do not go beyond the bounds of their legal powers."  Unfortunately, there are only parts of this in the new  constitution and we have been unable to create the systems, the  complete mechanism of government.    For example, if there should be unending disagreement within  the membership of parliament endangering the regular flow of  work, or if parliament were to enact one resolution after the  other contrary to the constitution, the head of state does not  have the right to dissolve it. Likewise, there is also no right,  by way of a parliamentary balance, to remove the president from  office if he acts contrary to the constitution, if the country  has been betrayed, or for committing other malicious and serious  crimes. However, the president, relying on experiences which  have withstood the test of time of a number of civilized  countries, was successful in a major effort to have these norms  included in the draft of the constitution. However, these ideas  were not ratified at meetings of the constitutional Commission.  In the parliamentary session during the process of ratification,  many deputies did not take note of the urgency of these  questions. However, complications arising from a lack of a  complete understanding of the motive forces of the constitution,  and what has resulted from the lack of legal means to regulate  difficult circumstances of the sort that exist now, are viewed  differently today.    You cannot find in the text of the new constitution even the  slightest possibility for the head of state to have the most  limited, I repeat, the most limited influence on the courts.  However, the court system as it operates today operates  altogether independently of anything and anyone. This has  resulted in the development of criminality in the Republic. Such  circumstances very much alarm me as a member of the Republic's  Security Council. Moreover, it was suggested not once but  repeatedly to the Constitutional Commission that they resolve  this problem in a quiet manner. We said that the head of state  must appoint [officers of] the courts. In addition, it was  suggested that court appointments be by democratic means,  utilizing a structure such as the Supreme Court Council under  the president. It is comprised of the senior justices of the  Republic's Supreme Court, specialists from the Ministry of  Justice and the chief procurator's office, advocates and other  specialists in the legal sector, and three deputies sent by  parliament.    Looking carefully at the question of organizing the work of  courts of justice, advice should be given about questions such  as appointment of [the officers of the] courts by the president,  removal and overruling of judges, and the application of rewards  and punishments. The courts are organs which have such broad  powers and which, at the same time, require very knowledgeable  people to serve on them. However this idea has still not been  carried out.    [Correspondent] How do you evaluate the constitution.    [Asanbayev] I evaluate it very highly. Its stabilizing role  in our society is very great. However, there is no need to say  that it was a complex and difficult task to draw up properly, in  a very compact and complete manner, such a broad, great document  in a short time in view of the varied state of our views in an  era of transition and our lack of experience in establishing our  statehood. However, there are various quite disparate views  about the character of the constitution. While some think of it  as the constitution of a presidential Republic, others say that  it is the constitution of a state of the parliamentary model.  While some say that the constitution looks forward to the  distant future, others think that it is a purely conservative  document. In the view of one expert, our constitution is rather  far from freedom. In truth, the constitution has come into being  through the reconciliation of yesterday and today; the old and  the new. This is because our society is today in transition and  that is the reality of the present. In addition, the  constitution has come into being as a result of a mutual  agreement between united forces; between all the various groups  living in society.    We should mention here that for that reason no one has the  right to appropriate the authority of the constitution and to  attach any kind of special rights to it.    Let us now consider the most important question. We, as you  yourselves know, live in a time of transition. The entire system  of economic relationships and of our social development is being  refined to advance society. This, to be sure, demands a deep  understanding of the questions of legislative work and  consideration of many phenomena in this sector. We think that  the new parliament to be chosen in the future will know how to  find a profitable and reliable mechanism for this activity,  moving away from the decrepit older system.    The honorable thought must take shape in our society that  our  constitution answers all the requirements of law and for that  reason it is the duty of all citizens to carry out [its  provisions]. It, like the constitutions of other peoples, is the  collective state ideology of development in this era. We must  forbid, whether it is on the part of members of parliament which  ratified the document, or individual scientists or social  activists, the casting of stones at the honor of the  constitution, on the one hand, and, on the other, raising a  storm of incomprehensible and false criticism . We must  encourage instead feelings of high honor in our society for this  highly esteemed law of the state. Knowing how to show respect  for the constitution has, whatever the time or whatever the  place, been a sign of pure citizenship, of culture, and of  patriotism.    To exchange views and share ideas, we should discuss some of  the ideas which find expression in the constitution from a  theoretical point of view.    [Correspondent] Could you not touch on this area in more  detail?    [Asanbayev] Let me settle one of the things which has been  much disputed. That is the question of the establishment of a  two house executive organ, with the higher powers called the  National Executive Mazhilis.    Such a structure has been characteristic of parliamentary  democracy since early times and is properly used in many  countries of the world. What is special about it?    It would be beneficial in that it would be a  regularly-functioning professional parliament and superior to  our Supreme Kenges in that respect. Thereby there would be the  possibility of creating a legislative policy that would be  carefully filtered and carefully considered. Matters extraneous  to legislating on a given occasion could be kept at a distance  or, otherwise, they could be dealt with through supplementary  legal acts.    Still, it would be possible to improve considerably the  preparation of drafts of law and their qualitative levels. We  have nothing to be proud about presently in this question. Laws  would be passed twice before the deputies [for review]. Not only  would each house state its views regarding whether it approves  or disapproves a draft of a law, but it is important that laws  would be ratified in fact. Under such circumstances, it is clear  that the responsibility of parliament and of its members would  increase.    A two-house structure would contribute to the development of  collegiality in the work of the deputies, and within the  chambers as a whole would increase knowledge and the pace of  parliamentary work.    In many countries it is not easy to solve the problem of the  inequality of delegations of deputies from various territorial  units. (If, for example, one compares the present number of  Qaraghandy and Qyzylorda deputies, what this problem means for  Kazakhstan emerges very clearly.) Through the two-house  structure it would be possible to reduce the negative effects of  the narrow thinking of so-called "parliamentary game players"  that results from the clash of class interests or "looking out  for the village" in making territorial or sector laws. There  would be uniformity in central and regional forces. Parliament  would become an organ where the interests of the entire country  and of the regions would meet; where compromises would be made.    The role of the regions has increased over what it was  before. This is because the true economic and social life is not  in the "corridors of power" of the capital but has passed over  to local areas where the fate of reform is decided in fact. It  would be beneficial for parliament to be well versed in the  problems coming from these areas and to seek for ways of  resolving them through law.    It is well known that the executive authority is critical of  parliament and prepares its decisions, to be heard twice by  parliament, with extreme care. The influence of this cannot but  reach the president. The possibility for supervision in a  session would be expanded [by having two houses.]    Exactly how, at this time, can we make clear just what a  two-house parliament would be in Kazakhstan? The parliament  would be comprised of two chambers: the upper--a senate, and the  lower--a house of deputies. The senate would be comprised of two  deputies chosen by an electorate comprised of all the local  Kenges deputies from every oblast, the capital, and Leninsk  City. Ten members of the Senate would be named by the president.  They would be persons with special knowledge or who had acquired  a great deal of experience in social service. Let me say, among  other things, that the upper house of France's parliament is  comprised of those elected indirectly and [having] one group of  deputies chosen by the president is a system employed in India,  Italy, and Pakistan. The house of deputies would be comprised of  135 deputies elected by majority votes from equal electoral  districts.    Each chamber would have its specific duties. Each would be  given their own appropriate and varied powers, according to  provision. The lower house, that is, those deputies directly  elected by the people, would play the deciding and initiating  role in legislation and in cadre questions (this is because the  right to initiate legislation would be exercised only there). On  the other hand, the upper chamber, with representative numbers  equal by region, would be the main force in resolving  international and republic-regional questions. Such differences  in function would assist in raising the capacities for service  [of each chamber], their knowledge, and the degree to which they  would be well informed. There would be activities involving  extremely broad questions that would have to be resolved by the  two houses jointly.    The legislative process would be as simple as possible and,  at the same time, as effective as possible. Drafts of proposed  laws would be reviewed by the lower chamber, provision by  provision, and approved as a whole. A draft of a law approved by  the members of the lower house by a majority vote would be sent  for review to the upper house. The Senate, if necessary, would  enter changes and additions and return it to the house of  deputies. If the lower house is not opposed to the changes, the  law would be considered ratified. Disagreements between the two  houses would be resolved through compromise procedures. If a  compromise is not possible, the original decision could be  approved by a two-thirds vote of all members of the lower house.    To be sure, there would be drafts of laws that would have to  be considered by both houses. Under such circumstances, a joint  Mazhilis of the senate and house of deputies would be called. If  a majority of deputies voted in favor in a joint Mazhilis, a law  could be considered ratified.    According to American conceptions of the executive, a draft  of a law is passed through the two houses of congress and openly  and fully discussed. It [either] encounters major changes  through corrections before it become law or it ends up being  dropped as nothing more than an idle suggestion.    This idea would never find use with us. Against it would be  such traditions as "the single house parliament has still not  exhausted itself," or "we are still not ready to do this kind of  thing." The following argument has also been advanced in  addition to evidence easy to refute: Kazakhstan is a unitary  state. However, whether one chooses a two-house parliament or  not, the nation will not be moved towards federalism. However, a  two-house parliament has never been a sign of a federal state  anywhere. There are many examples. We note that the parliaments  of Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, France, and Japan, all  considered unitary states, are comprised of two houses. Those  countries did not choose a two-house system for more convenient  solution of problems arising within their state territories, but  to refine the legislative process.    I think that sooner or later this beneficial system will be  put into effect. This is because we cannot continue to be  limited and cannot be repressed by the coming and going of  completely new people [elected as deputies]. Events progress at  their own speed but it is clear, at the very root of things,  that we will find the most proper way. We must know how to be  opposed to such things as getting puffed up about tireless work,  old boy networks, accomplishing nothing; about creating  problems, burnout, and excessive politicking. In order for me to  make this thought clear, let me offer an historical example. As  you know, Charles de Gaulle put into the constitution of the  Fifth Republic the basic elements of presidential authority and  guaranteed its stability. Socialist F. Mitterand later said  about this version of the constitution. "When he was president,  we did not like the constitution but now, when we ourselves are  in power, it seems to support our own position."    During the first period of the writing of the draft of the  constitution, the members of the commission were caught up by  broad national interests. This made it possible for us, in the  Autumn of 1991, to lay down the foundations of the future  constitution in a very short time: the structure was made clear,  a clearly systematized ideology was chosen (that the state was  for people, not the reverse), and the basic problems of content  were solved. Various versions were prepared. Plans were made to  organize the assembling of the draft broadly among native and  foreign experts and specialists and we began to carry them out.    Our country's achieving its independence demanded that we  speed up work on the draft, since a constitution is a sign of  independence. For that treason, from the beginning of 1992, the  work of the constitutional Commission was managed by the  president of the republic. The final polishing of the draft of  the constitution was able to go forward in a systematic manner,  with N.A. Nazarbayev chairing the meetings of the constitutional  Commission.    However, in addition to speeding up the process, the  influence of various groups and individual factors began to be  recognized in the work on the constitution. At that time the  Constitutional Commission became, in terms of its membership, in  fact an enlarged senior council of the Supreme Kenges. When,  during December of the previous year, the membership of the  commission had been expanded by a further 14 people's deputies,  their clear power became conspicuous. I think that all of this  was only favorable to the task at hand.    [Correspondent] Yerik Maghzumuly, let us return to the  declaration. Its ratification was no ordinary event. It  exhibited the peculiarities of the time in which it was prepared  and written: the president of the Republic had begun to  consolidate power, a new parliamentary system had come into  being, there was a previously unheard of flow of legislation,  there was a rise in the number of political demonstrations, and  signs were being seen of the beginning of democratic maturity in  society and in the state.    [Asanbayev] You are right. It was as if our whole lives were  confined to a week. We worked day and night. The times were  full, to the greatest degree, of important events. That time was  the most interesting time I remember in my life.    Think about it. After I was elected first chairman of the  Supreme Kenges from among several alternative candidates, we  began to master the knowledge and experience of a secret and for  us hitherto unknown parlamentarianism, together with my  colleagues in a body of deputies that was "on fire." This was in  order that we should enter upon the difficult road whereby I  would shape the work of the first democratically elected Supreme  Kenges.    For the first time we were in fact organizing the  legislative  activities of the Supreme Kenges. It is no secret that hitherto  all questions of legislation were decided by the Union and that  the overwhelming majority of all legal documents from the  republics were confined to the reproduction of Union legal  norms. Leaving aside questions of organization, all in all there  was no true legislative action in Kazakhstan. Questions such as  legislative strategy, planning legislative activities, and  carrying out parliamentary supervision over the work of  organizations exercising control over the way laws were being  carried out and reporting to the Kenges, even the simple  technical equipment guaranteeing the voting process of deputies,  had hitherto not existed.    We devoted a great deal of our efforts to mastering the work  methods needed to draft laws, just to get used to them in large  quantities. Hitherto the laws were "cooked in the pot" of the  central authority and the republics fulfilled them. For that  reason we kept our executive authority, as in the system of all  developed states of the world, in a purely legislative  parliament, and it was not ready at that time to take all the  difficulties of drafting laws upon its own neck. For that  reason, drafts of some laws of considerable importance for  regulating every area of social relationships, and [in any case]  always of the highest priority, were prepared within  parliamentary committees and commissions. We began to master for  ourselves the entire science of legislation, from the basics up  to how a draft was prepared, and how to divide a law into parts.  To tell the truth, I remembered several times Bismarck's caustic  remark: "If you love sausages and laws, do not go see how they  are made."    I would like to mention in passing in this context the  important and fruitful work of deputy speaker of the parliament,  Z. Fedotova, in taking upon her neck the basic difficulties of  organizing parliamentary legislative activities during this  period. She greatly aided the chief of parliament, myself, in  learning the secrets of many legal questions.    At that time there were many important questions to be  resolved, other than purely legislative problems. For example,  one of them was the Semey Testing Area. During its very first  session, the parliament demanded the closing of the testing area  from the Union government. When this demand was not met, a  resolution of the Supreme Kenges was ratified in the second  session prohibiting nuclear explosions and testing of all forms  of weapons of mass destruction in the territories of the  Republic. I think that this was one of the primary victories  gained by the present body of deputies. Nonetheless, all the  leaders of the Union forthwith looked askance at our resolution  and I suffered a certain amount of pressure as chairman of the  Kenges. The deputies encountered considerable opposition,  especially from the military-industrial complex. However time  smoothes everything. The testing area has been closed forever.    The parliament set about solving important state and  economic  problems, such as specifying local powers and local systems of  self-government and regulating property relationships. For a  long time, various versions of legal provisions were discussed,  and to "bake" the innovations suggested for legislation many  meetings were held with scientists and specialists, with  deputies of local Kenges, and with heads of industry. There were  repeated reviews of questions which had been decided. Such were  the characteristics of the way parliament worked with such  fundamental questions.    We began efforts to refine the work of the Supreme Kenges to  be more realistic and more systematic. It must be stated that  much of what has become accepted practice in parliament  operations and organization was specified during the fourth  session, at the time that the Supreme Kenges ratified a  resolution on refining its own operations. The urgency of many  questions such as expanding the powers of the chairman of the  Supreme Kenges, establishing a committee for external relations  and parliamentary connections, the hiring of available  consultants by committees, establishment of an office of  control, etc., found expression in that document for the first  time.    Working in parliament became very interesting. My  willingness  to work together with the president in solving, by me in my  capacity of specialist, problems such as immediate economic  reform , market systemization, and formation of a presidential  administrative model, became an incentive for me to accept  election to the office of vice president.    However, the declaration of Sovereignty occupied a special  place during that complex half a year full of memorable events  when I worked as head of the parliament. This is because our  turn towards state independence in truth, with intelligence, and  with purpose, began with it. The declaration became an  unshakable foundation for the solving of political and legal  problems of extremely great scope in direct connection with our  formation of a state.</p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> PIANO QUARTET PLAYS NEW HARTKE COMPOSITION  </P> <P> A concert by the Los Angeles Piano Quartet -- played to a sizable,  knowledgeable audience at Royce Hall, UCLA, on Sunday -- provided further  evidence that the LAPQ may be this city's most potent and accomplished resident  chamber ensemble.  </P> <P> The quartet is to be admired for its polished, penetrating interpretations and  for enlarging the repertory for its combination of instruments.  </P> <P> On this occasion we heard the latest effort in its own behalf: the West Coast  premiere of an instantly appealing (without populist pandering), handsomely  crafted work, "The King of the Sun," commissioned from Stephen Hartke, the Los  Angeles Chamber Orchestra's composer in residence and a member of the USC  faculty.  </P> <P> Hartke's 18-minute-long set of tableaux reacts to paintings of Joan Miro,  reactions by turns clever-whimsical, as in the stutter-stepping, rhythmically  complex, faintly jazzy "Personages in the night guided by the phosphorescent  tracks of snails" (the personages seem to be doing their best not to step on  the snails) or wistful-warm, as in the final "Personages and birds rejoicing at  the arrival of night."  </P> <P> Along the way one encounters a medieval hoedown, patches of plainchant and, at  nearly every turn, rhythmic vitality and respect for the audience's  intelligence as well as its desire to be entertained.  </P> <P> That the performance was masterful hardly needs saying, but one should  compliment the players -- pianist James Bonn, violinist Joseph Genualdi,  violist Ronald Copes and cellist Peter Rejto -- for keeping the staples on the  program equally spontaneous-sounding.  </P> <P> There were no surprises in the C-minor Quartet of Faure (whose scherzo trio may  have suggested the finale of Hartke's piece) or Schumann's E-flat Quartet, but  both were played with such energetic affection and precision that they could be  received as welcome old friends rather than tiresomely ubiquitous house guests.

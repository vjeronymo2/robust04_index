			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / In sickness, or wealth: Mergers and cost cutting in US healthcare The consolidation of the US healthcare industry is continuing, despite the failure last month of President Bill Clinton's proposed healthcare reform legislation. This week's acquisition by Columbia/HCA Healthcare, the biggest hospitals group in the US, of HealthTrust, owner of the second-largest hospital chain, is part of a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the industry. There were 51 US healthcare mergers and acquisitions in the first six months of 1994 alone, according to KPMG, the accountants. It is also the third takeover by Columbia in 15 months, transforming the Texas-based group from a company owning 23 hospitals to one with 311 and almost 5 per cent of the hospital beds in the US. Other recent deals have included acquisitions worth Dollars 765m by the Tennessee hospital group, OrNda, the purchase of 47 psychiatric hospitals for Dollars 200m by Charter Medical of Georgia, and the sale by California's National Medical Enterprises of 28 rehabilitation hospitals and 45 outpatient centres to Healthsouth Rehabilitation of Alabama for more than Dollars 300m. The upheaval is not confined to hospitals. Health insurers are merging. Wall Street financiers are building empires in residential care for the elderly. Surgery departments are offering cut-price heart bypass operations. The legendary salaries of US doctors are under attack. Ambulance companies are being touted as the next big merger area. This is happening without the intervention of Washington. President Clinton has postponed plans for healthcare reform to next year. But the healthcare industry is continuing to change rapidly, largely in pursuit of lower costs. At stake is the Dollars 600bn a year of revenue paid to US hospitals, nursing homes and doctors. This is 9 per cent of GDP and more than most European countries spend on their entire health services. The main reason for the high costs is inefficiency, says Mr Eran Broshy, a vice-president of Boston Consulting Group in New York. 'There are 35 to 40 per cent too many beds in America,' he says. 'Hospital groups must get bigger to make sure they get business with eventually perhaps only three to five groups per large metropolitan area.' Overcapacity in other industries would quickly lead to price cuts. But this has only just begun to happen in healthcare where prices allow hospitals to make a profit with only 40 per cent of beds occupied. Pressures for mergers date from the 1980s when employers began a drive to cut the cost of healthcare insurance for their employees. It started on the west coast, with employers contracting with 'health management organisations' (HMOs) to negotiate cost-cutting deals with doctors and hospitals. The success of this 'managed care' in controlling costs soon attracted the attention of the health insurers, which adopted a similar approach. In some parts of the US, managed care has had a dramatic effect on costs. In Minnesota, about one-third of the population is now treated under managed health programmes. Largely as a consequence, the city of Minneapolis-St Paul in Minnesota has lost more than 40 per cent of its hospital beds over a decade. In more conservative eastern regions such as New York and North Carolina, managed care reaches only between 5 and 15 per cent of people. As a result, the number of hospital beds in, for example, New York has fallen by less than 5 per cent in the last 10 years. This feeds directly through to costs. The annual per capita cost of healthcare in California is now about Dollars 1,900 compared with Dollars 2,200 in New York, according to Boston Consulting. Managed care changes the nature of competition between hospitals, says Mr George Halvorson, former chief executive of Minnesota HMO HealthPartners. Rival hospitals used to compete to buy the latest high-technology services and eminent doctors. This encouraged them to perform as many treatments as possible to cover the costs. Companies such as Columbia try to eliminate duplication of overheads and services in nearby hospitals. Mr Richard Scott, the chief executive officer, estimates annual savings of Dollars 125m from the latest merger alone. Large hospital groups can also make use of their increased buying power. Even before yesterday's deal, Columbia/HCA's renegotiation of supply contracts had yielded savings of Dollars 60m a year. Doctors' practices are also merging to cut duplication and increase buying power. Wall Street private investment firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson and Stowe is one of several groups that acquire doctors' practices and merge them. As well as bringing economies of scale, mergers help in controlling the costs of treatment. Larger groups can build up statistical databases on doctors' prescribing and referral habits. Doctors who require significantly more overnight hospital stays for their patients than average, or who prescribe too many expensive drugs, are asked to change their habits. 'We want to see fewer days of hospital stay per thousand of population,' says Mr James Hoover, a partner in the firm. Among the victims of these changes are hospital doctors whose fees are being closely scrutinised along with other costs. Bellevue hospital in New York, for example, this summer signed a deal with the Prudential insurance company to do between 100 and 150 heart bypass operations a year on the insurer's policyholders. Prudential is paying a flat fee of less than Dollars 35,000 per operation instead of being billed the sum of fees from staff and materials that would typically be twice as high. The doctors at Bellevue receive a proportion of the fees earned, less per operation than when they billed for services. This flat-rate fee system can be extended to cover all medical needs. For a flat fee per head, called a capitation payment, a hospital agrees to look after all the hospital needs of a group of people. One example of this approach is the agreement made in July by a Florida-based health management organisation, Physicians Corporation of America, with the Los Angeles-based hospital company Salick Health Care. In return for an annual per capita fee, the 319,000 members of PCA's schemes receive comprehensive cancer coverage. It is now in Salick's interest not to treat people unnecessarily and to introduce preventative healthcare to cut the proportion of members likely to suffer from cancer. The use of capitation fees to pay for healthcare is growing throughout the advanced economies. The UK government, for example, allocates resources to the National Health Service largely on a per capita basis. The trend towards payment for healthcare through capitation fees is likely to continue in the US, forcing further moves to save costs in the industry. With it, the wave of mergers and acquisitions looks set to continue.</p>

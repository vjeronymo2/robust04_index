He will also meet  President Richard von Weizsaecker and Chancellor Helmut Kohl and  exchange views with them on the growth of bilateral ties,  especially the ties between the NPC and the Federal Assembly of  Germany as well as on international issues of common concern.    "It is my hope that the visit will deepen mutual  understanding, expand exchanges and strengthen cooperation so as  to bring about new development of the Sino-German relations,"  Qiao said.</p>

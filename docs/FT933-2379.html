			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Food &amp; Drink: How to deal with a sleeping partner - Clients who fall asleep pose a real challenge for a restaurateur SOME YEARS ago when I was running a London restaurant, I read an article that had a very big influence in my attitude to customers. It was not written for the trade by a fellow restaurateur, nor did it appear in a specialist catering magazine. It was written for Vogue by Christopher Matthew, a perceptive and unbiased amateur, under the headline WIC These initials, Matthew noted, stood for the conversation that so frequently takes place between couples on their way to their chosen restaurant which can, as I learnt only too quickly, affect their mood from the moment they walk in and, ultimately, their enjoyment of the meal. Such 'Words In Car' may range from: 'If you hadn't bothered to take that phone call we would have been there by now' to 'Why didn't you park there? I am sure you could have squeezed in' or, most ominously, 'What on earth made you book a table here?' Yes, Matthew is absolutely right: so many things outside a restaurant's control can ruin a meal. For example, it may be very difficult to please diners who are still feeling the disappointment of a bad performance at the theatre. Still worse are the occasions when a company has to entertain overseas clients who have pulled out of a deal at the last minute. Retirement dinners, especially for someone taking early retirement - and taking it reluctantly - may be the most difficult of all. But in the best restaurants, such situations can be salvaged. Just as a thoughtful maitre d' remembers his regular customers' aperitif, so the swift delivery of the menu and wine list to an unhappy looking table can help matters. A word too to the kitchen to ensure that a potentially difficult table's order is dealt with promptly shows the same concern. As does a word of warning to a young commis waiter to steer clear and not aggravate matters. But during the summer I witnessed for the second time in a top restaurant a scenario that can unnerve even the best-drilled waiting staff and provides a set of initials to rival Matthew's WIC Mine are ZAT - Zzzz's At Table'. What do you do when a diner falls asleep? The first time I spotted this phenomenon was at a two-star Michelin restaurant in London's West End. In spite of the attractions of the food, wine and company my attention was suddenly distracted by what was happening at a table across the room at which the woman seemed to be physically propping up the man. I was riveted. The snoozing diner was young, in his early 30s and dressed in a pin-striped suit. Every few minutes he would lean forward over his plate and doze off. His companion, unhappy with his behaviour - particularly as, five years ago, they would have had to reserve their table some weeks in advance - kept shaking, prodding and pushing him in an attempt to wake him. All to little effect. The waiting staff sadly offered no help, pretending to ignore him and to keep away from the table, only interfering when it seemed that some damage might be done to restaurant property. There was no alternative. She called for the bill and escorted him out. I thought this just an isolated episode until this summer when in a restaurant in France we were seated across from a table of four Japanese. They seemed quite relaxed, with an empty bottle of white wine by their table and their first course finished. No sooner, however, had the main courses been served than one of the men began to sway tellingly over his dish. Within minutes he was deeply asleep. Cultural differences in how to treat the sleeping diner were soon obvious. His three fellow diners made no attempt to rouse him but continued their meal without paying him the slightest attention. When they had finished their main course the waiters cleared the plates without making any reference to the untouched dish. By the time they returned with the desserts the sleeping diner had awoken and, greatly refreshed, devoured his food and ordered an espresso coffee. There are obvious explanations: jet-lag, over-indulgence, ill-health, fatigue or boredom, which many readers may have experienced themselves and sympathise with. So far this phenomenon seems to only affected men in expensive restaurants. But it has left two otherwise highly professional sets of waiting staff lost for the appropriate response. For the concerned restaurateur the case of the sleeping diner presents a new set of challenges in customer care. I would be delighted to hear from any reader who has an ingenious solution or can tell me of a similar experience. I will reward the best reply with a bottle of pink champagne.</p>

The United Nations "probably expected too much. It has tried  to carry out operations without sufficient experience,"  Andreatta told a meeting of representatives from religious news  agencies.    "The 1993 results, the result of (UN Secretary General  Butrus) Butrus-Ghali's pride in organising peace forces to  rebuild public well-being and order, to rebuild countries, has  ended in very partial successes. And in some cases in failure,"  the foreign minister was quoted as saying in a text released  after his appearance. Andreatta accused the United Nations of  attempting peacekeeping operations "without sufficient  experience; it has sent troops with somewhat precarious chiefs  of staff. But on the whole it seems to me that it meant well."    As Italian troops concluded their pull-out from Somalia,  which they are leaving with all the other Western contingents  there, Andreatta painted a bleak picture for that East African  nation, saying that without an organised state it is difficult  to imagine justice, development or respect for human life. "You  cannot expect to transfer the democratic state model of Western  industrial powers with no perception of anthropological  complications, as Americans of good will but little experience  often do," said Andreatta. "This is the problem that the  experiences of the Butrus-Ghali secretariat will leave to the  United Nations," the foreign minister said.    Despite setbacks for UN operations, he concluded, failure to  intervene in crisis points would not put the situation to right.  "It would seem to me to be a mistake," he concluded, "on the  basis of these initial experiences, to suggest that the world  community should not take an interest in those parts of the  world where all legal power has disappeared, and where anarchy  reigns supreme."</p>

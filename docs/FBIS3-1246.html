			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by COSATU General Secretary Sam Shilowa at an </F> Independent Electoral Commission conference in Johannesburg on  18 March issued by COSATU on the SAPA PR Wire Service]    [Text]  <H5>  "Black Economic Empowerment" </H5>   The fashionable definition of `black economic empowerment'  is  the placing of black people in high profile managerial  positions. More recently, this has been expanded to include the  acquisition by a few individuals of equity in companies  previously owned exclusively by whites. In the not too distant  future, some will further extend this definition to include a  black elite whose access to political office will, it is  presumed give them access to the state coffers.    Of course, if we accept this definition, we would play  directly into the syndrome of `white faces, black masks'. That  is, the economy continues to be owned and controlled by a small  minority, while the majority remain trapped in squalor and  poverty. A few blacks, and a few women, are co-opted into what  was previously a white boy's club. The rules of the game,  however, remain fundamentally the same.    This is not empowerment, but black economic disempowerment.  It leaves the lives of the majority of people unchanged. It is  the story of the majority of post-colonial societies, inside and  outside Africa--a story of broken promises, compradorism,  corrupt elites, and betrayal. It is a story which COSATU  [Congress of South African Trade Unions] and the working people  are determined will not be repeated in our country.    The debate about black economic empowerment and affirmative  action has until recently largely been confined to the  boardrooms. For the majority, these discussions have been  remote. At best, they have been seen as attempts by a system in  crisis to defend itself by selectively co-opting blacks into  token positions. At worst, the black economic empowerment  debate has been seen as irrelevant to changing the lives of the  majority of people.    This situation is now changing. We want to redefine the  terms of the debate, so that it can be placed at the centre of  our agenda for transformation. Black economic empowerment needs  to be seen not as a cosmetic attempt to dress up old apartheid  structures of power and privilege by co-opting selected  individuals. Rather it should be viewed as a programme to  genuinely empower millions of people who have previously been  disempowered.    This new definition of black economic empowerment would  involve at least four key objectives:     -  Empowering the majority who have been economically  dispossessed to participate meaningfully in the mainstream of  the economy at all levels;    -  Unleashing the previously stifled human potential of the  majority in a way which benefits them and their communities;    -  Creating the infrastructure needed for viable economic  activity, which is currently denied to vast areas of our country;    -  Involving people directly in decision-making which affects  their lives. This means first and foremost empowering them in  the area of economic decision-making.       The democratic movement's Programme of Reconstruction and  Development [RDP] is precisely designed to achieve these  objectives. The RDP should therefore be seen as a programme of  economic empowerment. As I unpack this new definition of black  economic empowerment, I will try to show how the RDP intends to  go about achieving these objectives.  <H5>  Affirmative Action </H5>   Affirmative action in the workplace is a means of redressing  past discrimination and disadvantage which has denied black,  women, rural and disabled people equality of employment  opportunity. There are two main elements to affirmative action:  to eliminate discrimination, whether blatant or subtle; to  implement positive measures to eliminate past disadvantage.    Affirmative action for us, therefore goes much deeper than  just putting a few black faces into supervisory and management  positions.    Chapter Four of the Reconstruction and Development Programme  outlines areas where affirmative action is needed. It argues  that to be effective, affirmative action measures would have to  contain at least the following seven elements:    1. A massive programme of education, training, retraining,  adult basic education and recognition of prior learning, to  overcome the legacy of apartheid;    2. Empower not only individuals, but communities and groups,  under conditions which promote the collective rights and  capacity of workers and their representatives to negotiate  workplace issues;    3. Establish principles for the hiring and promotion of  workers which will prevent discrimination against people  previously disadvantaged by apartheid;    4. Accelerate, through collective bargaining programmes, the  eradication of discrimination in each and every workplace;    5. Provide job security for pregnant women and promote the  provision of child care, to further women's equality in  employment;    6. Ensure that the development of special expertise among  South Africans takes priority over the import of outside  personnel; and    7. Establish legislation and a strong ombuds to monitor and  implement affirmative action measures.    The last point notwithstanding, we do not believe that  legislation or quotas should be the main mechanisms for  achieving affirmative action. Social and workplace programmes  negotiated directly with workers must be at the heart of any  affirmative action drive.    At the level of the workplace this means negotiations need  to  take place between management and unions on a process of  affirmative action. This should result in the setting up of  joint affirmative action committees, with equal representation.  Management would need to give full commitment to the  implementation of a programme. Resources would need to be made  available, including for training, research on the problems to  be addressed, and full disclosure of information.    The committee would need to identify areas which need  attention. These could include; recruitment procedures and  procedures for promotion; working conditions; training,  education, and career paths; disciplinary procedures;  retrenchment and retirement; wage differentials and benefits;  facilities; and codes of conduct.    Having identified the problem areas, the union and  management  should negotiate a plan to address them. The plan should  include both `negative' and `positive' elements: removing all  barriers to equality, and formulating measures to ensure that  the whole company employment structure becomes broadly  representative of the composition of South African society.  Genuine affirmative action programmes should also aim to go  beyond the company gates, into the communities.    It is not enough to have an impressive-looking programme  with noble statements of intent. The plan should contain clear  time frames and targets, as well as mechanisms to ensure joint  monitoring and evaluation. If the company's target is to ensure  that artisans reflect the composition of South African society  by 1998, there must be a clear programme which sets out how this  target will be achieved.    This is not to suggest that the negotiation of affirmative  action programmes should be limited to the workplace. National  measures are necessary in relation to education and training,  for example, which would have to be implemented both at industry  level, and by the state.    The democratic state will play a key role in implementing an  affirmative action programme. Public sector employment  practices should set an example for the private sector. In  addition to the process of affirmative action negotiations  outlined above, government should introduce measures to ensure  that government departments and parastatals reach their targets.  Importantly, this needs to include reduction of differentials  between low-paid and high-paid workers. Funding of departments  could be made contingent on submission of acceptable plans.    The democratic government should also take steps to use its  influence over the private sector to promote affirmative action.  These could include: procurement policies which specify that  any publically funded programme, or commissioning of goods and  services by the state, will be conditional on the relevant  company having made satisfactory progress in implementing an  affirmative action programme; any state funding or subsidies to  private institutions would similarly be contingent on progress  in this area. Further particular priority could be given in  allocating state funding to programmes which play an important  role in advancing the process of affirmative action, eg adult  basic education.    The state would need to ensure a massive expansion of the  country's labour market statistical base. This is necessary to  monitor the degree of progress being made in different areas in  implementing the programme.    Finally, I want to deal with irresponsible statements made  by  the NP [National Party] and some employers that affirmative  action aims to replace whites, coloureds and Indians with  African workers. Affirmative action is part of our  reconstruction programme which aims to ensure that all our human  resources are properly developed, and that mass unemployment is  not regarded as something acceptable, regardless of which sector  of our society is affected.    Affirmative action is aimed at uplifting all those  communities which have been historically disadvantaged by  apartheid. Coloured and Indian communities would therefore be  major beneficiaries of affirmative action programmes.    Affirmative action is not designed to punish any particular  group. White workers are already becoming victims of the  economic devastation caused by apartheid. The unleashing of the  countries productive potential, and the resultant economic  growth and job creation which will flow from bringing previously  disadvantaged workers into the mainstream of the economy, will  ultimately benefit all workers, including white workers. COSATU  rejects any attempt to abuse affirmative action to create racial  divisions between workers. Mere replacement of white individuals  with blacks is tokenism which distorts the whole purpose of  affirmative action.  <H5>  Workplace Democratisation </H5>   The South African economy is in a typical third world cul de  sac--cheap labour, low skill, low technology, overreliance on  primary commodities. Employers have to come to terms with the  fact that to get out of this trap we have to end the culture of  unilateral management decision-making. Industrial  democratisation is the only route available to South Africa  which will unleash the creative and productive potential of our  people.    Meaningful empowerment of workers goes way beyond the  so-called 'worker participation' schemes which are springing up  in our industries. Most of these schemes, such as quality  circles, just-in-time etc, are devised to involve workers in  reorganising work, in a bid to raise levels of productivity and  profitability. They do not empower workers to make decisions on  fundamental issues affecting their lives. Further, these  schemes concentrate on the micro-issues, and do not involve  workers in decisions on the broad strategic direction of the  whole company or industry.    There is a need for a radical rethink on the process of  industrial democratisation, to ensure meaningful economic  empowerment of the majority of workers. Management will have to  accept that decisions on areas such as investment; technology;  research and development; training; job creation; levels of  renumeration; and even distribution of profits; can no longer be  their sole preserve. Joint decision-making in these area will  have to become a fact of economic life if our economy is to  emerge from its current crisis.    The ANC [African National Congress] has committed itself to  ensuring workplace empowerment. The RDP states that:  "Legislation must facilitate worker participation and  decision-making in the world of work. Such legislation must  include an obligation on employers to negotiate substantial  changes concerning production matters or workplace organisation  within a nationally negotiated framework."    The RDP states further that "company and tax law must be  amended to ensure that the rights of workers are protected and  extended...in relation to workers access to company information".    This path of industrial democratisation is new for both  management and unions. We will all have to climb a steep  learning curve.  <H5>  Black Ownership </H5>   The issue of black economic empowerment and black ownership  is often seen as depending on the acquisition by individual  entrepreneurs of companies. Yet what is forgotten is that trade  unions are the single biggest vehicle of empowerment for black  people. As we confront the challenge of rebuilding the economy,  we are determined to use our economic muscle to benefit our  members and their communities.    Workers have invested billions of rand in pension and  provident funds. Yet they have little say in how their money is  invested. While they and their families cry out for investment  in jobs, housing, infrastructure, and real development; pension  funds continue to speculate on the stock exchange, and on glass  buildings. COSATU is discussing ways of ensuring that real  control of how their money is invested is put in the hands of  workers.    The RDP states that "pension and provident funds should be  made more accountable to their members.... The democratic  government must change the law to ensure adequate representation  for workers through the trade unions and...legislate a  transformation of the boards of the mutual funds to make them  more socially responsible."    Other forms of ownership by workers and unions have emerged  and need to be developed further. These include the setting up  of co-operatives and small businesses for retrenched workers.  Another possibility which needs to be explored is of workers  taking over their companies through buy-outs. There have been  successful examples of workers taking over failing companies in  countries such as the USA and Britain. These experiments have  not yet been possible here, however.    Workers share ownership schemes which have been introduced  by  employers have, until now been tokenism of the worst kind. At  best these have been meaningless charity. At worst they have  been transparent attempts to diffuse union struggles for a  living wage. Share ownership schemes could only be of any real  benefit to workers if negotiated with them, and if accompanied  by a meaningful measure of worker control.    Recently there have been a spate of takeovers, deals, and  launches of new companies by black entrepreneurs. To the extent  that this represents a challenge to the existing white  monopolies, and a move in the direction of socially responsible  business, COSATU would welcome these developments. Further, it  represents a move away from the traditional image of black  business being confined to taxis, bottle stores, and shebeens.    However, at least some of these deals have exhibited the  same  old syndrome of `white faces, black masks'. Black businessmen  must be wary of being used by conglomerates to serve their own  ends. A failure to distinguish between genuine empowerment, and  fronting for white business, will continue to create a  credibility problem for black business.    The Reconstruction and Development Programme identifies the  existence of monopolies and conglomerates as the main obstacle  of black business: "The domination of business activities by  white business and the exclusion of black people from the  mainstream of economic activity are causes for great concern..  A central objective of the RDP is to deracialise business  ownership and control completely, through focussed policies of  black economic empowerment.... The RDP will introduce strict  anti-trust legislation to create a more competitive and dynamic  business environment. The central objectives of such  legislation are to systematically discourage the system of  pyramids where they lead to over- concentration of economic  power and interlocking directorships, to abolish numerous  anti-competitive practices such as market domination and abuse,  and to prevent the exploitation of consumers."    The opening up of the economy will also led to the flowering  of small and medium enterprises (SME's). The building of  infrastructure, the installation of electricity, and the  increase in peoples purchasing power will create unprecedented  opportunities for the setting up of SME's particularly in  townships and rural areas.    The RDP emphasises that policies need to be put in place to  develop the much-romanticised informal sector from `marginalised  survival strategies into dynamic small enterprises that provide  a decent leaving for both employees and entrepreneurs'.    The RDP identifies four major constraints facing small and  micro enterprise (informal sector) including the lack of access  to: credit, markets, skills and supportive institutional  arrangements. A range of measures are proposed which the state  can implement to address these problems. These include:  Government agencies must provide infrastructure and...provide  training in productive and managerial skills. The government  must require financial institutions to lend a rising share of  their assets to black-owned enterprise. All levels of the state  should...support joint marketing strategies and technological  development within the small-scale sector. Existing agencies  such as SBDC [Small Business Development Corporation] and IDC  [Industrial Development Corporation] should be restructured to  support small business more effectively...and end corruption and  nepotism in their lending programmes. Infrastructural programmes  (such as building of roads, electricity) must take the  implications for micro enterprise into account. Local government  must review zoning and licensing regulations to end  discrimination against micro and small enterprise.  <H5>  Black Business and Social Responsibility </H5>   COSATU will support these initiatives to empower all  sections  of our community to start businesses. The main proviso for this  is that labour standards and the basic rights of workers mustn't  be undermined. There is a danger, particularly in the context  of the domination of our economy by monopolies, that emerging  black business could seek to gain their competitive advantage  through cheap labour and bad working conditions.    This is the path which emerging business has taken in some  parts of the developing world. This parasitical form of  capitalism is in fact encouraged by big business, which sees  opportunities to lower its costs by closing down certain  activities and sub-contracting to sweat shops, which they have a  cosy relationship with. Such a trend is already beginning to  emerge in South Africa, spearheaded by certain large  corporations. This results in large-scale retrenchments and  union bashing. COSATU wants to warn that this is a recipe for  conflict. It won't work in our part of the world. The ANC has  also rejected this path, committing itself in the RDP to protect  workers rights and labour standards in SME's.    It is a myth, perpetuated by big business, that small  business necessarily means sweat-shop style operations. The  most successful SMEs and micro businesses, in terms of  productivity, job creation, and technological development, are  in fact in places like Italy, where flexibility is maintained  without attacking labour standards. We need to study  international experiences such as this, where industrial  districts are developed to support SME's, and co- operation is  sought with workers.    Black business, whether in SME's, or in larger enterprises,  should be a pioneer of new relationships in the workplace. The  forms of workplace democratisation and joint decision-making  outlined above would place these businesses at an advantage, in  terms of community support, levels of productivity, and  technological development. The type of support mechanisms  proposed by the RDP, together with healthy relationships with  the trade unions, could enable black businesses to make this  breakthrough.  <H5>  Land and Rural Development </H5>   Land is possibly the area where the black community has been  most brutally disempowered by apartheid. It is therefore  surprising that when people talk about black economic  empowerment, the question of land reform is invariably left out.    According to the RDP "a national land reform programme is  the  central and driving force of rural development. Such a  programme aims to address effectively the injustices of forced  removals and the historical denial of access to land. It aims  to ensure security of tenure for rural dwellers. And in  implementing the national land reform programme, and through the  provision of support services, the democratic government  will...generate large-scale employment, increase rural incomes  and eliminate overcrowding."    The land reform programme has two aspects: redistribution of  residential and productive land to those who need it but cannot  afford it, and restitution for those who lost land because of  apartheid laws. The latter will be achieved by a land claims  court, aimed at restoring land to those dispossessed since 1913.    The RDP outlines various ways in which land redistribution  can be accomplished, aiming to redistribute 30 percent of  agricultural land by 1999. This will be achieved by:  strengthening property rights of communities already occupying  land, combining market and non-market mechanisms to provide  land, and using vacant government land.    Specific mechanisms proposed by the RDP to redistribute land  include:    Acquiring land already on sale and land acquired by corrupt  means from the apartheid state or mortgaged to state and  parastatal bodies.    Substantial funding must be provided for land  redistribution.  A land tax on rural land must help to free up underutilised  land, raise revenues for rural infrastructure, and promote the  productive use of land.    Rural infrastructure, support services and training must be  provided to ensure that land can be utilised effectively.    Rural development must also unsure that proper  infrastructure  is provided to rural areas, particularly the `homelands', where  most rural people live, and have been denied access to the most  basic infrastructure and social services. Small-scale farming,  as well as small business needs to be supported.    The RDP proposes that "rural development policy must aim to  co-ordinate the activities of the relevant democratic government  agents, and to pass much of the control of democratic government  funded services to the rural people for whom they are intended.  The democratic government will include a central ministry of  rural development and land reform. A unit for rural data  collection and an early warning system for food and water  security."  <H5>  Empowerment of Black Women </H5>   The legacy of apartheid, particularly the migrant labour and  bantustan system, has meant that the majority of the poor in  South Africa are black women. Measures aimed to address the  disempowerment of women, and boost their role within the  economy- particularly in relation to jobs, small business, land,  and training are crucial if black women are not to be left on  the margins of the economy.    We are proposing the following to empower black women:    Public works programmes must maximise the involvement of  women and youth in the poorest rural households and most  deprived regions to create assets such as water supply,  sanitation and clinics. Institutions, practices and laws,  including tenure and atrimonial laws, which discriminate  against womens access to land must be reviewed to remove womens  disabilities in relation to land. Adult basic education and  training programmes should give special emphasis to equipping  women to enter into the mainstream of economic life. These  should have child-care facilities.    An accessible programme must be established to ensure  government support for women entrepreneurs. It should include  business training and access to credit the micro enterprise or  informal sector requires special attention.    Local service centres and satellites must be increased to  service women involved in enterprises. Women themselves need to  be involved in planning and implementing these measures. Women  must be involved in all the relevant institutions, councils  and commissions.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   We have tried to show that black economic empowerment goes  way beyond the creation of a black elite, or the enrichment of a  few individuals. Affirmative action, workplace democratisation,  worker ownership, black business, and land reform, if  implemented properly, will bring about a revolution in the lives  of millions of ordinary South Africans.    If we realise this vision, we can bring about an economic  miracle parallel to what has happened in other parts of the  world, without relying on social degradation and repression to  achieve this. We can unleash the pent-up energies and  productive potential of our people which has been suppressed for  so long. Economic growth will be integrally linked with job  creation, the provision of basic infrastructure, massive human  resource development, and the expansion of our productive  sector. The Reconstruction and Development Programme aims to  carve out such a path. We invite business to walk this road  with us.</p>

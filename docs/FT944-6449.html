			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (2): The Pru's move galvanises the industry - Outsourcing / The implications of the Prudential contract Earlier this month, the Prudential, the UK's largest institutional investor, asked 10 leading international banks to tender for its global custody business, thus setting off a burst of enthusiasm not seen in the sector in years. With Pounds 40bn of global assets to care for, the Pru's contract will be the largest single slice of new business since the California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers) put its then Dollars 65bn portfolio out to tender in early 1992. For those in the global custody business, the implications of the Pru's move are enormous. It is not simply the thought of a contract to service Pounds 40bn of assets, they say, but the broader question of just who ought to be in the custody business anyway. If the Pru's vast assets are still too few to justify it being in the custody business, then surely dozens of other smaller fund managers in the UK and beyond will also need to consider outsourcing their asset servicing business. In making its decision to outsource its custody, David Hanson, a director at Prudential Portfolio Management, said the company looked long and hard at its core businesses and decided that custody was not one of them. 'The players who are in here are in for the long haul,' Mr Hanson explained. 'They are investing Dollars 50m a year. Also, you really have to be part of the banking business to do it well,' he said. 'A bank is capital-hungry. Our core competence is investment.' And even if Prudential had decided to make a serious bid for the custody assets of others - giving it far greater critical mass than it has even now  -'you're never going to say 'The Prudential - number one in custody',' Mr Hanson said. Once that decision had been made, the company, which is the UK's largest life insurance company, retained a consulting firm to help it find the right custodian - or combinations of custodians - to suit its needs. Significantly, the Pru has selected the same firm of consultants which helped Calpers achieve some of the finest pricing for custodial services ever seen in the business. However, the fact that a company the size of Prudential should have decided to outsource its custody operations is by no means an indication of how much critical mass a fund manager would need to remain in that business. Ms Elizabeth Corley, director in charge of custody and investor services at UK investment bank SG Warburg and Co, says that her company has taken a different view. At Warburg, which is the custodian for its 75 per cent-owned subsidiary Mercury Asset Management (MAM), 'custody is a core business'. MAM began to invest heavily in its custody operations about six years ago mostly to meet the needs of its fund management clients for whom it offers a bundled service. However, because of the significant technology spend that effort required, MAM began to consider whether it could perform the same service well for those who are not its fund management clients. And, indeed, some of its fund management clients, such as the GrandMet Group Pension Fund, ask MAM to additionally provide the custody for the portion of assets it does not invest. Recently, it has begun to market its custodial capacity more widely - earning an added boost from consultants who rate it highly - and has attracted the business of Invesco, the UK-based fund manager. But MAM's recent emphasis on building its own stable of retail financial products has forced it to invest heavily in information technology not only for custody but for client record-keeping and other services. 'If you are making that investment, you must ask yourself whether you are doing it just for yourself, or for others as well, or should you not be doing it at all,' Ms Corley said. MAM, which is spending Pounds 10m to Pounds 12m on new systems each year, has decided it wants to do it for others in addition to itself. It has succeeded in winning the mandate to manage the new start-up unit-trust and unit-linked life insurance businesses of the Halifax Building Society and for Leeds Unit Trust Ltd, the unit trust arm of Leeds Permanent Building Society. Also, MAM makes its proprietary retail fund administration system available commercially. 'I actually think that outsourcing is going to become more important,' Ms Corley said. 'People are saying 'If I can't do something well and I don't need to, why should I?'' John Lee, partner at Lee, Schwartz Associates, a consulting firm specialising in custodial business, agrees that if anything, the trend towards outsourcing is likely to continue. While news of spectacular new contracts such as the Pru's may still be rare instances, a far more common form of outsourcing is occurring under the description of 'white labelling'. In white labelling, or private labelling, banks which have traditionally provided custody services find they can no longer afford to do so efficiently. They may then turn to one of the larger banks to do it for them, unbeknown to the ultimate client. The client, most likely a fund manager or insurance company, retains its direct relationship with the bank which will still be responsible for all reporting and the provision of administrative services. Ross Whitehill, senior vice-president, global custody, at Morgan Stanley, notes that in Europe, where relationship banking remains a key determinant of who does business with whom, such private labelling relationships look particularly attractive. Other banks were inclined to agree. 'We're talking now to two European institutions who provide global custody. They cannot keep up with the technology and the big Americans are pillaging all their clients,' said one banker. Although the banks are asking the custodians whose services they will 'white label' for non-compete clauses in their respective markets, the bank believes such agreements will increasingly become a profitable activity for the largest operators and a hallmark of the custodial business on the European Continent.</p>

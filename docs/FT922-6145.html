			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: British Gas silent on hive off speculation BRITISH GAS yesterday refused to confirm or deny speculation that the company might hive off its regional businesses or float its exploration and production business. The reports helped the shares gain 6 1/2 p yesterday to 257p. The group announced in January that it was undertaking a fundamental review of its operations, following continued pressure from Ofgas, the industry regulator and the Office of Fair Trading to introduce more competition into the gas market. Analysts suggested that it might be more sensible to sell off its supply businesses in advance of increased competition in the market, and allow shareholders to benefit, than simply to wait for its market share to be eroded. Another option would be to float the company's Pounds 4bn exploration and production arm. Speculation that British Gas might be considering such a move emerged again this weekend following the publication of an interview with Mr Cedric Brown, senior managing director at British Gas, despite Mr Brown's refusal to comment. Mr Brown has been tipped to become chief executive, if that role is relinquished by Mr Robert Evans, currently both chairman and chief executive. Mr Steve Turner, industry analyst at Smith New Court, and one of those who has suggested that a break-up would be in British Gas's best interests, said he believed such speculation was premature. 'British Gas faces the task of hiving off its pipeline business before the end of the year. It would be irresponsible for the company to undertake major restructuring before that has been achieved, and until the regulatory debate about returns on the pipeline business has been settled.'</p>

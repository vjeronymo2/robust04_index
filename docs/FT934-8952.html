			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Japanese cement groups to merge JAPAN'S biggest and sixth-largest cement-makers are to merged next year. The link-up is designed to create economies of scale in the face of weak demand and competition from cheap imports. Onoda Cement, the leading producer, and part of the Mitsui Group of industrial companies, will merge next October with Chichibu Cement. They will form a group, to be called Chichibu Onoda, with annual capacity of 17.94m tonnes, nearly a quarter of Japan's annual demand of 80m tonnes. At yesterday's closing price in Tokyo, Onoda was capitalised at Y241.8bn (Dollars 2.25bn) and Chichibu at Y65bn. The merger will allow them to cut distribution costs by Y300m in the first year, to March 1995. This will double, to Y600m, savings in the following year, said Mr Takaharu Unno, Onoda's senior managing director. Annual sales of the merged group will be an estimated Y264.5bn in the first year, on which taxable profits are forecast at Y8.2bn. The pair also plans to shed an unspecified number of workers over the next three years through natural attrition, said Mr Takahashi Kurihara, president of Chichibu. The merger could be the first step in a welcome restructuring of the cement industry, said Mr Masaya Fujimura, head of the cement association of Japan. Japanese cement demand has dropped 38 per cent over the past decade, from 130m tonnes annually. The government's attempts to boost public works through three spending packages over the past 18 months have had little effect, said company executives. They blamed this on a drop in office construction, and local government caution over letting new contracts, in the wake of a wave of arrests of construction industry executives and public officials. On top of this, there is stiff competition from cement imported from South Korea, which has become increasingly cheap as the yen has risen in value. The pressures on the industry were underlined yesterday when Onoda announced a 31.5 per cent drop in pre-tax profits, to Y1.76bn in the first six months to September, from Y2.57bn last time. Sales fell 6.5 per cent to Y105.3bn. Onoda warned that turnover would fall by the same percentage, to Y218.7bn for the full year to next March, the first sales setback for seven years. Pre-tax profits are set to fall by 40.6 per cent to Y5.3bn. The merger will by undertaken on an equal share exchange, at a rate of 2.1 Onoda shares for one Chichibu share.</p>

Sun Weiben, chairman of the Heilongjiang PPC, said at a  press  conference that local legislatures have the right to supervise  local governments, courts and procuratorates according to a 1993  amendment to China's Constitution.    The Heilongjiang PPC, he said, assesses the performance of  the provincial government by listening to its work reports and  examining its enforcement of laws and regulations.    While legislatures' supervision has been carried out  smoothly  at all levels of governments, courts and procuratorates, he  said, government institutions have yet to take greater  initiative to accept supervision by local people's congresses.    "A major obstacle comes from people's understanding of the  role of people's congresses. On the one hand, people's  congresses have to be more mature in exercising their  supervisory power; on the other hand, local governments, courts  and procuratorates need time to become accustomed to such  supervision," he said.    Lu Chuanzan, chairman of the Hebei PPC, said that local  people's congresses play their role in four fields: lawmaking,  supervision over the work of local governments, decision-making  for local major issues, and election of officials and personnel  appointment.    "The provincial people's congress has the power to appoint,  elect and dismiss government officials, including the governor,  and the province's top judge and procurator," he said.</p>

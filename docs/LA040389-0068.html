			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTNOTES: LEAD NOT INTO TEMPTATION  </P> <P> It's nearly noon on Saturday, the grocery cart is filled and you're finally in  line at the checkout counter. The kids -- who have been up since 5:30 a.m. --  are ready to snap, and you're bracing for an unpleasant scene when they come  face to face with their favorite treats.  </P> <P> But instead of chocolate, candy and gum, some are finding crayons, flash cards,  books and magazines.  </P> <P> Shoppers at a handful of Lucky stores in San Diego and Orange counties have  recently been given the option of exiting through a sugar-free checkout lane.  The concept will spread to other stores later this year, according to Brian  Carter, Lucky vice president.  </P> <P> "We've all witnessed the parents with children in the cart," Carter said. "Now,  if they choose, the temptation won't be there."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sorry, No Double Coupons  </P> <P> Want to buy stocks for nothing?  </P> <P> On Thursday, Los Angeles-based brokerage Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards is  offering a one-day promotion allowing investors to buy, free of commission, any  of 23 stocks on its recommended list.  </P> <P> The offer is among several marketing efforts by Bateman Eichler under Chief  Executive Richard J. Capalbo, who went to the firm last year after serving as a  marketing executive at Drexel Burnham Lambert.  </P> <P> The offer is good only during market hours Thursday and applies only to  purchases of the 23 stocks, which include Boeing, Walt Disney, Bank of America  and Pacific Telesis.  </P> <P> Bateman, of course, is offering no guarantees that those stocks will do well.  And the free commissions apply only to purchases, not sales. "We're  recommending you invest in these; that's why the offer is only on the buy  side," Bateman executive Gene Meeker said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lashing Out at Torture  </P> <P> Bob Stein has seen the wave of the future, and it's on an eyelash.  </P> <P> The trouble with the common eyelash curler, says the former Hollywood makeup  man, is that it hurts. It looks, and works, more like a medieval torture device  than an instrument of beauty.  </P> <P> "After years of suffering with that old steel tool that pinched the eyelids and  broke eyelashes, I thought there must be another way," he said.  </P> <P> Stein's answer: "Lady Wink," a white, spring-loaded plastic device that fits in  the palm of your hand. He says he's sold 3,800 from his Venice business, mostly  through beauty supply stores and salons, at $15 each. But space-age beauty will  require an education. Lady Wink is packed with a 16-page instruction booklet.  </P> <P> FO Sugar-free lane at Lucky store.BARBARA MARTIN / Los Angeles Times  </P></p>

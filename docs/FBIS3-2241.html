			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Jiang Zemin's Speech Delivered at the National Working </F> Conference on Propaganda and Ideological Work on 24 January]    [Text] Beijing, 6 Mar (XINHUA) -- The current National  Working Conference on Propaganda and Ideological Work, following  the National Working Conference on Economy, is another important  meeting of overall significance convened by the CPC Central  Committee in the crucial period in the building of China's  socialist market economy and modernization construction.    The main tasks of this meeting are: to implement the  guidelines set forth at the 14th CPC National Congress and at  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as of the  party's basic line; and to study and arrange the work on  enhancing and improving propaganda and ideological work under  the new situation in line with the principle of "adopting a  two-handed approach and of putting equal emphasis on the  two-handed approach." It is hoped that party's leaders at  various levels and comrades working at the propaganda and  ideological front will, through this meeting, further understand  the overall situation; unify thinking; rise with force and  spirit; work in a down-to-earth manner; create a new phase in  the propaganda and ideological work; and better mobilize, unite,  and encourage the broad mass of party members and the masses to  constantly advance the cause of reform, opening up, and  modernization construction.    Now, I want to discuss several issues.  <H3>  1. The Importance of Enhancing Propaganda and Ideological  Work in the New Period. </H3>   Of the several fronts that our party leads, the propaganda  and ideological frontline is a very important one. Among our  party's various levels of leading organs, propaganda and  ideological work departments are very important departments.  Among our party's cadres contingents, the propaganda and  ideological work contingent is a very important force. Both the  first generation of the leadership collective of the CPC Central  Committee with Comrade Mao Zedong at its core and the second  generation of the leadership collective of the CPC Central  Committee with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at its core attached great  importance to leading the propaganda and ideological front and  to giving play to the roles of propaganda and ideological work  departments and propaganda and ideological work contingent. The  history of past decades has shown that be it in revolutionary  wars or in socialist construction, great victories are  inseparable from propaganda and ideological work. This is a  basic experience of our party. Attaching great importance to  giving full play to the powerful role of propaganda and  ideological work represents a major tradition and a major  superior feature of our party.    It is the people's undertaking to build a rich, strong,  democratic, and civilized socialist country. With the help of  the party's leadership and through their own efforts, the people  embark on their undertaking to realize their own interests.  Propaganda and ideological work departments shoulder a vital  mission in this cause. To sum this up, we may say that this  mission is to correctly publicize the party's theory, line,  principles, and policies; and to reflect vividly the great  practice of the masses, to mobilize all positive factors, to  turn all negative factors into positive factors, to unite all  forces that can be united, and to fight to accomplish the  magnificent goal of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Our propaganda and ideological work calls for  arming our people with scientific theories, guiding them with  the correct public opinion, molding them with a lofty spirit,  and inspiring them with outstanding works so that new  generations of socialist-minded people who are endowed with  lofty ideals, moral integrity, a sound education, and a strong  sense of discipline can be continuously trained and fostered to  provide a powerful ideological guarantee and to play a  supportive role in forming public opinion in the great cause of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics.    Since Comrade Deng Xiaoping made the important remarks  during his south China inspection in 1992 and since the holding  of the 14th CPC National Congress, the situation concerning our  country's modernization construction has been excellent, reform  and opening up have made great strides, the economy has  maintained sustained development, people of all nationalities  have shown solidarity and lived in harmony, and the country has  enjoyed social and political stability. At the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee the "Decision of the  CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the  Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" was  adopted and the action plan for reforming China's economic  system in the 1990's was formulated. Reform of our country's  economic system has reached a new stage where promoting overall  reform of the economic system and seeking to achieve major  reform breakthroughs are integrated. At present, the  international situation's pattern is moving toward a multi-polar  development. This helps expand our country's maneuvering room in  handling international affairs. Economically-developed  countries are now undergoing readjustment of the economic and  industrial structures. Our country has improved relations with  Western countries. Asia-Pacific regions continue to maintain  relative political stability and an excellent situation for  thriving economic development. Our country's friendly and  cooperative relationship with neighboring countries and a vast  number of countries in the Third World has been further  strengthened. Of course, we are still faced with some  difficulties and problems in the course of progress, requiring  us to pay constant attention to studying and solving those  problems. Generally speaking, both the international and  domestic situations are relatively advantageous to our promotion  of reform and construction, which are indeed a hard-to-come by  good opportunity. In the current year, the basic policy of the  work of the whole party is: under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, to comprehensively  implement the guidelines set by the 14th CPC National Congress,  as well as by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee; to accelerate the building of the socialist market  economic system; to maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the national economy; to safeguard political  stability, and promote all-round social progress. The overall  mission of the whole party in the current year is to seize the  opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development,  and maintain stability. All party comrades must understand this  overall mission, submit to and serve this overall mission, act  under the awareness of this overall mission, and do a good job  in all areas of work.    The new situation has made greater and greater demands on  the propaganda and ideological front. The party's theory, line,  principles, policies, and our goals of struggle need to be  publicized more penetratingly and widely so they can be  understood and grasped by the masses. The series of new  measures taken by the party and the government to push forward  reform and construction must be convincingly explained in simple  terms to the masses. New experiences created by the masses must  be summarized and popularized; outstanding figures and their  lofty spirits emerging from all fronts must be eulogized and  propagated. The masses' increasing demand for spiritual  civilization must be satisfied through all efforts. The  multitude of problems arising in practice must be seriously  studied and solved; ideological and conceptual problems  pertaining to the readjustment of interests which crop up in the  course of reform must be redressed and resolved; and the  negative tendencies prevailing in social life must be overcome.  Our efforts to push forward reform and opening up to the  outside world and the modernization drive requires China to  better understand the rest of the world and the rest of the  world to better understand China. All these facts point to the  importance of propaganda and ideological work. We can accomplish  great things as long as we pay great attention to various  problems, and we must not overlook them in any way. We must  intensify our efforts and must not slacken them one iota; we  must keep on improving and upgrading, and we must never stand  still.    In the 15 years since the implemenation of the policy of  reform and opening up to the outside world, propaganda and  ideological work have played important roles of emancipating the  mind; renewing people's concepts; unifying the thinking and  action of the whole party and the people; helping to maintain a  stable and united social and political situation; mobilizing and  giving play to the masses' enthusiasm, initiative, and  creativeness; and of promoting the smooth progress of reform,  opening up, and modernization construction. Since the Fourth  Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee, the CPC  Central Committee, following Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's  basic line, and affirming the results of propaganda and  ideological work, has adopted a series of measures to rectify  the phenomenon of "one hand being relatively tough while another  one is relatively soft." Since the convening of the 14th CPC  National Congress, comrades on the propaganda and ideological  front have made great efforts, done a tremendous amount of work,  and have achieved new progress in the areas of theory,  journalism, publishing, cultural and arts, foreign propaganda  work, and in helping to build the contingent of propaganda and  ideological workers. On the basis of investigation and research  and after summing up experiences and new practices, we have  developed a basic idea about carrying out propaganda and  ideological work in the new situation and have further defined  the basic guidelines and principles, as well as the primary  tasks and work arrangements. Now that the general policy  guiding propaganda and ideological work has been set, the key  lies in implementation, in doing our work in a down-to-earth  manner, and in continuing to summarize our practical experience  and to advance in a pioneering spirit.  <H3>  2. The Fundamental Guidelines and Primary Tasks of  Propaganda and Ideological Work </H3>   Our party needs correct theoretical guidance and a unified  ideological basis to lead and unite the people of all  nationalities to carry out reform, opening up, and modernization  construction. Our party is the vanguard of the working class  with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding  thought. Marxism is a branch of science whose root is deeply  implanted in practice and which develops constantly in practice.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics deeply reflects the objective law of our  country's socialist construction, realizes fully on the will and  wishes of the party and the people, inherits and develops Mao  Zedong Thought, and is the Marxism of contemporary China [dang  dai zhong guo di ma ke si zhu yi 3981 0108 0022 0948 4104 7456  0344 1835 0031 0034]. This theory is the spiritual weapon of  the whole party and the people of all nationalities and our  powerful ideological weapon to score reform, opening up, and  modernization construction victories. In the past 15 years, it  was exactly because of the guidance provided by this theory that  our socialist undertaking has opened a new historical phase;  that the economic construction, people's lives, overall national  strength have all reached new heights; and that we have scored  achievements that have attracted worldwide attention; it was  precisely because of the guidance provided by this theory that  the cause of the building of socialism with Chinese  characteristics has stood rigorous tests and achieved thriving  development under the changeable international situation.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics is the fundamental principle guiding all  party work. The propaganda and ideological front must firmly  adhere to this basic guideline and use it as a guide in all of  its work. Only by doing so can we ensure a correct orientation  in propaganda and ideological work and the successful  accomplishment of all our tasks.    Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has shown great concern and  attention to working on the propaganda and ideological front.  He has proposed a series of far-reaching and important ideas on  the importance, policies, principles, and major tasks of  propaganda and ideological work; the building of a force for  this work; the party's leadership over the work; and more.  These important ideas not only adhere to the CPC's consistent  stand, but also include many new contents and demands for the  situation and tasks in the new period. They are important  component parts of the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and are of extremely significant importance to  guiding propaganda and ideological work and strengthening the  construction of socialist spiritual civilization. All party  members, particularly leading cadres at all levels and comrades  engaged in propaganda and ideological work, must earnestly study  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, further enhance their consciousness and  steadfastness of conducting prapaganda and ideological work  well, and strive to carry out this theory in actual work.    The frontline of prapaganda and ideological work is long and  the tasks are arduous. We should adhere to the ideological line  of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, closely  center around the central work of economic construction,  conscientiously do a good job in all kinds of work, and  vigorously promote the construction of socialist material and  spiritual civilization. Currently and for the foreseeable  future, we should emphasize four aspects of the work.    A) The most important task of the propaganda and ideological  front is the persistence in arming the entire party with Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics.    The 14th CPC National Congress proposed arming the entire  party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics. This is a strategic mission with  far-reaching and fundamental significance. The fulfillment of  this strategic mission will push the party's theoretical and  ideological level as well as its leading and ruling ability to a  new height. Over the past year or so, particularly since the  publication of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping and the release of the central authorities'  decision to study it, the study of this theory has been on the  upsurge. Generally speaking, however, such a study is still  preliminary. Party committees at all levels should further  understand the extreme importance, urgency, and protracted  nature of the work to arm the entire party with this theory and  truly do a good job in organizing and guiding party members and  cadres to study it. While continuing to run study courses for  principal leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial  levels, cadres with party membership at and above the county and  regimental levels should receive training in stages and in  groups within two to three years. In the course of studying, we  should read Comrade Deng Xiaoping's original works seriously to  comprehensively, systematically, and accurately master the gist  and essence as well as grasp the basic standpoint of his works.  Departments of propaganda and ideological work should  coordinate well with departments concerned to carry on a  thorough and sustained study among the entire party. Comrades  in departments of propaganda and ideological work should play a  leading role in studying theories, so the study can be conducted  more thoroughly and the theory applied more satisfactorily. In  the meantime, we should emphatically do a good job in  publicizing and studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should make  full use of the media, such as newspapers, radio, television,  and publications, to publicize this theory in depth and educate  our people and youth. We should sum up and spread the studying  experiences of the broad masses of party members and people in a  timely manner. The five bases for studying the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, established in  the Central Party School, State Education Commission, Chinese  Academy of Social Sciences, PLA National Defense University, and  the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, should play a backbone  role in studying in depth significant theories and practice in  the course of reform and construction, establishing questions  for study, concentrating their efforts, and accomplishing a  number of highly valuable research achievements. The  educational sector should compile teaching materials concerning  the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics  which will serve as the main contents for political courses in  schools.    B) We must persist in implementing the party's basic line  and in properly guiding public opinion.    While performing various tasks, for a century we should  unwaveringly abide by the party's basic line that regards  economic construction as the central task, that upholds the four  cardinal principles, and that persistently promotes reform and  opening up. The propaganda and ideological front must strictly  adhere to the party's basic line; must properly perform its own  tasks; and must carry out effective propaganda and ideological  tasks to mobilize people and further align the minds and actions  of the entire party and people across China with the party's  basic line.    To fully understand the actual situation and to properly  guide public opinion under the guidance of the party's basic  line are very important tasks performed by the party's  propaganda and ideological front. Presently the number of  China's newspapers and periodicals is enormous. Radio and  television networks cover the entire country. By sending daily  messages to the broad masses of people, the mass media are  influencing their minds and behavior at all times regardless of  where they are. When public opinion is guided correctly, people  are united with high spirits; when public opinion is misguided,  grave consequences follow. Positive and negative experiences  have shown us that guiding public opinion is extremely  important. Leading cadres of party committees at various  levels, propaganda departments, and news publishing units must  have a strong sense of responsibility in properly guiding public  opinion.    To correctly guide public opinion, it is important for us to  correctly understand the actual situation; to improve our  concept on the overall situation; to persist in properly  publicizing the party's line, principles, and policies; and to  resolutely maintain political unity with the party Central  Committee. We should carry out our work with the objective of  constantly enhancing the central task of economic construction;  we should lead the masses to utilize their enthusiasm and  creativity in deepening reform, in opening up wider to the  outside world, in developing the socialist market economy, and  in accomplishing various modernization tasks. We should make  major efforts to reveal the fact that socialist undertakings  with Chinese characteristics have been developing and bringing  about changes day after day, and should enthusiastically praise  the masses of people for their lofty character and splendid  accomplishments in changing the world and in creating a new  life. We should pay attention to investigating and studying  actual public opinion and the masses' actual thoughts and  concepts; we should actively express the views and proposals of  the broad masses of people in an effort to strengthen the  supervision over public opinion. The supervision over public  opinion should aim to help the party and government improve  their work, to resolve actual problems, to foster unity among  the people, and to safeguard social stability. When delivering  propaganda reports, we should pay attention to properly handling  the relations among reform, development, and stability as well  as the relations between local and overall situation; should  uphold materialist dialectics; and should avoid partiality and  oversimplification. We should strictly abide by the discipline  governing propaganda. Party newspapers and journals as well as  state news agencies, radio, and television stations should  actively publicize the party's views in an effort to play a key  role in properly guiding public opinion. Our stress on properly  guiding public opinion is in line with our emphasis that  departments and units in charge of publicizing public opinion  should be creative in their work. The prerequisite that they  uphold the correct policies, newspapers, journals, and radio and  television programs should be boldly creative and should strive  to form their own styles and characteristics.    Persisting in properly guiding public opinion means creating  a type of public opinion conducive to further reform and opening  up, and to the establishment of a socialist market economy and  the development of social productive forces. It means creating  a kind of public opinion which helps strengthen the building of  a socialist spiritual civilization, democracy, and the legal  system; which encourages and inspires people to make arduous  efforts and to blaze a new trail for the country's prosperity,  people's well-being, and social progress; which helps people  distinguish between right and wrong, uphold truth, good, and  beauty, and resist falsehood, evil, and ugliness; which promotes  national reunification and unity; and which helps to bring peace  of mind to the people and social and political stability.    C) We must strengthen ideological work to raise a new  generation of well-educated and self-disciplined people with  lofty ideals and moral integrity in order to expedite the  building of a socialist spiritual civilization.    Raising a new generation of well-educated and  self-disciplined people with lofty ideals and moral integrity is  the basic objective of building a socialist spiritual  civilization. Centering around this objective, we must  strengthen ideological and ethical education centering on  patriotism, collectivism, and socialism among the masses,  especially young people; must carry out education in the spirit  of plain living and hard struggle, and the principle of building  the country through diligence and thrift; and must carry out  education on professional and social ethics, on the basic  national situation, and on basic legal knowledge. We should be  good at doing ideological work among the masses. Heightening  the masses' awareness and encouraging them to work hard to  achieve their fundamental interests is our party's heirloom not  to be discarded under any circumstances. While we have achieved  some success in doing ideological work in recent years, some  localities and departments have ignored and slackened their  efforts in this regard, and we must attach great importance to  this problem. Ideological work is work for the entire party.  Not only should it be done by propaganda departments, but also  by party committees at all levels and grass-roots party  organizations of enterprises, rural areas, schools, and  neighborhoods. Executive departments, trade unions, communist  youth leagues, and women's federations at all levels also have  the responsibility to carry out ideological work among the  masses. Currently we must attach great importance to guiding  the people, particularly young people, to foster correct ideals,  convictions, world outlook, and concepts of life and values; to  oppose money worship, nihilism, and ultra-individualism; and to  resist the inroads of decadent capitalist and feudalistic ideas.  To keep pace with the requirements of the new situation, we  should, on the basis of inheriting the fine traditions, carry  out ideological work by making full use of the mass media and  cultural facilities and in ways which the masses readily accept  and welcome. We must be good at guiding the masses to pay  attention to democracy and to respect, understand, and care for  each other. We should use ways which can attract many people to  take part, to educate themselves, to discuss issues on an equal  footing, and to make criticism and self-criticism. We should  pay attention to differentiating levels, keep in mind the  different characteristics, combine demands of the advanced  levels with demands of the broad strata, and merge ideological  education with cultivation of proper conduct. Propaganda and  ideological departments should pay attention to summing up their  experiences in carrying out ideological work among the masses,  popularize the work of exemplary units, and make constant  efforts to upgrade our ideological work in society.    D) We must adhere to the course of serving the people and  socialism, uphold the principle of letting a hundred flowers  blossom and a hundred schools of thought content, foster the  main theme, and bring about a boom in socialist literature and  art.    Upholding the principles of serving the people and socialism  and of letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools  of thought contend are basic requirements for producing  spiritual works and an important guarantee for the prosperity of  propaganda and cultural undertakings. Fostering the main theme  and advocating diversification reflects in a concrete manner the  orientation of serving the people and socialism as well as the  principle of letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred  schools of thought contend.    Fostering the main theme means, under the guidance of the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and of  the party's basic line, vigorously advocating ideas and spirits  conducive to fostering patriotism, collectivism, and socialism;  conducive to reform, opening up, and socialist modernization;  conducive to national unity, social progress, and the people's  well-being; and conducive to seeking a happy life through honest  labor. Fostering the main theme so that our spiritual works are  in line with the people's interests can promote social progress  and can satisfy the people's growing spiritual and cultural  needs is the main idea of developing propaganda and cultural  services and creating a boom in socialist literature and art.    Effective policies and measures should be adopted to  vigorously support the production of intellectual products  reflecting the main trend of the era. Each year a number of  outstanding movies, dramas, and works in the fields of music,  dance, art, and literature which attract the people's interest  should be created. Intellectual works which reflect the main  trend of the era should not only possess healthy ideological  contents but possess varied, lively, and refined artistic  expressions which are strongly attractive and influential and  are highly competitive in the market for cultural products.  Social life is rich and varied, and the people's intellectual  and cultural needs are also varied and come from different  strata. All intellectual products which serve to educate and  enlighten the people and which give them recreational and  aesthetical enjoyment should be welcomed and encouraged.  Excellent nationality cultural products, refined artistic works,  and highly valuable academic works should be supported and  protected. Efforts should be made to develop such undertakings  as the press, publishing, radio, films, television, literature  and art, and the social sciences as well as to improve cultural  work in communities, villages and towns, enterprises, and school  campuses. We should increase investment in the field of  propaganda and culture so as to improve the condition for  developing propaganda and cultural undertakings.    The production of intellectual products is a complex working  process. Therefore experts, scholars, and literary and art  workers are required to give play to their personal creative  spirit. We should respect and cherish their hard work, persist  in emancipating our minds, seek truth from facts, adhere to the  "double hundred" principle, and strive to create a good  environment and atmosphere which encourages explorative and  creative activities. In academic research we should encourage  free discussions of different points of views and schools of  thought; in artistic creation we should encourage free  development of different styles and forms. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping said: "Literary and art workers who are responsible to  the people must always gear their works to the needs of the  masses. Artistically they should strive to further improve  their works, avoid creating crude works, conscientiously bear in  mind the effects on society created by their works, and do their  best to provide the people with their best intellectual  products." I hope comrades engaged in the production of  intellectual products will make constant efforts to enhance  their ideological and professional level and create more  intellectual products which stimulate people's enthusiasm,  enhance the masses' fighting will, tighten the national  cohesiveness, and invigorate all sectors of society. In this  way, our propaganda and cultural undertakings will be able to  further prosper and flourish.    In the course of carrying out propaganda and cultural work  and promoting socialist spiritual civilization, I want to  reemphasize three issues.    First, it is necessary to give priority to social benefits  [she hui xiao yi 4357 2585 2400 4135]. Economic and social  benefits should be integrated on the basis of this basic  prerequisite. The question of economic benefits has really  cropped up as the socialist market economy continues to develop  and as the production and circulation of intellectual products  are closely linked with the general laws governing market  operation. Good economic returns will help the development of  propaganda and cultural undertakings. At the same time, it is  necessary to realize that the value of intellectual products  which have a special property different from that of material  products is more importantly reflected in social benefit. The  economic returns of some intellectual products may be small, but  the products play a big role in promoting the development of  productive forces and all-round social progress. In propaganda  and cultural work we should always make social benefits our  highest criterion. When economic benefits contradict social  benefits, we should consciously subject economic benefit to  social benefit.    Second, it is necessary to adopt a scientific approach in  dealing with our traditional national culture and cultures from  the outside. Having experienced many vicissitudes of life, our  nation has created a brilliant Chinese civilization in the  history of mankind and developed a traditional culture of great  vitality. We should do a good job in inheriting this valuable  cultural heritage, discarding the dross and selecting the  essence. We should conscientiously study and draw on the  achievements of civilization of various countries in the world  and be good at assimilating what is good from the cultures of  other countries and nations to develop our culture. In stressing  the inheritance of cultural heritage and learning from other  cultures, our purpose is through these two means to closely  integrate our traditional national culture and the essence of  foreign cultures with the fine traditions and revolutionary  spirit which took shape in the long years of revolution and  construction by the people under the leadership of our party,  and to make constant innovations on the basis of new practice to  build and develop a socialist culture with Chinese  characteristics.    Third, it is important that we build a spiritual  civilization and strengthen its management. Building a  spiritual civilization includes management, and management can  in turn promote the building of a spiritual civilization.  Strengthening and improving management will provide an  effective guarantee for developing propaganda and cultural  undertakings and prospering the cultural market. We should make  great efforts to promote the prosperity of cultural undertakings  and produce more spiritual products loved by the masses.  Meanwhile, we must not be oblivious to erroneous and unlawful  things. On the major issues of principle the propaganda,  ideological, and cultural departments must adhere to principle  and take a clear-cut stand on what should be advocated, what can  be allowed, what should be limited, and what should be opposed.  The masses are very resentful of those things which negate the  party's leadership and the socialist system, disseminate corrupt  thinking and decadent sentiments, spread feudalism and  superstition, play up sex and violence, and endanger our cause  and harm people's physical and mental health, especially the  young people and children. We must not let those things spread  unchecked. We should see that many problems in our management  belong to contradictions among the people. In our work, we must  adhere to the party's principles and policies, do things  strictly in accordance with the law, and pay attention to  management and work methods. Regarding propaganda and cultural  undertakings -- including the law of the development of a  socialist cultural market -- there are still many things to  learn. We should seriously study and actively explore related  matters, sum up our experiences, improve and strengthen  management system, and raise our level of management.    To make propaganda and cultural undertakings prosperous and  build a socialist spiritual civilization, we should formulate a  plan for development. We have now established a three-step  development goal for economic development, and have also had a  basic framework for the reform of the economic structure and the  establishment of a socialist market economy. The building of a  socialist spiritual civilization touches various sides and is an  engineering system. A resolution in this respect was adopted at  the Sixth Plenary Session of the 12th CPC National Congress. On  the basis of our achievements, we should now carry out  deep-going investigations and studies, strive to formulate an  overall plan, and establish progressive goals and specific  measures for the building of a spiritual civilization within two  to three years according to the new situation.  <H3>  3. We should make efforts to strengthen and improve the  party's leadership over propaganda and ideological work. </H3>   Propaganda and ideological work has a bearing on the overall  situation in our undertaking to build socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Party committees at all levels must attach  great importance to this task; they must strengthen their  leadership and earnestly shoulder responsibility in this regard.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out: "While building a  high-degree material civilization, we should also raise the  scientific and cultural level of the entire nation; develop an  elevated, rich, and colorful cultural life; and build a high  level of socialist spiritual civilization." He has also  stressed: "In promoting the four modernizations, we must attach  importance to both material and spiritual civilization and must  not just pay attention to one side." We must do a good job in  building both material and spiritual civilization, and only when  there is both material progress and cultural and ideological  progress can there be socialism with Chinese characteristics.  We should solemnly place before the entire partythe question of  giving equal emphasis to two fronts and doing well in both; we  must place the question high on the agenda of party committees  at all levels. We should make it clear that the responsibility  for a region's or department's propaganda and ideological work  and progress in promoting spiritual civilization lies primarily  with its party committees. Party committees at all levels, and  their principal officials in particular, must conduct in-depth  research and investigation, sum up experiences, provide careful  guidance, and make supervision and inspection to improve  propaganda and ideological work. Some of the work requires  coordination from various sides, and party committees must make  unified arrangements and must study and coordinate their  actions. Party committees and governments at all levels must  constantly introduce the current situation, tasks, principles,  and policies to propaganda, cultural, and educational  departments as well as help those departments understand the  progress of reform and construction so as to facilitate their  respective work.    We should consider the propaganda of the reform of cultural  undertakings as important work, make overall arrangements, and  actively promote such work. The propaganda of the reform of  cultural undertakings should suit the need of the work of the  development of a socialist market economy and of the entire  cause of socialist modernization. It should be in accord with  the requirement of building socialist spiritual civilization and  with the law of the development of propaganda work and cultural  undertakings. Through reform of the management system, we should  change government functions, straighten up relations, simplify  administration, raise efficiency, and strengthen the vitality of  propaganda work and cultural undertakings. We should attach  importance to strengthening the institution [zhi du hua 0455  1653 0553] and standardization of propaganda and cultural work,  and increase the formulation of necessary laws, rules, and  regulations.    Building a contingent of propaganda and ideological  personnel who are politically sound, professionally competent,  and upright in work style serves as an organizational guarantee  for the successful execution of propaganda and ideological work.  Party committees at all levels should demonstrate concern for  this contingent in politics, ideology, work, and daily life and  do a good job in building it. The key to strengthening the  building of this contingent lies in successfully building its  leading body. In accordance with the policy of making the ranks  of cadres more revolutionary, younger in average age, better  educated, and professionally more competent and the principle of  requiring both ability and political integrity, we should assign  to important leading posts on the propaganda and ideological  front cadres who uphold the party's basic line, well versed in  Marxist tenets, and possess a strong sense of political  responsibility and an awareness of the cause. There is a large  collection of intellectuals on the propaganda and ideological  front. We must conscientiously implement the policy of  respecting knowledge and talent. We must strive to create a  democratic, lively environment in which people can cooperate in  unity and with an ease of mind. We must bring into full play  the intelligence and wisdom of the vast number of intellectuals  on this front so that they will find their way to distinction.  We must particularly help young talented people to grow up  faster and sounder, and we must gradually bring up in force  experts in various field who will make an impact at home or even  internationally. As for those making outstanding contributions,  we must especially care for and treasure them. We should  establish different kinds of award which reflect our nation's  scientific and cultural achievements and are deemed as a high  honor in society. The propaganda and ideological front shoulders  a heavy and difficult burden. We must treat comrades on this  front with understanding and vigorously support them. While  setting stricter demands on them, we must not demand perfection.  We must ardently help them sum up experience and raise their  standards. Propaganda and ideological workers must strive to  study theory; learn about socialist market economy, science and  technology, and history of literature, music, and fine arts; and  acquire a basic understanding of the development of Chinese and  world cultures. They should go down to the grass-roots levels,  to go deep among the masses, and to go into the realities of  life so that they can draw nourishment from the creative and  history-making activities of the masses to replenish and improve  themselves. No good works can be accomplished nor successful  propaganda and ideology work can be carried out if one removes  oneself from reality and the masses.    There is a galaxy of talents on the propaganda and  ideological front. The vast number of comrades on the  propaganda and ideological front are loyal to the cause of the  party and the people. Working diligently and conscientiously,  and willingly bear the burden of office, they did a tremendous  amount of work and made important contributions to publicizing  the party's basic theory and line, to promoting reform, opening  up, and modernization, and developing socialist spiritual  civilization. Practice has proved that this contingent is very  dedicated and possesses a strong fighting capability. The party  Central Committee trusts it and the party and people have high  expectations of it. In the new period, the contingent shoulders  an important responsibility. It is hoped that everyone will,  under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, work vigorously to make  the country prosperous, keep forging ahead with all our energy,  and make every effort to raise propaganda and ideological work  to new heights.    Comrades, our modernization involves a historical process  which centers on economic construction and during which the  socialist market economy, socialist democracy, and socialist  spiritual civilization will develop simultaneously. By  upholding the party's basic line and not wavering in it for 100  years and through the efforts of several generations, we can  definitely basically accomplish socialist modernization and win  the great victory in building socialism with Chinese  characteristics by the middle of next century. Let us unite as  one and forge ahead steadfastly and courageously toward this  goal!</p>

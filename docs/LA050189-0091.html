			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> The widows of several crew members aboard the Challenger space shuttle say they  are upset about plans by ABC to make a three-hour television movie about the  accident, the Associated Press reported. Loran Onizuka, widow of Challenger  astronaut Ellison Onizuka, and Jane Smith, widow of Challenger pilot Michael  Smith, and their attorney have talked to George Englund, executive producer and  writer of the ABC drama, in an effort to get him to drop the project. "Why do  we have to relive this? Why don't they leave it alone? If it is going to be  done at all, it should be done as a very serious documentary," said Smith.  Producer Englund, however, said the project to tell the story of the seven  astronauts who died in the Jan. 28, 1986, accident will continue: "The most  honorable thing I can say is that my hopes and wishes are that it will be  accurate." Englund said the cast has not been selected and a start date for the  production has not been set. But he hopes to film the entire movie in the  vicinity of the Johnson Space Center south of Houston. June Scobee, the widow  of Challenger commander Francis (Dick) Scobee, talked with Englund for purposes  of script research. But Englund would not say whether the families of  Challenger astronauts Judith Resnik and Gregory Jarvis or schoolteacher Christa  McAuliffe talked with him. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

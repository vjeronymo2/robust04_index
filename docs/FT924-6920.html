			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Spanish inquiry into ICI prices Imperial Chemical Industries is being investigated by Spanish anti-trust authorities for sharply, and, allegedly, unfairly, increasing prices at which it transfers agrochemical products to its largest Spanish joint venture, ICI Zeltia, writes Peter Bruce. The owners of Zeltia, a Galician-based chemicals group, have accused ICI of deliberately depressing profits at their 50/50 joint venture, whose share of the Spanish agrochemicals market has slipped from second to fourth since the price increases began in the spring of 1989. ICI said yesterday it believed the complaint was without foundation.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): BP to derecognise two unions BP CHEMICALS is to end collective pay bargaining at its Baglan Bay plant in south Wales in a rare example of a large UK company derecognising blue-collar unions. The company's plan, announced yesterday with proposals to cut 130 jobs and change working practices at the 900-strong plant, sparked fears among unions that other BP plants would follow. Many companies have withdrawn collective bargaining from white-collar employees, but it is unusual for manual-worker unions to be derecognised. BP Chemicals yesterday gave 90 days' notice to the TGWU general workers' union and the AEU engineering workers of its intention to end their role in pay bargaining at Baglan Bay. The two unions said that about 700 of the 900 workers on the site were their members. BP Chemicals said terms and conditions of all employees would be harmonised, and each would be asked to sign a personal contract. Pay would depend in part on individual performance, although initially workers would receive basic pay rises of up to Pounds 1,300 a year and improved allowances. Mr Fred Higgs, TGWU national secretary, said: 'It is extremely cynical for the company to try to end collective bargaining at the same time as announcing job losses. It is an attempt to intimidate people into giving up their fundamental trade union rights. If they get away with it at Baglan Bay, they may try it at other sites.' The TGWU said it was seeking legal advice on the company's move. A meeting of union officials throughout BP Chemicals has been called for Monday to discuss industrial action. Baglan Bay is one of three large chemicals plants owned by BP in the UK, the other two are at Grangemouth near Falkirk and Hull. It owns a further dozen smaller plants. The company proposes to alter shift patterns, increase team working and train workers to take on a greater variety of jobs. Mr Alan Bilsland, works general manager, said the changes were essential to improve the plant's competitive position.</p>

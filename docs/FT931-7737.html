			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / People: Central Stockbroking asks Edgecombe to step in Edward Edgecombe has taken over as chairman and joint managing director of Central Stockbroking Services after the founder of the two-year-old Manchester-based operation Brian de Vecchis was barred by the Securities and Futures Authority. Edgecombe, 57, who had been a shareholder but not a director of Central, was brought in after de Vecchis took Pounds 40,000 from the building society account of a 70-year-old widow who was a discretionary client of the firm, in order to meet capital adequacy requirements. De Vecchis, 51, whom Edgecombe has known for 20 years, had had a 70 per cent share in Central. The embryonic broking firm has subsequently severed all connections with de Vecchis, and Edgecombe is now a 40 per cent shareholder of the recapitalised operation. 'After the first quarter, to the end of December 1992, we are most encouraged; we are in profit, representing a considerable turnaround from the loss for the previous full year which was in excess of Pounds 50,000' says Edgecombe explaining that the 'big mistake' that had been made was that 'after the first year, when they could see the cash flow rising, they started to spend it.' Edgecombe says he has begun to cut aggressively into the overheads, achieving cuts of around Pounds 5,000 a month. The new chairman, who points out that his new challenge of developing Central will mean he will be far too busy to retire at 60, has spent his career in the mutual fund industry. He left Royal Life Investment Management, where he had been a manager, to rescue Central. Previously he had been at Guinness Mahon Investment Management and earlier had spells with Capel Cure Myers, Thornton Management and GT Management. While de Vecchis was known for his centralised style of management, Edgecombe has promoted Thomas Hatton to the position of joint managing director and secretary, and made Albert Kobierzynski finance director. ***** Phillip Thorpe, the former deputy chief executive of the Securities and Futures Authority who has since October been working with Andrew Large reviewing London's financial services regulation, is to be the new chief executive of IMRO in succession to John Morgan. ***** Robert Walther becomes deputy chairman of CMI, the international arm of CLERICAL MEDICAL INVESTMENT GROUP. ***** Keith Millar has been appointed chairman of GM Benefit Consulting Group, part GUINNESS MAHON. Duncan Howarth is chief executive. Kevin Clark and David Blaker are appointed directors of GM Benefit Consultants. ***** Charles Kirwan-Taylor and Anthony Stranger-Jones have been made managing directors in the corporate finance division of BARCLAYS DE ZOETE WEDD. ***** Catherine Wall has been appointed a regional director of BARCLAYS DEVELOPMENT CAPITAL based in Leeds.</p>

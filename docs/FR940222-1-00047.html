An HMO, CMP, or HCPP that exceeded the presumptive limit would have the option of providing to HCFA data to document that its costs in excess of the limit are justified because of the greater health care needs of its Medicare enrollees. The full reporting requirement would assist HMOs and CMPs in this endeavor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The organizations could also document unusual circumstances beyond their control (such as fire, flood, earthquake, strike) that had significant impact on their costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon documentation and verification by HCFA, the organization would receive payment for costs in excess of the limit if it could show that the excess costs were ``reasonable.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some organizations may feel disadvantaged because they are located in areas where there is a relatively low AAPCC. However, in all geographic areas, the basis for the AAPCC is precise data on Medicare costs for Medicare beneficiaries who are not enrolled in HMOs, CMPs, or HCPPs. In areas where the AAPCC is relatively low because the delivery of services under the fee-for-services systems is very efficient, prepaid health care organizations are still expected to be at least as efficient as the fee-for-service payment system. Only if the group of Medicare enrollees is less healthy than the Medicare average in the area could costs in excess of the presumptive limit be justified. In other words, a managed care system, as represented by prepaid health care organizations, is expected to be at least as efficient as the fee-for-service system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule could have a positive effect on the revenues of organizations that meet the criteria for payments in excess of the presumptive limit; organizations that do not meet those criteria may face reduced revenues. We estimate that the loss of revenue for HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs that exceed the presumptive limit would be approximately 5 percent on the average. However, we believe that many of these organizations will change their practices in ways that will reduce their costs to correspond to the reduction in revenues. This would achieve the purpose of the proposed rule, which is to protect the Medicare program against excessive payments by giving the affected organizations an incentive to hold their costs to reasonable levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCPPs that furnish hospital services are subject to the presumptive limit, which applies to all services, part B as well as part A. For these HCPPs, therefore, the removal of the ``effective incentives'' exception (under which these HCPPs were exempt from reasonable charge limits for physicians' services) does not have any additional impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 2. Effect of Cost-Reporting Changes on HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The change in reporting per capita costs (referred to as full reporting) would affect all 26 cost HMOs and CMPs. HCPPs that furnish inpatient hospital care would also have to monitor part A costs. As explained earlier in this regulatory flexibility analysis, inpatient hospital and SNF costs are not being reported. This may constitute an incentive to use more costly inpatient (part A) services, when outpatient (part B) services may be as, or even more appropriate. Under this proposed rule, HMOs and CMPs and the specified HCPPs would be required to report or monitor these costs. Although full reporting may cause a slight decrease in Medicare payments to HMOs and CMPs, accounting for these costs should be the first step in establishing utilization controls and determining the most appropriate use of resources for the least cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

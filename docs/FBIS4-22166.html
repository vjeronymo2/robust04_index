			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General of Justice Grigoriy </F> Nosov, first deputy chief of the Main Directorate for  Supervision of Fulfillment of Laws in the Armed Forces, by  Dmitriy Kholodov; place and date not given: "Military Mishmash:  Lieutenant General of Justice Nosov: 'There Are Many Violations  in the Higher Military Echelons Connected with Illegal  Commercial Activity'"]    [Text] While independence may be detrimental to some,  apparently, it is clearly beneficial to the Military Procuracy.  It has been noted that the less the Main Directorate for  Supervision of the Fulfillment of Laws in the Armed Forces (this  is what the GVP [Main Military Procuracy] is now called) depends  on these Armed Forces in a personnel and financial sense, the  more efficient its activity becomes.    We asked Lieutenant General of Justice Grigoriy Nosov, first  deputy chief of the main directorate, to talk about corruption  and the nonfulfillment of laws and regulations in the Armed  Forces:    [Kholodov] The GVP has been turned into a directorate of the  General Procuracy with a long name that includes the phrase  "supervision of the fulfillment of laws." It would be  interesting to know how you do this, given the existing chaos in  the legislative system of the country?    [Nosov] Our practical experience has shown that the problem  of the fulfillment of laws, to put it mildly, has not been  resolved. Military procurators have exposed more than 12,000  violations of legislation. On our protests, about 1,800 illegal  orders and other acts of the command authorities were canceled.  More than 13,000 officials were made financially liable. But the  adoption of a package of military laws was a big step.  Previously many aspects of military activity generally were  regulated only by orders and directives of the Ministry of  Defense. Unfortunately, under existing laws, the procedure for  their implementation has not been worked out in many ways. Up to  the present time, the subordinate legal acts necessary for this  have not been adopted. The situation is unprecedented for us as  well: The Military Procuracy is not mentioned at all in the Law  on the Procuracy of the Russian Federation.    [Kholodov] You are outside the law?    [Nosov] We were previously locked into the Union Procuracy.  Then the Russian Procuracy took us under its jurisdiction. There  is only an outdated 1981 decree on military procurators, and we  are compelled each year to confirm our existence with special  normative acts of the president and parliament.    [Kholodov] Does the Military Procuracy frequently protest  the  orders of higher military officials?    [Nosov] We conduct supervision over the fulfillment of laws,  including also by senior officials up to and including the  minister of defense and his deputies. In 1993 we protested 27  orders of the minister and his deputies. In 1992 there were 19  such protests.    [Kholodov] What kind of laws are most frequently violated by  this contingent of servicemen?    [Nosov] For example, the order on the promotion of Dmitriy  Yakubovskiy to the rank of major of justice. The directive of  the commanding general of the Internal Troops of the MVD  [Ministry of Internal Affairs] of the Russian Federation that  prohibited the allocation of housing to unmarried officers and  warrant officers. The instruction of a deputy of the Ministry of  Defense that authorized the discharge of officers without  granting housing was protested.    If we are talking in general about violations of laws in the  higher echelons, there are enough of them. There are especially  many in the assignment of housing. In the North Caucasus  Military District, on the verbal instructions of General  Netkachev, the commander of a large unit, apartments were given  to his deputies out of turn--to Generals Kulakov and Artemov.    [Kholodov] Apartments, of course, are a very important issue  for officers. But in the army cases of corruption are treated  with extreme sensitivity, especially those among the senior  command personnel. Are the military procurators conducting any  kind of work in this direction?    [Nosov] Many violations in the upper echelons are associated  with illegal commercial activity that is forbidden in the army.  Just as a result of inspections in the central apparatus of the  Ministry of Defense by forces of the main directorate,  reimbursement was made for damages in the sum of about 16  billion rubles [R]. Ten criminal cases were instituted. In  particular, under Article 260, clause a, of the Criminal Code of  the Russian Federation, with respect to Colonel General of  Aviation Pavlov, commander of Aviation of the Ground Troops, and  Generals Lukashev and Vorobyev, who are subordinate to him, who  committed abuses in the sale of military aviation equipment that  resulted in a large financial loss to the state. In the  interests of the investigation, I cannot say more. There are  many cases of servicemen working in commercial structures,  holding staff positions, receiving money. This does not lead to  anything good. The military are not businessmen but officials.    [Kholodov] We literally receive streams of complaints from  officers here at MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. Do servicemen turn to  you?    [Nosov] There are many complaints. Last year about 12,000 of  them came to the organs of the Procuracy. We check them out, and  institute criminal cases in some of them. For example, a  criminal case was instituted in January under Article 260,  clause a, regarding Major General Baskayev (commander of the  Internal Troops of the Moscow District). On Baskayev's  instructions, Colonel Trofimov, commander of an Internal Troops  subunit, concluded a contract with a certain commercial  organization to guard with Internal Troops forces a building  that was under construction. This company assumed the obligation  of allocating dwelling space in this building to servicemen as  payment for the guard duty. It turned out that this company was  not the owner of the housing. As a result, housing was not  allocated to them. Then servicemen of the Internal Troops  blockaded the building. The apartments had already been  distributed among civilians. With the employment of special  means of the forces of the Internal Troops, the legal owners  were evicted from the apartments and servicemen of the Internal  Troops and other persons who were absolute outsiders were  settled in them. In addition, damage was done to the property of  citizens in a sum of more than R272 million, and to an  enterprise associated with this building in a sum of R64  million. Proceedings were instituted on the charge of  arbitrariness by the commanding general.    [Kholodov] Commercialization in the army is terrible in that  arsenals are becoming empty. Are a lot of arms stolen in the  Russian Armed Forces?    [Nosov] In recent years the number of thefts has increased  by  a factor of 25. While in 1987-1988 a little more than 100 units  were stolen, now this is thousands of gunbarrels. All told last  year military procurators investigated 317 cases concerning  theft of arms and ammunition.    [Kholodov] Where is the most stealing?    [Nosov] In military units deployed in "hot spots." Most of  all in the Group of Russian Troops in the Transcaucasus. On 25  April 1993 there, for example, 44 armored assault vehicles were  stolen: About 60 armed militants [Mkhedrioni] broke into the  territory of a military unit in Kutaisi. It is interesting that  while previously the objects of theft were pistols and rifles,  frequently for hunting, now it is grenades and machine guns.  Last year two sailors of the Baltic Fleet stole a PZRK [portable  SAM] Strela-2.    [Kholodov] Indispensable for hunting...    [Nosov] They were arrested while attempting to sell it for  $40,000. Since September of 1993 a private and a junior sergeant  had removed six Igla SAM's from a depot and were selling them to  Lithuanian citizens--this also occurred in the Baltic Fleet. In  October 1993 in the Leningrad Military District, Warrant Officer  Ismailov stole seven 23-millimeter rapid-fire antiaircraft guns!    [Kholodov] And the last question. We have hardly talked  about  hazing of new conscripts for some time. There seems to be a  reserve of trust in the current Ministry of Defense. Now, it  seems, telephone calls and letters have literally burst forth...  I would like to hear the statistics on such crimes that are  available to the Military Procuracy.    [Nosov] You can see a reduction in crimes of this nature by  14.6 percent in comparison with 1992. During all 1993 for all  troops, 1,287 hazing crimes were recorded. But this is "clean  hazing," and its importance in the total number of military  crimes is less than 5 percent.    [Kholodov] Is there "dirty hazing"?    [Nosov] That is to say, "clean hazing" implies nonregulation  mutual relations among servicemen that are not in relations of  subordination or seniority with respect to one another. The  number of these crimes does not include, for example, assault  and battery by commanders.    In the last year we concluded the investigation of 1,942  criminal cases of nonregulation mutual relations. About 80  percent of these were sent to court. [end Nosov]    It is difficult to oversee laws in a state where there  are none, or where they contradict one another. Nevertheless,  the Procuracy is obligated to be impartial. But whether the  Procuracy is earning its keep is for you, taxpayers, to  judge.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Fees rise follows computer troubles THE PARTY'S much-criticised national membership scheme came under fire in Blackpool yesterday as conference approved a 20 per cent increase in annual membership subscriptions. The rise from Pounds 15 to Pounds 18 was accompanied by a smaller increase in affiliation fees submitted by trade unions. The increases had been portrayed by Labour's ruling national executive committee as a stopgap measure to address the party's pressing financial difficulties. Although a motion calling for the membership system to be decentralised to the regions was eventually defeated, the platform had first to endure a succession of floor speakers rising to condemn existing arrangements as inefficient. One critic argued that the scheme had brought Labour's Walworth Road headquarters into 'disrepute'. Another said the party had been sold a supposedly 'all singing, all dancing' computer system that in fact could not work, as it was based on postcodes which 'cannot adequately identify' constituencies or branch parties. Arguing against decentralisation, Ms Diana Jeuda, an NEC member, said that regionalising the scheme was more likely to multiply difficulties than resolve them. She admitted, however, that some grievances were justified: 'I did wonder if I should bring a tin hat,' she said. While one motion selected for debate spoke about the 'chronic problems' associated with the national membership system and another said the switch to the central computer had proved 'seriously flawed', Mr Eddie Haigh, for the NEC, told delegates that lessons had been learned. There had been delays in dealing with membership applications but steps had been taken to correct that and other faults. 'Despite all the problems, the system has already brought real benefits. For the first time we know who our members are,' he said. 'We have a national register, which means we can contact every individual member direct.' Conference agreed to remit a motion calling for the NEC to conduct 'a proper pilot scheme into mass membership', on the ground that it contained wording that would have broken the party's formal link with the trade unions.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Togolese have been voting since this morning in  24 constituencies, where second-round elections have been set up  to elect parliamentary candidates to fill the remaining seats at  the National Assembly after the 6 February first round of  legislative elections. [passage omitted] Voting started a bit  late following anti-fraud measures taken yesterday by the  National Electoral Commission. Calm currently reigns at the  capital's polling centers.    Meanwhile, in the interior of the country some incidents  have  been recorded. In Haho Prefecture, youths wearing T-shirts that  displayed Union of Forces for Change logos tried to disperse  voters and tear up ballot papers. Six polling stations were  ransacked. During the night of 19 February three [as heard]  explosions were reported in Kloto Prefecture. There was one  explosion in the district center of Agou-Gadzepe, where the  prefect's office was destroyed by a bomb. A second bomb which  was discovered was defused. In Koumawou, a house next to the  Gendarmerie building was targeted. There was another explosion  in Afegame, where a shop was destroyed. In all the above cases,  only material damage was reported. A fourth explosion was  reported in Akatse, also in Kloto Prefecture [as heard].    We have also been informed that there was an explosion last  night in Lome, in Totigan. The explosive was planted under a  felled baobab trunk tree which had been felled across a street.  There was no loss of life or material damage. Although there  were explosions in one district of the capital, as well as  others in Agou, and incidents were reported in Notse where  ballot boxes were broken, the climate is fine in Assoli, where  Kossi Malambani interviewed the area prefect this morning:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified prefect] You must have  noticed, if you did walk around, that people are lining up at  the polling stations. There are very long queues. Since we  are fasting during Ramadan, people got up early and were already  at the polling stations by 0600. What is holding up voting a  little is that political party delegates should have signed the  ballot papers first, and this is has somewhat slowed down the  voting.    [Malambani] To ensure the smooth running of the second-round  elections, of what measures have been taken this time around, as  compared with the first round?    [Prefect] This time, the people have been well informed,  especially those who work in the polling stations. Polling  officers, local electoral commission members, and party  representatives have all been well briefed on how to receive  voters and collaborate with their other colleagues.    [Malambani] What would you like to say to your people?    [Prefect] What I would like to tell the people is that  voting went on smoothly during the first round. And I would  like the second-round elections to turn out the same way. I  would like the people to turn up in massive numbers on election  day and vote calmly and without any incidents. I would also  like polling officers to implement our recommendations, they  should not press voters, voters must be allowed to enter polling  stations calmly to vote and they must be happy to have performed  their civic duty when they leave the polling booths. [end  recording]    Also in Lome, Guegue Adjavon managed to interview voters and  polling officers:    [Unidentified polling officer] I have noticed that voters  are not coming out in sufficient numbers to vote, as was the  case during the first round of elections. They have certainly  not been informed. Others have no idea where to go to vote,  because the second-round elections are not taking place in all  the constituencies. The people do not know exactly what to do.  We are waiting for them. [passage omitted]    [Second unidentified polling officer] Here the participation  rate has been a little higher. But I hope that in other polling  stations where there are second-round elections that the  participation rate will be the same, that is, as many people as  possible will participate. What I deplore at this polling  station -- Massesse I School -- is that His Excellency Herman  Yameogo, the chairman of the International Followup Committee,  did not visit this station. I wish he would tour other centers  to see what is happening there. For the moment, there is no  intimidation here at this polling station. Everything is going  on very well, very well indeed, and we are operating under very  excellent conditions. [end recording]</p>

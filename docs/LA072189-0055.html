			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MISLEADING VIEW OF OUTSIDE NURSES  </P> <P> John Johnson's story "Nursing Registries Booming" (June 4) creates a somewhat  misleading, and potentially alarming, picture of our use of nursing registry  personnel by suggesting that those who lack adequate skills and training are in  the majority.  </P> <P> In fact many of the registry personnel utilized by Kaiser Permanente are highly  regarded and in some cases considered part of the nursing "family."  </P> <P> The current nursing shortage has created a heavy reliance on agency personnel  by most health care organizations and until the crisis is resolved that  reliance will continue. While nursing registries are not a solution, they are  nevertheless an integral part of today's nursing picture. To depict them in  such a uniformly negative light does a disservice to the entire nursing  profession.  </P> <P> It is essential that the media portray a balanced viewpoint of nursing which  would include focusing on the challenging, demanding, exciting and rewarding  profession it truly is.  </P> <P> MARCIA SCANLAN  </P> <P> Panorama City  </P> <P>  Scanlan is assistant administrator for nursing services at the Kaiser  Permanente Medical Center in Panorama City.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo  Djukanovic is paying an official visit to Great Britain. We  have established a direct link with London where Mr. Prime  Minister [Djukanovic] is. Good day!    [Djukanovic] Good day!    [Announcer] To get right to the point for the listeners of  Argument Vise [An Argument More] program -- what is the  objective of your visit to Great Britain, have you had any  concrete meetings and talks?    [Djukanovic] Together with the deputy prime minister and  Montenegrin foreign minister I am visiting London at the  invitation of one of the members of the foreign affairs'  committee of the lower chamber of the British Parliament. This  afternoon I am supposed to present my vision of the current  situation in Yugoslavia in this lower chamber committee.    [Announcer] I presume that we will obtain some concrete  information about your talks there later in the day.    [Djukanovic] Hello?    [Announcer] Yes, we can hear you. Rather optimistic  assessments have been coming from Albania, to which you paid an  official visit beforehand -- that is, mutual satisfaction with  this visit. Could you say anything more about it for our  listeners?    [Djukanovic] I took the opportunity of the fact that I was  travelling to London via Albania to hold talks with the Albanian  Government. We held talks with Prime Minister Meksi, naturally,  in the presence of the foreign minister and other government  officials. We discussed the need to intensify mutual relations.  We took the opportunity to tell Mr. Meksi that the overall  foreign affairs' goal of the FRY [Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia] is to establish good relations with its neighbors  and that, within this context, Montenegro has an explicit need  to establish good, that is to say, better relations with  Albania, with whom it borders directly, than we have had in the  past. On that occasion, we discussed some essential issues that  represent the most important segments of the improvement of  mutual relations -- the rights of minorities in both countries  and some vital issues that we perceive as a possibility to  promote economic and other cooperation.    I received assurances that, in accordance with the  democratic  changes that are underway in that country, the rights of the  Serbs and the Montenegrins who live in Albania will receive  appropriate treatment parallel to a demand that such a policy be  pursued for the Albanians in the FRY.    Naturally, as always, special interest was shown in the  problem of Kosovo. It seems that there have been some ambiguous  statements by some diplomatic representatives of some  superpowers -- I am primarily referring to the statements that  have been coming from London recently -- which have contributed  a lot that Albania abandoned the aggressive attitude toward the  FRY regarding Kosovo, acknowledged that Kosovo is an integral  part of Serbia and Yugoslavia, and that this issue can only be  discussed at the level of rights that must be guaranteed to the  citizens of Albanian ethnicity in Kosovo.    I would say that for me all together this was a sign that a  new leaf has been turned in the attitudes toward this issue and  in the general FRY-Albanian relations.    [Announcer] Thank you very much. We wish you all success in  you visit and activities in London.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Syria-Israel talks make progress SYRIAN-ISRAELI peace talks in Washington were inching forward yesterday as both sides focused discussions on the 'security regime' for the Golan Heights, land occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. Mr Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's chief negotiator with Syria, said yesterday the Syrians wanted a comprehensive settlement. He said the way the talks were taking shape as security discussions between two states at peace had shown that Syria's concept of peace is more far-reaching than the Israeli government thought. Mr Yitzak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, has so far refused to specify the extent of any withdrawal until Syria agrees openly to a 'full peace' including diplomatic relations, trade and open borders. However, it would be unlikely for Damascus to sign an agreement with Israel before substantial progress on the Israeli-Palestinian track of the Arab-Israeli peace talks. Signs of Israeli optimism on the Syrian track came a day after the Clinton administration said for the first time it might be willing to guarantee security arrangements for the Golan deal. However, on a visit to the northern border on Tuesday Mr Rabin said: 'We'll make an effort not to pay this time the price we paid for the peace with Egypt' - a reference to Israel's complete return of the occupied Sinai to Egypt in exchange for peace in 1979. Despite continued government spending in the Golan Heights, Mr Avraham Shochat, Israeli finance minister, said yesterday that he had told businessmen planning to invest millions of dollars in the occupied territory that investment was inadvisable in the long term.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Management: Eyeballing the finance director - Metallgesellschaft has highlighted the risks of derivatives Huge losses on oil futures speculation which brought Metallgesellschaft, the German metals and engineering group, to the brink of insolvency this month, show how vulnerable some companies can be in today's fast-moving commodity and financial markets. The company's fate is likely to confirm the belief of many senior managers that derivatives trading is dangerous and should be avoided. 'There is almost one (large corporate treasury loss) a year,' says Howard Lovell, a partner in Coopers and Lybrand's financial risk management practice, who cites other cases at Allied-Lyons and Showa Shell. 'And they all seem to involve the use of derivatives.' Senior managers are certainly right to be concerned. But, like it or not, derivatives trading is a reality for most big companies: without it they would have to absorb losses on their exposure to foreign currencies and to raw materials prices. Lovell says companies fall into three categories: those where the top management understands futures and options trading and manages it effectively; those where senior managers do not understand derivatives and have put up a blanket barrier; and those companies using these sophisticated instruments without proper controls. Lovell believes that besides the extremely large losses that have been reported, many companies lose smaller amounts through lack of technical understanding. He knows of at least five companies which have lost up to Pounds 200,000 in the past year - in one case because a corporate trader did not properly understand the pricing of a transaction, and in another because the tax implications of a trade were not calculated. 'Every company has different sets of exposures and has to work through what its risks are, how big they are, the availability of a hedge, the cost, and whether the risk is self-insurable,' says Stephen Crompton, director of treasury at SmithKline Beecham. 'If a risk is very small, it may not be worthwhile setting up the infrastructure to manage it.' The first step is to decide the aims and policies of the treasury department. Lovell says he is tired of corporate treasurers bemoaning the difficulties of explaining derivatives to senior management: it is their responsibility to do so. Managers should not allow themselves to be baffled by the highly technical content. They should not be content with reams of computer print-outs they do not understand. 'The basic thing is to be able to distinguish between the management of exposure and speculation,' says Archie Donaldson, a director of The MTM Partnership and a former treasurer of ICI. He warns against 'creating exposure in order to have something to manage'. Rather than banning speculation, though, it is necessary to identify genuine exposure and how it will be managed. 'You should list and put through your board the policies you are going to pursue,' adds Donaldson. For example, this should include the fixed and variable rate portions of debt, how that debt will be managed, and the limits of flexibility. The other key to safety is the enforcement of these controls. Most large losses have been incurred because dealers have doubled up on losing positions, or gone over their exposure limits. Had these positions been detected and tackled earlier, losses would have occurred but could have been contained. Donaldson says checks are needed to counteract the impulses of human nature. 'When the trader gets it wrong, he still believes it is just a matter of timing. Then he gets frightened and covers it up.' While there is never going to be a system which a determined individual cannot abuse, adequate monitoring should ensure early detection of fraud - 'before the treasurer gets on the plane', as one corporate dealer says. 'You can't stop somebody doing an unauthorised trade,' admits Derek Ross, a partner of Touche Ross. 'But you can make sure it can be closed out the following day.' There are several important principles to follow, according to Ross: dealing must be segregated from exchange of confirmations on trades (which is part of the pre-settlement function), and payment instructions should be independent. In addition, the management reporting function, usually provided by the accounts department, should be responsible for performance measurement. To establish a successful hedging business, treasury should be integral to day-to-day management. At the most sophisticated end of the scale is British Petroleum, the international oil group, whose treasury department is run like a bank. BP has established the corporate treasurer's position as a route to a seat on the board. The original purpose of BP Finance was to raise debt and cover the company's monthly running costs: these are in sterling while its receipts are chiefly in dollars. Now, however, if it sees an opportunity to make a profit in a market, it will take it, provided it is within certain set limits. The finance operations are run as a separate profit centre which, as well as defraying the costs of running the company, can also add its own profit to the bottom line. But BP never splits out how much has been made or lost on the treasury function. Trading options requires a sophisticated understanding of a highly technical area, as well as advanced systems. Companies should build up their trading expertise very gradually. 'The problems in a lot of companies are caused by letting amateurs play when they don't understand the risks they are taking,' says one corporate trader. Smaller companies may not want anything quite as professional as BP's dealing room. But they should identify exactly what they do want before starting out. Derivatives have proved dangerous for corporate treasurers because their complexity makes exposure harder to manage and to track. But used correctly they allow companies to reduce exposure and focus more keenly on their core business. According to Neil Record, chairman of Record Treasury Management, the currency risk management specialist, the first thing that happens after a debacle like Metallgesellschaft is that a senior manager will ask his finance director whether a similar disaster could occur. 'The finance director should be able to look him in the eye and tell him why it couldn't happen,' says Record.</p>

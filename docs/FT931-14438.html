			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Threat to South Korea's country's farmers Liberalisation of South Korea's rice market, as proposed in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, would threaten the survival of many of the country's 6m farmers, a delegation from the country's National Assembly said yesterday, writes Frances Williams. Six deputies have been in Geneva to lobby key trade negotiators, as well as Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, on South Korean opposition to 'tariffication without exception'. This proposal would oblige countries to convert all farm import barriers into tariffs, which would then be gradually reduced.</p>

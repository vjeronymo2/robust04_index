Asked about the absence of Venezuelan deputies during the  committee meetings being held at the Parlatino's permanent seat  in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Sen. Rubeo said: "This is a natural  consequence of political readjustments that occur after new  officials are elected."    The Venezuelan congressmen who are members of the Parlatino  committees could not travel to Sao Paulo because President  Rafael Caldera's Convergence Party, which recently became the  ruling party, demanded a revision of all international  activities by the Venezuelan Congress. As a result, the  deputies' trip was not authorized.    Rubeo said: "We support the winds of austerity blowing in  the  brotherly country, but we are sure that Venezuela will not give  up the privileged positions it has won in the international  community thanks to its fervent effort to support continental  integration."    "Through me, Parlatino urges the Venezuelan congressmen to  continue participating in this task aimed at drafting programs  that will end hunger and inequalities in the continent," Sen.  Rubeo said.    Venezuelan Deputy Henry Bencid, Parlatino vice president for  Venezuela, said in Caracas on 16 March that his country risks  staying out of Parlatino because "Convergence opposes Congress  complying with its international commitments."    According to Bencid, who is a leader of the opposition  Social-Christian Party [COPEI], Convergence's attitude results  from a "misunderstood" position of austerity, which has been  announced by the new administration.    The Venezuelan deputy asserted that a revision of the  Venezuelan Congress' international activities, as demanded by  President Caldera, might imply derogation of the law that  approved Parlatino's institutionalization.    Bencid said that if this occurred, the Venezuelan Congress  would have to quit Parlatino and lose the benefits granted by it.    Currently, several Venezuelan congressmen occupy important  positions in Parlatino. The president, for example, is Social  Democratic Action Party Deputy Humberto Celli, and the vice  presidents of three committees are Venezuelan deputies.</p>

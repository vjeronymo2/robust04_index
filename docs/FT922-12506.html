			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Boom years predicted for Third World in 1990s: World Bank expects 2.9% annual growth DOMESTIC economic reforms will lead to much improved growth prospects for developing countries in the 1990s, according to a study* published today by the World Bank. The bank projects per capita growth of 2.9 per cent a year in the 1990s, compared with only 1.2 per cent in the debt-ridden 1980s. This represents a return almost to the golden years of the 1960s, when per capita growth averaged 3.3 per cent a year in the Third World. Eastern Europe, however, is set to remain one of the slowest-growing regions. The bank projects per capita growth of only 1.6 per cent a year in the region, well below that in Asia or Latin America. No forecasts were made for former Soviet republics. The decade started badly for developing countries with per capita incomes falling in both 1990 and 1991. Most countries continue to face a difficult external environment: growth in big industrial countries is likely to average 2.6 per cent a year, slightly less than in the 1980s; concessional finance will be scarce, with only the strongest economies able to tap private capital markets; real interest rates will stay high at about 3 per cent; commodity prices are expected to remain at current low levels in the short term before rising in the second half of the decade. The bank bases its optimism mainly on 'sweeping policy reforms' taking place in the developing world. It says countries in every region have sharply reduced trade quotas and tariffs, resulting in a doubling of the bank's index of 'trade openness' in the past decade. Trade liberalisation should underpin real export growth of 7 per cent a year in the 1990s - the best performance in 35 years. The report calls on developed countries to support these trends by dismantling their own trade barriers, particularly those erected against manufactured goods. It says a 50 per cent reduction in trade barriers in the US, Japan and the EC would raise developing country exports by more than Dollars 50bn (Pounds 28bn) - almost as much as the net flow of development aid. However, the distribution of the benefits of trade liberalisation in rich countries would be uneven. Bank figures show that east Asia would probably win more than 50 per cent of the additional export orders. Latin America would account for a further 20 per cent. Eastern Europe might win little more than 7 per cent of the new markets. The study warns developing country exporters not to rely solely on cheap labour as a source of competitiveness. It recommends greater investment in transport and telecommunications and says countries that fail to invest in education, training and information technology 'will find it increasingly difficult to compete successfully in the global market for manufactures at any acceptable wage.' *Global Economic Prospects and the Developing Countries.

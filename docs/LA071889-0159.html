			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> GREEKS DROP PAPANDREOU'S LAWYER  </P> <P> The Greek government gave the New York lawyer of defeated Socialist Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou a $200,000 "golden handshake" today and dropped him  from the state payroll.  </P> <P> Lawyer Leonard Boudin was handling Papandreou's libel suit against Time  magazine and was in charge of efforts to extradite fugitive Greek banking  tycoon George Koskotas, who is jailed pending extradition hearings in the  United States.  </P> <P> Boudin filed charges against Time in Britain last April, saying the weekly news  magazine libeled Papandreou in carrying an extensive interview with Koskotas.  Koskotas accused the Papandreou government of approving a plan to pocket  millions of dollars in interest payments from state accounts at the private  Bank of Crete, which he controlled until fleeing in November.  </P></p>

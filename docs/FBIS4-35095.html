			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 28 Jun (AFP) -- Recontras (rearmed contras)  are holding hostage Colombian Ambassador to Nicaragua Mario  Camacho and the rest of the Colombian Embassy staff in Managua,  a woman inside the mission has stated.    "Everything is fine, but nobody can leave," the woman told  AFP in a telephone conversation. The woman identified herself  as an embassy official, but she refused to reveal her identity,  and she appeared to be nervous.    The embassy was occupied "peacefully" on Tuesday morning by  a  group of Nicaraguan recontras who were not armed, the woman  said. She did not specify how many people are being held inside  the diplomatic mission.    Nobody answers the telephone in the embassy, and there has  not been any information on what is happening inside.    The Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry has not made a statement on  the incident. Police sources had reported earlier that the  recontras had entered the embassy to request political asylum  and not to necessarily occupy the embassy. The police sources  noted, however, that they were unaware of other demands by the  recontras.    In a simultaneous action, another group of former contras  occupied the offices of the International Commission of Support  and Verification of the OAS, which is located in Managua.</p>

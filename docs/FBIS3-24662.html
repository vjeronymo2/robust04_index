			<p>Statements     Suggest Scope of Zagreb's Intervention in Bosnia                             SUMMARY      Zagreb has agreed under threat of sanctions to consider  withdrawing forces it admits are present in border areas inside  Bosnia-Herzegovina  while continuing to deny that it has  intervened in the Bosnian war.  At the same time, some recent  statements from Zagreb suggest that Croatia is more deeply  involved in the Bosnian war than its leaders have previously  admitted.                             END SUMMARY      In the wake of a UN Security Council demand issued on 2 February  that Croatia withdraw all elements of its army from Bosnia-  Herzegovina--and having received warnings from the United States  and from European Union of the possibility that it could be put  under economic sanctions like Yugoslavia--Zagreb has promised to  comply with the UN's ultimatum.  At the same time, the government  of President Franjo Tudjman has claimed that it is only minimally  and indirectly involved in aiding the war efforts of the Bosnian  Croats.   Zagreb television, apparently attempting to downplay  the Croatian government's implicit acknowledgment that Croatian  Army (HV) units are present in Bosnia-Herzegovina, reported that  Foreign Minister Mate Granic had sent a letter to UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali assuring him of Croatia's "readiness"  to "reduce tensions" between the Croatian and Muslim sides" in  the Bosnian war (Zagreb TV, 11 February).  In a television  interview the next day, Granic explained that HV units would  withdraw from "border areas," but that Croatia would insist that  the UN establish "control" over the Croat-Bosnian border (Zagreb  TV, 12 February).  At a 14 February UN Security Council session,  Croatian Ambassador to the UN Mario Nobilo, without directly  addressing the issue of the HV's intervention in Bosnia,  reiterated Zagreb's willingness to cooperate with the Security  Council.  He stressed that the Croats hoped that the success of  recent talks between the Croatian side and the Bosnian government  would reduce the threat to Bosnian Croats (Zagreb TV, 15  February).      Denials of Large-Scale Intervention     Despite the announcement that it would comply with the Security  Council's demand that it withdraw its forces from Bosnia, the  Croatian government has continued to deny that its army units are  fighting against Bosnian government forces.  Insisting that  troops arriving from Croatia to fight are volunteers of "Bosnian  origin," the Croatian Council of Defense and Security, a body  chaired by Tudjman, declared that "about 2,000 volunteer  soldiers" had been "allowed" to leave the Croatian Army and "go  to help their kin" in order "to protect them from aggression and  ethnic cleansing."  These soldiers "deployed" in Bosnia Croat  units did "not engage in any operations to capture territories  that belong to somebody else but only defended their centuries-  old hearths."  While the statement claimed that the "Croatian  public has supported" those who went to fight in Bosnia, it did  not elaborate on whether that support was material in nature  (Zagreb radio, 5 February).      At the same time, the Council of Defense and Security statement  acknowledged that, according to the terms of an agreement between  Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Tudjman signed in July  1992, some HV units are present on Bosnian territory.  However,  the statement insisted that "Croatian army units are deployed  only in the border area" between Croatia and the Herzegovina  region of Bosnia-Herzegovina "above Dubrovnik toward Stolac and  the Neretva River" (Zagreb radio, 5 February).  The statement did  not specify which units nor how many soldiers were involved, but  Stolac is about 20 kilometers from the Croatian border, while the  Neretva valley stretches north from the border through Mostar,  suggesting that the Croats may have adopted a loose definition of  "border areas."  Responding to the UN Security Council's demand  that Croatia withdraw its forces from Bosnia, Croatian Ambassador  to the UN Mario Nobilo, echoing recent remarks by Tudjman,  insisted that the presence of these troops was justified on the  basis of the July 1992 Izetbegovic-Tudjman agreement, adding that  their removal would "seriously jeopardize the territorial  integrity and security of Croatia" (Zagreb radio, 4 February and  11 January).      Hints of Deeper Involvement      Statements from other Croatian leaders suggest a more significant  commitment of military resources to the Bosnian war than that  acknowledged by the 5 February Council of Defense and Security  statement.  Croat leaders including Tudjman have hinted at the  need for such support for the Bosnian Croats since fighting broke  out between Serbs and Croats in northern Bosnia in March 1992,  but have denied that Croatia provided direct aid:      Bobetko.  Croatian Army Chief of Staff General Janko Bobetko has  made several statements that suggest a much higher level of  support to the Bosnian Croats than the Croatian government has  admitted. During a 29 December 1993 interview on Zagreb  television Bobetko, claimed that "a large number" of Croats with  roots in Bosnia-Herzegovina "are now defending Bosnia," adding  that when the Yugoslav Chief of Staff Momcilo Perisic claims that  there are 60,000 Croatian soldiers fighting in Bosnia-  Herzegovina, "it seems he has a good computer and can count the  heads."  Bobetko maintained that it should be "no surprise" that  there would be a large Croatian force in Bosnia because the  Croats there are "being subjected to the kind of genocide  experienced at Vukovar" and elsewhere within the territory of the  Republic of Croatia.  Bobetko asserted that "it is a fact" the  aid to Bosnia "represents a big part of our"--presumably, the  Ministry of Defense's--"expenditure."  He insisted that the  "Croatian people must accept" these expenditures "both  politically and financially."  Similarly, in a 31 January  interview on Zagreb television, Bobetko referred to "thousands  and thousands" of Croats born in Bosnia and currently living in  Croatia who were affected by the war, asking rhetorically, "Who  has got the right to forbid me or any Croat from Bosnia" the  right to defend his family?      Susak.  Without referring specifically to sending troops to  Bosnia, Defense Minister Gojko Susak has also suggested that  Croatia has provided significant military aid to the Bosnian  Croats.  In a television interview he stated that "Croatia has  helped . . . and it will do all it can to help" the Croats in  Bosnia in the future (Zagreb TV, 28 December 1993).      General From Zagreb      The appointment of General Ante Roso as commander of the Bosnian  Croat forces in November 1993 further suggests the degree to  which the Croatian military has intervened in the Bosnian war and  raises questions about the claimed origins of the "volunteers"  who have purportedly returned to their native Bosnia-Herzegovina  to serve in the Bosnian Croat forces.  Roso, an emigre and former  French Foreign Legion officer who returned to Croatia after  independence and joined the Croatian army, was a prominent HV  general before his switch to the Bosnian Croat army.  He rose to  prominence in the 1991 war in Croatia and played an important  role in the January 1993 operation to take back the approaches to  the Maslenica bridge, then held by the Serb separatists.  A 24  November article in the Split weekly Nedjeljna Dalmacija asserted  that, despite Roso's claim that his family is from Herzegovina,  some claim" he is from Imotski, a town near the border with  Herzegovina but within Croatian territory.      Implications      Croatia's reluctance to acknowledge the depth of its direct  direct involvement in the Bosnian war suggests that it will try  to evade full compliance with the UN Security Council's demand  that Croatian forces withdraw from Bosnia.  While wary of  incurring economic sanctions, the Croatian government has  repeatedly voiced its fear that the Croats of Bosnia are  threatened with genocide and is unlikely to withdraw military  support to the HVO and the so-called Republic of Herzeg-Bosna  established by the Bosnian Croats.  Like Belgrade, Zagreb is  likely to continue to insist that it has no direct presence in  Bosnia but merely lends political support to the efforts of its  ethnic brothers across the border.

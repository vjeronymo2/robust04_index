			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / French Elections: Le Pen lashes out at 'unjust' system IT ONLY needed his extreme National Front to gain around 12 per cent in yesterday's first round vote - a couple of points higher than the extreme right-wing movement was scoring in the campaign opinion polls - to relaunch its leader, Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, into rhetorical orbit. 'It was scandalous', said Mr Le Pen, that the Communists with a lower vote of 8-9 per cent could get two dozen seats, while the National Front would at best get only two seats. The reason, of course, is that the Communist vote benefits from the majority voting system by being geographically concentrated, while the support of the National Front, like that of the Greens, is spread thinly. This 'unjust and anti-democratic system' must be changed, insisted Mr Le Pen. The National Front's one incumbent deputy, Ms Marie-France Stirbois, said yesterday she thought her party's score was excellent, particularly in view of the fact that the National Front started the race for the parliamentary seats with 'shoes of lead' because all the media publicity was focused on the ecologists, rather than the extreme right. There was no early result from the Nice seat for which Mr Le Pen is running. He himself said his party's support was 30-40 per cent up on its score in the 1986 and 1988 National Assembly elections, conveniently ignoring the fact that it also constituted a decline from the 13.9 per cent which it gained more recently in last year's regional elections. The National Front yesterday did well enough for up to 90 of its candidates to go on to the second ballot on March 28, the leader claimed. Generally, these candidates would not stand down in favour of other parties' candidates, though Mr Le Pen hinted that there might be some switching of support to mainstream Gaullist/centre-right candidates whom the Front regarded as 'good'.</p>

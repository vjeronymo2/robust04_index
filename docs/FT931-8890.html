			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: McErlain to step down as chairman of Anglo United MR DAVID McErlain is to step down as chairman of Anglo United, owner of the Coalite smokeless fuel business, after its banks agreed yesterday to a financial restructuring, including a debt-for-equity swap, which will leave shareholders with just over 50 per cent of the company. Mr McErlain said he had 'warned the banks' that receivership would be preferable to a restructuring which left shareholders with little of the enlarged equity. However, the shareholders' stake could still fall to as low as 36 per cent depending on the rate of take up of warrants and of banks' conversion of loan notes into shares. His restructuring plan was backed by the banks but he has had to relinquish the top job. Mr Harold Cottam, chairman of Haden MacLellan Holdings, the engineering group, takes over next month. Anglo recently faced a Pounds 16.3m interest bill and Pounds 7m outstanding from this year's debt repayment, when operating profits fell from Pounds 13.4m to Pounds 4.68m for the half year to September 30 1992. Following the highly leveraged bid by Mr McErlain for Coalite in August 1989, the group's total debt was Pounds 467m. Disposals and the proceeds of a rights issues reduced borrowings to Pounds 211m by March 31 1992. However, debt recently rose to Pounds 250m as the group failed to make further divestments, precipitating the present problems. The group warned that its trading performance continues to be 'hampered' by the recession. The main features of the restructuring are: the swap of Pounds 45.9m debt for 459.3m new shares at 10p (placed with the banks, subject to open offer); conversion of Pounds 74.9m debt into deep discount notes and convertible loan notes; and the rescheduling of the remaining Pounds 130.5m of bank debt. The rescheduled debt is repayable in two instalments: Pounds 10m on September 30 1994 and Pounds 120.5m on March 31 1995. The convertible loan notes can be converted over the next 10 years at 10p a share. Interest at an equivalent 10 per cent is being deferred until conversion, while the deep discount loan notes will have a 12 per cent yield, payable on redemption at their maturity date. The effect will be to defer interest on Pounds 50m of debt converted into deep discount loan notes. Existing shareholders are being offered warrants on the basis of 1-for-3, which can be exercised at 10p. Anglo's share price yesterday rose 1p to 6 1/2 p. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Samuel Montagu will end up with more than 40 per cent of the enlarged group. The outstanding preference shares are being converted into new ordinary shares at the enhanced conversion rate of 12.4 new shares for each preference share. Following the restructuring, they will end up with 14 per cent of the enlarged share capital.</p>

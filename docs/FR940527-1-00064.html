			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ``refined'' reclassification methodology would add a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second basis for adjusting a reclassified hospital's wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> index. This was developed to assist hospitals whose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situation warrants a different nearest neighbor approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, it is possible that a hospital's data could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represent more than 25 percent, or even 50 percent, of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total hours when combined with its 10 nearest neighbors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the same hospital's data very likely might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represent a much lower percentage of the total hours in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSA or statewide rural area in which it is located. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refined method would allow a hospital to use not only the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average hourly wage of its 10 nearest neighbors, but also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its hours weight when combined with its 10 nearest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neighbors. So, in addition to the test of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representativeness of the other hospitals' average hourly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wage described above, there would be a test of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriateness of substituting its hours weight from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital's immediate labor market for the weight that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise be used (.25, .50, or its MSA/statewide rural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours weight). A reclassified hospital's hour weight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflected in the wage index would be adjusted under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method if two criteria are met. First, a hospital's share  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the total hours in its nearest 10 neighbors ``labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market'' would have to exceed its hour weight in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSA/statewide rural labor market. Second, the use of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nearest neighbors' hours weight would have to increase the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average hourly wage that comprises the numerator of its wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> index value. If both criteria were met, then the nearest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neighbors' weight would be substituted for the hours weight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would have been used were the hospital not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclassified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This refined reclassification methodology would allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for three different types of reclassification groups under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which a hospital's wage index would be calculated by using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one of the following: (1) The nearest neighbors' average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hourly wage and the MSA hour weight; (2) the nearest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neighbors' hours weight and the MSA-based average hourly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wage; or (3) both the nearest neighbors' weight and average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hourly wage. The following tables summarize our findings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under each of the options we examined in comparison with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current labor market system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table E displays the number of hospitals for which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference between the area wage index value for a given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative and the hospital's own relative wage index value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (determined by dividing the hospital's average hourly wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the national average hourly wage) is greater than .08,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either positive or negative. For each wage index option,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Lose and Gain columns show the number of hospitals for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whom the difference represents a given decrease or increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in wage index value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table F presents the assessment of wage conformity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> across labor markets. We determined that a ``boundary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problem'' existed for a target hospital (that is, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital whose wage index value is being calculated) if_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Among nearby hospitals, one or more other hospitals'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wage index value is at least .04 greater than that of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> target hospital, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The hospital with the lower wage index value pays  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher wages than the hospital with the higher wage index  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Nearby hospitals'' were defined as the 20 nearest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals or if a hospital does not have 20 other hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within a 35 mile radius, all hospitals within a 35 mile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radius. Table F shows the number of hospitals with one or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more boundary problems and the average size of the wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> index difference for those boundary problems. An average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wage index difference of .12 corresponds to a payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference of about $300 per case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

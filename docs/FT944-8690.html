			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Whitbread rises to Pounds 183.6m - Analysts remain cautious despite better than forecast increase Whitbread opened the brewers' reporting season yesterday with a sharper profit rise than forecast, thanks to strong gains in premium lagers and cask ales among its drinks, and in pubs and restaurants on its retailing side. Pre-tax profits rose by 8 per cent from Pounds 132.3m to Pounds 143.1m in the six months ended August 27, or to Pounds 183.6m including exceptional gains, largely from selling most of its stakes in regional brewers. Turnover edged up 3 per cent to Pounds 1.22bn (Pounds 1.19bn). Whitbread's success was considered untypical, however, and analysts remained cautious ahead of results from other brewers. Whitbread has the best exposure to fast growing market segments such as premium lagers, stout and cask ales. These represent about 40 per cent of its beer sales against less than 20 per cent for Bass, the largest brewer. The industry suffered a 1.7 per cent fall in on-trade beer volumes in the six months to August from a year earlier, but Whitbread's was flat. Off-trade sales were up 5.9 per cent but Whitbread's rose 11.8 per cent. 'Beer is a core business. It is one where we can grow profits and we intend to go on doing so,' Sir Michael Angus, chairman, said. His bullish comments and the company's expressed interest in using its ungeared balance sheet to further its expansion left analysts expecting deals in due course. He declined to comment, however, on whether Whitbread was interested in buying Courage from Fosters. Operating profits from beer rose 5 per cent to Pounds 27m (Pounds 25.8m). Beer volume was up 3 per cent overall but sales rose only 1 per cent at Pounds 451.7m, indicating Whitbread faced competitive pricing in off sales. Pub operating profits were Pounds 59.3m (Pounds 53.9m) on sales of Pounds 295.3m (Pounds 275.2m). Food and drink margins were flat, but food sales were up 19 per cent, accounting for about 25 per cent of pub turnover, about double the industry average. Whitbread said it plans to sell its 750 free houses. Restaurant and leisure profits were Pounds 30.9m (Pounds 28.4m) on sales of Pounds 544.9m (536.5m). The interim dividend rose 7 per cent to 5.35p (5p). Earnings per share were 30.09p (19.96p) including exceptional gains, or 21.62p (19.24p) without. COMMENT A few years from now, more brewers might look like Whitbread: strong in briskly growing beers and nimble in pubs and off-licences. Yet Whitbread needs to learn some of its competitors' tricks. Bass's beer margins are about 9 1/2 per cent against Whitbread's 6 per cent. Meanwhile, there is plenty of momentum to push full-year pre-tax profits to about Pounds 260m before exceptionals for earnings of 39.2p a share and a prospective p/e of 14. This is broadly in line with the sector but a little caution is called for until Whitbread spells out its beer expansion.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Suspended sentence: The UK motor industry can breathe a sigh of relief The UK motor trade and industry could be compared yesterday with a man in the dock who, fearing a jail sentence, receives instead a slap on the wrist to hisses from his self-proclaimed victims in the public gallery. After 18 months of deliberation and sifting through a mountain of evidence, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission has taken 1,000 pages to conclude that: British consumers, particularly private motorists, pay more for their cars than they should; A complex monopoly exists in the case of 24 car suppliers; Some of the restrictions applied by manufacturers to their exclusively franchised dealers reduce competition and act against the public interest. Yet the report effectively finds the industry guilty of only minor misdemeanours on two fundamental questions: whether consumers were justified in complaining that UK car prices are excessively high compared with other EC countries; and whether the system of exclusively franchised dealers is a contributing factor. It concludes that neither carmakers nor dealers have been engaged in systematic profiteering and recommends no significant structural changes in the way the industry operates. It also appears to have accepted in their entirety the industry's arguments that Britain's franchised dealer system, with its dedicated service and repair facilities and after-sales support, is necessary because of the complexity of the products sold and their safety implications. The report provides little guidance for the EC Commission, which is studying whether the car franchised dealer system can continue to be exempted from EC competition rules after the current exemption period expires in mid-1995. This system restricts sales of new cars exclusively to dealers chosen by the manufacturers. Consumer groups, already critical of dealers and their service and repair performance, have called for the system to be replaced by a market 'free-for-all', with manufacturers being obliged to supply cars to virtually any outlet which wishes to sell them. Dr John Beishon, director of the Consumers' Association, said: 'It is simply astonishing that the MMC recognises there is a monopoly and yet accepts that it should stay. It backs all our arguments and yet sits on its hands.' Even Professor Garel Rhys, who holds the chair of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School, sponsored by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, described the report yesterday as 'equivalent to rearranging the furniture on the Titanic'. The society itself said it was vindicated in its protestations that there is no systematic price-gouging by the UK industry. Nevertheless, the commission's own calculations show (see chart) that some categories of car, particularly those bought by private buyers, can be more expensive in the UK than elsewhere. It identifies several causes, but they do not amount to a blanket condemnation of the industry: Some conditions imposed by manufacturers on their dealers restrict competition; The voluntary export restraints which have limited Japanese imports to an 11 per cent share of the market; Distortions associated with company cars, not least the deep discounts frequently given to large fleets; Difficulties experienced by consumers in importing cars from the EC; The UK's habit of driving on the left instead of the right. One of the report's main remedies is to give more freedom to dealers through: Removal of restrictions on dealers advertising outside their manufacturer-designated sales territories; Ending manufacturer-imposed restrictions on the number of dealer outlets any one group may own - Ford has a limit of eight; Ending manufacturer restrictions on dealer groups owning rival franchises within their designated sales territories, although the commission does not go so far as to say that multi-franchising should be allowed under one roof or on a single site; Lifting curbs on dealers setting up car-part sales or fast-fit operations within the franchised territories; Removal of unit sales ceilings that some manufacturers impose on individual dealers. Even if the manufacturers are obliged to implement all these recommendations, they can be considered to have got off lightly. The report puts them under little pressure to make their pan-European pricing policies more open, or to make it easier for consumers to compare prices for similar-specification cars in different national markets. Indeed, within minutes of the report becoming public, Sir Hal Miller, Tory MP and the society's new chief executive, went on the offensive, saying that the main reason for any price differentials between Britain and the EC was the 27.3 per cent combined Value-Added Tax and special car tax imposed on new car purchases in the UK. This compared with, for example, the 14 per cent levied in Germany. The point is a potentially important one in terms of the Budget that the chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, is to present on March 10, and on which the motor trade and industry is pinning strong hopes for a roll back in taxation. Until the publication of the report, it had been fairly easy for successive chancellors to ignore the industry's persistent complaints that the 10 per cent special car tax is an anomaly that depresses car sales. Now the matter has been brought into focus. As consumer group complaints of excessive prices - which usually rise each year by more than the rate of inflation - rumbled along for more than a decade, Treasury officials were able to argue that if car prices were excessively high, it was up to the industry to cut them. The exchequer should not subsidise lower prices by cutting the special car tax with a potential loss of Pounds 1.5bn to the Treasury. Now, because the industry has been virtually cleared of price-gouging, Mr Lamont could look more favourably at the increasingly desperate pleas for tax relief from carmakers. The pleas arise against the background of the steepest car and truck market collapse in the UK since the Second World War. Sales have fallen from a record 2.3m in 1989 to 1.59m last year. With industry statistics showing at least 70,000 jobs being lost in the past two years, and with 10 per cent of the franchised dealers closing or being sold off last year, it is possible that the chancellor will decide partially to dismantle the special car tax. The other main issue of contention is a proposal in the report to dismantle the Anglo-Japanese 'gentlemen's agreement' which has effectively confined Japanese-produced cars and light commercial vehicles to 11 per cent of the UK market since the mid-1970s, and to allow them unfettered market access. This would have greater immediate significance were it not for the fact that the voluntary restraint agreement is scheduled to be terminated at the end of this year, as the single EC market comes into effect. The UK will then become subject to an 'understanding' reached between the EC Commission and Japan last July. Under this, existing national import restraints will be lifted, to be replaced by a progressive EC-wide dismantling of Japanese import curbs, leading to an open market by 1999. Even so, Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, appears ready to give consideration to the commission's proposal, to the consternation of British producers. They could have a point. France, Italy and some other large markets will retain ceilings on Japanese imports almost throughout the transition period. If the UK were voluntarily and unilaterally to end restraints, it could well find itself a bigger target than it bargained for. However, the commission believes that opening the doors should be accompanied by a quid pro quo in which the Japanese undertake to ship in a reasonable proportion of cars competing head-on with the main volume car makers, and not, as has happened in the past, concentrate on exploiting the more profitable market niches where competition is less intense. That is still enough to send a frisson of unease through a UK industry increasingly anxious for sales in a market where most observers expect only a marginal market recovery this year, and then only in the second half. All this is little consolation to British consumers who at best can hope for a slow fall in prices as the measures the monopolies commission has recommended gradually take effect.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COMPARISON OF EUROPEAN CAR PRICES* UK 1990=100  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              UK    GERMANY  FRANCE  BELGIUM  NETHS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SMALL  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ford Fiesta Popular Plus 1.1 litre 3-door            100     87-95    88-96   76-82   82-90 Rover Metro L 1.1 litre 3-door            100     N/A      72-82   69-77   71-79  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LOWER MEDIUM  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Vauxhall Astra L 1.4 litre 5-door            100   105-115  105-117  98-105  97-107 Ford Escort LX 1.4 litre 5-door            100   111-121  105-117  94-100   92-99 Volkswagen Golf CL 1.6 litre 5-door            100    98-108  100-112   88-98  92-103  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UPPER MEDIUM  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Vauxhall Cavalier L 1.6 litre 5-door            100    99-110   95-105   90-98  91-101 Peugeot 405 GL 1.6 litre 4-door            100    89-100   96-109   85-96   83-94 Ford Sierra GLX 2.0 litre 4-door            100   103-111   96-104  95-100   87-93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LARGE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.0 litre 4-door            100    91-102   99-114  96-108  91-104 BMWv 520i 4-door                      100    89-101   98-114  92-104  89-102  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: New Motor Cars, Monopolies and Mergers Commission report  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Transaction prices, taking account of currency fluctuations,  discounts, specification adjustments etc.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

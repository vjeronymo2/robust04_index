			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New Delhi, March 19 (AFP) -- Calls for recognition  of the Dalai Lama's government-in-exile and support for the  Tibetan freedom struggle resounded at a global parliamentary  conference on Tibet here Saturday.    Delegate after delegate voiced support for the cause of  Tibetan independence from Chinese rule on the second day of the  three-day convention, under way at a venue on the outskirts of  the Indian capital.    Lord Ennais, a former British minister for home and overseas  development and a member of the all-party parliamentary group  for Tibet in Britain, urged the international community to  extend recognition to the exile government.    He also called upon world governments to use their influence  in the United Nations to help the Tibetan cause and end what he  called the "last vestiges of colonialism."    It was the main theme of Saturday's proceedings at the  conference, being attended by nearly 40 MPs from 23 countries  and an equal number of Indian deputies.    Gonzalo Facio, a former foreign minister of Costa Rica and  his country's ambassador to the United States, supported the  call for recognition of the government-in-exile, based in the  northern Indian town of Dharamsala.    "Such a recognition by governments will not immediately lead  to the freedom of the Tibetan people but it will help them  achieve the objective," said Facio.    "I am all in favour of it. I think governments will start  doing it," he said.    The Dalai Lama, supreme spiritual leader of six million  Tibetans, has lived in exile in India since fleeing his homeland  in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule.    His government-in-exile is presently recognised by no  country. His host India, which is home to some 100,000 of his  followers, also treats Tibet as a part of China.    But the sentiments expressed at the parliamentary conference  reflected the growing world support for recognition of the exile  government, said Tashi Wangdi, a Tibetan leader.    Delegates also said complete independence was the only  solution to the Tibetan issue.    "The root of all problems (in Tibet) is the Chinese colonial  rule in Tibet," said Norwegian MP Harald Ellefsen. "Bringing an  end to that colonial rule will be the only fair and just  solution."    Latvian representative Jurif Sinka said: "I hope China will  find the courage, humility and generosity .. and set the Tibetan  people free."    Polish delegate Henryk Wujec urged the Tibetans to struggle  like the Polish Solidarity group had done against the Communist  regime in Warsaw.    Leif Bergdahl of Sweden suggested that the convention send a  delegation to Tibet and compile a report on the situation in the  Himalayan region, overrun by Chinese troops in 1949.    The conference is being held in the shadow of the Dalai  Lama's warning to China earlier this month that he may be forced  to bow to hardline elements within the Tibetan movement if China  does not respond to his moderate approach.    Tibetan delegate Karma Chophell said the Tibetans wanted  nothing less than total freedom. "We are not seeking any  autonomy. this should be very clear to everyone," he said.    Chophell said the Tibetans had realised after 14 years of  contacts between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities that  Beijing was only biding time and was not interested in a  solution.    "The final solution for all problems in Tibet is the  complete  independence of Tibet," he sad.    Deputies on Saturday also broke up into separate groups to  discuss alleged human rights abuses in Tibet, environmental  degradation and a perceived threat to Tibetan culture posed by a  Chinese influx.</p>

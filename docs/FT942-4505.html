			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Helene rights to help fund Pounds 10m Reggie acquisition Helene, the fashion wear manufacturer and distributor, yesterday announced a Pounds 8.9m rights issue to help fund the Pounds 10m proposed acquisition of Reggie, a supplier of women's outerwear. Some 41.8m ordinary shares are to be issued at 24p on a 1-for-3 basis. The initial consideration of Pounds 4.5m for Reggie will be satisfied by Pounds 2.9m in cash and loan notes and the balance by the issue of 6m shares to Reggie's vendors. The further Pounds 5.5m will be payable so long as Reggie's aggregate pre-tax profits for the two financial years to December 31 1995 exceed Pounds 4m. Reggie, which last year reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.56m on turnover of Pounds 16.4m, primarily supplies large high street retailers with its own-designed women's coats, jackets and separates. Helene reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.51m in 1993 on turnover of Pounds 101.6m, 56 per cent of which was generated by women's wear. Mr Norman Fetterman, Helene managing director, said Reggie operated in markets complementary to those of Helene and that the acquisition would 'strengthen our position as a key supplier to major high street retailers and mail-order companies.' The Helene board said it hoped to raise a total of Pounds 14.9m, Pounds 6.4m of which would be used to meet the cash element and part of the loan note element of the acquisition and Pounds 8.5m as additional working capital. Mr Fetterman said a larger capital base was needed to expand the company at a time when retailers were beginning to do business with key suppliers only. Apart from the rights issue, the board proposed that an additional Pounds 6m would be raised by the subscription of 24.3m ordinary Helene shares (about 12.3 per cent of the enlarged ordinary share capital) by Causeway Smaller Quoted Companies Fund. The rights issue has been fully underwritten by Samuel Montagu.</p>

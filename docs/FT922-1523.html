			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Negotiation likely to be Mandela's only choice: The political aftermath of a week of confrontation WE WANT arms now, declared the slogan on the placard greeting Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, as he arrived to address a township rally yesterday at the end of a week of confrontation and violence that has stunned South Africa. At a dusty football ground at Evaton, 25 miles south of Johannesburg, the ANC leader was left in no doubt about the anger of the 15,000-strong, predominantly youthful, crowd. 'Mandela', declared another poster, 'give us permission to kill our enemies'. And as the ANC president asked what the party should do, a forest of arms went up, with fists clenched and index finger curled, simulating the trigger action of a gun. It would have been surprising if Mr Mandela had responded to the anger with anything other than the announcement that he was suspending bilateral talks with the government designed to end last May's impasse in constitutional negotiations. It was all but inevitable that the stalemate at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the multi-party negotiating forum, should be followed by confrontation in the townships. More than two years after Mr Mandela's release the ANC and its allies seemed as far away as ever from their main objective; running the government of South Africa. In the eyes of many of their impatient and expectant followers the political changes that have taken place are no more than cosmetic. And as it became apparent at Codesa that the government was determined to resist ANC demands for a majority rule constitution and insist on what amounts to a white veto, it was only a matter of time before the frustrations turned into violence. But for all the anger it is hard to see that Mr Mandela has any choice but eventually to return to the negotiating table: the ANC is outgunned by the security forces, and trade sanctions are a dead letter. And ANC talk of the 'Leipzig option' - overwhelming the government by putting millions of demonstrators on the street - is treated sceptically by government. Officials acknowledge the capacity of the ANC and trade unions to conduct a successful one- or two-day stay-away, but doubt that this or any other 'mass action' can be sustained for much longer. For President F W de Klerk, however, having the upper hand - for the time being at least - would be a Pyrrhic victory. Only peace and stability, his officials concede, can bring about the economic recovery the country desperately needs. Nevertheless, the government is open to charges of complacency or over-confidence, which events of the past week will have shaken. The ANC's accusation that the government would respond differently if whites were being slaughtered is undeniable. The failure to seal off hostels for migrant workers, often located in the heart of troubled areas, is one key example of apparent indifference. According to Mr Mandela, Mr de Klerk promised in May last year to phase out hostels, replacing them with family accommodation, and to fence them off in the meantime. Nothing has been done. ANC criticism that the government has failed to ban so-called traditional weapons is also valid. While no one forecasts an early resumption of talks, it may well be that the minds of the main protagonists will have been concentrated by a week which contained all the ingredients of the country's nightmare scenario, in which industrial action, the bloody rivalry between the ANC and the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party, and trigger-happy South African police combine to tip the country towards ungovernability.</p>

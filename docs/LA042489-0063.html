			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> GROUP WARNS OF ALLERGY DRUG  </P> <P> An anti-allergy drug due on pharmacy shelves in June has been linked to the  deaths of babies and should be restricted to prescriptions, a private health  watchdog group said.  </P> <P> "Researchers in Belgium, where it is available over the counter, have  associated the drug with sudden infant death syndrome, and in subsequent  research found it to cause obstruction of the airways during sleep in infants,"  the nonprofit Public Citizen Health Research Group said.  </P> <P> The group asked the government to reverse a decision allowing non-prescription  sales of a common anti-allergy drug called Phenergan, made by Wyeth-Ayerst  Laboratories of Philadelphia.  </P> <P> The group said it was petitioning the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to ban  non-prescription sales, and it said its petition was supported by the Maryland  SIDS Institute and six prominent SIDS researchers.  </P> <P> SIDS kills an estimated 5,000 American babies each year, but its cause is  unknown.  </P> <P> Wyeth-Ayerst spokesman Audrey Ashby said the FDA reviewed all test data in  making its decision to allow the drug to be sold without a prescription. "We're  satisfied the products are suitable," Ashby said.  </P></p>

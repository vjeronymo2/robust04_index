			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] According to the 30 April Lisbon daily  EXPRESSO, in three months Portuguese drug addicts exchanged in  pharmacies almost half a million used needles within the context  of the operation "Say No to a Second-Hand Needle." Launched by  the National Commission Against AIDS in cooperation with the  National Pharmacies Association, the campaign, which took place  between October and December 1993, involved most of the  institutions charged with combating AIDS and drug addiction.  Pharmacies made available to drug addicts 610,000 kits  containing a sterile needle, an alcohol-soaked pad and a condom,  accompanied by an explanatory pamphlet. The kit was exchanged  for a used needle. The report compiled about the operation  revealed that 57.5 percent of the 446,920 needles were collected  in the Lisbon area. Some 20 percent came from Porto, 12 percent  from Setubal, 5.2 percent from Braga, 4 percent from Faro, 0.9  percent from Leiria, and 0.4 percent from the rest of the  country. Even if it is not possible to extrapolate from these  figures, it seems that official estimates concerning the  proliferation of drug addiction and the AIDS virus are well  below real figures. According to the National Commission Against  AIDS, only 1,416 cases of infection were detected until  September of last year, 289 of which were among drug addicts.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO;  </P> <P> VOLUNTARY WATER CONSERVATION  </P> <P> The City Council soundly rejected a mandatory water conservation measure and  instead opted for a voluntary system designed to cut water use. The council  voted to create a voluntary conservation program calling on residential,  business and industrial users to cut their water use by at least 10% during the  next two months. Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who introduced the voluntary program,  pledged to seek mandatory conservation measures in 60 days if the voluntary  effort fails to generate the 10% cut needed to offset drought conditions.  </P></p>

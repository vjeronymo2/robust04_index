			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Edmundo Galiza Matos] </F>   [Text] Dr. Aldo Ajello, representative of the UN secretary  general in Mozambique, says that he is going to apply pressure  so that the confinement of troops and their subsequent  demobilization can be completed as soon as possible. Speaking  at his usual Friday news conference this morning, Ajello said  both the government and the Mozambique National Resistance  [Renamo] have been making positive statements in this direction,  but there is a need to turn statements into concrete actions.    The Italian-born UN official said the movement of people to  assembly areas should not be delayed because of political  differences since the confining of troops has been secured  technically and logistically. Aldo Ajello said that in various  meetings he held with both the government and Renamo during the  week, he noticed progress in the process. He added that a  solution to the problems involved in confining troops and  demobilization will be found soon.    Butrus-Ghali's representative in Mozambique has revealed  that  the government has so far demobilized 17,889 troops, while  Renamo has demobilized 3,123. The government has still to  demobilize 31,580 men, while Renamo must demobilize 3,630  guerrillas. Aldo Ajello feels that if these men are not  demobilized as soon as possible there will certainly be  difficulties in concluding the closing down of all assembly  areas by 15 August.    He was satisfied, however, with the approval of a timetable  of the activities of the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] until the  holding of elections in October. The timetable includes, among  other things, the conclusion of the confinement of troops from  the government and Renamo, the closing down of assembly areas,  the conclusion of the demobilization of troops from both sides.  The timetable also provides for the presentation of the final  report on the national mine disarming investigation on 20 June  and the conclusion of the collection of weapons, ammunition, and  war materiel in government and Renamo depots on 10 August.    Aldo Ajello says he believes that both Renamo and the  government agree that this timetable, which he described as very  important, will be fully implemented. Regarding the training of  the new army, Ajello said that despite the progress already  achieved, there are serious problems in convincing people to  join the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces because they believe  they will be badly fed and accomodated and receive low salaries.    The UN Operations in Mozambique currently has 364 observers  and 4,560 blue helmets in the field. The UN Civil Police is  made up of 729 men deployed in 24 posts.</p>

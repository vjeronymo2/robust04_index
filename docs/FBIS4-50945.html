			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>   [Text] Beijing has stepped up surveillance over  dissidents, including those who have left the city centres or  gone into business. Friends of dissident intellectual Zhou Duo,  who staged a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square the day before  the massacre, claimed he had been subjected to harassment by  security forces. This is in spite of the fact that last month,  Mr Zhou, a sociologist, had left the capital to set up a  business in Tianjin.    "Zhou is selling cosmetics and other consumer products with  the help of a cousin," a friend said. "However, he is under  constant surveillance by Tianjin police and his business  prospects have been hurt."    In March, Mr Zhou, and two other intellectuals, wrote a  private letter to National People's Congress Chairman Qiao Shi  pleading for a faster pace of reform and labour rights. One of  the other petitioners has also been put under 24-hour police  surveillance in spite of his having forsworn protest actions in  the run-up to the fifth anniversary of the massacre.    Meanwhile the associates of Beijing University law lecturer  and labour activist Yuan Hongbing said they expected him to be  charged and put on trial this year. With two other dissidents,  Yuan was detained by police in early March for allegedly forming  an underground labour organisation and for organising a petition  demanding worker rights. The associates said his wife had been  informed that Yuan had been "formally arrested" and that  investigation into his case by state security agents would be  completed at the end of June. Yuan's case would then be handed  over to the procuratorate, which would determine when the  judicial procedure would start.    "The authorities have told me nothing about the nature of  his  `crime'," friends quoted Yuan's wife as saying. "They have not  even told me where he is being held. I am not allowed to send  him medicine and clothing." She added Yuan had stomach, skin  and liver ailments, and she was frustrated by the news blackout.    Sources in Beijing University said its famous law faculty  had  been subjected to tight surveillance owing to the radicalism of  several young scholars. Graduate student Wang Jiaqi, who was  detained with Yuan, fled the country last month.    The sources said at least one other graduate student there  had gone into hiding to escape detention. The student, who has  not been seen since March, is believed to have returned to his  native province.</p>

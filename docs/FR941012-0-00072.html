			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although OSHA has decided to retain in the final rule the prohibition against use of chain-saw noise alone as a means of contact, the final rule does provide employers with a great deal of flexibility in maintaining contact with employees. First, permitting radio communication to be used as a means of contact allows contact to be maintained while at the same time maintaining a two tree-length distance between adjacent occupied work areas. Second, permitting contact to be maintained by radio or whistles allows employees to work alone rather than limiting employees to working in teams that are within visual distance of each other. Allowing radio contact will also provide flexibility for small radio crew operations when visual or voice contact may not be possible. Third, OSHA also believes that permitting radio contact will not be unduly burdensome for the industry since many companies already are utilizing electronic communications (Ex. 5&hyph;27; Tr. W2 227).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the issue of equipment noise preventing radio communication, OSHA notes that radios are available with ear phones that fit inside hearing protection muffs. Where such ear phones and hearing protectors are provided, equipment noise will neither interfere with communication nor should result in occupational hearing loss.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because contact may be maintained by radio, OSHA has removed the exception to the contact requirement for ``single employee assignments.'' OSHA believes that radio communication already is necessary in order for many of those single employee jobs to be performed (e.g., watchman). As such, OSHA does not believe that extending the radio contact requirement to all logging operations will unduly burden employers, while at the same time it will provide important protection for all loggers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 6. Chain-saw protective devices.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the proposed standard, OSHA did not include a provision requiring chain saws to be equipped with chain brakes or other devices that prevent kickback. The proposed standard also did not require chain saws to meet any performance criteria of any standards-setting organizations. Rather, OSHA proposed only to require employers to inspect and maintain chain-saw safety devices when chain saws were so equipped. The hearing notice requested further comment on the adequacy of various chain-saw safety devices and what regulatory action OSHA should take in the final standard regarding chain saws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There was no dispute among commenters that chain-saw protective devices are necessary to prevent operators from being injured. The record shows that the chain-saw bar can kick back in less than 0.3 seconds (Ex. 4&hyph;172). The record also shows that average human reaction time, however, is only 0.75 seconds (Ex. 4&hyph;172). That means in many cases the operator cannot take action quickly enough to avoid being struck by the chain saw. The record also shows that many injuries in the logging industry are the result of chain-saw kickback. According to the WIR survey, 20 percent of all logging injuries reported involved chain saws and almost two-thirds of those injuries were the result of chain-saw kickback (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The Maine BLS survey also shows that chain-saw injuries account for a significant number of logging injuries (26%) in that State (Ex. 4&hyph;175). Similar to the WIR survey, the Maine BLS survey indicated that over half of all chain-saw accidents resulted from kickback.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Devices to prevent chain-saw kickback.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Information submitted to the docket indicates that there are four devices that exist to reduce or minimize the risk of injury due to chain-saw kickback. These devices are chain brakes, bar tip guards, reduced-kickback guide bars, and low- or reduced-kickback saw chains. Information about these devices was taken from a 1983 report prepared for the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) (Ex. 5&hyph;13) as well as comments to the proposed rule. The discussion that follows explains the different devices and their advantages and disadvantages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> chain brake <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is a device for stopping the saw chain when kickback occurs before the chain can contact the operator. The most common type of chain brake is actuated when the operator's hand or arm hits the brake lever that is located immediately ahead of the front handle. When kickback occurs, the chain brake may either be actuated by the operator's hand pivoting forward on the handle, or by the hand being dislodged from the handle, striking the brake lever. According to the CPSC report, chain brakes, unlike new technology chains and safety guide bars, do not have any adverse effect on the cutting effectiveness of chain saws. The record also indicates that one of the advantages of chain brakes is that, unlike other protective devices that can be removed, the chain brake is an integral part of the saw and is difficult to remove (Ex. 4&hyph;174). As such, chain brakes deter the disabling of the kickback prevention system by the operator (Ex. 5&hyph;19).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

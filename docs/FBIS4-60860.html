			<p>BFN     [Text] In recent days some provocateurs and press organs  are claiming that the interethnic relations in our republic's  northern region have again become aggravated. Our colleague  Gulsefa Ahmedova interviewed Deputy Chairman of the Supreme  Soviet Afiaddin Dzhalilov.    [Begin Dzhalilov recording] I believe that these are mere  rumors and are provocative in nature. With a group of  parliamentarians we visited [word indistinct] (?Siazen),  Khachmasskiy, Kubanskiy, and Kusarskiy Rayons in recent days.  We met the local inhabitants. Of course we also met with the  Lezghins living in Kusarkiy. I can state unequivocally that the  Lezghin people and all the peoples living in that region are  involved in Azerbaijan's life, are doing everything for the  speedy resolution of the Karabakh problem, and the Azerbaijani  and Lezghin peoples, who have lived and created together in that  same place, are sparing nothing in this grave historic,  political, military, and economic period for Azerbaijan. The  conclusion at these meetings was that human rights in Azerbaijan  are being protected, every suitable condition is being created  for national minorities, and the national minorities in  Azerbaijan, including the Russian community, share Azerbaijani  people's cares and are resolved to see a speedy end to this war  and the Armenian aggression, and a peaceful resolution of the  Karabakh problem.    In a word, I want to say that no matter if they are  Lezghins,  or Russians, or other ethnic minorities living in Azerbaijan,  they state unequivocally in connection with our visit there that  they support Azerbaijan President Geydar Aliyev's political  activity.

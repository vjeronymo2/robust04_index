Supreme Commander ACM [Air Chief Marshal] Woranat Aphichari  said the Government policy for the Armed Forces to procure  weapons through barter deals was "impractical" and should be  rectified. ACM Woranat's statement came after the Cabinet on  Tuesday turned down the Air Force's request to forego the policy  in acquiring a fleet of transport planes from Italy. The Air  Force wants to buy six Italian-made medium G222 transport planes  at a cost of US$131.5 million with funds allocated over the five  years starting this year. [passage omitted]    Responding to ACM Woranat's comments, Prime Minister Chuan  Likphai before leaving for Trang province insisted the military  must comply with the policy. "If (the military) can try, then it  must try. If it has not tried and just thinks that it cannot do  it, then that is not correct. If we try and it fails, then we  can talk," Mr Chuan said.    At the end of the Armed Forces' commanders' monthly meeting,  ACM Woranat said the Government policy adopted in November would  delay the arms acquisition process because the talks would be  more time consuming. The delay could result in price increases  and the Government having to pay more for the same equipment if  deals could not be reached within deadlines. The Armed Forces  had limited funds and the price increases would become a  financial burden, he said.    ACM Woranat insisted that the Armed Forces had tried to  follow the Government's policy in the arms acquisition plans  "but since we are facing the difficulty in implementing it, then  we have to inform the Government".    Under the Cabinet resolution in November, the Defence  Ministry has assigned the Supreme Command to study how to barter  Thai farm products for weapons.    The Commerce, Agriculture and Foreign ministries will be  told  in advance by the Supreme Command from which country the  military will procure arms and see whether barter deals can be  made. [passage omitted]    Lt-Gen Anuson Kritsanaserani, the director-general of the  Armed Forces Information Office, said the armed forces  commanders during yesterday's meeting expressed concern over the  policy and assigned the armed forces comptrollers to look into  the problem. He said the meeting also asked why the Cabinet did  not impose similar conditions on contractors of mega-mass  transit projects such as the elevated electric train systems.    Defence Minister Wichit Sukmak earlier said the Air Force  would strictly follow the Cabinet resolution in settling the  aircraft deal with Italy but noted that any further delay in the  acquisition might result in an increase in price and quality.    RTAF [Royal Thai Air Force] commander ACM M.R. Siriphong  Thongyai said he understood the Government's policy on arms  procurement, saying that country would benefit from such a deal.  However, he said the Government had limited time in the barter  deal on G222s. [passage omitted]    Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said the  Cabinet merely wanted to make the utmost benefit out of the  plane purchase plan for trade negotiation with Italy. The  Government had no intention to interfere with the armed forces  in their arms acquisition process. If the barter deal was too  difficult to achieve, Thailand could obtain some other forms of  trade benefits from Italy.    Thailand, for example, could ask Italy to ease its trade  barriers on Thai canned seafood, or urge it to help talk with  other European Union members to reduce tariffs on Thai exports  such as tapioca or canned tuna sent to the community.    The Government did not require that Thailand must purchase  the Italian planes only through the barter deal.    It may agree to such other things as more favourable trade  terms or even for its support for certain Thai positions in the  European Union, Mr Suphachai said. [passage omitted]</p>

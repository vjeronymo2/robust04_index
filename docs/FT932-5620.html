			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Burundi leader beaten in poll Burundi's military leader, Jean Pierre Buyoya, was unexpectedly beaten in the country's first democratic election by challenger Melchior Ndadaye, according to undeclared provisional results, Reuter reports from Bujumbura. The results, to be announced later today, showed that Mr Ndadaye confounded forecasts and polled more than 60 per cent of the vote. Mr Ndadaye, a 40-year-old banker, is a member of the majority Hutu tribe which has been governed for decades by the Tutsi minority, of which Mr Buyoya is a member. It was the first democratic election in the central African state since independence from Belgium in 1962.</p>

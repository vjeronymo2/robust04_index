But a "highly-placed  political sources" hinted in a report in the government  newspaper "AL-INGAZ AL-WATANI" that the expulsion order could be  reversed if Britain showed understanding of the reasons behind  the order. On Thursday Sudan said that it was giving Streams  two weeks to leave. Britain has given Sudan until Tuesday to  reverse the decision or face retaliation. The Sudanese  official said that the expulsion had nothing to do with the  ambassador's contacts with Sudanese opposition leaders or  controversy over a visit to southern Sudan by George Carey, the  archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

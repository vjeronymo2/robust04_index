			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PEETE IS THE FANS' CHOICE AS LIONS' QUARTERBACK  </P> <P> Rodney Peete clearly is the fans' choice as he battles to become the Detroit  Lions' starting quarterback.  </P> <P> But until he's Coach Wayne Fontes' choice, Peete isn't taking anything for  granted despite a strong performance in the preseason opener, a 25-24 loss to  Cleveland on Saturday.  </P> <P> In his pro debut against the Browns, Peete completed 11 of 23 passes for 155  yards, one touchdown and one interception as the Lions unveiled their stretch  offense.  </P> <P> He also drew the loudest cheers during pregame introductions and left the field  to a standing ovation at halftime after throwing a 41-yard touchdown pass with  one second left in the half to give Detroit a 17-15 lead.  </P> <P> When Peete was replaced at quarterback by Bob Gagliano in the second half, the  fans repeatedly chanted for his return to the game.  </P> <P> "It makes you feel good, it really does," Peete said Monday at the Lions'  Oakland University training camp. "But the thing you have to do is keep it in  perspective. ...  </P> <P> "Right now, I'm just trying to get experience. As far as looking down the line  and saying I'm going to be the guy, you'd have to ask Coach Fontes."  </P> <P> Fontes won't come out and say that Peete, who surprisingly lasted until the  sixth round of the NFL draft, will be his starter, but there are several signs  that Peete is the leading candidate. Originally, Peete was supposed to sit out  this week's game with Cincinnati. Now, Fontes says he'll play and may even  start against the Bengals.  </P> <P> And since Fontes said he wants to have a starting quarterback in mind before  the third preseason game, Peete would seem like the logical choice if he ends  up starting the first two exhibition outings.  </P> <P> Fontes said he continues to be impressed with Peete, both on the field and off.  </P> <P> "For a rookie, I thought he was brilliant out there," Fontes said. "I hate to  put that much pressure on the young man but he played very well. It was a heck  of a performance.  </P> <P> "Rodney is the type of young man that all the hype and publicity won't bother  him at all. He knows it comes with the position. He can handle it. He won't get  cocky and think he has all the answers at this time."  </P> <P> Peete started slowly against Cleveland after leading Detroit to first downs on  their first two plays from scrimmage.  </P> <P> He fumbled later in the Lions' possession and Cleveland kicked a field goal,  fumbled into the end zone for a Cleveland safety on the next possession, and  then had an interception returned 73 yards for a TD in the second quarter.  </P> <P> But Peete settled down late in the second quarter, when he passed for 141 yards  as Detroit scored 17 points. The Lions finished with 438 yards offense, more  than they had in any regular-season game last year.  </P> <P> "At the start, it seemed like everything was going so fast," Peete said. "I  just had to get the first few series out of my system. You have to remember  that this the same game as in college, it's just on a different level.  </P> <P> "A lot of players come in and try to put a lot of pressure on themselves. This  is the NFL and that puts them in awe. I feel this was a step forward for me  whether I played well or things went totally bad. I just wanted to get a chance  to play."  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Pickens Vows to Hike Koito Stake: Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens Jr. said he  will move quickly to boost his stake in Koito Manufacturing Co. to 33% from  26%, despite another defeat of his attempt to gain seats on the board of the  Japanese auto parts maker. Pickens, who lost his bid to secure four board seats  at Koito's annual stockholders meeting in Tokyo last week, said he plans to buy  more Koito stock that could cost him an additional $160 million at about $20 a  share. By increasing his stake to 33%, Pickens said he would, under Japanese  law, be allowed participate in decisions made by management.  </P></p>

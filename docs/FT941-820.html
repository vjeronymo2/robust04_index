			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Smith New Court turns bonuses into golden handcuffs Smith New Court, the securities house, is attacking the long-standing City tradition of 'take the money and run' by transforming annual bonuses into golden handcuffs. The company yesterday announced a plan to encourage loyalty by paying staff part of their annual bonus in Smith New Court shares. Individuals will only receive these shares if they are still employed by the company three years later. One of the principal aims of the scheme is to stem the exodus of leading staff from Smith New Court. Last year, departures included its highly rated oil and banking analysts to Nomura and its utilities team to Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Mr Michael Marks, chief executive, said last night: 'This is partly about retention of staff. We are not ashamed about that. People were taking a large bonus and then trotting off to the next franchise. That can't be in the interests of shareholders.' He stressed that the incentive scheme would also foster a greater sense of ownership by staff in the company. 'It will hopefully give them a meaningful stake,' he said. Mr Marks said a small trial version of the scheme had run last year and only one of the 20 people involved had since left Smith New Court. The shares will not be newly issued, as in many existing share option schemes. The cash that would otherwise have been paid out in bonuses will instead be used to buy shares from current shareholders. In a circular sent to shareholders yesterday, the company is seeking authority for up to 15 per cent of its equity to be held in trust for this purpose. Smith New Court is still deciding how much of the bonus will be paid in shares, although some insiders suggest it is likely to run to a maximum for more senior staff of up to about 25 per cent. More than 90 per cent of staff at the company received bonuses last year. Shareholders will vote on the plan at an extraordinary general meeting on April 20. It is also subject to final approval by the Inland Revenue. The proposals come after a year of high bonuses paid by City institutions. Earlier this month, it emerged that BZW paid total remuneration including bonuses of more than Pounds 1m to up to eight of its directors.</p>

As a  result, after the enterprises had established themselves, they  randomly used other people's trademarks and infringed upon the  rights of the people who had registered the trademarks, to the  extent that many disputes on use of trademarks have emerged and  many enterprises fight to sell a commodity with the same  trademark in the same market, causing chaos, a decrease in  price, and damage to the reputation of the trademark.    In light of the abovementioned situation, various economic  and trade departments and commissions, as well as foreign trade  bureaus, are hereby requested to seriously look into the problem  of the use of trademarks for export goods by enterprises, when  they declare import and export operation rights for production  enterprises and approve the establishment of various kinds of  foreign trade companies and foreign-funded enterprises.  Regarding: Those production enterprises which have relied on  the registered trademarks of other people for a long time but  have been unable to obtain permission from the patent holders of  the registered trademarks; the trademarks of commodities  operated by enterprises and causing registration disputes  between manufacturers and traders inside the country; those  enterprises which have names the same as the registered  trademarks of other people and their exports are the same or  similar to the commodities with trademarks registered by other  people; and regarding other activities which jeopardize the  reputation of the registered trademarks of other people, which  violate the law on trademarks, and which might cause disputes on  use of trademarks, no declaration, examination, and approval is  to be carried out.    Regarding the disputes on the use of trademarks which have  already emerged, the departments which gave the original  declaration and approval should mediate a solution according to  law. As for the cases which cannot be effectively settled by  administrative mediation, which cannot be solved for a long  time, which affect normal operation of enterprises, and which  disrupt export order, the persons who possess the registered  trademarks can report to the law enforcement organs for  arbitration according to law.    [Signed] Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade    [Dated] 16 July 1991</p>

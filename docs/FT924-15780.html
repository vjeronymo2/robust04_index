			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Air France falls deeper in red and cuts more jobs AIR FRANCE, the French state-owned carrier, yesterday provided the latest sign of continued recession in the world airline industry by announcing 1,500 fresh job cuts and increased losses for the first half of the year. The job cuts, to take place next year, come on top of 1,000 jobs shed last year and the 2,500 already planned to go this year and in 1993. Air France said it had to make these extra reductions because of worse-than-expected first-half losses of FFr1.6bn (Dollars 310m), up from FFr1.16bn in the same period of 1991 and a sharp reversal from the FFr477m profit reported in last year's second half. Mr Bernard Attali, the group chairman, said the cuts should restore Air France to break-even by 1994. This is a year later than forecast earlier and follows FFr1.4bn of losses over the past two years. Like its international competitors, the group is fighting a price war, especially on trans-Atlantic routes which represent 15 per cent of its annual sales, in an attempt to increase its share of sluggish traffic. It has responded by slashing costs, while attempting to maintain capacity, which is why the latest job losses will be among ground staff. By the end of next year, the Air France group, including its UTA long-haul subsidiary, will have lost 5,000 of its 45,000 staff and trimmed FFr3bn from its running costs. The latest cuts will reduce the general management staff by 15 per cent. Air France said it could not exclude redundancies, though staff being made redundant would be offered retraining and a job elsewhere.</p>

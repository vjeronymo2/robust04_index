			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Israel sends more tanks to Lebanese border ISRAEL positioned more tanks and troops along its border with Lebanon yesterday in the third day of hostilities between Iranian-backed Hizbollah guerrillas and Israeli forces. At least 14 people are believed to have died in the violence. On Monday night three Israeli gunboats bombarded the Palestinian refugee camp at Nahr El-Bared in Syrian-controlled northern Lebanon. Yesterday an Israeli warplane bombed suspected Hizbollah targets in the northern Bekaa Valley. In the south, Hizbollah fired about 30 Katyusha rockets, some into northern Israel. It was the first time the fundamentalist guerrillas have targeted Israeli territory since the assassination by the Israelis of their leader, Sheikh Abbas Musawi, last February. The rockets fired by Hizbollah killed a 14-year-old boy in the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona and a Lebanese school teacher and his 18-month-old son in Rmaich, just north of Israel. United Nations soldiers yesterday turned back 150 Hizbollah guerrillas who were attempting to reach Israeli-held territory. Security sources said at least eight Israeli Cobra helicopter gunships fired missiles into suspected Hizbollah hiding places in the 440 square mile 'security zone' in southern Lebanon on Monday night. The Israeli artillery fired 700 rounds into southern Lebanon between Sunday afternoon and dawn yesterday, when the shelling subsided. The escalation began when a remote-controlled bomb detonated by a Hizbollah guerrilla killed five Israeli soldiers on Sunday. A sixth Israeli soldier is believed to have died from his wounds. Security sources said they had seen no sign of an Israeli armoured column with tanks moving into southern Lebanon, as reported by Israeli radio yesterday. Israel later issued an official denial that there was mass movement into Lebanon. The Lebanese army - which usually refrains from involvement in Hizbollah-Israeli battles - has cancelled all leave and told its troops to rejoin their units. Lebanese troops fired artillery rounds towards Israeli positions that were shelling civilian areas near Nabatiyeh late on Monday.</p>

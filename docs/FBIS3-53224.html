			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F> Group]    [Text] There is a strong possibility that OPEC and non-OPEC  countries will reduce oil production. The petroleum ministers  of the six Persian Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] countries will  meet in Bahrain next week to study the outcome of efforts by the  Omani petroleum minister. He is contacting non-OPEC members in  a bid to urge them to reduce production.    Oil sources have described the Omani minister's contacts as  important. Oman is among the non-OPEC members that have  accepted reducing production by five percent. Following the  drop in oil prices and after meeting the Qatari energy minister,  who is also the OPEC secretary general, the Omani petroleum  minister left on a series of visits to Yemen, Egypt, Syria,  Norway, Britain, and Russia--all non-OPEC countries--and gained  their agreement, Norway and Britain excepted, to reduce  production.    After the recent GCC summit and the statement of readiness  by  the GCC heads to reduce oil production, the issue of agreement  between OPEC and non-OPEC members has become more serious. Iran  has said it is ready to reduce oil production, stressing that a  decision to reduce production can be made within the OPEC  framework.    Many oil experts believe that in addition to the economic  recession in the West and the West's oil policies, the drop in  oil prices is also linked with increased production by non-OPEC  members. This has led to efforts to convince these countries to  reduce production in a coordinated manner. The Omani petroleum  minister will continue his mission with visits to Brunei,  Malaysia, and Mexico within the next few days.    The reduction in oil prices has already affected the budgets  of the Persian Gulf Arab countries and made Saudi Arabia, which  is the largest oil producer, review its military projects and  its astronomic arms purchases. The reduction in the budgets and  the scrapping of ambitious military plans by the Persian Gulf  countries means a drop in foreign purchases, placing economic  pressure on the West's industries and military and nonmilitary  finances. So, the Western countries will gradually pay for the  damages that their policies on the oil-producing countries have  caused.    KUNA reported that the Kuwaiti petroleum minister will  discuss oil developments and ways to control oil prices at the  meeting of the GCC foreign [as heard] ministers in Bahrain.  This shows that in addition to its impact on the economy of the  Arab oil-producing countries, the reduction in oil prices may  have domestic political consequences for them if left  uncontrolled.</p>

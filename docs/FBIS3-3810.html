Tong is a long-time activist in a movement which saw  hundreds  of elderly victims come to Beijing to petition Japanese Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. He was taken from his Beijing home  by police last Friday, one day before Hosokawa arrived for a  three-day visit to China, one source said.    Authorities detained at least 100 of the victims in front of  the Japanese embassy in Beijing on Friday as they came to  deliver letters to Hosokawa demanding compensation and a public  apology for Japanese war crimes.    The release of Tong and others detained by police for  related  activities was the focus of an open letter to China's National  People's Congress on Monday. The letter was signed by 500  Chinese intellectuals.    In a related development, Gao Hongmin, a government official  detained Monday for allegedly planning to distribute political  leaflets in Tiananmen Square, was also released after undergoing  four hours of interrogation by police. Gao returned to work  Tuesday.</p>

First deputy Interior Minister Colonel-General Mikhail  Yegorov told an international seminar today that the bureau will  include specialists from all members of the Commonwealth of  Independent States and cooperate closely with police authorities  in the United States, Germany, Italy and other nations.    Yegorov said that "full-blooded" units of this nature have  already gone into action in all the regions of Russia.    He reported that 2.8 million crimes were committed in 1993  in  Russia. Although the overall growth is only about one percent  over the previous year, he noted, serious crimes such as murders  and offenses with the use of fire arms are rising faster.    Last year, 26,000 murder cases and 20,000 fire arms offences  were reported. But Yegorov did not give comparable figures for  the previous year.    Criminal gangs have controlled about 40,000 businesses and  state organizations in the country and multiplied their assets  in recent years with forged advice notes, drug-trafficking and  car and weapon smuggling.    According to Yegorov, gangsters from various groups clash  daily for "spheres of influence".    From 600 to 700 cases of racketeering, 10 to 15 cases of  hostage- taking and 30 to 35 armed gang clashes were recorded  each month, he said.    He stressed that with many hardened offenders freed from  jail, the expertise of criminals has been increasing. There are  a total of 400,000 inmates in Russian prisons.</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Warburg speculation boosts MAM shares Shares in Mercury Asset Management, the fund manager which is 75 per cent-owned by SG Warburg, jumped 58p to 711p yesterday on speculation that Warburg and Morgan Stanley would buy out minority shareholders if their merger went ahead. It is thought they propose to fold Morgan Stanley's asset management business into MAM, which is more than twice the size, creating a group with almost Pounds 100bn funds under management. Such a move would require the approval of more than 50 per cent of MAM's minority shareholders. It is possible that the 15 per cent held by funds managed by MAM and by its employee trust would also be excluded leaving the decision up to investors representing just 10 per cent of the shares. The merged banks could be forced by the Takeover Panel to make an offer to the minority shareholders. But it now appears that this is their plan anyway. Many of MAM's senior staff are also significant shareholders - the directors alone hold more than 2m shares worth Pounds 14m - and can be expected to demand attractive terms. But one of MAM's institutional investors voiced concerns about such a move. 'Once their shares have been bought out there is nothing to stop them trotting across the road to Schroders or whoever. MAM has a lot of very marketable people.' Even if MAM buys out most of the minority shareholders any opposed to a merger with Morgan Stanley's asset management business could still cause trouble. The merged banks would only be able to force shareholders to sell once 90 per cent of the 25 per cent had accepted. Some observers believe that the banks may have decided to buy out the minorities merely to make the deal easier and may refloat MAM at some stage. 'It would be a very handy source of capital for them,' said one institution. Sources close to Warburg argued that the benefits of independence have not been as great as predicted when Warburg originally floated off 25 per cent. On the other hand its efforts to expand internationally and into the UK retail would be boosted by the Warburg and Morgan Stanley names. Valued at almost Pounds 1bn, Warburg's stake in MAM represents more than half its own market capitalisation and is seen by both banks as a key element of the deal. MAM will announced its choice of independent financial adviser on Mon-day.</p>

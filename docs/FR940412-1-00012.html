			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current maintenance inspection provisions do not allow for thorough viewing of the wing structure. With this in mind, Univair issued Service Bulletin (SB) No. 29, dated January 27, 1994, which specifies procedures for (1) installing inspection openings in the outer wing panels, and (2) inspecting the outer wing panels for evidence of corrosion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the incidents described above including the referenced service information, the FAA has determined that AD action should be taken to prevent wing structural damage that, if not detected and corrected, could progress to the point of failure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Univair Models Ercoupe 415&hyph;C, 415&hyph;CD, 415&hyph;D, 415&hyph;E, and 415&hyph;G, Forney F&hyph;1 and F&hyph;1A, Alon A&hyph;2 and A&hyph;2A, and Mooney M10 airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would require installing inspection openings in the outer wing panels, inspecting (one-time) the wing outer panel structure for corrosion, and repairing any corrosion found. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with Univair SB No. 29, dated January 27, 1994. The inspection will become part of the affected airplanes' annual maintenance inspection program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The compliance time for the proposed AD is presented in calendar time instead of hours time-in-service (TIS). The FAA has determined that a calendar time for compliance is the most desirable method because the unsafe condition described by the proposed AD is caused by corrosion. Corrosion can occur on airplanes regardless of whether the airplane is in service or in storage. Therefore, to ensure that corrosion is detected and corrected on all airplanes within a reasonable period of time without inadvertently grounding any airplanes, a compliance schedule based upon calendar time instead of hours TIS is utilized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 2,672 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 8 workhours (maximum) per airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost approximately $67 (maximum) per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,354,704. This figure is based on the assumption that no affected airplane owner/operator has accomplished the proposed action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 -->  PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Letter: Twin tickets Sir, Jurek Martin ('Fumbling Bush', August 1/2) says US law prohibits a presidential candidate from choosing a running mate resident in the same state as himself. This is not so. The 12th Amendment prohibits electors of a state from voting for a ticket if both candidates are from the electors' state. But electors from other states could vote.

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Occidental to sell off coal business OCCIDENTAL Petroleum, the Los Angeles-based energy group, yesterday revealed that its coal business was up for sale and said the company would take a fourth-quarter, non-cash after-tax charge of Dollars 600m to cover the costs of divesting it. The announcement ended months of speculation about Occidental's plans. The company had indicated coal was no longer a core business, but had never said it planned to leave the business entirely. Moody's Investors Service placed Occidental's long-term debt and commercial paper under review for potential downgrading. It cited concern 'for the financial performance of Occidental's core business and its continuing high financial leverage, despite substantial restructuring efforts undertaken by the company since 1991'. Standard &amp; Poor's, however, affirmed its ratings on Occidental's senior and subordinated debt and its commercial paper, reflecting 'the solid business positions of Occidental's oil and gas, petrochemicals, and natural gas pipeline businesses.' Occidental reported fourth-quarter income from continuing operations of Dollars 14m (5 cents a share), compared with Dollars 7m (2 cents) a year earlier. Including discontinued operations, the company had a net loss of Dollars 588m (Dollars 1.94) in the latest quarter against net income of Dollars 6m (2 cents), in 1991. Sales slipped to Dollars 2.3bn, from Dollars 2.5bn. Mr Ray Irani, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We have implemented significant new cost savings measures including a salary freeze and substantial reductions in personnel, and we expect these measures to have a positive impact on our results in 1993. We have made no secret of the fact that our coal operation is not one of our core businesses, and we are proceeding with its disposal in a prudent and orderly fashion.' The company said it was discussing the sale of its coal business with several interested parties. For the full year, Occidental had income from continuing operations of Dollars 126m, against Dollars 372m in 1991. The company posted a net loss of Dollars 591m (Dollars 1.97 a share) in 1992, compared with net income of Dollars 460m (Dollars 1.52). In 1992, Occidental took net charges of Dollars 244m for the adoption of new accounting standards. On Wall Street, shares in Occidental closed up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 18 1/2 .</p>

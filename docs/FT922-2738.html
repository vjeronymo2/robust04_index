			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Portuguese customs to strike today PORTUGUESE customs officers are due to go on strike at ports, airports and border crossings for seven days from today to protest against job losses when the European Community abolishes frontier controls in 1993, Reuters reports from Lisbon. The officers' unions predict that 600 to 1,000 lorries will be stranded at Portugal's borders with Spain on the first day alone. About 85,000 customs employees across the Community stand to lose their jobs with the creation of the single market on January 1, 1993, a tenth of them in Portugal. The unions said customs workers had been offered Esc 86,000 escudos (Dollars 647) each in redundancy money from EC funds but the Portuguese government has not made it clear its own compensation plans.</p>

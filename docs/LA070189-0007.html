			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FILE  </P> <P> Inauguration ceremonies will be held in Chino on Friday for the first  California mosque of a Muslim sect whose founder 100 years ago claimed to be  the embodiment of the Christian messiah and the prophesized mahdi in Islam who  would revive the worldwide faith.  </P> <P> The $1.4-million Baitul Hameed Mosque of the Ahmadiyya Movement, which serves a  Southern California congregation of about 500, will be dedicated by Hazrat  Mirza Tahir Ahmad, 60, the fourth successor to the founder, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam  Ahmad.  </P> <P> The current spiritual leader lives in London, in exile from his native Pakistan  where members of the movement are regarded as a "non-Muslim minority" and are  prohibited from practicing their faith openly, according to Anwer Khan, a  spokesman for the new mosque.  </P> <P> The movement, claiming a worldwide following of 10 million, has established  congregations in 122 countries, Khan said.  </P> <P> Construction of the 11,000-square-foot mosque, which mixes a Spanish-tile roof  with low minarets, began after Mirza Tahir Ahmad laid the foundation stone in  October, 1987. Prayer services were held in the building during the recent  month of Ramadan, but Khan said full operation of the mosque will not begin  until next week.  </P> <P> PEOPLE  </P> <P> The Rev. Norman Lund, dean of faculty at the Lutheran Bible Institute in  California, a 100-student school in Anaheim, has been elected by the  theologically conservative American Assn. of Lutheran Churches to head its  fledgling seminary program. The denomination of 62 congregations, plus 25  churches served by affiliated pastors, was born in reaction to the 1987 merger  that formed the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Lund said he switched  his affiliation to the conservative denomination at its convention last week in  Moorhead, Minn.  </P> <P> Radio broadcaster James Dobson, through a spokesman at his Pomona-based Focus  on the Family Ministries, says that he has dropped his backing for the book,  "The AIDS Cover-Up," by Gene Antonio. U.S. Surgeon General C. Edward Koop  recently criticized Dobson and another evangelical broadcaster for echoing  Antonio's assertions on spread of the disease. Dobson interviewed Antonio on  his program and offered his book for a time, but the spokesman added that "we  gave careful consideration to the feedback we subsequently received from  members of the medical community and made the decision to discontinue it."  </P> <P> MEDIA  </P> <P> KNBC has decided to cancel "Checkpoint," a religious/public affairs program  that succeeded the all-religious "Odyssey" program. That leaves KCBS' "Today's  Religion" as the last television religious program produced and regularly aired  by a Los Angeles station. KNBC's magazine-style show was dropped for "economic  considerations," says producer Beth McKenzie, although programs still unaired  and reruns will continue through the end of 1989. McKenzie will be leaving the  station this month after 14 years with the program. She said the program has  had a following despite its recent 5:30 a.m. Sunday time slot because of people  who videotape the program for later viewing. JOHN DART  </P></p>

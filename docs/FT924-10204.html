			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / British patience runs dry Mr Vaclav Havel, the soon-to-be ex-president of the soon-to-be ex-Czechoslovakia, last week was received as an honorary member of the French Academie des Sciences Morales et Politiques. In his acceptance speech, he meditated at length on the virtues of patience. There is no point waiting for Godot, in the sense of an external salvation, for Godot does not exist; there is no point indulging in the impatience of a rational activist, for that is a communist-type error; the only real merit lies in simply waiting. It is an admirable, almost a saintly prescription for Job-like self-control. It will have been music to the ears of President Francois Mitterrand, whose most constant political maxim, exercised throughout his long political career, is: 'Il faut donner du temps au temps (let time do its work).' But it is not a prescription which seems to have a wide following in Britain today. Foreigners have long noticed the physical evidence of economic decline and decay; the whole world knows that Mr John Major's government has recently suffered - or has brought on itself - a set of policy failures on a truly heroic scale. But what really strikes the visitor from abroad as a new phenomenon is the violence with which the media denounce the government's failures. Old-timers may protest that the situation, while obviously worrying for Mr Major, is not really all that frightful, nor indeed all that different from a longstanding British pattern. This is just another little economic crisis followed by another little economic policy U-turn, similar to so many we have known ever since the second world war. OK, so Mr Major's ERM strategy turned out to be unsustainable; but now we have another strategy (for growth, no less), and with any luck that will work better and please the people more. There is a narrow sense in which weary familiarity is painfully close to the mark. The relative economic decline of Britain has been going on for a century or more, and shows no sign of ending; the British economy has been erratically mismanaged ever since the war, and the current fiasco is only the latest episode in a long-running farce. Moreover, it is sometimes claimed that Mr Major is only in the same boat as many other political leaders in the industrialised world, ranging from President Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Germany, to President George Bush in the US. They are all unpopular, and for broadly similar reasons; they have economic problems at home for which they have no solutions. But there is another sense in which the new debacle seems to me qualitatively different from its predecessors. Where Mr Major seems to be in a class of his own is in the depth and intensity of the media criticism of his administration, in the broadest sense of the term. President Mitterrand is almost as unpopular as Mr Major, according to the public opinion polls; but his treatment in the press is restrained and comparatively respectful; he is not the target of such strident vituperation. Returning to Britain after some years abroad, I find myself shocked by the volume and the violence of the current wave of criticism to which the government is subjected - not because it is undeserved, but because the pervasive tone of anger and contempt seems to me of an intensity without precedent in postwar British history. It is not clear that Mr Major's policy failures are fundamentally worse than those of Home, Eden, Wilson or many others; but they were not treated like this. Moreover, the anger and contempt are directed not merely at the government but at the whole administrative machine. Once upon a time, economic mismanagement was blamed on the wilful stupidity of ministers, while the Treasury was generally exonerated, despite its arrogance; today even the Treasury has lost all credibility. This loss of reputation has spread like wild fire to many other institutions once respected, and we may be perilously close to a general failure of credibility by the apparatus of the state. This seems to me a new phenomenon in Britain, and different from anything commonly observed in other European countries, except perhaps in Italy; and I suspect that the explanation has something to do with the second world war. In the past the British people excused their leaders for policy failure, because they tacitly made allowance for the heavy economic legacy inherited from the war effort. The Germans became rich because they lost the war, the British became poor because they paid for it. The corollary of this excuse was that the British refused to take seriously their reduced position in the world, or do anything significant to improve their performance or modernise their institutions. But few now remember the war, and forgiveness for that failure has been exhausted. The central element of this national self-indulgence has been refusal to come to terms with Europe. France and Germany were both traumatised by the disasters they suffered in the war, and were forced to frame their future in European terms. The British are still obsessed with war heroics, from Bomber Harris to El Alamein, and are still wrestling in anguish over their relationship with the Community. There is a time for patience, and a time for anger. In Britain the time for anger appears to have arrived.</p>

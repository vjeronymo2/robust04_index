			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Forte/Savoy Savoy's stock exchange statement contained many mysteries; not least, why it made it at all. The announcement added little to market knowledge and was chiefly remarkable for what it left unsaid. Doubtless, Forte thinks it worthwhile talking to the shareholding trusts about co-operation between the two hotel groups. It may well have much to offer in terms of joint marketing agreements, reservation systems and staff training. But the real unspoken point at issue is that of control. The long-running war for Savoy is hotting up again. Forte already speaks for 42 per cent of the voting shares but its standstill agreement not to buy more shares complicates matters. Forte is clearly growing restless and appears to have blocked the proposed appointment of Sir Roger Gibbs as Savoy chairman. In talking to the family trusts, Forte is opening up another front and must be hoping to win majority control without resorting to a bid. The trusts may well be more amenable given the Savoy's dismal trading record and the halving of its dividend last year. The company's weighty non-executive directors now have a critical role to play in encouraging any constructive proposals from Forte while defending the interests of all shareholders. Forte badly needs a success. The company was embarrassingly wrong-footed in its attempts to buy the Ciga hotels and it now appears as though the Meridien chain might evade its grasp. Some forward momentum is required if Forte's shares are to sustain their lofty rating.</p>

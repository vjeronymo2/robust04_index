The resolution on the border guards was  passed in September 1991, almost three years ago. Bacharow,  speaking in Russian says:    "The number of border guards has more than doubled since  then. New formations and units have been created to carry out  tasks in a new direction. The border guards acquired their own  air force, which considerably raised the mobility and improved  the manoeuvring potential of formations and units. The guards  also changed in quality. Formations started appearing that were  almost totally based on professional staffing. In this short  period of time a material and social basis was created, which  made it possible not in words, but in deeds, to tackle  independently all of the tasks facing us."    Bacharow continued: "The guards are sufficiently equipped  with up-to-date weapons and hardware. We have good relations  with the border guards of neighboring states: Russia, Ukraine  Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland. We are establishing relations  with border guards in Germany and France. This is natural, for  it is possible to solve the whole complex of border guard tasks  properly today only with full mutual understanding and concise  interaction of all services within this or that state and deep  integration of analogous processes in all Europe."    Bacharow says: "A few words about the operational situation.  Today it is more complex than ever. Such negative phenomena as  the drugs, illegal immigration, and weapons trading have moved  to the number one spot. Although the border guards do not have  a direct link with any of them, during everyday life and  activity they constantly come up against them. The following  figures show that the situation is become more complicated.  During six months in 1993, 396 violaters of the state border  were detained. Five months into 1994 the number is already 948,  including over 200 detained according to information from the  departmental service of active measures or by the service  itself. Since its creation, this service--which is understaffed  by 50 percent--is operating at the level of a good combat border  detachment, although it has about 20 times less personnel. It  has been proved possible to violate our republic's frontier with  impunity. We make no secret of this. During six months in 1993  there were five cases. In 1994 there was only one case.  Seventeen criminal cases resulted from violations of the state  frontier. In 1993 there were only two criminal cases. Of these  17 cases, seven were organizers from the new legislation passed  by the Supreme Soviet. In 1993 contraband worth 0.8 billion  rubles was confiscated; in 1994 the amount was 11.5 billion. In  1993 170 weapons were confiscated, and in 1994 the figure was  286. In 1993 123 tonnes of nonferrous metals and in 1994 248  tonnes were confiscated. Narcotics: In 1993, 17.3 kg were  confiscated, and in 1994 over 80 kg were confiscated. Border  guards received hard currency amounting to over $780,000 from  fees for detention and for visas. If all of this is converted  into Belarusian rubles, in five months the border guards  themselves paid 50 percent of their annual budget. We hope that  by the end of this year, as in 1993, we will pay the entire 100  percent of our annual budget ourselves." [sentence as heard]    Having stressed the difficulties of the job, Bacharow went  on  to say: "The fight against illegal immigration is the top  priority because it is the source of all evils today. We do  have the necessary legislative basis, but it has to be  perfected. As commander and as a member of parliament, I am  particularly concerned by the fact that the drugs business is  moving to a qualitatively new basis. I am consciously making  this statement; yes indeed, to a qualitatively new basis. Until  now the republic was only a transshipment base, but there are  now incidents that confirm that the republic is becoming a  market for drug sales. This is a very dangerous point, a very  dangerous sign. We were forced to fight the drugs business  before now, but even today it is not too late. In the very near  future a joint group must be created, a joint department,  perhaps a joint administration of the KGB, MVD, border guards,  and customs to deal with this issue directly. So far, our  efforts are at the level of the stone age."</p>

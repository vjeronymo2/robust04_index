			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAUGUS PARENT OFFERS HIS POINT OF VIEW  </P> <P> In Mike Downey's column on the Saugus-Palmdale football game, he mentions that  the principal of Palmdale had heard that Palmdale's players were being taunted  by racial slurs. There is no mention of who spoke those slurs. In fact, there  is no confirmation from any other source that such slurs were spoken.  </P> <P> My two sons, as two of the three Saugus team captains, state that they heard no  such slurs being directed at Palmdale's players. Further, they claim that with  only minor exceptions, the on-field relations between the teams was good.  </P> <P> Personally, I have heard of only one incident on the sideline where a Saugus  player made a racist remark. The remark was spoken, not yelled, and almost  certainly not heard by anyone from Palmdale. Coach Dick Flaherty firmly  instructed the player that the statement was out of line and the player was  benched for the rest of the game.  </P> <P> This is my honest understanding of this issue, but I make no claim to being  unbiased. If Downey had based his story only on my information, he would have  had a different story. However, he would have been just as guilty of bad  journalism, as he was in his column.  </P> <P> DAVID ALBERT, Saugus  </P></p>

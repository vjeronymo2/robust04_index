			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev on board a </F> Tu-134 by Nikolay Dolgopolov; date, precise location not given:  "Conversation with Minister Kozyrev in the Heavens"]    [Excerpts] People in the West -- and, above all, at home  -- have all been amazed at how Kozyrev has changed. There are  far fewer rumors about his resigning and more and more talk  about his and Russia's political firmness. What is the reason  for this change in the foreign minister's image and in Russia's  foreign policy course? Our long discussion took place on board  a Tu-134, and, surprisingly, Kozyrev had left his usual  diplomatic restraint back on the ground. [Passage omitted]    [Dolgopolov] We have now, touch wood, removed the threat of  nuclear war. I have a different question. Today our Russian  diplomatic service and you as its main repository have a new  image -- a fairly aggressive one. I did not board this aircraft  to praise you. But over the last few months things have been  more successful for Russia in this field. Let us recall poor  Yugoslavia at least. What is the reason for the turnaround?  And how do those Americans who, I bet, are unaccustomed to  seeing you as a determined man, react to these changes? Is  there a grain of truth in my observations?    [Kozyrev] Certainly. Russia will never become a  second-rate, insignificant country. We will put straight anyone  who does not understand that right away. Russia must be a  great, global power. But I must point out that diplomacy and  indeed policy as a whole never arise out of nothing. They  derive strength from society and are shaped by the state. But  we have a new Russian state system, it has already found its  level. And diplomacy is accordingly acquiring a different  voice. This is very easy to talk about now, whereas back in  1991 we had to speak loudly and energetically. People forget one  thing: Our huge state had after all broken up then. And our  newly formed country was faced initially not with the question  of having a loud voice but of having a voice at all and  remaining within the international system. No one said that the  Russian Federation is the rightful heir of the Soviet Union's  legacy. I admit to you that in those conditions the task of  practicing the diplomacy of the least possible losses is a  highly complex one. That is roughly what we did in 1991, when  the Union ceased to exist, and in 1992. Never mind the  luxuries, all we wanted to do was stay alive.    And we survived. What is more we joined all the  international organizations to which the USSR was just not  admitted. Everything comes to him who waits. That is why  Russian diplomacy is growing stronger now. As a professional I  am surprised by the fact that at this time a host of people has  emerged who are yelling: But I was defending my doctor's thesis  back then, in the second year at the institute. However, you  must not forget that the Soviet Union was a very unique state.  It bore a kind of mark of Cain. Although it is our homeland  and we do of course take pride in a lot of its heritage, the  country was not entirely normal. You see what our diplomacy has  had to come through. Everything's time comes. I want Russian  statehood to grow stronger. And we need a firm authority. The  firmer authority in Russia....    [Dolgopolov] ...Excuse me, do you mean firm internal  authority?    [Kozyrev] Yes, precisely that, then we will use even firmer  language on the international arena.    [Dolgopolov] Andrey Vladimirovich, about the Americans. Are  they conscious of this?    [Kozyrev] Of course they are. You know there is a  two-pronged reaction. Anyone has some desire, a natural  temptation to establish relations that are as suitable for  themselves as possible. They have seen that we are normal  people and will not fuel the nuclear threat. And of course the  Americans want us to remain normal politicians. But like a poor  relation. You are a good guy, so follow us. You used to be bad  and did everything in an inhuman way. I must say that there is  a grain of truth in this, although not 100 percent. A definite  stereotype has developed: Since you are being good, follow us.  But we are now saying: Yes, we have become good. But you will  have to follow us on these issues. That may be causing them  some discomfort in the United States: how, why?    Russia cannot of course, however, give in to euphoria or  hysterics. But nor should the Americans think that we as a  great power will always follow the United States without fail.  Nothing of the sort! There are issues on which, and I do not  rule this out, we may follow their lead. But in areas where it  is natural they will have to follow Russia's lead. And in some  spheres we will act together.    [Dolgopolov] Whom do you personally find it easier to deal  with -- Christopher or his predecessors?    [Kozyrev] Let's not get onto that.    [Dolgopolov] It strikes me that even the Americans have  realized that Russia is not a poor relative, if only because of  the diplomatic success in Yugoslavia. Will there be a new  flourish following the coming visit to Moscow by two sworn  hard-liners -- Comrade `Arafat of the PLO and Mr. Rabin of  Israel? Can we hope that the Near East problem will be solved  after all?    [Kozyrev] At any rate we do not plan to withdraw from the  Near East. You see, we have taken part in this process from the  very outset -- in conjunction with the Americans, naturally, as  co-sponsors....    [Dolgopolov] That's a difficult word.    [Kozyrev] Co-sponsors? We have been like Siamese twins.  The States once proposed a new format to us -- we agreed to  always speak with a single voice. If Russia said something, it  meant that the United States would do the same (and vice versa,  of course) -- that was roughly the understanding. Our American  partners started approaching this issue, as it were, in a new  way. They began coming up with their own initiatives.  Admittedly, they were always aimed in the same direction. But  when we asked them several times why these initiatives had not  been coordinated with us in some considerable detail, they  replied: "Why should we coordinate details on this!"    And let me tell you something frankly. After a couple of  answers like that we told them: "OK, since that's your idea of  partnership, maybe it suits us too." Then it was "so long,  Siamese twins." We are still people pulling the cart in the  same direction. We will just each be doing so in our own way.  And we too have started speaking with our own voice and taking  our own initiatives. We and the United States have common goals  -- only a peace settlement will do, nothing else. But our steps  will be completely independent. We are no longer twins but  people doing the same job but by different means. Recently in  Vladivostok I mentioned this bluntly to Christopher: If you  want to have very close cooperation anywhere, let's discuss it.  In other areas it might indeed not be advisable to speak with a  single voice. We can each do it in our own way -- and,  naturally, head in the same direction. But it should not be the  case that the United States has, as it were, free partnership,  while Russia has close partnership. If you have the freedom to  come up with your own initiatives on a specific issue, then we  have exactly the same freedom. Let there be equal opportunities  and commitments. If we agree once again to operate somewhere as  Siamese twins and if it is in our common interests, then that is  possible too.    [Dolgopolov] I really get the feeling that in certain parts  of the world our interests are interlinked. Take North Korea --  which the Americans claim already has an atom bomb. But isn't  the United States being too tough on the Koreans? There's no  visible sign of even normal diplomacy. The sons of Kim Il-song  have their backs to the wall, and no escape is obvious.    [Excerpts] [Kozyrev] That is why we came up with a new  initiative the other day. It has two simple, clear elements  which reflect the interests both of us and, I am sure, of all  other normal states. The first is to prevent the  nonproliferation regime from being undermined.    And the second. It has proved really impossible to solve the  problem on a U.S.-DPRK basis alone -- there has just been  further deterioration and tension. I won't say who is right and  who is wrong. But the fact is that this is the situation. So  we have proposed convening an international conference to  discuss and resolve this problem. The participants would be the  states in direct proximity and with real interests. These would  be Russia -- the events are almost as if they are happening in  the near abroad, right in our back yard. China. The United  States -- for the simple reason that the Koreans are demanding  certain decisions from the States. And the two Koreas and Japan.    [Dolgopolov] Andrey Vladimirovich, we ourselves also have  plenty of difficult problems in the far, or -- as you might  interpret it -- near abroad. Just take the protracted dispute  with Japan over the northern territories. First there are  reports that our border guards have been quietly withdrawn.  Then the president's press secretary explains that it is not  the border guards who are being withdrawn, just obsolete  equipment. Hata recently visited Moscow. So just what is going  on?    [Kozyrev] A clear-cut formula was reached during Yeltsin's  visit to Tokyo -- the northern territories issue does exist.  Unfortunately, we have inherited an unregulated border from the  USSR. The treaty which would fix the border does not exist. It  is in both our interest and that of the Japanese to work on this  issue. But although this was a stumbling block to the  development of any kind of relations for 45 years following the  war, this is now no longer the case -- as the Hata visit  confirmed. Admittedly, nothing revolutionary has happened --  and may not happen for a long time to come. It is a highly  complex matter. But there is no cause for despair, we must keep  on trying. This does not mean that they should make  concessions, or that we are obliged to either. We have to work  on this for as long as it takes.    [Dolgopolov] Now a word about another visit which strangely  became a talking point.    [Kozyrev] You're talking about Nixon's visit?    [Dolgopolov] I know that you did not meet with him, but what  happened? How do you view Yeltsin's appearance against the  backdrop of the Kremlin wall, where he treated the old  ex-president extremely severely? Nixon, who is 81 years old,  has definite influence with Republicans in the United States,  and it was not just anyone but Democrat Bill Clinton who sent  him to our country.    [Kozyrev] I will tell you everything I know about this. I  am aware of the external aspects and some of the internal  aspects. It is like the theater: The Americans simply have  poor producers. The whole scene may have been badly planned. A  good, well-known actor appears -- Nixon. But the producer makes  a major error: The actor appears at quite the wrong moment. He  turns up in the wrong play, using his lines in a different  dialogue at the wrong moment. The audience laughs. And someone  gets angry. The irritation begins. This is what happened to  Nixon. This was the first time in all his recent visits that he  did not address me, for instance.    [Dolgopolov] Are you friendly with him?    [Kozyrev] Very. It must be said that he was undertaking an  interesting mission. He has found his niche. He came here with  a similar objective under Gorbachev in 1991. And even then he  tracked me down at the Russian Foreign Ministry -- in a wretched  small building with a collapsing floor. We organized everything  normally for him. "Gorbymania" was at its height in the United  States. And on his return he decided to say that "Gorbymania"  only ruled in the West, while the situation was effectively the  reverse in the USSR. And he also told the United States about  Yeltsin the real political figure. So neither I nor Boris  Nikolayevich have anything but respect for Nixon. He is a major  political figure. And visits by people of that level must be  organized by professionals. A foreign minister should not have  to learn about a former president's visit in the newspapers.    [Dolgopolov] So who did organize it?    [Kozyrev] I do not want to say who did this. The people who  did it know who they are. But it was not that they were  unprofessional in what they did, but deliberately overturned  everything. Absolutely! Everything was topsy-turvy so that the  main hero became the main villain. He did not meet Boris  Nikolayevich. But the president learned that Nixon had gone to  see Rutskoy, Zhirinovskiy, everyone. I cannot understand it, no  one has ever behaved like that. Impromptu moves are well  prepared for any visit by a politician who is in any way  respectable. I hope everyone is aware of this. But impromptu  moves for the sake of it are a mistake. Nixon's visit involved  a series of political mistakes. I don't think he himself had  anything to do with it. I think he was told that the program  had been worked out and prepared as always. He does not have to  go into every detail. There is a certain apparatus to handle  this. But Nixon found himself in a very surprising situation.  Imagine: You get up early one morning, go to your bathroom in  your robe, clean your teeth, and suddenly there is someone else  there, albeit a friend, but someone whom you did not invite.  And you say in amazement: "Why couldn't you call me and tell  me you were coming? Aren't we good friends?" And Boris  Nikolayevich was right to say that he had not been treated as  befits the president of Russia.    [Dolgopolov] You mentioned that Nixon met with  Zhirinovskiy. And Vladimir Volfovich tried to a certain extent  to pass himself off as your colleague -- he was dying to head  the Duma International Affairs Committee.    [Kozyrev] He's dying to be head of state.    [Dolgopolov] Would you shake his hand?    [Kozyrev] No.    [Dolgopolov] Or acknowledge him?    [Kozyrev] I have no truck with fascists.    [Dolgopolov] What then is your attitude to the Duma's rather  surprising amnesty law?    [Kozyrev] To my mind, the decision to release everybody was  by no means right.    [Dolgopolov] But a memorandum of accord has already been  prepared....    [Kozyrev] ...The talk of a universal accord is abstract. If  the concept has something else in mind other than the  Constitution -- an agreement with the fascists, for instance --  I do not understand it and will have no part of it. If it means  agreement with the party of war that Rutskoy leads, I will tell  you bluntly -- Rutskoy means war.    [Dolgopolov] ...Aren't you being a bit hard on the former  vice president?    [Kozyrev] ...There is civil, cold, and maybe even hot war in  the world. Let me tell you straightaway -- if Rutskoy or  Zhirinovskiy becomes president, Russia will not survive. I  would repeat that I am giving you my personal view. I can see  no agreement on this. What would it consist of? Of observing  the Constitution? The entire people voted for that. But those  who called on Russia to take up the sword should be kept in  jail. Until such time as Zhirinovskiy abandons his blatantly  fascist slogans and Rutskoy his gamble on, essentially, a rerun  of the Yugoslavia situation in Russia, I can have no agreement  with them.    [Dolgopolov] One more difficult question before we land,  Andrey Vladimirovich.    [Kozyrev] Go ahead. Although it's time to fasten your seat  belt.    [Dolgopolov] It's about a problem which for some reason is  of concern to almost everyone. Just what is the Foreign  Ministry's personnel policy? For instance, who appoints  ambassadors -- you or the Kremlin? Sometimes when you see  people emerge in diplomatic posts you have to wonder: Just what  is so-and-so -- not a career diplomat but a recycled political  figure -- going to be doing abroad?    [Kozyrev] There has not been a single appointment that has  not been coordinated with me. Sometimes the initiative may come  from Boris Nikolayevich. Or somebody else might say --  so-and-so's a good man, he'd do well in such-and-such a posting.  Yes, there are times when people are suggested. There are  times when it is suggested to them. Sometimes they ask  themselves. Admittedly they'll later say in public that they  weren't asked, that they were virtually forced into it. I know  pretty much exactly who asked and who didn't.    [Dolgopolov] But people do ask....    [Kozyrev] Yes, there are non-career diplomats who ask for  postings themselves.    [Dolgopolov] I should explain to readers that the word  "non-career" means people who previously had no connection with  the Foreign Ministry or diplomacy, but who have nonetheless  received important postings far from home.    [Kozyrev] That's about the size of it. Now to turn to Boris  Nikolayevich's role. He is the president, and under the  Constitution he appoints the ambassadors. It is the Foreign  Ministry Collegium which decides whom to recommend. But I would  reiterate that there has not been a single ambassador posted by  Boris Nikolayevich without our consent. We will now be  consulting with parliament -- with four committees from the two  chambers.    [Dolgopolov] My last question. There has now been a certain  renewal among the top Foreign Ministry leadership. You have new  deputies and even first deputies. Are you not worried that some  of them -- former ambassador to Spain Igor Ivanov, for instance  -- may be dealing with problems that are entirely new to them?  He has been and still is a Europe specialist, but is now  conducting highly difficult talks on the Near East.    [Kozyrev] Are you sure the job should definitely be done by  an Arabist? We work on the basis of their experience, advice,  and recommendations. But a first deputy minister, who makes  policy and conducts talks, should have political experience and  very high professional standards. I'm a supporter of teamwork.  And I want people to know who works at the Foreign Ministry.  There's Vitaliy Ivanovich Churkin -- he handles Yugoslavia. I  am pleased for his -- our -- success. I have no inferiority  complex at all. Boris Nikolayevich Pastukhov handles Georgia.  Ivanov deals with the Near East.... These are all top-notch,  experienced people. Each in their own post.    [Dolgopolov] We are landing, Andrey Vladimirovich. You  yourself will realize that not everything we have discussed can  be included in the interview. This isn't the West -- our  newspapers are just eight pages long. So -- thank you, and we  will try to include the most interesting parts of our talk. You  yourself said that people should know about those who work at  the Foreign Ministry. So now they will.</p>

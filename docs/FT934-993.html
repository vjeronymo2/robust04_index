			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Commission wants equal tax treatment in Europe The European Commission yesterday heralded a new approach to tax harmonisation by adopting a recommendation aimed at ending discrimination against non-resident taxpayers. The Commission is calling on member states to grant the same tax benefits to 200,000-300,000 EU citizens working beyond the borders of their home country as they currently do to residents. Many cross-border workers are unable to claim family and married couple tax allowances at home or abroad. The Commission has asked governments to bring national legislation and bilateral tax agreements with other EU members into line with the recommendation by 1995. If national rules are not harmonised, a formal directive could be proposed. Brussels will continue to pursue governments through the European Court of Justice, using the recommendation as a basis for complaints. Senior Commission officials said yesterday the approach was one way of unblocking proposals on tax, which require unanimous approval from member states. Such measures are often opposed by governments which fear losing revenue and sovereignty over tax matters. A broad recommendation could be used, for example, to speed harmonisation of tax treatment for small and medium-sized companies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 25 February Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] In order to bring about a breakthrough in the  rough-going Japan-U.S. economic consultations, the government  plans to announce import promotion measures on automobiles and  auto parts -- the sector of most concern in the talks.    In an action with respect to the standards and  authentication  system, the Ministry of Transport [MOT] will station officials  in the United States on a permanent basis to help facilitate  U.S. auto manufacturers' acquisition of "model certification"  from Japan. The government will also study how it can support  import car exhibitions held by the private sector. These plans  will be incorporated into the "general measures on foreign  trade" [taigai sogo taisaku] which will be finalized in the  middle of March. Meanwhile, Toyota Motor Corporation and Nissan  Motor Company have decided to prepare voluntary import plans  primarily aimed at buying U.S.-made auto parts in 1995. These  plans will be announced in March. The government wants to  secure understanding of the United States by emphasizing that  both the government and the private sector are making efforts --  toward reopening the talks.    The government measures will give priority to creating  circumstances which can contribute to promoting purchases of  U.S.-made automobiles and auto parts.    Model certification is a system whereby the MOT will check  and determine whether the models of vehicles [to be imported]  meet the safety criteria of Japan or not. Once certification is  issued, vehicles of the certified models can be sold in the  Japanese market without inspection in the country. Since  inspections of individual vehicles by the government are not  necessary, the system will contribute to lessening  manufacturers' burdens. The MOT has decided to give  preferential treatment to stationing its inspectors in Detroit  beginning in April to deal with applications for model  certification by U.S. manufacturers.    As far as U.S. demands for easing the standards and  authentication system are concerned, specific plans will be  worked out by increasing the frequency of meetings of Japanese  and U.S. transport authorities' specialists on standards and  authentication, and by setting a deadline for arriving at a  conclusion in the meetings. The auto maintenance service  industry will be advised not to discriminate against  foreign-made parts. The possibility of the government providing  support for imports -- in the form of the Japan External Trade  Organization (JETRO) backing up import car exhibitions and  business conferences -- is also being considered.    With respect to the framework talks on automobiles and auto  parts, Toyota Motor Corporation and Nissan Motor Company will  prepare and announce their voluntary plans on procurement of  U.S.-made products in March. They are studying whether to  indicate procurement plans in monetary amounts.    They will also make public details of already-agreed-on  cooperation projects including sales plans in Japan of vehicles  from the U.S. Big Three.    It is likely that other companies like Honda Motor Company  and Mitsubishi Motors Corporation will eventually prepare  similar plans, even though the companies will be presenting them  as the companies' own purchase plans, and not as "pledges" to  the United States.    Regarding four [as published] other areas including  government procurement, competitiveness, and deregulation, a  meeting of cabinet members concerned will be held to finalize  specific plans on 25 February. The specific plans will include  adoption of a general evaluation system in some parts of the  telecommunications, medical equipment, and government  procurement, and an announcement of the plans will be made on or  around 10 March.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Ford looks to Vietnam venture Ford has said it will apply to the Vietnamese government early next year for a licence to build vehicles with a local partner, state-owned Song Cong Diesel. Speaking after talks with senior government officials in Hanoi yesterday Mr Wayne Booker, a Ford executive vice-president, would give no details of the vehicles Ford intends to build or the volumes in which they would be produced. He said the project would reflect Ford's determination 'to become a key player' in the Vietnamese and other Asian markets. Negotiations on the project are at an advanced stage, following several months spent on a feasibility study. Ford will be the majority partner in the venture. Ford, the world's second largest vehicle maker, is joining a queue of manufacturers either planning to make or already producing vehicles in Vietnam. In October, Chrysler announced a Dollars 100m joint venture to build mini-vans and possibly four-wheel drive vehicles, the first venture by a US carmaker since the lifting of the US economic embargo on Vietnam this year. Several international vehicle makers are considering projects in the country, in spite of difficulties in finding local partners with experience in the industry.</p>

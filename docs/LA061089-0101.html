			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: JUDGE DELAYS RELEASE OF BRITISH EX-OLYMPIAN  </P> <P> The proposed release of David Jenkins, the former British Olympian who has  served six months of a seven-year sentence for selling black-market steroids to  athletes, was delayed Friday by a federal judge in San Diego when the judge  learned that the prosecutor had intercepted the judge's mail.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving demanded an explanation, calling the  removal of a letter from his courthouse mailbox "shocking, unprofessional and  intolerable to the court, with potentially serious consequences."  </P> <P> The judge's criticism was directed at Phillip Halpern, an assistant U.S.  attorney who persuaded a court clerk to remove the letter written by Kenneth  Ingleby, a U.S. Customs Service official who opposed reduction of Jenkins'  prison term.  </P> <P> Irving also accused the prosecutor of "trading on the friendship" of clerk  Chris Gibson, who received a thank-you note from Halpern. The note told Gibson  she could throw away the letter because Ingleby had authorized the disposal.  </P> <P> Halpern apologized to the court but insisted he was merely trying to prevent  direct communication between an agency head and a judge, a communication which  is illegal according to the U.S. Code on Procedures.  </P> <P> Jenkins, a U.S. resident, will remain in Boron Federal Prison in the Mojave  Desert until Irving renders his decision.  </P></p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Red tape strewn across Europe - In A Nutshell British exporters believe regulations and red tape will represent the largest non-tariff barriers to selling in continental Europe, followed by discrimination against non-local goods and services. One in 10 exporters regard Germany as the most difficult sales destination because of the high-quality standards and competitive pricing demanded, according to a survey of 450 small businesses by Barclays Bank. France was seen as most likely to impose red tape or to discriminate against imports. Despite this 81 per cent of exporters were optimistic about future prospects. One third have increased their export sales and promotion and a similar number have made new contacts abroad.</p>

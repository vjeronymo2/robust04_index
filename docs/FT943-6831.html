			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Krupp Hoesch cuts first-half loss Krupp Hoesch, the merged steel and engineering group, yesterday said it had slashed losses to DM47m (Dollars 29.90m) for the first six months, compared with a DM324m deficit for the same period last year. The Essen-based group operated profitably during June for the first time since the merger in December 1992. It forecast a break-even by the end of the year and said that steel would be the only one of the six divisions to be making a loss, although it would be much lower than the DM780m loss reported in 1993. Aggressive cost-cutting and savings created by bringing together complementary sectors within the two groups had helped the performance, a spokesman said. The company shed 11,041 workers, or 13 per cent of the workforce, in the 12 months to June 30 and said it would shed about 2,000 more before the end of the year. This would bring the workforce to around 70,000, down from about 95,000 at the time of the merger. Strong exports and signs that the German market is pulling out of its worst post-war recession also aided the recovery. Turnover in the first six months rose 6 per cent to DM10bn, while group orders increased 12 per cent to DM11.2bn. Steel sales, which make up about 30 per cent of group turnover, rose 3 per cent while orders climbed 18 per cent. However, industry sources said that while the upturn in the US economy was reducing excess European capacity, demand still needed to improve before prices could recover.</p>

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Opportunity for extremists IT WAS always possible, even probable, that acts of extremism would undermine and might eventually destroy the foundations of the Middle East peace process laid in Madrid 14 months ago. The only effective way to reduce that risk was through sustained progress at the negotiating table. There had to be enough diplomatic momentum to raise the eyes and expectations of the region's populations above the daily and mutual abrasions of military occupation and to isolate politically those who most vigorously opposed the process. The failure of Israel, the Palestinians, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan to progress beyond procedural issues during the eight rounds of negotiations held so far is now bearing predictably sour fruit. Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the two most radical Moslem groups in the West Bank and Gaza, have been responsible for the deaths of six members of Israel's security forces this month and are increasingly seeking to assume the mantle of Palestinian resistance. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, responded crudely by deporting 415 alleged Hamas supporters, without charge or trial. Lebanon refused to accept them and these men are now abandoned on a frozen hillside, without basic humanitarian care, a testament to the ease with which Middle East leaders can revert to the attitudes and actions which marked the past four decades. The one sure thing is that Hamas will not liberate Gaza and the West Bank for the Palestinians, and Mr Rabin will not find a secure, negotiated future for Israel by taking harsh actions which have been universally condemned by the world community, specifically by UN Security Council resolution 799, and which simultaneously inflame opinion in the occupied territories. PLO squeezed The Palestine Liberation Organisation, denied from the outset any formal role in the peace process but in effective control of the delegation to the Washington negotiations, is squeezed ever more painfully between Israel and Hamas. Its diminished leadership will lose more ground among its own constituents if it resumes talks without first having achieved something for the 415 deportees, or for the other 600 or so Palestinians arrested at the same time and still in detention. If the PLO decides against going back to the table then it is unlikely that Syria, Jordan and Lebanon will break Arab ranks. In short, the peace process will be stalemated, but not, perhaps, lost. What it most needs at this low ebb is an act of statesmanship recognised by all sides as a sincere gesture towards compromise and negotiation. Given that no Arab leader currently looks capable of emulating the late Anwar Sadat and that Mr Rabin is politically hamstrung by his rash expulsion orders, it is once again to the US that the region must look for help. Concessions in the Middle East are invariably much easier to make in response to a third party. All those directly involved in the conflict are susceptible to initial requests from President-elect Bill Clinton. American dimension Much though the new president may wish to concentrate on domestic issues, the peace process urgently requires the American dimension that it lost from the day that Mr James Baker left the State Department to concentrate on Mr Bush's re-election campaign. Without the enormous commitment of Jimmy Carter, the last Democratic president, President Sadat's visit to Jerusalem in 1977 would not have been translated into a peace treaty. Without the unstinting efforts of Mr Baker, the Madrid conference would never have been held. Mr Bush has said repeatedly that, having got everyone to the table, he cannot now desire peace more than the negotiating parties. But what an American president can do is provide a more effective framework for negotiations with a demonstration of his own personal interest and the appointment of full-time, specialist conciliators, within or attached to the State Department, who have the political weight to propose compromise solutions. Too much time has already been lost since the Madrid conference; the events of recent weeks have demonstrated once more that extremists in Israel, the occupied territories and elsewhere in the region are always ready to respond to any sense that the tide is beginning to turn back in their favour.</p>

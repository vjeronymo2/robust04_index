			<p>SUMMARY                                 With the deadline for a U.S. decision on renewing most-favored-  nation (MFN) trading status for China rapidly approaching,  Beijing is sticking to its longstanding strategy of making  gestures on human rights and publicizing compliance on other  issues of concern to Washington while rejecting any formal  linkage between MFN and human rights.  Beijing has continued to  warn of the negative economic consequences that might result from  the Clinton administration's failure to renew China's MFN status  and, resurrecting a tactic used during past MFN renewal debates,  has highlighted the strategic consequences that could arise if  MFN is not renewed.  However, Beijing's efforts to present an  image of progress in addressing U.S. demands are being undermined  by leadership concerns about domestic stability and the adoption  of measures to repress dissent that are at odds with the goals of  China's campaign for MFN renewal.                          END SUMMARY     Stepping up its efforts to influence the MFN debate as the  deadline for renewal draws near, Beijing in recent days has  sought to highlight its alleged progress in meeting U.S. human  rights concerns, announcing the release of more jailed  dissidents.  On 13 May, for example, Xinhua announced a major  gesture on human rights in reporting that Chen Ziming, who along  with Wang Juntao had been serving a 13-year sentence for his role  as an alleged ringleader of the 1989 pro-democracy movement, had  been "released on bail for medical treatment."  China had  released Wang on 23 April and allowed him to go to the United  States for medical treatment.  In a similar concession to  Washington on a high-profile dissident, Beijing, according to the  independent Hong Kong daily The South China Morning Post, has  resolved one of the "major blocked passport" cases and has given  noted legal scholar Yu Haocheng permission to leave for the  United States (12 May).     In addition, Xinhua on 12 May reported that Zhang Ruiyu, who  reportedly had been jailed in August 1990 for having "conspired  to overthrow the government by means of religious activities,"  has been released "on parole."  The next day, Xinhua announced  that five more religious dissidents--Chen Zhumun, Yan Peizhi, Xu  Zhihe, Cui Tai, and Zhang Li--have been released from labor  reeducation institutions.  According to the press agency, the  five had been arrested between December 1991 and September 1993  for "disturbing social order and endangering public security by  making use of religion."     Compliance with Executive Order Conditions     Beijing has also stepped up its efforts in recent days to  demonstrate Chinese compliance on other MFN-related issues, while  denying any linkage between these gestures and the MFN debate.  On 19 May, for example, Zhongguo Xinwen She, Beijing's news  service for overseas Chinese, reported remarks by a PRC Foreign  Ministry spokesman that touched on a number of issues identified  as areas of U.S. concern in President Clinton's May 1993  executive order on China's MFN status for 1993 and 1994.  According to the report, the spokesman denied that Beijing is  "jamming" Voice of America broadcasts to China, but noted that it  has agreed to hold talks on "technical matters" regarding the  broadcasts, "such as the questions of overlapping frequencies."  --Prison Conditions.  The spokesman also underscored Beijing's  alleged progress on the question of prison visits by the  International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).  He said that  China's talks with the ICRC were proceeding apace and that the  two sides have "agreed" that the talks "furthered understanding  and were very positive."  Apparently seeking to polish China's  image on the question of conditions in PRC prisons, Zhongguo  Xinwen She on 20 May began a series praising the success of  China's penal system.  The first installment of the series cited  Zhang Xiufu, a vice minister of justice, as touting China's  success in "reforming" its criminals through labor, saying that  China has "one of the lowest rates of recidivism in the world."  Other installments have pointed to other alleged virtues of the  penal system such as the supposedly enlightened treatment of  "hardened" criminals at Shanghai's No. 147 prison with its "rich"  sports and culture programs (21 May), the "humanitarian"  treatment of foreign prisoners in Shanghai City Prison, who  allegedly receive television sets, books, magazines, and a copy  of China Daily (22 May), and the successes of China's  "transformation through labor" policy (May 24).     -- Prison Labor.  Beijing has shown particular sensitivity to  recent charges that China is exporting goods made by prison  labor--perhaps because resolving the prison labor issue is one of  the mandatory conditions of President Clinton's executive order.  For example, China responded quickly and authoritatively to the  16 May release of a foreign-made film on the No. 2 Prison in  Xinjiang.  A spokesman for the "Judicial Department," in remarks  carried by Xinhua the next daY, called the film a "fabrication"  and denied the film's claims that the prison produces clothes for  export.  Two days later, a PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman took  issue with claims by "a number of U.S. Congressmen" that China is  continuing to export prison labor products to the United States,  calling these remarks a "sheer fabrication" and saying that  Beijing has acted in "strict compliance" with the Sino-U.S.  Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and the subsequent joint  statement on implementation (Xinhua, 19 May)   On 2O May, Beijing  reiterated its earlier denunciations of the film in a statement  from a "leading official" of the "Judicial Department" (Xinhua,  2O May).     -- Tibet.  Beijing has also taken special pains in recent days to  address the question of Tibet--another area of U.S. concern  mentioned in the 1993 executive order--by publicizing an  interview with a spokesman for the United Front Work Department  of the party Central Committee.  Clearly meant for foreign  audiences, the interview was published in the 16-22 May edition  of Beijing Review, China's English-language weekly current  affairs journal.  In addition to claiming economic and social  advances in Tibet, the spokesman laid out Beijing's longstanding  policies on talks with the Dalai Lama.  The spokesman underscored  Beijing's willingness to hold talks with the Tibetan religious  leader, asserting that China has made "genuine efforts" over the  past ten years to hold talks with the Dalai Lama and insisting  that such efforts will continue with "full sincerity and  patience.     Warnings on Consequences     As the deadline for the MFN decision nears, Beijing has also  ratcheted up its warnings of the negative consequences that might  follow from a failure by the Clinton administration to renew  China's MFN status.  Meeting with former U.S. Secretary of State  Henry Kissinger on 12 May, PRC President and CPC General  Secretary Jiang Zemin resurrected a threat used by China during  past debates over MFN renewal, indicating that the failure to  renew China's MFN status could have strategic consequences for  the United States.  According to a 12 May Xinhua account of the  talks that day, Jiang underscored the "responsibility" borne by  China and the United States as "two powers having a considerable  influence on the world" and warned that "confrontation between  the two countries "will do no one any good."  Better relations,  he said, will "benefit" the world and are "re9uired for world  peace and stability."  Not surprisingly, he also suggested that  bilateral relations will "meet with difficulties or setbacks or  even regress" if Washington persists in "stressing differences  over ideology" and tries to impose "sanctions.and pressure."     PRC Premier Li Peng delivered a similar message in his meeting  with former U.S national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski on  16 May.  Bluntly rejecting any linkage between MFN and human  rights, he stressed that China will "not allow any country to  impose its ideology or concepts of values" on China and will  "never allow any other country to attempt to interfere in China's  internal affairs."  Declaring that "foreign statesmen will surely  make mistakes" if they base their "understanding" on the words of  a "tiny number of Chinese," he went on to indicate that the  failure to renew China's MFN status would have strategic  consequences as China's "development and growth" are an  "important factor contributing to world peace."     While reemphasizing the alleged risks in the strategic sphere,  Beijing has also continued to warn of the negative economic  consequences that could arise if MFN is not renewed.  During his  visit to the United States in early May, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua,  according to Xinhua, repeatedly warned of the potential for  negative economic fallout.  A 3 May Xinhua report, for example,  said that Zou told U.S. businessmen on the 2d that a "long term  stable and harmonious environment" is necessary for economic and  trade cooperation.  He reportedly went on to note that because of  the annual debate over MFN, the United States-is "not as  advantageously placed" as the Europeans and the Japanese, warning  that there will be "serious damage" to the economics and trade of  both countries if MFN is not granted.  Providing further evidence  of the potential for negative economic consequences, Chinese  media continue to routinely quite American corporate executives  concerning the losses their companies will face if China's MFN  trading status is not renewed.     Complications     China's efforts to demonstrate progress on Washington's criteria  for MFN renewal this year are being undercut by concerns about  domestic stability that have led the leadership to take a number  of steps that are at odds with Beijing's attempt to project an  image of compliance.  Even as China has been releasing some  prominent jailed dissidents, Western media have been reporting  that new arrests are being made.  For example, on the same day  that Xinhua announced the release of Zhang Ruiyu, the French  press agency AFP reported that Yang Zhou became the fifth  Shanghai dissident to be arrested in recent weeks (12 May).  Moreover, the National People's Congress Standing Committee,  during a 5-12 May session, amended the 1986 "Regulations for  Controlling and Punishing Public Offenses," which judging by the  text carried by Xinhua on 13 May, provides new legal  justifications for detaining China dissidents.     Outlook     Now that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has put  forward his assessment of Beijing's progress in meeting the  conditions of the 1993 executive order, Beijing will probably  refrain from any new steps that could negatively influence the  President's final decision.  However, as pointed out in a 23 May  editorial carried by the PRC-owned Hong Kong daily Ta Kung Pao,  China's domestic security concerns will continue to take priority  over meeting Washington's requirements on MFN renewal.  In an  unusual public acknowledgement of the link between the  leadership's preoccupation with social stability and the MFN  issue, the editorial stressed that, while Beijing desires better  ties with Washington, China will "not abandon-its sovereignty or  sacrifice social stability to meet U.S. demands" to gain MFN  renewal.

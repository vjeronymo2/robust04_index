"These enterprises will become independent legal entities  under the leadership of the boards of directors. They are  required to be independent in economic operation, assume sole  responsibility for their profits and losses and produce goods  according to market demand goods," said Zhou Gulian, chairman of  the provincial Commission for Economic Restructuring.    Other enterprises are being encouraged to follow suit, Zhou  noted.    A survey showed that Anhui made some progress last year in  reforming the enterprise system.    A number of state enterprises have already tried out the  share-holding system by combining the change of the enterprise  operational system with the establishment of a modern enterprise  system, thus enhancing their vitality and paving a way for the  reform of this year.    According to Wang Xiuzhi, deputy governor of the province,  Anhui will strive this year to expand to 100 the number of key  enterprises trying out the share-holding system. That would  cover 20 percent of the province's total.    It will encourage three to five key state enterprises to  issue shares to the public and select one to compete for the  national experiment in the modern enterprise system.    The province plans to lease or sell medium-sized and small  state enterprises with poor economic results.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: Black Thursday for troubled Finnish banks - Losses across the sector could be as high as Dollars 2bn WITH as many as five of the banks in Finland's troubled financial sector due to report their eight-month results, it is little wonder that today has already been christened 'Black Thursday' by Finnish news-papers. The fact that so many banks are announcing together is as unprecedented as the size of the losses they are likely to reveal. Nor is it any coincidence that the announcements are being made together - several of the banks have planned to release their figures earlier, and have postponed them for fear of being first with the bad news. There is no doubt that the figures will be dreadful. 'The losses will be huge,' says Mr Jari Eklund, analyst with KOP Investment Research. 'Even the best bank is in a bad situation,' he explains. One estimate is that losses across the banking sector will be as high as FM10bn (Dollars 2.15bn) this year - double last year's level - prompting suggestions that the government may have to re-emphasise its determination to support the sector. The performance of Finland's two leading banks, Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP) and Unitas, the holding company for the Union Bank of Finland, will be the main focus of interest. But a broader picture of the scale of the crisis will emerge from the results of Skopbank, which had to rescued by the Bank of Finland last year, STS and Okobank. Of the five, Skopbank is expected to announce the biggest losses, and only Okobank is thought to have any chance of reporting a profit. The banks' problems stem directly from Finland's economic difficulties, and in particular are being caused by credit losses and narrow margins. The situation has deteriorated steadily throughout the year, exacerbated by Finland's high real interest rate levels and an increasing number of bankruptcies, and there is no indication yet that the worst is over. Non-performing loans continue to rise. The government has already provided a FM28bn support package for the sector, comprising FM8bn in preference capital and a FM20bn guarantee fund. This may be enough to get the banks through this year, and even next, but many believe it will not be enough. 'The final figure could be twice that amount,' according to Mr Eklund. All the main banks, apart from Unitas, have already applied for a preference capital injection from the government and Unitas is thought likely to do so before the year end. In the current austere environment, it is difficult to see where relief is going to come from. Interest rates are coming down slowly, but they need to fall much further before customers are enticed back and margins improve. There is considerable tension between the banks, which want lower interest rates, and the Bank of Finland, which wants a tight monetary policy to enhance the country's credibility before the markka's exchange rate is fixed again. Mr Vesa Vainio, chief executive of Unitas, says that for the banks' situation to improve there need to be changes in the broader business environment. He rejects suggestions that the main cause of the problems is the easy lending that took place in the 1980s. 'The problems now are high interest rates and lack of demand from our customers. We have to get new decisions which will change the business environment. It's a must,' he states. The banks are doing what they can by way of rationalisation and staff cuts to enhance profitability. KOP, for example, plans to cut 10 per cent of its staff this year. Unitas will have reduced its staff to 8,500 by the end of the year, 2,000 fewer than in 1987. This is just one aspect of a broader restructuring, through mergers and branch closures, which is thought to be inevitable in what many consider to be an over-banked country. This is one reason why there was some surprise when Unitas pulled out of talks to buy Skopbank from the government's guarantee fund earlier this week. The worry for the government is not just the persistent air of crisis in the banking sector, but its impact on the budget deficit and the additional pain which will be inflicted on the Finnish population by a new package of cuts. Comparisons are made by Finnish bankers between their difficulties and the crisis in Norwegian banking. But there is one big difference: the Finns do not have income from an oil industry to bail them out. In Finland, the taxpayer will end up footing the bill.</p>

The possibility that, in a few days, the bacteria  may ``swim'' downstream to the area near Moscow has not been  ruled out.    Laboratory studies of water samples are now being conducted.  The analysis results will be known today. For now, medical  personnel are puzzling over the riddle of how the bacteria got  into the Protva. If it came from the ``closed'' institutes that  were long involved in developing biological and chemical  weaponry on the river's shore, it is entirely possible that the  study bacteria are causative agents of a disease even more  frightening than mortally dangerous cholera.</p>

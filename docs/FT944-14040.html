			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / UK Company News: VW absorbs Seat UK to complete British revamp Volkswagen, the leading European vehicle maker, is to consolidate all its vehicle importer/distributor operations in the UK through the takeover of Seat UK by VAG (UK), which already controls the VW, Audi and Skoda brands. Seat UK, a subsidiary of the VW group's Spanish subsidiary, is to become a fourth franchise division of VAG (UK). It will continue to operate as a separate franchise with an independent dealer network, and a distinct product range and marketing and pricing structure. The aim was to achieve 'operating efficiencies in all the central support functions' of the different franchises, Seat UK said. Mr Stan Cholaj, managing director, said it was expected that the Seat operations would be transferred 'within a year' from Crawley to Milton Keynes, where VAG UK has its headquarters. The takeover of Seat UK by VAG (UK) will be the final step in the consolidation of the VW group's UK operations, which have undergone a far-reaching restructuring in the past two years. Volkswagen acquired VAG UK, the British importer of VW and Audi vehicles, from Lonrho, the international trading group, early last year. VAG (UK) took over the management of Skoda Automobile UK, which imports cars from VW's Czech subsidiary, in January. Financial services for the four franchises have been merged under the management of Volkswagen Financial Services (UK), and parts distribution has also been brought under central management. VAG (UK) has also set about separating dealer franchises, with sales and marketing groups for each brand. Mr Richard Ide, managing director of VAG UK, said this process would be completed by early 1997, by which time there would be some 170 Audi dealerships with separate showroom facilities from the VW brand. The VW dealer network will total about 300.</p>

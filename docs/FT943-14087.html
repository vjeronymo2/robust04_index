			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Emu unlikely this century, says Vranitzky The European Union's project for forging economic and monetary union (Emu) by the end of the century will be 'very hard to fulfil', according to Mr Franz Vranitzky, the Austrian chancellor. Speaking during a visit to London this week, Mr Vranitzky took a cautious line on the prospect of deepening political and monetary integration in the EU, which Austria is due to join on January 1. Mr Vranitzky, whose country closely follows Germany in its monetary policies, said the EU should wait until after 1999 to establish Emu with a relatively large number of member states. This would avoid the danger of a 'two-track' Europe - a development that would emerge if Emu went ahead with a smaller group. He said the 1996 intergovernmental conference planned to review the Maastricht treaty should discuss 'a new institutional framework' for the EU. But he indicated the practical consequences might be limited to a stronger role for the European parliament and 'more flexibility in decision-making'. Asked whether Austria's neutrality would allow it to join a common European security arrangement, he confirmed Austria's interest in participating in 'a system of collective security' but made clear this would not necessarily entail a commitment to provide troops for any possible EU actions against 'peace-breakers' in foreign conflicts. Austria would decide 'case by case' whether support for EU security moves would involve the dispatch of troops or more 'technical' measures  - logistic support or help with arms supplies. Mr Vranitzky explained his caution about Emu partly by drawing attention to problems of 'psychology' in replacing national currencies by a single European currency. 'Austrians would definitely find it hard to see it (the schilling) eliminated in a short space of time,' he said. He added that this sentiment was similar to that seen in Germany and the UK about the possible replacement of the D-Mark or sterling. He said establishing a monetary union 'that deserves the description' would require 'a minimum number of countries' as participants. 'I would prefer a larger number of countries. Otherwise we could arrive at a kind of two-track integration process, which would not be an optimal development.' The number of countries likely to fulfil the Emu economic convergence criteria laid down by the Maastricht treaty was likely to remain rather low by the end of the century. As a result, he said, 'I really do think it will be necessary to talk about monetary union later than 1999.' Mr Vranitzky made his comments even though the Maastricht treaty rules out any minimum number of EU states in 1999 as participants in monetary union. In theory, this means that as few as two or three EU members could launch Emu from that date, provided they fulfil the convergence criteria. Austria is one of the few European countries which currently come close to meeting all the criteria on inflation, interest rates, public sector debt and budget deficits. Although Austria does not participate in the European Monetary System, the schilling's central exchange rate against the D-Mark has remained unchanged since the system started in 1979.</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: BES from Close Brothers - At a glance Close Brothers has launched a BES scheme, BESSA CARE, which allows a non-recourse loan after six months or 12months. This means top-rate taxpayers effectively pay 60p after tax, and receive 72p after six months, and 76p after 12months. The loans are provided by the Bank of Ireland. The company will buy two nursing homes for Associated Nursing Services. However, John Spiers, of BESt Investment points out that the return for investors after five years is low - Pounds 1.10 1/2 p for every Pounds 1 spent before tax - and so suggests it should only be taken up by those who wish to take the early loan. The scheme is unsuitable for basic rate taxpayers.</p>

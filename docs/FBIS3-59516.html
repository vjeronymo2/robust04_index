It proposed the elaboration (in concert with  industrialists) of an aeronautical research programme as well as  the definition of modalities for financing, follow-through and  control and distribution of results. Industrialists, the States  and the Union are invited to carry out joint strategic  reflection in order to give fresh impetus to this industry. The  EP [European Parliament] considers that it would also be  necessary to:    a) pursue and intensify the aid programme for reconversion  of  armaments industries (KONVER) and integrate the major military  programmes in the appropriate European structures;    b) launch training and re-training programmes;    c) speed up harmonisation of norms of industrial and  regulatory industrial techniques, and create a single authority  to oversee the functioning of the unified air transport market.    The EP also calls for competition policy with regard to  merger or takeover operations to be adjusted to the needs of  industry on the world market. The Commission must ensure that  this practice does not entail a monopolistic situation. The EP  considers that, given the European structure of these  industries, it is appropriate to speed up the establishment of  representative staff bodies at European level. The situation of  the aeronautics industry is not dramatic, said the Rapporteur,  despite some structural weakness (companies operate in an  over-national way), the vulnerability due to dependence on an  often volatile dollar, and the prospect of massive job losses  (150 000 by the end of the century). Mr Fuchs (France) said on  behalf of the Socialist Group that the opinion that the criteria  on merger and concentration control in the aeronautics sector  should not be (as the European Commission thinks) respect of  competition but the maintenance of European competitiveness. In  the future, Mr Fuchs believes, there may be only two or three  large companies at European level. Markets are too fragmented,  said Mr. Siso Cruellas (Spain) for the EPP [European People's  Party], while Mrs. Minardi (France) defended, on behalf of Left  Unity, the maintenance of national industries. If there is no  specific R&amp;D programme for the aeronautics industry, it is  because it benefits from certain aspects of the 4th research and  development framework programme, said Mr. Bangemann on behalf of  the European Commission. Furthermore, he does not agree with Mr.  Fuchs on the need to maintain a public service: privatised  industry could be more effective than national monopolies. A  working group is currently studying the means to make it  possible to compensate for the dollar's volatility (for example,  through insurance policies taken out by companies). Concerning  the military aspects of this industry, the Member States are  reluctant to grant a role to the Community as such in this  domain, concluded Mr. Bangemann.</p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STEPPED-UP DRUG WAR TO FOCUS ON S.D. BORDER;  </P> <P> BUSH PLAN: QUESTIONS REMAIN AS TO HOW RESOURCES WILL BE ALLOCATED AMONG BORDER  REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA, ARIZONA, NEW MEXICO AND TEXAS.  </P> <P> For San Diego and the rest of the U.S.-Mexican border area, President's Bush's  $10.6-billion anti-drug plan foresees the hiring of hundreds of new Customs  officers and Border Patrol agents, the expansion of the U.S. immigration  checkpoint near San Clemente, and the improvement of drug-detection  capabilities at and between ports of entry.  </P> <P> It remains unknown, however, how the new resources will be allocated among the  border regions of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas that make up a  so-called "high-intensity drug trafficking" area that stretches for almost  2,000 miles. The border is one of five such designated zones nationwide, along  with Los Angeles, New York, Miami and Houston.  </P> <P> The San Diego area, like other border regions, is a major conduit both for  undocumented immigrants and for illicit drugs entering the United States from  Mexico.  </P> <P> Adding to the uncertainty of the much-ballyhooed anti-drug initiative is the  fact that the Administration's proposals are subject to revision by Congress,  which controls the government's purse strings. Whatever package emerges from  Capitol Hill, results will be far from immediate: Only $25 million of the  multibillion-dollar package is definitely scheduled to be used during the  current fiscal year; most of the funds will be available in the fiscal year  that begins Oct. 1.  </P> <P> According to the President's plan, border lawmakers and officials, the program  includes:  </P> <P> * The hiring of 175 new officers for the U.S. Customs Service to improve  inspections at ports of entry, such as the giant facility at San Ysidro, which  is billed as the world's busiest international crossing. In addition, the  Administration plans to seek $5 million for 23 additional teams of  drug-sniffing Customs dogs. The Administration is also attempting to modernize  Customs equipment to help improve identification of false documents and  suspected criminals.  </P> <P> * The hiring of 174 new agents and 26 new support staff for the U.S. Border  Patrol, the uniformed enforcement arm of the U.S. Immigration and  Naturalization Service. Border Patrol staffing has been declining since a  hiring freeze was imposed in late 1988. The agents play a key role in deterring  drug trafficking, particularly in the sometimes-vast areas between legal ports  of entry.  </P> <P> * The improvement and expansion of border-area fencing, ground sensors and  other equipment, plus the completed expansion of the Border Patrol checkpoint  along Interstate 5 near San Clemente. U.S. authorities have long sought a  broadening and modernization of that facility, which is considered a key  enforcement tool on the main route from the border to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The President's plan also envisions additional military assistance for border  law enforcement, although few details were provided. The Administration would  also like to increase by 1,000 slots the amount of detention space available  for so-called "criminal aliens" -- foreigners convicted of drug-related and  other crimes.  </P> <P> All told, officials said, Bush's blueprint anticipates that perhaps 700 new  federal officers will be assigned to the border region beginning late this  year, including agents from Customs, the Border Patrol and the Drug Enforcement  Administration, among others. The border region would presumably receive some  of the 75 new federal judgeships called for under the Bush plan.  </P> <P> Under that plan, the border area and the four other target zones will get  increased funding two ways: first, through a yet-undetermined split of the $25  million that is to be distributed this year; that should be augmented with up  to $21 million more from drug-related cash and other assets seized by federal  authorities and plowed back into the anti-drug effort.  </P> <P> Secondly, the vast majority of drug-fighting funds will be allocated through  increases in the regular federal budget for law enforcement agencies, treatment  programs and the like.  </P> <P> In the second category, the Los Angeles area is expected to receive $169  million in fiscal year 1991, 11% more than the current $151 million.  </P> <P> Officials of the nation's "high-intensity" areas have questioned whether a  special $25-million fund to be shared this year would be sufficient to make  much impact.  </P> <P> Hours after Bush outlined his plan, a group of police officers at one of Los  Angeles' drug "supermarkets" wondered whether any of it would filter down to  them. "Most of all, we need new radios," said Sgt. Dave Cullen, part of a Los  Angeles police narcotics crew making one of its periodic sweeps through  MacArthur Park.  </P> <P> Although few details were given of the benefits that target areas can expect,  officials said 300 additional agents and support personnel will likely be added  to Los Angeles offices of federal agencies such as the Drug Enforcement  Administration and Customs Service.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Paul Lieberman and Jocelyn Stewart contributed to this  article.  </P></p>

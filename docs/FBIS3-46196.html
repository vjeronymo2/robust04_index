The urban abortion rate is higher than that of the  countryside, the poll by the All China Women's Federation said.    In Shanghai, 41 percent of the women have had abortions at  least once. In Beijing, close to 35 percent had had them, and  there is a growing trend for non-married women to abort, the  newspaper said.    Not all of the poll results were published.    The strict control over the birth rate in China since the  beginning of the 1980s, limiting the number of births to 14  million per year, has led to a strong surge in abortions,  sometimes late in the pregnancy.    Official family planning permits only one child per urban  couple but, in general, two for rural parents.    Of the women questioned, 88 percent said that abortion had  greater consequences on a woman's health than on her reputation,  but at least two-thirds said they would not like their  colleagues and friends to know they had had an abortion.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> M. Additional Guidance_FDA Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guide Including Specific Guidance on Smoked Fishery Products <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As an adjunct to its rulemaking to require HACCP procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the seafood industry, FDA is drafting an extensive guidance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for processors to use in understanding and implementing HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principles for their operations. This guidance will provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information that processors and importers can use in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of their HACCP plans. This information consists  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> largely of an identification of hazards that can affect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety of seafood and a review of control measures that can keep  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the hazards from actually occurring, or that can at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimize the likelihood of their occurrence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has included selected portions of the draft HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance as Appendix 1 to this proposal, so as to better inform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the public about how this guidance will be structured and about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the kinds of assistance that will be available to processors and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importers who implement HACCP. The agency emphasizes, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this guidance is a work-in-progress and still being developed by FDA. Nonetheless, the agency seeks comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need for this guidance and the usefulness of the format the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency proposes to adopt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, FDA is including in Appendix 1 specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance on time-temperature and salinity parameters and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matters for use in the HACCP plans of processors of smoked and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smoke-flavored fishery products. While FDA is seeking comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the guidance generally, it particularly seeks comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance on smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products. Material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relevant to the safe processing of smoked and smoke-flavored  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fishery products is found in various sections of the HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance because this general guidance is primarily organized by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazard rather than by commodity type. However, the agency has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gathered the materials relating to smoked and smoke-flavored  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fishery products into a single section of the guidance to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilitate use of this guidance by this industry, and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilitate obtaining public comment on it. As stated above, FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seeks public comment on the appropriateness of the materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relating to smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance, on their validity as guidelines, and on whether they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be made mandatory by incorporating them into any final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation that results from this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While no known outbreaks of botulism attributed to smoked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fish have been reported since 1963, FDA believes that the failure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by manufacturers to obtain information about the composition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hot- and cold-process products represents a potential health hazard. Without analytical results from the testing for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water-phase salt and sodium nitrite levels, a manufacturer cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether the fish have been adequately processed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inhibit  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. botulinum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> spore outgrowth and toxin production. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's concerns are underscored by the diversity of processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperatures and salt levels used in the manufacture of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products, particularly the lower range temperatures and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water-phase salt levels (Ref. 24).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, as stated above, the use of modified atmosphere and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vacuum packaging with smoked and smoke-flavored fish products is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also a source of concern. These types of packaging provide an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anaerobic environment in which <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  C. botulinum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  spores can grow out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and produce botulin, the causative agent in botulism. When  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumed, the toxin attacks the central nervous system and may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause death if untreated within 3 to 6 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For all these reasons, FDA has tentatively concluded that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some type of guidance that defines the procedures for the safe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing of smoked and smoke-flavored fish is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historically, fish have been smoked in order to preserve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them. Today, the primary reason for smoking is to impart certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taste and texture qualities to the fish. There are essentially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two types of smoked fish: (1) Those that are subjected to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``cold process'' that leaves the fish soft and moist, with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delicate smoke flavor, such as lox, and (2) those that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subjected to a ``hot process'' that produces a less moist, firmer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product with heavier smoke flavor, such as smoked whitefish.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Brussels to probe professions THE European Commission's competition directorate is to examine the collective fixing of fees, advertising restrictions and limitations placed on entry to the professions, Mr Claus- Dieter Ehlermann, director general of DG IV, the competition directorate said yesterday. He told the Board of Chartered Accountants in Business conference in Bristol, he endorsed stronger competition within professions in the European Community. He questioned whether rules of entry to curb membership were acceptable if free access offered no threat to a profession's reputation or the public interest. He raised doubts over different practices between member states for authorising inter-professional associations; the need for compulsory membership of professional orders; and the adequacy of self-regulation. Mr Ehlermann laid down five principles underlying competition within the professions reflected in the European Commission's work to date: whether restrictions on competition in professions are justifiable or excessive; that national laws should not affect the application of EC competition rules; that collective fixing of fees or charges should be banned; that international cooperation is viewed favourably as long as it does not reserve national markets for national practitioners; that restrictive practices with mainly national impacts be left to the national authorities or courts to determine.</p>

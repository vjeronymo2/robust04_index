			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / International Company News: Lend Lease improves on good MLC performance LEND LEASE Corporation, the Australian property and financial services group, yesterday announced a 6.5 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 171m (USDollars 122.4m) for the year to June 30, largely reflecting a strong performance by its MLC Life insurance subsidiary. Mr Stuart Hornery, chairman, said MLC Life, Australia's third largest life insurance company, paid a 70 per cent franked dividend of ADollars 103m, against ADollars 82m last time. Overall, retail financial services contributed ADollars 109m to the result, equivalent to 55 per cent of group net profit, up from 45 per cent previously. Lend Lease said the contribution from property services fell to ADollars 62m, equivalent to 32 per cent of group profits, from ADollars 79m (43 per cent) the previous year. The group has made provisions of ADollars 40m against its commercial property portfolio, compared with ADollars 72m the previous year. Total provisions stand at ADollars 144m. The result was struck after an abnormal loss of ADollars 18m, mostly relating to property write-downs, against an abnormal gain of ADollars 12m last time. But the impact on net profits was offset by a tax credit of ADollars 6.65m relating to a tax audit for the four years to 1990. Lend Lease declared a fully franked final dividend of 33 cents, against 32 a year earlier, making a total of 73 cents against 71 cents. The shares closed unchanged at ADollars 15.90.</p>

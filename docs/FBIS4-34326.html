			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Morning Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] Cuba's problems are economic, and the solutions we  need are of an economic nature. This is why the reforms are  made within our political system without being associated with  any transformation, said Carlos Lage, executive secretary of the  Cuban Council of Ministers, during an interview published today  in the Spanish daily EL PAIS.    Lage indicated that it is possible to improve the Cuban  political system, however, not through elections in a multiparty  system. The Cuban leader explained that the Caribbean nation is  being flexible in its economic model and is willing to make the  necessary changes, but not by moving toward capitalism, rather  by consolidating an efficient socialist economy.    When questioned about groups of Cubans who are in the  Belgium  and German embassies and the Chilean consulate here in Havana,  Carlos Lage said that occupying a diplomatic mission is not the  way to leave Cuba because the country grants permits to whoever  requests them. Moreover, he reiterated that the sole solution  to the conflict is for those people to leave the buildings they  are occupying with the government's guarantee that there will be  no reprisals against them.</p>

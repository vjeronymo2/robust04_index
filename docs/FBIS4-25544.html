			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "News 7" program] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa met with Chinese  counterpart Qian Qichen in Beijing this afternoon, and discussed  North Korea's alleged nuclear development. In the meeting,  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen noted that China is calling for  North Korea's self-restraint from fruitless military conflicts,  stressing that concerned nations should seek a settlement of the  problem through consultations to the end.    The Japan-China foreign ministerial meeting was held at the  Diaoyutai State Guesthouse for over two hours. In the meeting,  Foreign Minister Kakizawa expressed great expectations for  China's role in the North Korean issue, asking it to persuade  North Korea to reopen dialogue with the international community.    On that ground, Foreign Minister Kakizawa requested China  not  to use its veto when the UN Security Council [UNSC] discusses  sanctions against North Korea, noting China's positive role is  very important in the UN process to determine its stance,  including sanctions.    In response, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said that the  Chinese Government is greatly concerned over the present  circumstances of the problem.    [Begin recording of reporter Tadanobu Sakamoto in Beijing]  Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen expressed the Chinese  Government's great concern over the present circumstances of the  North Korean nuclear issue. He then clarified that China is  trying its best to persuade North Korea to refrain from  fruitless military conflicts. On the other hand, he indirectly  showed China's negative stance toward UN sanctions, saying  sanctions cannot be effective right now and the issue should be  settled through consultations to the end.    However, the Japanese delegation is paying attention to the  fact that Foreign Minister Qian Qichen did not clearly say China  would oppose UN sanctions because this is seemingly the first  change in China's official stance toward the issue.    The Japanese Government views China may not use its veto  when  the UNSC is forced to impose sanctions against North Korea.  Hereafter, the government intends to strengthen its approach to  China in close cooperation with the United States and the ROK.  [end recording]</p>

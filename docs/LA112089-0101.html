			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Q&amp;A: ALAN BERNSTEIN;  </P> <P> THE PROFESSIONALS' SALESMAN;  </P> <P> HIS PITCH: TEACHING DOCTORS AND LAWYERS THEIR BUSINESS  </P> <P> While doctors, lawyers and other professionals are highly educated, most are  greenhorns when it comes to knowing how to promote their businesses.  </P> <P>  There was once a time when professionals didn't need to know the fine arts of  marketing and advertising. State laws and the rules of professional  associations prohibited many from selling themselves.  </P> <P>  But that all changed in 1977 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that neither  states nor professional associations may legally prevent professionals from  advertising. A new, more competitive era had dawned, and Costa Mesa businessman  Alan Bernstein stepped in to help.  </P> <P>  In 1979 he left his position as director of marketing for the American Heart  Assn. in Los Angeles to co-found the Practice Builder. With Paul Brosche,  former vice president of marketing for Bekins, he launched a pioneering effort  to teach marketing strategy to professionals.  </P> <P>  Bernstein's firm includes an advertising agency with a client list of 400  practices and a monthly newsletter with 10,000 subscribers, who also receive  free marketing advice over a telephone hot line. The company, which employs 30  people, also conducts about 22 marketing workshops a year for professionals  nationwide.  </P> <P>  In a recent interview with Times Staff Writer Leslie Berkman, Bernstein said  professionals should carefully choose where they open new practices and advised  that they set goals for the growth of their practices and allocate marketing  budgets sufficient to achieve them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Q. How did you get into the business of teaching doctors, lawyers and other  professionals how to sell their services?  </P> <P> A. While I was director of marketing for the American Heart Assn. in Los  Angeles, a friend of mine who taught in the business school at Pepperdine came  to me and said he had a Long Beach dentist in his management class who kept  asking questions about marketing. He said perhaps I could sit down and talk  with him. So I did and one thing led to another and I took him on as an  after-hours client.  </P> <P> Q. What did you advise him to do?  </P> <P> A. I didn't suggest that he do anything fancy. Just some basic things like  asking patients to refer other people to him if they felt good about his  treatment. And he started communicating regularly with his patients through  direct mail to remind them about checkups and to tell them about new  developments in dentistry. He also started advertising in the newspaper and  using coupon advertising through the mail.  </P> <P> In 18 months we took his practice from a $250,000-a-year business to an  $850,000-a-year business. This was easy and I thought if I could do it for one  dentist, I could probably do it for 50. So I left the heart association and  opened a consulting group in Newport Beach. And we must have been doing  something right, because within six months we had over 100 clients.  </P> <P> Q. Is direct mail to clients and patients an important marketing tool for  professionals?  </P> <P> A. Yes. We call it internal prospecting. We generally advise that four times a  year professionals should send mailings to existing clients and patients to  encourage repeat business.  </P> <P> Q. What is the content of the mailings?  </P> <P> A. In the case of a dentist, he could talk about new developments in cosmetic  dentistry such as new whitening agents for teeth. You might want patients to  know that you are introducing orthodontics into a practice, which is something  that a lot of general dentists are doing. And there is a new emphasis on  prevention of gum disease.  </P> <P> Q. Is the purpose to let patients know that their dentist is up to date?  </P> <P> A. That's one of the very specific purposes. And secondly to tell people why he  is doing these things. To convey the message that he is caring. Also, it gives  the professional another opportunity to ask for more referrals.  </P> <P> We also have a strategy to prod patients who haven't come in a long time for  checkups. We use direct mail, followed 30 days later by a telephone call if  there is no response. Some people don't go to the dentist or optometrist  regularly simply because nothing hurts. So we tell people the consequences. For  instance, that if you are over 40 and don't have an eye exam on a yearly basis  you could develop glaucoma, which is asymptomatic and basically irreversible.  </P> <P> Q. Beyond the relaxing of restrictions on advertising, are there other reasons  why today's professionals need marketing skills more than they did 10 or 15  years ago?  </P> <P> A. Yes. The competitive pressures are greater today than ever before for a  professional. More graduates are coming out of professional schools and  practitioners are practicing longer. Basically, supply is out of kilter with  demand.  </P> <P> Q. Is the competition greater in Southern California than elsewhere?  </P> <P> A. My dad who is a retired dentist likes to say that the plate upon which the  continental United States sits has shifted and the East Coast rose and the West  Coast dipped and all the professionals rolled to within a mile of the beach.  </P> <P> But recently the continental plate rose again on the West Coast and a bunch of  professionals rolled back to the Midwest. So now you can go to the wheat fields  of Kansas and find an overabundance of practitioners. Graduates of professional  schools are beginning to spread out and so it is not uncommon now to find a lot  of competition these days even in small towns.  </P> <P> We tell clients to look for markets that are less competitive because they can  be more lucrative. For example, a young orthopedic surgeon decided that the  Fresno market was too crowded so he went to practice among agricultural workers  in the Central Valley. After three years, he has nine offices and grosses $3.3  million a year. I'd say he's doing fairly well.  </P> <P> Q. Why do professionals continue to open practices where the competition is  stiffest?  </P> <P> A. Oftentimes location decisions are not made with any kind of business  analysis. When someone decides to open a practice, really what he should do is  get a feel of the professional-to-population ratio for the area to see if it  can support his practice.  </P> <P> Q. It seems that professionals usually want to open offices in wealthy places  like Newport Beach and Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> A. They tend to go to wealthier areas because it reflects who they are. They  tend to be upper middle class in their values and they tend to like to  associate with other people who are upper middle class in values.  </P> <P> However, if you talk to practitioners who are located in blue-collar areas,  they tend to report greater levels of satisfaction with their practices.  Patients and clients in blue-collar areas are easier to deal with. Receivables  are less of a problem because you have more prompt payment and fewer bounced  checks. Also, professionals are not challenged as much about what they  prescribe in working-class communities. They are put up on a pedestal more.  </P> <P> Q. Do you ever suggest that professionals compete on the basis of price?  </P> <P> A. Not normally. The reason is if you are going to be a bare-bones operation  with lower prices overall, you have to be an extremely good manager because you  are dealing with high volume and very thin profit margins. Poor service to one  patient or client can erode a profit margin on a dozen patients or clients. So  it doesn't make sense for most practitioners who have no background in good  management to try to compete in that arena.  </P> <P> Q. Should professionals occasionally advertise discounts of their services?  </P> <P> A. What we have found is that if you simply promote a discount, you do yourself  a disservice. Over time the only thing the public tends to know about you is  you're the deal guy. The allure of it is that it does produce immediate cash  flow. But it harms your image in the long run.  </P> <P> It makes a lot more sense to promote the non-monetary reasons to come to a  practitioner. To talk about whether he or she has extended hours or has special  expertise in a particular kind of technique or caters more to families or  business people or has in-house financing. But you can also give the reader or  viewer of the advertising a low-risk way to try a bite-size piece of service.  </P> <P> Q. Do you mean a free evaluation or consultation for first-time patients or  clients?  </P> <P> A. Yes. For instance, psychotherapists and marriage and child counselors often  will not charge during the first visit, because you want to get to know each  other to see if the chemistry is right. They don't often promote this, although  I'd say the vast majority offer this kind of option. All you have to do is ask  for it.  </P> <P> Q. How much money should the average doctor spend on advertising and promotion?  </P> <P> A. They've got very poor rules of thumb, which are often set by their  accountants. Accountants will tell them to spend anywhere from 2% to 4% of  their gross collections on promotion.  </P> <P> But this is a very poor guideline. The amount spent on promotion should depend  on the goal for growth that the doctor has set for his practice. Also we want  to know what his current trend line is -- "is business increasing or  decreasing?" Then we tell him the budget needed to get to that goal. The people  we are working with spend up to 20% of their gross on promotion.  </P> <P> Q. I guess that promotion is not as accepted by professionals as it is by the  retail industry?  </P> <P> A. Not nearly. But the promotion budgets of the professionals we deal with have  been growing quite dramatically over the years. The key is that we track  everything we do so that our clients know what works and what doesn't. Like any  smart people, they want to go ahead and grow more. And they have developed  trust in us, so their budgets increase.  </P> <P> It is a lot nicer and a lot safer in many respects for a professional to invest  in his own business than to invest in something he can't control, like the  stock market for instance. They are plowing back profits into their businesses  and borrowing, sometimes taking second mortgages on their houses, to promote  their practices.  </P> <P> Q. If the public responds to an ad, what will assure repeat business? Doesn't  it depend a lot on how the professional treats his patients or clients?  </P> <P> A. We can't teach them that. People are intrinsically nice or they're not. They  are intrinsically happy or not. There are all kinds of small personality  variables which make people likeable or not.  </P> <P> Q. But isn't personality important to the success of a professional?  </P> <P> A. It's almost everything. People cannot differentiate the quality of a  practitioner. They read the bedside or chair-side manner as quality. We can  bring people into an office; we can't keep them there.  </P> <P> Q. What is the toughest market for professionals to promote themselves?  </P> <P> A. The toughest market tends to be right in the middle of big cities. The  reason is that if you are looking for greater expansion and you have to  advertise externally there are really very few affordable media alternatives.  Television and newspaper advertising is too expensive and covers too much  territory. So you go to direct mail. But direct mail is oftentimes also a very  expensive kind of medium. Generally you can't do it for less than 40 cents a  household.  </P> <P> By contrast, in Midland or Odessa, Tex., you could buy the whole radio market  for less than one ad in the L.A. Times. We bought inexpensive television  advertising there for a dental client and, bam, his practice went from zero to  a million bucks in one year.  </P> <P> Q. Physicians complain that the reimbursements from Medi-Cal are insufficient.  So do you have physicians coming to you to ask how they can attract more  private paying patients to their practices?  </P> <P> A. Yes.  </P> <P> Q. What can you do for them?  </P> <P> A. If you want to change to a suit-and-tie clientele from a Medi-Cal type of  practice, you are probably going to have to open up a whole new office.  </P> <P> Q. Do you mean that in some cases the doctors have actually had to close an  office and open someplace else to change their image?  </P> <P> A. Well, usually what happens is they don't close the office. They open a  second one in a higher-rent district where they are able to draw a more  affluent clientele.  </P> <P> Q. Can a doctor or dentist attract a better-heeled clientele by refurbishing  his waiting room?  </P> <P> A. Sometimes. But you have to be careful. I know a dentist near Leisure World  in Laguna Hills who put a lot of expensive-looking antiques in his waiting  room. He thought his patients would enjoy it. But he found a lot of people  started going to other dentists. They thought the place looked too expensive  and that he must be charging too much.  </P> <P> Q. So what did he do? Take all the antiques out?  </P> <P> A. Yes. You really have to be in tune with your primary market. You have to  think the way they think. You have to understand their feelings and the way  they look at the world. If you do that, you will always be successful, at least  from a marketing point of view.  </P></p>

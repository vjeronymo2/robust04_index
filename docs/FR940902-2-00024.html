			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By the terms of the proposed AOC, these PRPs will together pay $7,803,386.11 to the Hazardous Substance Superfund (Superfund). The $7,803,386.11 represents approximately 11.2% of the total anticipated costs for the Site upon which this settlement was based. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In exchange for payment, U.S. EPA will provide the settling parties with a covenant not to sue for liability under sections 106 and 107(a) of CERCLA, including liability for EPA past costs, the one-time cost of remedy, future EPA oversight costs, future operation and maintenance of the as-yet unselected remedy, and under section 7003 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended (also known as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amount that each individual PRP will pay, as shown above, equals $2.97 multiplied by the number of gallons of waste the party sent to the Site (Base Amount), plus a premium payment of either 30% or 120% of the Base Amount, as specified by each Respondent PRP in the AOC. The per gallon charge of $2.97 was calculated by dividing the total estimated response costs for the Site ($69,594.403) by the total estimated volume of waste disposed of at the Site (23,454,592 gallons). For parties paying a 30% premium, there is an exception to the covenant not to sue if total response costs at the Site exceed $69,594,403. If this amount were exceeded, EPA could sue these parties for all or a portion of the overage. For parties paying the 120% premium, the exception to the covenant not to sue does not apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, the public may submit comments to U.S. EPA relating to the proposed  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> settlement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of the proposed AOC may be obtained from Greg Phoebe (8HWM&hyph;SR), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, 999 18th Street, Suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2405, (303) 294&hyph;7036.

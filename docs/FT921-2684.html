			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Tokyo holds back from intervening in markets TOKYO share prices showed further weakness in opening trading early today, after Japanese authorities gave no sign of following past practice and intervening to revive the stricken market. Finance Ministry officials indicated instead they would rely on general monetary and economic policies to restore confidence eventually in the market and in the economy. 'This is now a free market,' an official said. 'We are not going to try any of the old tricks. They will not work.' With institutional selling continuing to put pressure on prices today, the Nikkei index finished the morning session down 317.67 points or 1.59 per cent at 19,599.96. Yesterday the index failed to regain the psychologically important 20,000 level, though it finished the day up 80.47 at 19,917.63. On Monday, the index fell through the 20,000 level to its lowest close for five years. The last time the index fell through this level in 1990 Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the finance minister, relaxed regulations to encourage investors to buy stock. This time, his successor, Mr Tsutomo Hata, has given no indication of making a similar move. The ministry's change of heart is a recognition that officials' power to manage markets has been undermined by liberalisation in the 1980s, including introduction of stock futures trading, admission of foreign companies and interest rate deregulation. It also a reflects a belief that even with support from stockbroking companies the ministry lacks financial resources to shore up equities. In the 1960s, the last bear market, officials encouraged broking companies to club together to maintain prices. Bankers ruffled, Page 30; Stock markets, Page 39</p>

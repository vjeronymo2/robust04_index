			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / The Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Ashdown says party 'near breakthrough' THE LIBERAL Democrats were on the verge of breakthrough to the political big time, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, said yesterday, as he underlined the strength of the party's base in the country. Speaking just ahead of the party's annual conference, Mr Ashdown highlighted a survey, published yesterday, which showed that the Liberal Democrats had established a decisive lead over the Conservatives in the south-west of England and were making inroads into Tory support in the south-east. The poll, by Mori for The Sunday Times, found that 46 per cent of those questioned in the south-west supported the Liberal Democrats, with only 30 per cent supporting the Tories. This is almost a reversal of the parties' positions at the general election. Mr Ashdown said he hoped the conference would demonstrate the party's maturity and ability to put across a clear message. He hoped its mood would be 'serious, workmanlike and determined to ensure that the position we now have, we hold'. While emphasising that the party's base support in the country as a whole was higher than it had ever been, he warned that Liberal Democrats still had a long way to go and much work to do to build on the achievements so far. His warnings against triumphalism were slightly undermined, however, by his own refusal, in a weekend newspaper interview, to rule out the possibility of his becoming prime minister. Yesterday he sought to play down the significance of that, saying that every party leader wanted to be prime minister. This week's debates are seen by Liberal Democrat strategists as an important opportunity for the party to communicate a distinctive political identity. This is seen as crucial to its ability to turn the protest votes it has been attracting into positive support. The aim is to concentrate on policies in areas such as taxation and employment, where the Liberal Democrats' ideas can be presented as more radical than those put forward by either of the other parties. Mr Ashdown said that 'opportunity' was at the heart of the party's message. 'The politics of the 1990s will be dominated by the party most able to offer opportunity to every citizen in the land.' He continued to resist suggestions that the Liberal Democrats were closer to Labour than to the Tories, insisting that British politics was now multi-dimensional. The party's co-operation with the government over the Maastricht bill demolished, he said, the idea that the Liberal Democrats were interested in creating a 'Lib-Lab' coalition. Proposals for a greenfield development tax were approved by delegates at the final conference of the English Liberal Democrats acting as a separate entity. The tax is aimed at discouraging the building of out-of-town hypermarkets and similar projects.</p>

			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RALLY HALTS BROAD SLIDE AS DOW FINISHES OFF 16  </P> <P> Stock prices finished broadly lower today, although a late-afternoon rally  trimmed the losses for the session.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 19.82 points on Monday,  fell 16.21 to 2,606.31.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 579 up, 895 down and 497 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 134.07 million shares, against 130.95 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index fell 1.02 to 182.33.  </P> <P> Trading activity was moderate, picking up the pace from Monday which was the  slowest trading day of the new year.  </P> <P> Stock prices had risen in three of the past four sessions after sinking for  most of the month of January.  </P> <P> Some analysts said today's decline was an indication that the market's broader  trend is still lower.  </P> <P> The prospect of rising interest rates has inhibited recent price gains, making  yields on short-term Treasury securities more competitive with those available  on stocks and dimming chances for corporate earnings growth.  </P> <P> Those worries grew more pronounced as the Treasury's auction of $30 billion in  new securities approached this week.  </P> <P> In the credit markets today, rates edged up on six-month Treasury bills while  yields on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to the 8.56% level from 8.53% late  Monday.  </P> <P> Bond prices fell in early trading today. The benchmark 30-year bond was down  3/8 point, or $3.75 per $1,000 face amount, around midday. Its yield rose to  8.57% from 8.53% late Monday.  </P> <P> Money market economists said traders were slightly skittish because of  uncertainty over the prospects for the Treasury Department auction of 10-year  and 30-year bonds Wednesday and Thursday.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight  loans, was quoted at 8 3/16%, down from 8 1/4% late Monday.  </P></p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Upturn forecast for construction THE construction industry should see an upturn in the second half of this year after three years of recession, according to the National Council of Building Materials Producers. But the improved outlook depends on the government maintaining public-sector investment at present levels, the council said yesterday. The recovery in private-sector activity was 'extremely fragile' and limited to new house construction. Overall construction output is forecast to decline by 1.5 per cent in 1993 to Pounds 29.6bn - after a 5.5 per cent decline last year - in spite of the prospects for improvement in the second half. The pace of recovery in 1994 and 1995 will be slow, says the council, with 1 per cent growth next year followed by a 2 per cent rise in 1995. The council says that significant orders for new public non-housing work in the first quarter of the year underlie the improved outlook for 1993. The main beneficiaries are in the areas of health, education and roads. It predicts output for this sector will rise 4 per cent to Pounds 4.8bn this year. But next year growth is expected to slow to 3 per cent, and output will fall by 2 per cent in 1995 because of the likely squeeze on exist-ing public spending pro-grammes. Mr Peter Roberts, chairman of the council's forecast panel, said that maintaining current spending plans in the November Budget is vital for the industry to sustain recovery and ensure positive growth in 1994 and 1995. The public sector accounts for 39 per cent of the industry's output. In the private housing sector, the council forecasts 'tentative optimism' with an estimated 135,000 houses starting construction this year. This compares with 119,800 last year, and a projected 150,000 in 1994 and 160,000 in 1995. Public-sector housing starts are forecast to decline from next year after strong growth in 1992 and 1993 as government funds for new housing associations are reduced. Output in the industrial sector is forecast to hold steady this year thanks to spending by the privatised utility companies. The commercial sector, depressed by the big surplus of offices and retail premises, remains the industry's black spot. After falling 23 per cent last year, output is forecast to fall a further 20 per cent this year to Pounds 3.93bn and another 10 per cent in 1994.</p>

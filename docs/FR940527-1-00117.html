Other Adjustments to the Average Standardized Amounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Recalibration of DRG Weights and Updated Wage Index_Budget Neutrality Adjustment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of the Act specifies that beginning in FY 1991, the annual DRG reclassification and recalibration of the relative weights must be made in a manner that ensures that aggregate payments to hospitals are not affected. As discussed in section II of the preamble, we normalized the recalibrated DRG weights by an adjustment factor, so that the average case weight after recalibration is equal to the average case weight prior to recalibration. While this adjustment is intended to ensure that recalibration does not affect total payments to hospitals, our analysis indicates that the normalization adjustment does not necessarily achieve budget neutrality with respect to aggregate payments to hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act specifies that the hospital wage index must be updated based on new survey data no later than October 1, 1990 and on an annual basis beginning October 1, 1993. This provision also requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that any updates or adjustments to the wage index must be made in a manner that ensures that aggregate payments to hospitals are not affected by the change in the wage index.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To comply with the requirement of section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of the Act that the DRG reclassification changes and recalibration of the relative weights be budget neutral and the requirement in section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act that the updated wage index be implemented in a budget neutral manner, we compared aggregate payments using the FY 1994 relative weights and the wage index effective October 1, 1993 to aggregate payments using the proposed FY 1995 relative weights and wage index. The same methodology was used for the FY 1994 budget neutrality adjustment. (See the discussion in the September 1, 1992 final rule (57 FR 39832).) Based on this comparison, we computed a budget neutrality adjustment factor equal to 0.997647. This budget neutrality adjustment factor is applied to the standardized amounts without removing the effects of the FY 1994 budget neutrality adjustment. We do not remove the prior budget neutrality adjustment because the statute requires that aggregate payments after the changes in the DRG relative weights and wage index equal estimated payments prior to the changes. If we removed the prior year adjustment, we would not satisfy this condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, we are proposing to continue to apply the same FY 1995 adjustment factor to the hospital-specific rates that are effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1994, in order to ensure that we meet the statutory requirement that aggregate payments neither increase nor decrease as a result of the implementation of the DRG weights and updated wage index. (See the discussion in the September 4, 1990 final rule (55 FR 36073).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Tajikistan Prime Minister </F> Abdudzhalil Samadov by OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent Yuriy  Kushko under the "Hello" rubric: "Going to the Ruble Zone with  a Tajik Ruble" -- date not given]    [Text] Whereas Russia and Belorussia [Belarus] have signed  a treaty on merging their money systems, in Tajikistan this  unification has been slowed down. Yuriy Kushko, OBSHCHAYA  GAZETA correspondent, turned to Tajikistan Prime Minister  Abdudzhalil Samadov for comments.    [Kushko] How correct is the report that during your meeting  with Aleksandr Shokhin in Moscow an agreement was reached on the  introduction of "banknotes with national symbols" in Tajikistan?    [Samadov] This matter was indeed discussed. Upon agreement  with the Russian Government such banknotes will be temporarily  introduced in our country. Tajikistan's order for printing them  has been placed with the Russian "Goznak" factory. We will  receive the first batch in May.    [Kushko] Can this money be seen as national currency?    [Samadov] No, it cannot. This will be a kind of a coupon  ruble to service our domestic trade.    [Kushko] You have repeatedly said that the collapse of  economic ties and civil war have pushed Tajikistan to the verge  of survival. Can it be that the current cash crunch will push  the Republic to the verge of death?    [Samadov] Presently we are on the brink of social upheavals  among certain sectors of the population. At the same time I  rule out the recurrence of civil war. Yes, it is hard, but we  all have to hold out for another couple of months.    [Kushko] According to the terms of Tajikistan's accession to  the ruble zone, Russia promised it a credit of 120 billion  rubles [R]. Has the agreement been adhered to and is this money  sufficient?    [Samadov] In all, we received around R70 billion. However,  the Republic's requirements in the first quarter alone were R174  billion, and just as much in the second quarter. But we  understand that Russia itself is short of money.    [Kushko] Does the introduction of the Tajik coupon ruble  mean that the idea of merging money systems has been given up?    [Samadov] This is a complex and protracted process, but it  cannot go on indefinitely. As for the Tajik side, we are ready  to walk our part of the way to the end. At the latest talks in  Moscow we firmly agreed with the Russian side that our money  systems will finally be merged.</p>

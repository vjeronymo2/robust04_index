			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Property The Department of Environment's review of commercial leases, coming to all good HMSO bookshops soon, could rattle the foundations of the UK property market. Like many British institutions, the standard 25-year lease, with its seemingly iniquitous upward-only rent reviews, has come under fire. The charge is that such leases are too rigid, unfairly weighted against the tenant and institutionalise inflation. Yet if they were changed, new property development would become riskier, given the unpredictability of future income. Rental and capital values would move together more closely and quickly transform property from a quasi-bond into a quasi-equity investment. Landlords would offset the increased risk by demanding higher initial rents or would simply stop developing marginal properties. The DoE's urban regeneration champions would hardly appreciate their colleagues' radicalism. The DoE would therefore be wise to conclude that the traditional lease is the worst form of commercial rental agreement apart from all the rest. Besides, it could argue that the market's invisible hand is already slowly shaping leases to new economic conditions. Leases are shortening to 10 or 15 years and often include break clauses. The abolition of confidentiality clauses would help encourage a less imperfect market. After all, markets work best where the information flow is free. If the government still worries that upward-only rent reviews stoke inflation, it could always recommend linking rents to the retail prices index, as happens in other European countries. That would provide another incentive for its own anti-inflationary policies.</p>

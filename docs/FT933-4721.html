			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK journalist sources probe BRITAIN was ordered yesterday to face a European human rights investigation over a court order that a journalist disclose his source of information, Reuter reports from Strasbourg. The European Commission of Human Rights examined a complaint by British journalist William Goodwin of The Engineer magazine that the 1989 order to hand over his notes, upheld on appeal by the House of Lords, violated his freedom of expression guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. The Commission declared Mr Goodwin's application admissible, meaning Britain will have to defend itself before the European Court of Human Rights unless the two sides reach a settlement. It was the second time in two days that Britain had been ordered to face the Strasbourg court. On Monday the Commission accepted a suit by relatives of three unarmed IRA terrorists shot dead by British commandos in Gibraltar in 1988. The Goodwin case concerns information the journalist obtained by telephone about the financial problems of an undisclosed company, which was seeking a loan. The company said the information came from a stolen draft of its confidential corporate plan and obtained a court order barring publication.</p>

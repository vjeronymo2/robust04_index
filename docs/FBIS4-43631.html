			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The final, unofficial results of the local  elections have been announced. Of the total 28 mayoral posts,  the National Unity Party [NUP] won 11, the Republican Turkish  Party [RTP] won seven, the Democratic Party [DP] won four, the  Communal Liberation Party [CLP] won two, and independent  candidates won three mayoralties. In Pasakoy [Asha], the DP and  NUP candidates received the same number of votes.    In the five big cities, NUP candidate Semi Bora was elected  mayor of Lefkosa [Nicosia], RTP candidate Oktay Kayalp mayor of  Gazimagosa [Famagusta], RTP candidate Sumer Aygin mayor of Girne  [Kyrenia], RTP candidate Kemal Emirzade mayor of Guzelyurt  [Morphou], and NUP candidate Mehmet Zafer mayor of Lefke  [Lefka]. [passage omitted]    Party leaders assessed the election results after their  announcement. In a statement over the telephone carried live on  Bayrak Television while the count was in progress, Hakki Atun,  DP leader and prime minister, said that it is very satisfactory  that the municipal elections were held in a democratic  atmosphere. Expressing the belief that democracy will be further  consolidated in the wake of these elections, Atun noted that the  new candidates will serve the people in the best manner in  cooperation with the government. He pointed out that the  existing draft bill granting more autonomy to the municipalities  will be enacted as soon as possible, adding that the local  administrations should increase their financial resources to  this end. Municipalities should offer the best service, and the  new bill will modernize their structure, Atun remarked,  stressing that the government will support the newly elected  local administrators in every possible way.    In a statement to TAK [Turkish Cypriot News Agency], Atun  declared that the local election results will not affect the  coalition government. Atun underlined that there is no reason  for the election results to affect the government. Noting that  his party is participating in municipal elections for the first  time, the DP leader said: We chose the candidates  democratically, and we must respect the results.    Also in a statement over the telephone carried live on  Bayrak  Television, Ozker Ozgur, RTP leader, state minister, and deputy  prime minister, declared that the RTP is emerging from the local  elections as the first party. Interpreting the outcome as  evidence of the Turkish Cypriot people's support for the  policies of the RTP, Ozgur remarked that this is also related to  the party's performance in the government. Ozgur said that he  expected these results because the RTP ministers in the  government worked hard and established a good dialogue with the  people over five months. In reply to a question, Ozgur declared  that the results will not affect the composition of the  government and added: We must continue the efforts toward  solutions to all our problems together with our people both on  the local and general level. Pointing out that his party  emerged successful from the local elections, Ozgur said that  this is the victory of democracy. Ozgur also said that  democracy has entered an irreversible process in north Cyprus.    NUP leader Dervis Eroglu, in a statement to Bayrak Radio and  Television, described the local elections as a success for his  party. Expressing the belief that the results will relay a  message to the coalition parties, Eroglu said: Given the  pressures applied both before and during the elections and the  current economic difficulties, our people will undertake certain  actions. He said that the NUP was successful despite this being  the first time it participated in elections as the opposition.  Eroglu charged that pressure was applied during the elections  and expressed the hope that such incidents will not occur in the  future. Noting that the country is currently experiencing an  economic crisis, Eroglu said that nothing is being done or  proposed to resolve these problems. He added: The people,  however, are making their own decision and are finally achieving  the results they want.    CLP leader Mustafa Akinci announced that he will resign as  party leader. In a statement on Bayrak Television in connection  with the election results, Akinci declared that he made this  decision in order to allow the full rehabilitation of the party.  Akinci explained that he was unable to implement this decision,  [word indistinct] Akinci said. He congratulated the newly  elected candidates. Akinci noted that as a deputy in  parliament, he will contribute in every possible way to the  contemporary, productive, and democratic development of  municipalities. Assessing the local elections, Akinci also said  that although the CLP increased its votes in several areas, it  was unable to receive sufficient votes to win the mayoral posts.</p>

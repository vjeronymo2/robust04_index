Addressing a meeting of the Association for Relations Across  the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) which opened here today, ARATS  President Wang Daohan said that his association was successful  in its work in 1993.    The association, a non-governmental body, serves to promote  contacts across the Taiwan Straits and the eventual  reunification of China.    Wang praised the "Wang-Koo" [Gu] meeting -- a meeting  between  him and Koo Chen-fu [Gu Zhenfu], chairman of the Straits  Exchange Foundation from Taiwan, held in Singapore last year.    "The meeting made it possible for high-ranking officials  across the straits to discuss matters for the first time in the  capacity of non-governmental officials," he said.    That meeting marked a "major historical step" in the across-  straits relations and a "new stage" in ARATS' work, he added.    Wang Daohan said that Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the  Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, and Vice-Premier Qian  Qichen have paid close attention to ARATS' work and have issued  instructions on its work.    He also expressed thanks to Chinese Vice-President Rong  Yiren  and to Wu Xueqian, vice-chairman of the National Committee of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, for  their contributions to the ARATS establishment and to its work.    He said that during the ongoing meeting, participants will  discuss ARATS' tasks in the new year and ways to improve ARATS'  work, so that the organization will be able to play a greater  role in promoting across-straits contacts and relations, and  achieving peaceful reunification of the motherland.    Wang expressed the belief that the deepening of the reform,  opening wider to the outside world and rapid and steady growth  of the economy in the mainland this year will certainly push  forward the across-straits relations in the direction of  peaceful reunification.    According to participants, Jing Shuping will no longer serve  as an ARATS vice-president on the grounds that he is now the  chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.  Instead he will serve as an ARATS adviser.    Zheng Hongye, chairman of the China Council for the  Promotion  of International Trade, will also serve as an ARATS adviser.</p>

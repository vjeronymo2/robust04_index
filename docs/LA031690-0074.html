			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOE ROTH -- A 20TH CENTURY MAN;  </P> <P> FILM: THE DIRECTOR OF 'COUPE DE VILLE' IS UNCONVINCED HE HAS A TALENT FOR  DIRECTING, SO HE'S HAPPY HE HAS A DAY JOB -- AS CHAIRMAN OF 20TH CENTURY FOX.  </P> <P> The Hard Rock Cafe was jumping. To celebrate an invitation-only screening of  Universal's new film, "Coupe de Ville," the chic West Hollywood eatery was  packed with Hollywood's finest -- actors, producers, agents and lawyers -- all  eager to meet one person.  </P> <P> Joe Roth.  </P> <P> Wherever the director of "Coupe de Ville" stopped on his zigzag course through  the restaurant, a crowd gathered. Shelley Long squeezed his hand and paid her  respects. Universal Pictures chief Tom Pollock offered hearty congratulations.  Directors Amy Heckerling and Neil Israel, both old Roth pals, gave the  41-year-old director affectionate hugs.  </P> <P> As he struggled toward the buffet table, Roth bumped into Billy Crystal, who  offered praise for "Coupe," which opened to mixed reviews last weekend  (Universal is broadening its run next Friday to about 150 theaters). Without  missing a beat, Roth impishly retorted: "How much are you lying?"  </P> <P> "Oh, maybe a little bit," Crystal said slyly, quickly adding: "Joe, you did  great."  </P> <P> Roth wasn't enjoying this regal treatment because the crowd here smelled a hot  new director. In fact, when Israel asked if he was eager to direct again, Roth  furiously wagged his head. "Oh no. No. No. I'm happy where I am. Whenever I  watch the movie, I keep saying, 'Thank God, I've got a job. I've got a job!' "  </P> <P> And what a job. Since August, Roth been the chairman of 20th Century Fox Films,  the first time a director has run a major studio in more than half a century.  </P> <P> But even Roth's new-found clout couldn't guarantee a successful celebration.  Just as the bash hit its stride, a phalanx of police burst into the room,  accompanied by a local fire marshal, who closed down the restaurant, citing  overcrowding.  </P> <P> As several burly firemen, wearing big yellow slickers, made their way through  the Hollywood crowd, Roth reluctantly headed outside, accompanied by his wife,  Donna. "Geez, what a party," he sighed, eyeing a fire truck parked at the curb.  "I never even got a burger."  </P> <P> Joe Roth's 20th Century Fox office doesn't have the palatial glaze of most  movie-mogul throne rooms. Sitting on a scuffed white couch, eyeing his most  distinctive office props -- a plain wooden desk and a mini-basketball hoop --  you get the feeling Fox hasn't wasted any money on decorator's fees for its new  film division chairman's office. Roth's shelves brim with pictures of his  family and a photo of his directorial idol, Preston Sturges, playing pool.  </P> <P> Roth's attention is focused on the wall near his desk, where a production chart  follows the flow of Fox film releases. The batting order gives you a pretty  good idea of Roth's strategy for turning around the slumping studio.  </P> <P> "The Adventures of Ford Fairlane," Andrew Dice Clay's first starring feature,  and "Die Hard II," the sequel to the 1988 box-office hit, are slated for June.  In July, the studio has a pair of high-profile sequels, "Young Guns II" (Roth  produced the original 1988 hit) and "The Exorcist III." Later in the fall, the  studio will deliver "Pacific Heights," starring Michael Keaton and Melanie  Griffith, followed by Tim Burton's "Edward Scissorhands," with "Predator II"  due at Christmas.  </P> <P> It's a fairly conventional production strategy -- an occasional offbeat film  mixed in with a hefty dose of brand-name sequels and distinctive movies made by  strong-minded directors. It reflects Roth's strategy during his two-year stint  running Morgan Creek Productions, where he sandwiched a daring thriller like  David Cronenberg's "Dead Ringers" between lowbrow crowd-pleasers like "Young  Guns" and "Major League."  </P> <P> Still, the question is inevitable. How much room does this formula leave for a  personal film that didn't have a top-name actor -- a picture like "Coupe de  Ville," which Roth directed for Universal before taking the job at Fox? How  much room would there be for Roth, whose previous directorial efforts were a  critically praised flop, "Streets of Gold," and the critically dismissed  "Revenge of the Nerds"?  </P> <P> "If the person who'd directed 'Streets' and 'Revenge' had come in here and said  I want to direct a $10-million film with no real stars, I'd probably say no,"  acknowledged Roth, an informal, candid man who dresses simply and has retained  his lean, high school athlete build. "On the other hand, would I have liked the  material? Would I have liked the cast? Yes. But is it an obvious sell? No."  </P> <P> But don't expect Roth to look for advice from Hollywood's entrenched market  research consultants, whom he has derisively dismissed as "voodoo makers."  </P> <P> "This business has become so driven by money and fear that it's become overly  reliant on testing and research," he said, his voice taking on a steely edge.  "It's an excuse. A crutch. Worst of all, it pits you against your instincts.  We've become so statistically driven that we can be ecstatic when we watch a  movie -- and get depressed when we get bad numbers a half-hour later. That's  crazy! The sheer, overwhelming data for 'War of the Roses' suggested it was not  going to be a hit. But it'll end up doing $85 million in the U.S. alone."  </P> <P> Paul Mazursky, who says he "lights candles for Joe every night" for making his  critically lauded, post-Holocaust romance, "Enemies, a Love Story," confirmed  this account.  </P> <P> "Joe loved 'Enemies' when he first saw it, but when the research people  screened it, it didn't get great numbers from a big chunk of the audience. And  Joe said to me, 'I love the movie more now than I did the first time I saw it.  Don't worry about the numbers -- I regard them as useless. They're for  advertising purposes alone. I wouldn't touch your movie.' "  </P> <P> The busy studio chief has green-lighted 16 films during his first seven months  at Fox. He projects that he'll make 22 movies this year and says he has a  mandate from Fox Inc. Chairman and CEO Barry Diller to make as many as 30 films  in 1991.  </P> <P> But what has really made Roth an object of intense industry curiosity is his  maverick status. The moguls who run Hollywood's other studios have all been in  place -- or key players in the system -- for more than a decade. Even David  Puttnam, when he took over Columbia, was a highly visible, Oscar-winning  producer. But as recently as 1987, before his Morgan Creek films began to  attract attention, Roth was a virtual unknown operating out of a small  trailer-office on the Fox lot.  </P> <P> "He's the first real outsider to run a studio in years," said Larry Gordon, a  leading producer who was one of Roth's predecessors running Fox. "He's not a  member of the club. Everyone else in town -- Eisner, Diller, Katzenberg,  Sheinberg, Daley, Semel, Pollock, Mancuso, Medavoy, Guber and Peters -- have  all been around for 20 years. But Joe's from a different crowd.  </P> <P> "When I go in to see those other guys, I'm going into combat, with my flak  jacket on. There's so much history there. But Joe doesn't carry all that  baggage around with him."  </P> <P> Still, industry skeptics remain surprised by Roth's swift ascent to executive  stardom. Before his brief stint at Morgan Creek, he had produced a batch of  largely undistinguished films, including teen hits ("Bachelor Party"), critic's  favorites ("The Stone Boy") and such forgettable flicks as "Americathon," "The  Final Terror" and "P.K. and the Kid."  </P> <P> "Give Joe two years," said one veteran producer. "Then we'll know whether the  hits he had at Morgan Creek were the result of being truly shrewd or just  lucky."  </P> <P> For now, Roth is trying to revive Fox's reputation with exhibitors by  delivering a host of star-driven films (like Bette Midler's "For the Boys") and  sequels.  </P> <P> "It's very competitive to get theaters," he said. "So they need to know that we  can bring them event films -- both for summer and for Christmas -- that will  generate audience interest. But I don't want to make what we call  'programmers.' You're not going to get people out of the house unless you make  stories that have a strong emotional hook. The kind of hook that if you had a  seismograph, it would cause a real blip."  </P> <P> But can Roth run a film studio without eventually getting removed from reality?  How long will it take before the cagey outsider becomes the complacent insider?  </P> <P> "I worry about that every day," he said. "I try to drive into this lot every  morning thinking as a producer, trusting my instincts. But it's hard. I wish I  could enjoy it more when people come over and tell me how much they liked my  movie.  </P> <P> "But you never know who's sincere and who's not. So one of the ways I guard  against that is pretty simple -- I figure no one is telling the truth."  </P> <P> When Hollywood executives describe Roth, they use the same phrase --  competitive. Several years ago, when preparing to produce a baseball film, he  played center field at a Chicago Cubs fantasy baseball camp. It's somehow  fitting that Roth's most vivid memory isn't the joy of schmoozing with his  heroes but the thrill of matching his athletic skills against them.  </P> <P> "I hit against Ferguson Jenkins," he says. "Well, I tried to hit against him.  The first pitch was a fastball." Roth signals the whoosh of a ball hurtling  past him. "No chance."  </P> <P> With his checkered past as a director, many thought Roth might be equally  overmatched when he went off last summer to make "Coupe de Ville," which stars  Patrick Dempsey, Daniel Stern and Arye Gross as three estranged brothers  traveling to Florida to meet their father.  </P> <P> A week into shooting, Roth collapsed. "I was so eager to direct that I had us  shoot in the South in the heat of summer," he said. "I went out there with no  hat, no sunglasses, no protection. I just snapped. They thought I had a stroke.  I curled up in a ball and said, 'Let's just pack up and go home. I'm finished.'  Finally, they put me on an I.V. and my body started sucking up salt. I took the  next day to recover and then finished the film."  </P> <P> It's revealing that Roth picked Dempsey not simply for his comic flair. "What  really got Patrick the part was the pain on his face," Roth said quietly. "He'd  been an unhappy kid who left home early, so he lived out that part. That's  something all the brothers share -- they're alienated from each other."  </P> <P> Roth identifies with this emotional distance. He grew up in New York, where his  parents were active unionists. Again Roth was an outsider. "My family was a  left-wing, artsy family. I was very emotionally cut off from them -- I was more  comfortable with sports. In school, I'd sit in the front row of class, over in  the corner, out of the teacher's peripheral vision, and I'd make up all-star  lineups in my mind."  </P> <P> For most of his 15 years in Hollywood, Roth was also off on the fringe, far  from front-row center. "I had an awful lot of frustration," he admits. "I  remember being so frustrated about five years ago that I talked to my  accountant about going into the cable field."  </P> <P> Finally, when he was producing a film on location in Brazil, he snapped. "I was  in the middle of the 100-degree heat, in a horrible rainstorm, standing in the  jungle surrounded by bugs and snakes that could kill anyone within 100 feet,"  he said with a frown. "And I thought, 'I'm not even directing. I'm just  watching the damn movie being made!' "  </P> <P> When Roth returned, he put his house for collateral and made "Streets of Gold."  "I love the singularity of focus with directing," he says. "Night shooting is  so wonderful -- it's just you with the actors. You have a peacefulness you  don't have in this other job I do."  </P> <P> But Roth has no illusions. "When I watch my movie, I really feel someone else  can do it better. If I thought I had the talent of a Larry Kasdan or Barry  Levinson, OK. But I don't think I have that gift."  </P> <P> Roth shrugged. "After all, I didn't give it up to go back and teach at the  local education center. I have a great job. I'm one of the few guys who can say  'yes' to making a movie."  </P> <P> Still, you get the feeling Roth's still not entirely comfortable in his new  role. He admits that when Barry Diller first offered him the Fox job, he turned  it down.  </P> <P> "I'd spent my whole life railing against these institutions, making movies  about characters who were outlaws," he said. "But Barry convinced me I had a  mandate to run the company my way -- and to trust my instincts."  </P> <P> Roth gazed wistfully out his office window. "You can't predict anything in this  business, but here I am."  </P></p>

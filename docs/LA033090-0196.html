			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> VALVANO PAID HIM AT IONA, EX-NBA CENTER ALLEGES  </P> <P> Former NBA center Jeff Ruland said he took unspecified amounts of money from  Jim Valvano while the North Carolina State coach was at Iona, the Philadelphia  Daily News reported today.  </P> <P> Valvano, who left Iona for N.C. State in 1980, denied Ruland's allegation  through attorney Art Kaminsky, who also said an NCAA investigation found no  wrongdoing at Iona.  </P> <P> "Jim doesn't want to get into a public debate over this," Kaminsky told the  paper. "He doesn't want this to Ping-Pong back and forth."  </P> <P> Ruland, a two-time All-Star with Washington, said, "Greenbacks changed hands."  </P> <P> "I took money from Valvano," the newspaper quoted Ruland as saying.  </P> <P> Asked if he accepted money from Valvano while being recruited or while playing  at Iona, Ruland said, "Both of those. That's enough. That's all I want to say."  </P> <P> Ruland said the matter wasn't "about a lot of money," but he would not specify  the amount or say how frequently it changed hands.  </P> <P> "I don't know anything about it," Kaminsky said. "If that's what he wants to  say, fine."  </P> <P> Ruland's NBA career ended after a knee injury limited his play to five games  with the Philadelphia 76ers in 1986-87.  </P></p>

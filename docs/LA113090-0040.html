			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CORRUPTION TRIAL OF 7 SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES GOES TO FEDERAL JURY;  </P> <P> COURTS: PROSECUTION CLOSES BY SAYING THE MEN VIOLATED THE PUBLIC TRUST. THE  DEFENSE SAYS THE MAIN WITNESS IS A LIAR AND A THUG.  </P> <P> The case of seven Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies accused of skimming  $1.4 million in drug money went to a federal court jury Thursday with a  prosecutor calling them corrupt, and the defense saying the government used  unreliable witnesses.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles trial lasted seven weeks and focused the spotlight on a scandal  that embarrassed the Sheriff's Department in the nation's most populous county  and its chief, Sheriff Sherman Block.  </P> <P> "With all the power the government has, they have not proved their case beyond  a reasonable doubt," defense attorney Harland Braun told jurors. "And that is  because the defendants are innocent."  </P> <P> Braun, who represents former Deputy Daniel Garner, pointed the blame at Robert  Sobel, the government's star witness against the deputies and the former chief  of the elite narcotics squad called Major Violators II.  </P> <P> Braun portrayed the former Sheriff's Department sergeant as a thug and a liar.  </P> <P> "Sobel is worthless," Braun told the jury. "It would demean our history, our  jury system if you based a verdict on someone like Robert Sobel."  </P> <P> The seven defendants, Garner, Terrell Amers, James Bauder, Eufrasio Cortez,  Ronald Daub, John Dickenson and Macario Duran are charged with conspiracy,  theft, racketeering, tax fraud and money laundering.  </P> <P> Braun criticized prosecutors for using drug suspects as witnesses and said  testimony had shown that the government operated its own undercover  money-laundering operation, returning drug profits to the Colombians supplying  the illegal product.  </P> <P> In rebuttal, Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas A. Hagemann said, 'There are some  things the government does that aren't very pretty. . . . But it's done  according to the book and approved at the highest level of government.  Washington says OK because it's a drug war and there are benefits. So there is  an undercover money-laundering operation."  </P> <P> As for the drug suspects, he said the government did not choose them as  witnesses. He said the defendants caused such people to become witnesses in the  case by allegedly stealing money from them.  </P> <P> During the trial, the deputies testified that they made luxury purchases of  boats, cars and vacations by legitimate means, with money obtained from  savings, relatives, overtime work, legal gambling and yard sales.  </P> <P> "These are the defenses of wishful thinking," Hagemann said of the deputies'  evidence, "a defense made up of nonsense."  </P> <P> The prosecutor pointed to the men's "outlandish expenditures" for luxury items  during the 15 months the skimming allegedly occurred and said their guilt had  been proved.  </P> <P> "This is a case about trust and the people that we entrust," he said. "In 1988  and '89, these deputy sheriffs could not be trusted."  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie spent an hour giving jurors instructions in  the law and ordered them to begin their deliberations this morning.  </P></p>

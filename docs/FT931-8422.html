			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Departments preparing extensive temporary work scheme PLANS to create thousands more temporary work places are being considered by the government in response to rising unemployment. The proposal, one of several made by the special committee on unemployment chaired by Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords, is being fleshed out by the Department of Employment in consultation with the Treasury. Other proposals are being costed and worked out in detail by several government departments  -including education, trade and industry, and social security. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, has been given the responsibility of taking a strategic lead in the reviews. Separately, regional assistance is to be better targeted. The Department of Trade and Industry is redrawing the map of 160 'assisted areas' - which benefit from regional grants - to reflect changes in employment trends over the past decade. The results are expected in April after consultations at European Community level. The DTI is also looking at how the government can further encourage small-business start-ups. At present some 29,000 temporary work places are offered on the Employment Action scheme. From April its funding will be merged with Employment Training, the main training scheme for the long-term unemployed. Offering 150,000 places at any one time, the Pounds 936m programme will be run by Training and Enterprise Councils, which can select individuals for temporary work, foundation training and occupational-skills training. Participation on schemes will remain voluntary. It is understood that Mrs Shephard has argued within cabinet that sanctions, such as the withdrawal of benefit, can only be introduced if the unemployed have a wide menu from which to choose. The government is, for example, likely to lift the 21-hour limit on study. Investigations are also under way as to whether the unemployed can be offered more financial help in pursuing education. In the longer term, sanctions may be introduced for targeted groups such as the 18-to-24-year-old long-term unemployed, a group the government wants to lead back into the workforce before too many become unemployable. The Confederation of British Industry is considering whether it should recommend to the government that this age group should accept compulsory training for benefit. However, previous studies have suggested that once training is compulsory 'timewasters' bring inertia to programmes.</p>

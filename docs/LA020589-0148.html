			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GETTING AN UNFAIR RAP?  </P> <P> After reading the Jan. 10 edition of The Times, I was somewhat puzzled with one  of your headlines. While not finding anything wrong with the basic content of  the article, I did find the title rather offensive. The article I am referring  to is "A La Jolla Life on a Mira Mesa Income."  </P> <P> Although I recognize that your intent was not to insult the Mira Mesa  community, the title seemed to imply that we are living in some sort of ghetto  of San Diego. While it may not be La Jolla, I am very happy to live in Mira  Mesa as are many of the naval officers that live around me. We all take pride  in our community and hope that many of the unfair raps the area gets cease.  </P> <P> PAUL A. PANEK  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

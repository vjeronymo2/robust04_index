			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Kohl warns CIS against military build-up: German chancellor calls for dismantling of tactical nuclear weapons CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday warned the former Soviet republics not to contemplate setting up new armed forces of a size which would disturb the security balance in Europe. It was 'senseless' for the west to provide humanitarian aid and help rebuild the economies of former Soviet republics if at the same time they were debating setting up forces 'which would disturb the European balance, and tie up financial and technical resources which could be used more sensibly in other fields'. Mr Kohl was addressing the chiefs of the general staffs of all nine member states of the Western European Union (WEU), who gathered for the first time yesterday in Bonn as part of the process of building a stronger European defence identity. His remarks coincided yesterday with a decision by Mr Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's president, to appoint three commanders loyal to the republic, in a further step towards creating a Ukrainian national army. The new commanders, whose predecessors refused to swear an oath of obedience to Ukraine, will head the military districts situated in Ukraine. The move is likely to cause consternation in Moscow where military chiefs are strongly against dismemberment of the Red Army. Ukraine has been largely successful in its effort to form its own army, securing the loyalty of nearly 300,000 soldiers by the end of last week. Mr Kohl yesterday called for the dismantling of tactical nuclear weapons in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), successor to the Soviet Union, and gave his backing to moves to provide peaceful occupations for former Soviet nuclear scientists, to prevent them exporting their knowledge abroad. David White adds: Britain said it would make concrete proposals for helping to ensure the security of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union in talks later this week between Mr Tom King, UK defence secretary, and Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the armed forces chief. The talks are to take place on Thursday in London during the planned visit of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, to Britain. Mr King said UK technical help might include containers for shipping nuclear arms due for destruction. It was essential that weapons be made safe and that materials from them be safeguarded. Discussions would also focus on the future of Soviet nuclear scientists to ensure they had work and did not become 'idle hands'. Reuter adds from Moscow: Fighting raged in different parts of the Caucasus yesterday, with dozens killed in one of the bloodiest battles in a longstanding territorial conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Armenian mission in Moscow said 45 Azeris and 15 Armenians had been killed over the weekend in Nagorno- Karabakh.</p>

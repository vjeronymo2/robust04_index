			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Arts: Passion and precision - London Promenade Concerts ON THURSDAY the second of the Royal Concertgebouw's Albert Hall Prom appearances brought the rarity of the concerto for oboeist, flautist and orchestra, Grande Aulodia (1970), by the Italian composer/conductor Bruno Maderna (1920-73). Earlier came a work with some stylistic kinship to Maderna's, the beautifully wrought, romantic early orchestral Passacaglia by Webern and, later, a work with none, the fifth symphony of Tchaikovsky. The conductor was the orchestra's chief, Riccardo Chailly, who shaped the Webern piece with passionate precision, drawing it beautifully to a climax on which the high trumpets set a seal of excellent musicianship, just as the other brass players had earlier contributed memorable muted snarls and rasps. The work's gradient, from the barely audible opening pizzicati to the sonorous massifs towards the end, was defined with an ease of which only the best of orchestras is capable. The concerto's soloists, Paul Verhey and Maurice Bourgue, must each play four instruments, Verhey the flute, piccolo, flute in E flat and alto flute; Bourgue the oboe, oboe d'amore, cor anglais and musette, akin a bagless bagpipe. The wealth of solo sonorities is given scope by the relaxed formal structure  -one critic justly termed the work the 'cadenza concerto' - and was splendidly produced by these two virtuosi, completely at home with Maderna's often pointillistic idiom: even the musette was remarkably eloquent. The large orchestra, in a special arrangement on the platform, periodically chips in a kind of buoyant textural refrain reflecting one or other instrumental sub-group - jagged dance-like carolling for massed strings, brass volleys, tuned percussion expostulations, and so on. But the work ends unexpectedly on a sustained passage of almost Ivesian mystery and stillness. Chailly negotiated the interplay of solo and orchestral sections with care, and the work came over as gratefully suave if not deeply substantial. His reading of the symphony was deliberated and restrained. The music's pessimism was favoured over its struggle for life. But for all the finesse with which this interpretation was advanced, one couldn't but regret the deficiency of musical red corpuscles.</p>

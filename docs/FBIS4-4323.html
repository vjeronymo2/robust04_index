			<p>CSO     [Text] The DPR [Parliament] will continue to `go after' 49  companies which have non-performing loans at BUMN [State-Owned  Enterprises] Banks; at the same time, the BKPM [Capital  Investment Coordinating Board] considers that the construction  of the integrated chemical industry project owned by the Golden  Key Group is not yet in the non-performing category.    "At the present time, there is only one client who is known  to have a non-performing loan and the other 49 don't. We will  continue to pursue them at not just one bank but at all the  banks involved," said Yahya Nasution, deputy chairman of the  DPR's Commission VII, when he and A.A. Baramuli (a member of the  DPR's Commission VII) spoke to the press yesterday.    Yahya said that the case is being pursued because it had  been  uncovered by Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad and the  governor of the Bank of Indonesia. "Considering that the  non-performing loan was granted by a bank syndicate with Bapindo  [Indonesian Development Bank] as the lead arranger, that is the  bank that we will question first."    "From Bapindo's response to Commission VII on Wednesday we  will find out whether it will be necessary to invite in other  state banks," said Yahya.    At the same time, Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, state minister for  investment (Meninves) and chairman of the Investment Board,  stated that the construction of the integrated chemical industry  project owned by Eddy Tansil in Cilegon--which has been  mentioned as a cause of non-performing loans--cannot be  categorized as non-performing yet because it has not yet gone  past its deadline.    "We are continuing to evaluate the three companies. If there  is a good reason for the arrears, we will give them additional  time," he told the press on 8 February after a working meeting  with the DPR's Commission VI.    The BKPM, Sanyoto said, is still giving Graha Swakarsa Prima  (GSP) Inc, Hamparan Rejeki (RP) Inc, and Pusaka Warna  Polypropilen (PWP) Inc--the three subsidiaries of the Golden Key  Group supporting the integrated chemical industry--the  opportunity to continue constructing the plant.    The license granted to the three projects is still in the  form of a Permanent Approval Certificate (SPT), but the BKPM has  still not granted them a Permanent License Certificate (SIT).    "The BPKM will not grant an SIT until the three companies  have had a trial run. However, it seems that the three companies  have not had a trial run yet," he said in response to a question  from Tadjuddin Nur Said, a member of the DPR's Commission VI,  concerning the integrated petrochemical industry which is  reported to have 1.3 trillion rupiahs in non-performing loans  with BAPINDO.    Sanyoto said that an SPT was granted to GSP Inc on 5 June  1989 and renewed on 24 May 1991 with an investment of 228  billion rupiahs, which included the importation of engines worth  $96 million. Every year this company produces 120,000 tons of  styrene monomer, 50,000 tons of polystyrene, 15,000 tons of  acrylonitrile butadene and 10,000 tons of styrene acrylonitrile.    Sanyoto said that GSP Inc had authorized capital of 200  billion rupiahs, subscribed capital of 60 billion rupiahs and  paid-in capital of 60 billion rupiahs.    The BPKM approved the PTHR [expansion unknown] as a PMDN  [Domestic Capital Investment] on 28 November 1988 to be  constructed with at least 214 billion rupiahs in capital,  including the importation of $96 million worth of engines. The  source of funding included 60 billion rupiahs of its own  capital, 154 billion rupiahs of borrowed capital, 200 billion  rupiahs of authorized capital, 60 billion rupiahs of subscribed  capital and 60 billion rupiahs of paid-in capital. This company  plans to produce 40,000 tons of acrylic fibers per year.    PWP Inc was founded with a capital of 269 billion rupiahs  consisting of 169 billion rupiahs of borrowed capital and 100  billion rupiahs of its own capital. The company will produce  140,000 tons of polypropylene.    According to Baramuli, the problem of non-performing loans,  which were uncovered right from the start, was reported to the  chairman of the DPR's FKP [Functional Development Faction]; the  head of the FKP had never prohibited the problem from being  revealed, but his faction would go along if they were forbidden  to speak up.    Baramuli admitted that he had received support from the  businessman Probosutedjo. In fact, he continued, Probosutedjo  mentioned a figure of one trillion rupiahs in non-performing  loans, beyond the 1.3 trillion rupiahs, but Baramuli did not  want to reveal this to the press.    A. Sutomo, junior attorney general for special criminal  matters (JAM PIDSUS), said that his agency had tried to take  anticipatory steps about the 1.3 trillion rupiahs in  non-performing loans from Bapindo. "But the Attorney General's  Office is committed to respecting the bank secrecy mandated by  law," he said at breaks in his speech to legal-affairs reporters  here yesterday.    Penetrating bank secrecy, he said, cannot be done until the  Attorney General's Office is sure that a criminal act has been  committed and is sure who the suspected perpetrator is. This  means that bank secrecy cannot be penetrated until the Attorney  General's Office is already at the investigatory stage.    Sutomo said that his people are limited right now to  collecting data and information from various parties about cases  of non-performing loans taken out by Eddy Tansil.    According to banking-law expert Rasjim Wiraatmadja, based on  the provisions of banking law Number 7 of 1992, collateral for  loans does not have to be in material form; it can be based on  the banker's convictions about the debtor. If a banker is  convinced that the credit granted can be paid back and if he  knows the debtor very well, according to the provisions of the  law the credit is justified.    "Under Law Number 14 of 1967, in fact, there always had to  be  some material collateral in order to grant credit. But under Law  Number 7 of 1992 that provision was eliminated so that  collateral can be based on the banker's convictions about the  projected being funded," he told BISNIS here yesterday.    Even though bankers can grant credit on the basis of their  convictions, material collateral is still required because in  the February regulation package (PAKFEB) of 1991 there is a  provision about obligatory reserves which was renewed in the May  regulation package of 1993.    In legal terms, said Rasjim, Law Number 14 of 1967, which  required material collateral, is no longer valid since it was  superseded by a later law. Now one must refer to Law Number 7 of  1992.    "In the May regulation package banks are obliged to set  aside  a reserve of 0.5 percent for current loans and 100 percent for  non-performing loans. To meet these provisions, material  collateral which can easily be turned into cash is really  necessary."    Subagjo Joyosumarto, head of the Bank of Indonesia's Banking  Development Bureau, said that the way to solve the  non-performing loan problem is to write the loans which are not  non-performing off the books. "Another way is for the government  to order the banks to carry out mergers, consolidations and  acquisitions," he told the annual meeting of members of the  Perbanas [Private National Banks] Auditors Club (ACP) here  yesterday.</p>

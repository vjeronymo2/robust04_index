			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Antonio Barragan from the "Vector 21" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Mexican Episcopal Conference has formed a  commission that is not intended to have any legal weight but to  give moral support in the efforts toward reconciliation and  peace in Chiapas State. This commission is composed of two  archbishops and five bishops and will be headed by Adolfo Suarez  Rivera, who is the president of the Episcopal Conference and  archbishop of Monterrey.    Monsignor Ramon Godines Florez, the bishops' official  spokesman, announced the creation of the commission when he  explained the Episcopal Conference's stand on the Chiapas case.  The Conference's position was presented in an eight-point  document, which we will mention later on. Godines Florez  basically commented on the cease-fire implemented in Chiapas by  order of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.    [Begin Godines Florez recording] It seems the suspension of  the bombings and cease-fire are very important measures. We wish  it was already in effect in order to begin a dialogue and seek  reconciliation and peace. [end recording]    Godines Florez also mentioned the appointment of Manuel  Camacho Solis as the commissioner for peace and reconciliation  in Chiapas. He said that despite everything one must view this  appointment with optimism because of Camacho Solis' great  virtues as a mediator.    Monsignor Godines Florez noted that the NAFTA text must be  reviewed because it was negotiated behind the backs of the  peasants and Indians, who know nothing about it. He said such a  situation could result in more problems in the long run.    With regard to the Episcopal Conference's position, I will  sum up the eight-point document for you:    Point 1: The reason for violence in Chiapas is the misery,  neglect, and scorn the peasants and Indians of that state and of  other parts of the country are experiencing.    Point 2: We reject violence and the use of armed uprisings  as  a path to resolving true problems, such as misery and injustice.    Point 3: We think it is wrong and harmful that, in addition  to adding suffering to their poverty, groups insist on a class  struggle.    Point 4: We know it is not inherent of Indian cultures to  attack adversaries because they have taught us hospitality and  respect for human life.    Point 5: It would be belittling for the Mexican Army to  commit excesses in fulfilling its duty when its duty is to work  for the security and freedom of the Mexican people.    Point 6, which I believe is one of the most important points  and one that the bishops mentioned last: In the face of  accusations or suspicions that the church in San Cristobal las  Casas, quote, encourages the armed uprising, unquote, the church  stresses that if any Catholic Church member, by subjective  conviction, decides to join the armed struggle, this is done  independently from the mission they accepted as catechists. In  any case, an accusation must not be based on assumptions but  must be thoroughly proven.    The Chiapas bishops have consistently urged the rebels to  change their behavior and act as Jesus taught us in the Gospel.  We cannot accept such accusations against priests, nuns, or the  bishop himself. We are certain the bishop has always condemned  violence, but he has also reported the misery that, in this  case, is caused by abuses in power and structures that must be  changed.    These are six of the eight points. There are two more  points.  Point 7 states we are living an important moment in our  country's history. It adds we must all change our attitudes.    Point 8 says: In conclusion, we urge everyone to pray, which  is the force that changes our hearts in accordance with God's  will.    With regard to the appointment of Camacho Solis as head of  the Commission for Peace and Reconciliation in Chiapas, it notes  all Mexicans must support the initiatives started by this  commission.</p>

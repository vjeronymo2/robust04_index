			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Futures-related programs boost Dow Wall Street Blue chip stocks were shaken out of the doldrums yesterday despite a softer tone in bonds, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 20.31 higher at 3,773.45, as futures-related buy programs sparked the most robust upturn on Wall Street in nearly a month. But the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 inched just 0.81 ahead to 458.67. However, only 222m shares were traded. The lacklustre volume probably exaggerated the extent of the Dow's advance, which showed signs of flagging during the afternoon but caught a second wind in the final hour. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite hardly budged, climbing a scant 0.66 to 441.84. But the Nasdaq composite jumped 5.37 to 734.25, as a favourable outlook for semiconductor companies allowed computers stocks to rebound from this week's sell-off. The strength of the blue chips, after so many flat sessions, was surprising in view of the morning's inconclusive economic report. The good news was that producer prices last month dipped 0.1 per cent, with analysts forecasting a slight gain. The bad news was that the core index, excluding food and energy, jumped 0.4 per cent, rather stronger than expected. The mixed signals on inflation disappointed a bond market in search of fresh direction. As a result Treasury prices drifted moderately lower, and thus provided little leverage for stocks. Nevertheless, equities showed surprising strength, though there was no obvious justification for the enthusiasm. The big gainers were stocks most likely to benefit from a buoyant economy, a group which has languished over the past month. Among the cyclicals, Caterpillar climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 105 1/8 and Cummins Engine added Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 41 7/8 . Steel and aluminium producers were in demand, partly in response to rising industrial metal prices in the commodity markets, analysts said. Bethlehem Steel was marked up Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 21 1/8 , Alcoa pushed Dollars 1 3/4 higher to Dollars 73 and Reynolds added Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 48 1/8 . Energy stocks were in demand as well, with Mobil appreciating Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 82 7/8 and Chevron gaining Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 90 7/8 . The technology sector benefited from a much needed boost from the Semiconductor Industry Association's May book-to-bill ratio, which compares shipments to orders. The keenly watched barometer matched expectations of continued strength and encouraged investors to shop for bargains. On the Nasdaq, Cyrix bounced back Dollars 1 to Dollars 27 and Novellus put on Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 33 1/4 . On the Big Board, Compaq was up Dollars 1 at Dollars 35 3/8 and Texas Instruments Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 77 1/4  . Meanwhile, PepsiCo was near the top of the NYSE's most active list for the second day running, though yesterday the share price only dipped Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 31 1/8 . The previous session, the company's profits warning touched off fears of sustained downturn in soft-drink sales. Canada Toronto recorded a small gain in relatively light trading. The TSE-300 composite index was up 13.72 points, or 0.33 per cent, to 4,210.51, for a loss on the week of about 71 points. Winning issues edged losers by 371 to 358. In another quiet session, trading volume was up slightly to 45.0m shares from Thursday's 43.46m, while trading value was CDollars 499.5m compared with CDollars 516m. Advances were led by the mining group, which gained 1.81 per cent. Brazil Sao Paulo closed up three per cent in light trade after prices rallied for the third day in a row on portfolio-squaring ahead of the options settlements and optimism ahead of the adoption of a new currency on July 1. The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares ended up 880 at 30,204 points. Turnover was CR414.4bn (Dollars 195.5). Telebras TEL. SA, Brazil's most popular blue chip, was very volatile in late trading. The preferred stock closed up 2.2 percent at CR86.50.</p>

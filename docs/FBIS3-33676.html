			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Statement That Raises Hope"] </F>   [Text] Certainly we must not ignore the statement that U.S.  President Bill Clinton made to the American television network  CNN yesterday, which was reported by all international news  agencies. The importance of this statement is due to two  factors: First, it comes a few days after the Geneva summit with  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and, second, it comes a few days  before the resumption of the bilateral negotiations in  Washing?on after a suspension of about four months.    What did President Clinton say? He declared that he will do  all he can to establish an honorable, permanent, and acceptable  peace in the Middle East. He said that peace is the outstanding  priority of U.S. policy in the region. Evaluating the Geneva  summit, President Clinton said that Syrian President Hafiz  al-Asad was sincere when he emphasized to him Syria's concern to  reach peace, which he described as very important to Syria and  to all Arab peoples. Clinton said that he wants to see a peace  agreement between the Arab countries and Israel. He noted that  his meeting with President al-Asad in Geneva was serious and  great.    Regarding Lebanon, President Clinton said that the talks  with  President al-Asad in Geneva dealt with implementing the al-Ta'if  agreement and that they agreed that Lebanon should return to  being an independent and sovereign state and that all foreign  forces should withdraw.    These positive statements prompt us to rise to our feet in  respect for U.S. President Bill Clinton and to call on him at  the same time to translate them into action on all the  Palestinian, Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian negotiating tracks.  Fortunately, the Washington bilateral negotiations will be  resumed on Monday on all tracks. We have a right to be  optimistic and to expect great results from these negotiations.    The United States provides Israel with everything from bread  to missiles. As we know, there are strategic cooperation  agreements between them that allow Israel, as happened recently,  to transfer advanced U.S. technology. Since the Arab party's  intentions have been proven serious to the United States as  President Clinton himself noted, it remains for him to signal to  Israel that withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and  recognition of the Palestinian people's rights have become a  requisite that must be fulfilled sooner rather than later.    Israel is maneuvering on all negotiating tracks and instead  of proceeding seriously and directly toward peace, we find that  it is trying to incite Arabs against each other. First Israel  focuses on the Syrian track so that one thinks that a solution  is imminent. Israel then abruptly leaves Syria and focuses on  the Palestinians so that everyone thinks that a solution is at  hand. It then leaves the Palestinians and returns to the  Syrians. It continues this approach in an attempt to generate  concern and division among the Arabs, pretending that this is  the nature of negotiations.    We Arabs have all become convinced of America's role as a  full partner in the peace process. We are all convinced that  the role of a full partner cannot only be played through  statements. This role must be exercised practically by advising  Israel that its security cannot be achieved by capturing the  land of others but by striking a balance in the interests of all  parties and living together within a framework of good  neighborliness and cooperation in all areas. President Clinton's  statement raises our hopes and affirms that peace is making  progress despite Israel's maneuvers. It remains to translate  these statements into action.</p>

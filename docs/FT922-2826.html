			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Justinian: Press is living dangerously Once again the public has been displaying its perennial ambivalence to its daily fare of newspaper reading. The media coverage of the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales has by all accounts been a huge commercial success. At the same time the coverage has produced a barrage of public criticism, led by the forthright statement from the Press Complaints Commission. It may be that those who avidly read the revelations of royal disharmony are not the same persons who express outrage at such press outpourings; but the suspicion is that we all speak with two voices. The public outcry at the media reporting is clearly propelling government towards the introduction of a privacy law. If so, the need for some clear thinking about what constitutes an invasion of private life - and in particular the reporting on royalty - is acute. Any privacy law must initially determine whether invasion of privacy has taken place. What does 'private life' mean? Does it include a person's home address? What about the sexual proclivities, not to say activities, of an individual? Is the drug addiction of one member of a family a matter which touches the privacy of other family members? The Calcutt Committee in its report of June 1990 discussed the meaning of privacy. Its conclusion was that privacy could be defined as 'the right of an individual to be protected against intrusion into his personal life or affairs, or those of his family, by direct physical means or by publication of information'. It went on to note that the right to privacy 'could include' protection against physical intrusion; publication of hurtful or embarrassing personal material (whether true or false); publication of inaccurate or misleading personal material; and publication of photographs or recordings of the individual taken without consent. The Press Complaint Commission's Code of Practice does not reflect these categories; unless the Code is speedily amended the message will go out to politicians that the press is unwilling to regulate itself. Once through the threshold issue the next question is whether there has been an intrusion or inquiry into or publication relating to the private sphere. If the answer is yes, one then faces the difficult hurdle of the public interest defence. An immediate question is: would any of this protective cloak against unwanted personal publicity be thrown over the royal family. There is a general view that those who are engaged in public affairs lose some, if not all, of their privacy. A politician is expected publicly to uphold the moral values of society and to the extent that his/her private life discloses double standards it is disclosable to the public via a vigilant press. But if politicians and others choose the public arena as their occupation they cannot complain if the law should treat them less sensitively than those who wish to pursue their lives away from the public domain. The trouble about applying these principles to the royal family is that its members do not choose to live their lives publicly. They perform publicly as a matter of public duty. At least all that is true of those members of the royal family who are somewhat distanced from the throne. The constitutional position of the Queen and Prince Charles may thrust all their working days into the public domain. The Press Complaints Commission has tacitly acknowledged that some members of the royal family are entitled to protection of their privacy. The adjudication last August in the matter of Princess Eugenie is a case in point. The Commission held that the People newspaper's publication of nude photographs of the infant princess was an invasion of privacy. In response to the People's defence that the photographs were 'charming' and 'natural', the Commission brushed aside such claims as irrelevant because the photographs were simply an invasion of privacy. Stripped of the circumstances that led the Press Complaints Commission to pronounce so precipitately on the stories of the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Commission nevertheless did shed some light on the issue of public interest. It conceded the existence of a legitimate public interest in the situation of the heir to the throne. Noting that the state of the royal marriage was already in the public domain, by virtue of the 'outward behaviour of the spouses', the Commission nevertheless expressed the opinion that the manner and tone of the reporting was a breach of the Code of Practice. The implication of that statement is that even a finding of 'public interest' will not necessarily justify intrusive and speculative treatment of a story which the Commission described as 'dabbling journalistic fingers in the stuff of other people's souls in a manner which adds nothing to the discussion of the matter of public interest'. Just before the Press Council was disbanded at the end of 1990, it planned to hold a seminar to discuss the problems of a free and responsible press in reporting on the royal family. Such a dialogue now needs to be undertaken urgently, whether or not moves to introduce a privacy law for the rest of us comes about.</p>

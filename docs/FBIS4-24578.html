			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 28 (XINHUA) -- The Mobil Oil Company  was proud of its century-long presence in China, and would like  to do business here for another hundred years.    Lucio Noto, chairman and chief executive of Mobil, said this  recently in Beijing in an interview with XINHUA.    The company began its China business by establishing the  first China representative office in Shanghai in 1894, and it  was famous for introducing kerosene to China.    Noto, who came solely for the centenary celebrations, said  that this was his first overseas trip since he took over the top  slot last March.    "I want to express our willingness of furthering cooperation  with China," he said, adding that Mobil would take the  opportunity to probe the possibility of more cooperation.    The chairman disclosed that several cooperative projects  were  under discussion between Mobil and China, and it was possible  that an agreement to establish a joint venture in north China's  Tianjin would be reached within a few months.    "The setting up of joint ventures would both enable Mobil to  provide better service to its Chinese customers, and benefit the  development of China's economy," he said. "the cooperation is  beneficial to both sides."    Noto also said that his company was interested in recovering  and processing petroleum in China, including in the South China  Sea and north-west China's Tarim Basin, and a team would be sent  to China shortly to do research.    "We would not lose any good business opportunity here," he  added.    To mark the 100th anniversary, Mobil has set up a fund of  500,000 U.S. dollars to help develop China's education.    The company presented 100,000 U.S. dollars to the National  Academy of Education Administration as the first installment of  the fund, in support of the academy's efforts to upgrade the  training facilities and programs for education administrators.    Noto said that his company had become one of the largest  foreign suppliers in China, providing lubricating oil to various  industrial fields of the country since it re-entered the Chinese  market in 1974.    That same year this second largest oil company in the United  States became the first foreign oil company to import Chinese  oil, natural gas and fuel for aircraft into the USA. It was  also the first foreign company selling oil products in China.    In 1983, it set up a filling station in south China's  Shenzhen, thus becoming the first Western oil company of this  kind. In 1986, the company began cooperation with Shanghai in  producing lubricating oil for ocean shipping and automobiles.</p>

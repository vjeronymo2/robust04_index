			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: A social side to business (4) - Samuel Brittan's views on the legitimacy of the social elements of corporate responsibility, reported on September 2, generated a large number of letters. This is a selection Sir, By raising many good questions while providing little in the way of answers, Samuel Brittan's comments accurately reflect the current, underdeveloped state of economic thinking on the subject of ethics. Perhaps the reason lies in the dichotomy in western thought between the 'self' and 'others'. Economic theory is based on the premise that people act in their own self-interest, the 'self' is implicitly understood to mean the individual or, at a stretch, the family unit. Sacrificial acts done for the sake of 'others' are viewed as an anomaly. To fit such acts into their theoretical framework, economists must rationalise them as bringing a sort of perverse satisfaction to the doer. Brittan concludes that economics needs to be expanded to take account of values. I would suggest a more metaphysical approach: expand, through education, peoples' consciousness of 'self' so that it embraces not only their individual being but their community, nation, the world, and ultimately the whole creation. Manufacturers that felt no sense of separation from the environment would baulk at the thought of polluting the air or water to cut costs. Citizens of rich nations who felt at one with poorer peoples of the world would find it much easier to mobilise the resources needed to eradicate famine and disease. In essence, expanding our awareness of 'self' would not invalidate economic theory, but it would dramatically change the choices we make as individuals and societies. Of course, there are serious obstacles to achieving this. Our educational system would need to be rebuilt around a core set of moral and spiritual precepts. Gaining consensus on the content of this set would be a monumental task. But here, the economists can help. In the 1960s, the work of Theodore Schultz and Gary Becker on investment in education and training altered the attitudes of policymakers worldwide towards the importance of 'human capital'. Similarly, if today's economists were able empirically to link economic advancement to factors like family values, sense of community, trust, and integrity among leaders, our policymakers might invest more aggressively in society's stock of 'spiritual capital'.

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Official prices return to China's markets: Beijing's leadership, panicked by inflation, has brought back price controls Market stallholders across China have begun to display signs showing officially sanctioned prices. So it is that price controls on foodstuffs, including grain, meat, fruit and vegetables, have been re-introduced by a panicky leadership which has made fighting inflation its priority. While market vendors might grumble about the restrictions there is not much they can do about them since under the new anti-inflation drive food prices are being monitored rigorously, especially in urban areas. At the Yongan district food market in Beijing's eastern suburbs, bargaining is out for the moment. Complaints about high prices, the normal pantomime of shopping in China, are met with a shrug and nod towards a board on which are displayed food prices per jin (about 500gm). The clamp on food prices is the most visible sign of the new anti-inflation campaign, though China's leaders must realise that these measures risk creating shortages which would run counter to one of their chief aims - to ensure abundant supplies in the market. For the moment, however, it is clear that Beijing is launching a fairly determined campaign against price rises in the hope that it can break the inflation cycle, and perhaps, more important, dampen inflationary expectations. The leadership has not admitted it outright, but a 16-point economic stabilisation programme unveiled in July 1993 to bring the economy under control by so-called 'macro-economic' measures, including credit restrictions, is being superseded. The 'fight-inflation-first' campaign announced by prime minister Li Peng last month may well mark the first stage of a new stabilisation programme. This will place much heavier emphasis on government interference than last year's measures which relied more on indirect restraint through curbs on monetary growth, and restrictions on lending to ailing state enterprises. Chinese officials will have expected much better results from their efforts of the past year or so to maintain high levels of economic growth while bringing inflation under control. That policy has, at best, fallen well short of expectations and, at worst, failed. Publication of a rash of bad economic news in the past month or so has forced policymakers into an extensive review of options, none of which is proving politically palatable. The bad inflation figures for July and August, indications that monetary growth is defying efforts to restrain it, and evidence of a new consumer spending binge will have provided a fairly brutal reminder of the continuing difficulties of managing China's economic transformation. 'I think it's probably a shock to them that things have gone back to where they are now,' said a western economist. He predicted that the next 12 months would prove especially difficult, given the high underlying rate of inflation, continuing heavy demand for subsidies from faltering state enterprises and restlessness among a peasantry whose meagre incomes are being squeezed by higher costs of such items as fertilisers. But it is the inflation bogey that has really unnerved the leadership. Indications that rather than slowing, the rate of price increases had begun to accelerate raised the alarming spectre of inflation spiralling out of control, fuelled partly by inflationary expectations. Consumer prices in the China's 35 major cities were 27.1 per cent higher in August than a year earlier. This was well up on the July figure of 24.2 per cent which itself represented a sharp increase on the previous month. National inflation statistics were hardly more encouraging. The CPI countrywide was up 25.8 per cent in the 12 months to August. While money supply figures for the first seven months of this year are not available, anecdotal evidence indicates that the broader M2 measure of monetary growth exceeded the 24 per cent target. Western economists believe the figure could be closer to 34 per cent. The government's inability to meet its monetary targets has been one of the main causes of continuing inflationary pressures. Demands for sustenance from state enterprises, many of which are virtually bankrupt, are complicating the government's task. Policymakers are walking a tightrope between the need to curb inflation and fears of social unrest caused by the inability of state-owned factories to pay their workers. Worries about unrest have prompted a 'stop-go' approach to monetary policy in the past year or so with the authorities alternately tightening and loosening credit in three-month cycles. An easing of credit restriction since April is seen as one of the main causes of the latest inflationary surge with capital spending by state-owned companies leaping by 73 per cent in July compared with the same month last year. Officials, who had boasted a year ago that 90 per cent of consumer prices had been de-regulated, are sensitive to suggestions that the re-imposition of price controls represents a step-back from economic liberalisation. Hard-pressed Chinese officials seeking better news can point to falling producer prices - prices of steel and other raw materials are down sharply - and to an improving external sector. Exports have grown by more than 30 per cent this year, foreign exchange reserves have rebounded and in light of this current account forecasts are being revised. But in the end the government's success in this latest phase will rest on its ability to check inflation while maintaining high levels of economic growth. The authorities are striving to bring growth down to manageable levels from the unsustainable 13 per cent of the past two years, but at the same time avoid a too rapid deceleration. This is a task that would be considered daunting by those managing even the most sophisticated economies.</p>

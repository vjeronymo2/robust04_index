			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWSBITES: WITHIN A SCONE'S THROW  </P> <P> If you find yourself craving toad-in-the-hole, bubble and squeak, Stilton  quiche, English trifle and scones this weekend, you'll want to visit the Great  British Food Fest, Saturday and Sunday, Oct. 13 and 14, from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.  in Town Center Park, Costa Mesa. The event is part of the Festival of Britain,  an arts festival and retail promotion. U.K. fare will be served from booths set  up by virtually all restaurants in the South Coast Plaza area.  </P> <P> Most of them will also feature British foods within the restaurants. Town  Center Park is at Bristol Street and Town Center Drive. Admission is free.  </P> <P> You can taste new wine releases from such wineries as Caymus, Chamisal,  Saucelito Canyon and Saintsbury during an informal evening of "fun, food and  wine" at Gustaf Anders in South Coast Plaza Village on Thursday, Oct. 18 at 7  p.m. Tab: $45, excluding tax and tip. (714) 668-1737.  </P> <P> To promote responsible alcohol consumption and to aid Mothers Against Drunk  Driving, the Irvine Marriott recently installed a Breathalyzer machine in  Champions Sports Bar. It measures a person's blood-alcohol level; drivers are  considered drunk with readings of 0.08 or higher. Any guest over the legal  limit will be encouraged to arrange alternate transportation. Proceeds from use  of the machine (50 cents per test) will be donated to the county chapter of  MADD. The Irvine Marriott is at 18000 Von Karman Ave.; (714) 553-0100. BEVERLY  BUSH SMITH  </P></p>

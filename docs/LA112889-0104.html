			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOP LOSER SEEKS PROBE OF TIGHT VA. GOVERNOR'S RACE  </P> <P> Democrat L. Douglas Wilder's election as governor was certified Monday but J.  Marshall Coleman, his Republican opponent, asked for a recount and also  requested an investigation of alleged irregularities at the polls.  </P> <P> Coleman made his announcement about three hours before the state Board of  Elections reported the returns as 897,139 votes for Wilder to 890,285 for  Coleman -- a margin of 6,854 votes, or about 0.38% of the nearly 1.8 million  votes cast. It was the closest gubernatorial race in Virginia's history.  </P> <P> Unofficial counts had put Wilder, who is the first black to be elected governor  of a state, ahead by 6,852 votes. State law allows for a recount of any race in  which the margin is less than 0.5%.  </P> <P> Coleman, a former state attorney general, said he would seek a recount and  would ask the Democrat-controlled General Assembly to investigate allegations  of irregularities in the Nov. 7 balloting.  </P> <P> In notifying the legislators that he would contest the returns, Coleman said  that registers used at the polls included the names of some people who were  ineligible to vote.  </P> <P> "In an election as close as this one, irregularities which would not ordinarily  have a probable impact on the outcome assume a greater importance," Coleman  said in his letter to the General Assembly.  </P> <P> Coleman's attorney, William H. Hurd, refused to say more about the allegations.  "There are a number of areas that we're looking into," he said.  </P> <P> Coleman had until Dec. 7 to request a recount, but Monday was the last day the  election could be contested because of alleged irregularities.  </P> <P> He said he would withdraw the challenge if the recount and other information  convince him that an investigation is "no longer necessary to safeguard the  accuracy and integrity" of the election.  </P></p>

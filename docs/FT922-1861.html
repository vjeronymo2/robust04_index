			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Japan The latest slump in the Tokyo equity market is viewed locally with a kind of gloomy fatalism. Traditionally, the story goes, it has been the job of foreign investors, with their more rational valuation methods, to call the bottom of the market. Last year they did just that. But domestic investors failed to follow the lead, so the foreigners have lost heart and there are thus no buyers left at all. The more apocalyptic talk about collapsing bank capital ratios leading to a credit crunch has largely died down. However far the Nikkei falls, the system will doubtless limp along. But there is still profound gloom about corporate earnings. It is in the nature of the Japanese economy that recovery should be led by producers - or government - rather than consumers. When it comes to investing out of recession, Japanese companies are hampered not only by the higher cost of capital but by their prodigal over-investment in the bubble years of the late 1980s. At that time, companies bought market share regardless of profit and investors bought stock for capital gain regardless of income. Now, corporate executives talk earnestly of the need for adequate return on capital and institutions are restive for higher payouts. But, as one of Japan's biggest fund managers remarked yesterday, if the corporate sector's return on equity is only 5-6 per cent and the medium-term outlook for dividend growth is 5-6 per cent as well, who would want to buy the market on nearly 40 times earnings?</p>

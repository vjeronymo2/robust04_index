			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Opel to reveal big cost-cutting measures ADAM OPEL, the German subsidiary of General Motors, will tomorrow unveil details of a far-reaching cost-saving plan designed to enhance productivity at the group's German factories. The agreement, due to be signed by the management and workforce at Opel's Russelsheim headquarters tomorrow morning, follows Volkswagen's radical proposal for a four-day week starting at the beginning of next year. Opel's agreement, which will apply to its 50,000-strong workforce in western Germany, is a response to the same cost and competition pressures faced by its rival Volkswagen but adopts a different approach, preferring to modify the terms of existing contracts with employees and reducing perks without shortening the working week. As such, it may evolve into a pattern for future settlements in German industry as employers seek to find ways of reducing costs without embarking on further rounds of redundancies. 'The purpose of the agreement will be to force through a linkage between productivity and an improvement in cost structures with the payment of benefits to employees,' a spokesman for Opel said yesterday. Opel was reluctant to disclose details of the agreement ahead of the press conference or to quantify the benefits of the proposed savings. But a report in a regional German newspaper suggested yesterday that the agreement contains three central measures. These are: A differentiation of pay increase between basic pay and fringe benefits. The latter accounts for a substantial proportion of German companies' wage costs and usually increases at the same rate as for the basic income. In future Opel fringe benefits will still increase, but at a lesser rate than the basic wage. The special Christmas bonus enjoyed by Opel workers will be paid in two stages instead of in one tranche. The second tranche will be made conditional on cost improvements and on a reduction in absenteeism and sickness rates at the company's factories in Russelsheim, Bochum and Kaiserslautern. Benefits paid to employees who are on short-time working - that is not working a full week - will be restructured. In return, Opel is understood to have guaranteed to increase production in German factories and reconsider plans to lay off manufacturing employees. This could protect 3,700 jobs in the components sector which had been threatened by possible Opel plans to buy equipment from external suppliers. The agreement has been reached after tough negotiations between employees and employers. Mr Rudolf Muller, chairman of Adam Opel's Works' Council, yesterday said the package would cover a four-year period from the start of 1994 and should ensure the viability of the factories in Russelsheim, Bochum and Kaiserslautern.</p>

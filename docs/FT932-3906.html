			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Staveley rises 9% despite fall in margins STAVELEY, the measuring and mechanical engineering company which also owns British Salt, reported a 9 per cent increase in pre-tax profits last year but a deterioration in trading and operating margins. The mechanical and electrical services division suffered from depressed conditions in the construction industry. But measurement, which makes weighing machinery, and minerals, which produces more than half the UK's salt, both increased profits. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 22.4m to Pounds 24.4m on sales up 15.6 per cent at Pounds 344.9m. Underlying organic sales growth was 10 per cent - the balance arising from an acquisition and the effect of translating foreign currency sales. Earnings per share rose from 15.1p to 16.1p and the group is to pay a final dividend of 6.2p, giving 8.5p in total, up 3.7 per cent. Measurement produced operating profits of Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 8.1m) from sales of Pounds 153m. Mr Brian Kent, chairman, said margins should be double this year. Growth in this division would come from the introduction of new products. Profits from mechanical and electrical services fell to Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 5.6m) on sales up 18 per cent at Pounds 152.9m. Mr Kent said the fall in the construction industry had bottomed out and there was recovery potential from a stronger order book. Minerals produced operating profits of Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 11.8m) on sales of Pounds 32.9m despite price controls. Gearing rose from 11 per cent to 22 per cent with net debt up from Pounds 11m to Pounds 20m, partly as a result of translating dollar denominated debt after sterling left the ERM. Capital expenditure was lifted by a Pounds 4m investment in plant to help expand sales of salt products.</p>

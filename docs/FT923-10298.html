			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / The Breakup of ICI: Weak basic chemicals market behind 17% fall IMPERIAL Chemical Industries reported half-year pre-tax profits down 17 per cent from Pounds 507m to Pounds 420m. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said the fall was mainly because of weak market conditions in the basic chemicals and agrochemicals and seeds markets. Earnings per share fell 14 per cent to 39.9p (46.6p). The interim dividend is maintained at 21p. The recession was lasting longer and was deeper than most people had originally expected, he said. The faint signs of recovery in the early spring had faded. He refused to make any predictions about the world economy, except that it would remain uncertain and life would continue to be tough. The pharmaceuticals, specialties and materials businesses had improved through self-help and determined control of costs, Sir Denys added. The restructuring programme was progressing well and cost savings were running at an annual rate of Pounds 250m. Group turnover fell 4 per cent from Pounds 6.37bn to Pounds 6.15bn. Reduced selling prices accounted for 1 percentage point, falling volumes 1 percentage point and disposals 3 percentage points. Favourable exchange rates increased turnover by 1 percentage point. The sales decline occurred mainly during the second quarter. Half-year trading profits at the pharmaceuticals division rose only 3 per cent from Pounds 233m to Pounds 241m on turnover of Pounds 771m (Pounds 729m). Growth from new products and disposal gains were offset by increasing US generic competition against Tenormin, a beta-blocker for hypertension which is ICI's best-selling drug and the world's fifth largest. Operating profits at the agrochemicals and seeds operations fell 39 per cent from Pounds 154m to Pounds 94m on turnover of Pounds 769m (Pounds 801m). The company blamed wet weather and intensified price competition in the US, as well as European farmers' concerns about the recently announced reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy. Trading profits for the specialities operations were Pounds 36m (Pounds 29m) on turnover of Pounds 655m (Pounds 652). The paints businesses reported profits of Pounds 55m (Pounds 57m) on sales of Pounds 817m (Pounds 789m). Materials recorded profits of Pounds 14m (Pounds 8m) on revenues of Pounds 987m (Pounds 1.021bn), while explosives generated profits of Pounds 21m on sales of Pounds 272m (Pounds 254m). The improvements in the specialities and materials businesses were due primarily to cost reduction programmes. However, Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief operating officer, said profits in the businesses were still unsatisfactory. The industrial chemicals division suffered from squeezed margins created by a combination of recession and over-capacity. The chlor-alkali businesses suffered from high energy costs and production is being kept at only 75 per cent of capacity. The whole division is still looking for cost cutting possibilities. The group as a whole has reduced the number of employees by 5,000. Since July 1990 the total reduction has been more than 19,000, of which 5,000 have been transfered to other companies. The group estimates profits for the first six months have benefited by more than Pounds 100m from this programme.</p>

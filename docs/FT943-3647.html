			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: KKR/Borden KKR's Dollars 2bn bid for Borden looks like a triumph of financial engineering. The leveraged buy-out group is not only acquiring a pasta-to-wallpaper conglomerate which is ripe for a break-up. By paying with shares in RJR Nabisco, KKR has also halved its exposure to the tobacco and food manufacturer. RJR has not been the fabulous investment KKR initially anticipated when it bought it for Dollars 26bn in 1989, mainly because of the cigarette price wars launched on Marlboro Friday. KKR presumably thinks the bulk of the gains from restructuring RJR have already been achieved - a point other shareholders should note. Meanwhile, the share swap between Borden and RJR is designed to facilitate the transfer of some Borden assets to Nabisco. RJR would pay with its Dollars 500m worth of Borden shares. Borden could then sell its RJR stake and use the cash to pay off some of its debt mountain. The deal, though, has industrial as well as financial logic. Borden, in common with most food manufacturers, has seen its brands devalued as retailers and consumers have driven harder bargains. The industry is now aiming to regain some of its lost bargaining power by reshuffling assets and concentrating on fewer product areas. United Biscuits' purchase yesterday of Dalgety's Dutch snack business is another example of the trend. Though Borden has few powerful brand names, its assets should prove more valuable in other companies' hands.</p>

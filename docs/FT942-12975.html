			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Compass plans rights to buy US caterer Shares in Compass Group fell yesterday after the caterer and healthcare company surprised the City with news of plans to buy a US contract caterer for Dollars 450m (Pounds 308m). Compass said it was 'in an advanced stage of negotiations in relation to a substantial acquisition'. About half the purchase price would be funded through a rights issue. The shares closed down 13p at 316p. The target is thought to be Canteen Corporation of America, based in South Carolina, which has an annual turnover of Dollars 1bn. It is owned by Flagstar, which also owns restaurant chains. Flagstar, listed on Nasdaq, incurred losses of Dollars 1.68bn after a Dollars 1.4bn goodwill write-off in 1993 on Dollars 4bn turnover. City analysts were surprised Compass had switched its attention to the US from Europe. Only last July the group, which has grown from a Pounds 167m management buy-out from GrandMet in 1987 to a market capitalisation of Pounds 600m, bought the airport restaurant and contract catering business of SAS Service Partner, a subsidiary of the Scandinavian airline. The Pounds 71.9m acquisition helped lift 1993 turnover by 44 per cent to Pounds 497m and pre-tax profits rose 31 per cent to Pounds 41.5m. One analyst said the speed of the deal suggested the group was seizing an opportunity to get into the Dollars 80bn US contract catering market. Mr Francis Mackay, chief executive, and Mr Roger Matthews, finance director, were flying back to London and were not available for comment.</p>

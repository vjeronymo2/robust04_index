			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 30, IRNA -- If the Serbs do not abide  by their commitments, lasting peace will not return to the  Balkans, Croatian Premier Nikica Valentic told Majlis speaker  'Ali Nateq-Nuri here Saturday. Valentic briefed Nateq-Nuri on  latest developments in the aggressed Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and termed as "good" relations between  Muslims and Croats.    The hojjat ol-eslam said in reply that like the Zionists,  the  two main characteristics of the Serbs are genocide and  expansionism, and they will not be satisfied only with Bosnia.    He deplored the inability of international organizations in  solving the Bosnian crisis and called for lifting of the United  Nations arms embargo against the republic.    On relations between Iran and Croatia, Nateq-Nuri termed as  "positive" the areas of cooperation and called for full-fledged  expansion of bilateral ties.    Valentic arrived here last night.</p>

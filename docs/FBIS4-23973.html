			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpt" of interview with Gbanda N'Zambo Kwatumba, </F> presidential special adviser, by correspondent Kimbabi Shitua on  19 June; place not given--recorded]    [Text] [Kwatumba] After the murder of the Rwanda and  Burundian heads of state, the head of state immediately made  contacts with the presidents of the region, including the  Kenyan, Uganda, and Tanzanian heads of state. I went to see  them in order to organize a consultative meeting in view of the  deteriorating situation that everyone witnessed in Rwanda a day  after the death of President Habyarimana.    Secret diplomatic negotiations were undertaken. I do not  think I am disclosing a secret when I tell you that this action  by President Mobutu was countered by some Western countries --  you can easily guess who they are -- simply because it was  Mobutu who made the proposal. So the death of the poor Rwandan  Africans was not to be taken into account. They did not want  Mobutu to be the one to put an end to the bloodbath in Rwanda.  That is why his initiative seemed hesitant at the beginning  because some Western countries interfered in the process.    But, despite all this, President Mobutu redoubled his  efforts  and, as you are aware, we succeeded in making the warring  factions -- that is the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the Rwandan  Government and the heads of state of the subregion -- sign the  cease-fire agreement separately. After this, you saw all the  efforts that were made by other heads of state of the subregion,  including President Mwinyi who summoned two meetings attended by  the two warring factions. But these two meetings were a failure  because both parties refused to come. Therefore, in the face of  the deteriorating situation and confronted with the role of  troublemakers played by some countries to hinder the quick  organization of a meeting to solve the massacres and genocide,  because the truth is that the horror had overstepped all  boundaries of the imaginable, we thought that it was time to  take it a step further. That is why the head of state made  every effort and used all his diplomatic weight to obtain the  subregional mini summit that took place in Tunis and led to the  signing of the cease-fire by the two warring factions and the  heads of state of the subregion.</p>

Citizens are becoming fund of  politics again.They realize they are protagonists and want to  participate. Resentment towards the parties has relented; there  is interest and there is an effort to understand and cooperate.  "There no longer is the bitterness, for example, when we used  to mention the DC [Christian Democratic Party]...." says Giorgio  Calo, director of Directa, a Milan institute specializing in  opinion polls. Tangentopoli [Bribe City] has swept away an  arrogant, corrupt political system that created hatred in the  country. Now there is a new and evidently credible sense of  involvement. "Today people may be confused, but they are  certainly interested. They feel like they are participating in  the creation of the new Republic," Calo said.    This is an important element that comes from the polls  various institutes are conducting in view of the 27 March  elections. The last poll conducted by Directa says that only 16  percent of those polled is uncertain, doubtful, does not know  what to do. The rest already know how they will vote. Of those  who have already decided, 35.2 percent chose the progressive  grouping, 30.7 percent chose the center of Martinazzoli and  Segni, and 34.1 percent chose a coalition of the right (Bossi,  Berlusconi, and Fini). Therefore it will be an election that  will be decided by a thin margin.    Directa reached these conclusions after having interviwed  1,300 individuals distributed throughout 98 localities, "with a  double stratification, by geographic area and according to the  size of the centers," Calo explained.    Separating certain data shows that Segni and Martinazzoli  forming an imperfect balance at the center: 15.1 percent to the  former and 15.6 percent to the latter. On the right, Bossi's  League comes in at 13 percent, the Snake [Forza Italia] at 9.2  percent, and Fini's National Alliance at 11.9 percent.    Where does Forza Italia, squeezed between the League's north  and the MSI's [Italian Social Movement] south, place itself  territorially? "The movement is well distributed throughout the  country, but more so in the center-south," Calo explained.    The director of Directa adds: "In contrast to the last  administrative elections, where the phenomenon of the politics  of personality was clear, things are different in this election.  Ideologies having gone out the door, values are coming in  through the window. Certainly, the politics of personality  continues, but mostly it involves the top leaders. Today the  voters are facing off on democracy, the social welfare state,  and free enterprise." The director of Directa therefore  pinpoints three factors that will determine the victory or  defeat of the various groupings: the impact of the leader,  values, and what he defines as a "good product," that is, the  quality of the candidate in the electoral college.</p>

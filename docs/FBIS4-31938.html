			<p>BFN     [Text] Negotiations between the republic of Serbian  Krajina and the Republic of Croatia, which were supposed to  convene today in Plitvice, have been called off. As was  announced, the two sides were to talk exclusively about economic  issues. Here is Branislav Bozic reporting from Plitvice:    I cannot tell you why the negotiations have been called off.  They called me on the phone from Zagreb at 1345 and I was told  that the negotiations had been called off since an agreement had  not been reached on the details of the negotiations. I was also  told to withdraw my people, and this is exactly what I am doing  at the moment. This is what Colonel Bill Morton, a Canadian who  is deputy commander of the South Sector in charge of organizing  the conference, told us half an hour ago.    After that, we contacted Milan Martic, president of the  republic of Serbian Krajina, and he told us that the Croatian  side has set forth new ultimatums and is still conditioning the  negotiations on bringing five of their correspondents and all  U.S. correspondents who are in Zagreb, although a reciprocal  decision was agreed upon during the preparations to the effect  that only one of their correspondents and one cameraman can  come, as was the case during the Zagreb talks, when only one  correspondent and one television cameraman from the republic of  Serbian Krajina were there, Martic said.    These negotiations obviously do not suit the Croatian side  and they clearly want to not only postpone but interrupt them  and accuse us in order to be able to carry out the war option.  It is known that they are amassing forces along the borders of  the republic of Serbian Krajina.</p>

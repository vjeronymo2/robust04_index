Attendance costs at such a conference do not need to be included in the budgets of proposed research projects; such costs will be paid from funds provided under a cooperative agreement between CSREES and the University of Maryland for an annual risk assessment symposium. Additionally, a final project report on research results will be required in a fixed protocol, electronic format, suitable for distribution by USDA on CD&hyph;ROM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicable Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This Program is subject to the administrative provisions found in 7 CFR part 3415 (58 FR 65646, December 15, 1993), which set forth procedures to be followed when submitting grant proposals, rules governing the evaluation of proposals, the awarding of grants, and post-award administration of such grants.

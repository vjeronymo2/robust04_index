			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Watmoughs'Pounds 22m rights for Spanish print plant WATMOUGHS, one of the UK's largest printers, yesterday announced a 1-for-4 underwritten rights issue at 350p to raise Pounds 22.3m for a new gravure printing facility in Spain. The Pounds 36m plant will service five year contracts to print Hello magazine - the UK's most recent publishing success - Hola magazine, Hello's progenitor, and Blanco y Negra, a leading Sunday supplement, in Madrid. Mr Patrick Walker, chairman, said the three contracts would require 80 per cent of the new plant's capacity when it comes on stream in spring 1993. It would be profitable at that level from day one. The market welcomed the move, with Watmoughs' shares falling only 7p to 425p having earlier touched 405p on news of the rights issue. The group is forecasting pre-tax profits of not less than Pounds 8m (Pounds 11.6m) for 1991 together with a final dividend of 8p, an increase of 0.25p. Gravure printing of Sunday supplements and magazines like Marie Claire is becoming an increasingly international business. Watmoughs hopes the Spanish plant will give it a platform for the southern European market. Mr Walker hopes to cash in on being a specialised printer, unlike the publishing groups Bertelsmann of Germany and Hachette of France, Spain's main existing gravure printers. The majority stake Watmoughs purchased last year in Revai, a Hungarian printer, has already given it a web-offset capacity with which to develop new markets in eastern Europe, Mr Walker said. The company already has about half the Sunday supplement market in the UK, and also prints travel and mail order catalogues. Since its launch in 1988, Hello magazine has had a marked success in the UK, rising to a weekly circulation of 520,000. Packed with news of the rich and famous - a critical interview is as likely to be printed as a picture of a Calcutta slum. Hola magazine, published with Hello by Hola SA, has an average weekly print run of 750,000 while Blanco y Negro, published by Prensa Espanola, has a 720,000 print run. Analysts expect the plant to be dilutive on earnings this year, requiring an increase in borrowings that will lift gearing to a maximum of 40 per cent before the plant becomes cash generative in 1994.</p>

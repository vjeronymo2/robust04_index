			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. FEARS TERRORIST ATTACK IN EUROPE ON IRAN ANNIVERSARY  </P> <P> The United States is deeply concerned about the possibility of a terrorist  attack against Americans or U.S. installations in Europe to coincide with the  upcoming 11th anniversary of the Islamic revolution in Iran, the State  Department said Thursday.  </P> <P> Deputy department spokesman Richard Boucher recalled that a threat advisory was  issued last December, and he said that threat continues.  </P> <P> The anniversary of Iran's revolution is this Sunday.  </P> <P> Boucher added that the United States has no specific information about any  possible terrorist operation or its target.  </P> <P> "If further credible or specific information on this threat develops, the  department will issue additional alerts to travelers and other concerned  parties," he said.  </P> <P> The Tehran government late Thursday rejected the State Department's warning as  baseless. A press statement issued by Iran's U.N. mission also said that it has  brought "this grave issue" to the attention of the U.N. secretary general.  </P> <P> "The Islamic Republic of Iran categorically rejects the baseless allegation  made by the U.S. State Department, and considers them (sic) vain attempts to  discredit the Islamic revolution," it said.  </P> <P> In his comments, Boucher added that the department is encouraging travelers to  Europe to exercise caution but that Americans are not being urged to cancel  plans they may have to visit the Continent.  </P> <P> The statement issued last December said the concern was based partly on reports  of movement of terrorists from the Middle East and the discovery of weapons  shipments destined for pro-Iranian groups in Spain and Africa.  </P></p>

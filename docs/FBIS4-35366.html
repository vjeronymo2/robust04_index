			<p>BFN     [Text] The Palestinian security forces in the Gaza Strip  have detained an Islamic Jihad activist. According to Islamic  leaders in Gaza the detainee, Hani al-'Abd, is a journalist  working in a local communications center which is connected with  Islamic Jihad. Islamic Jihad people in Gaza say that Palestinian  policemen searched for al-'Abd several days ago. Since he was  not at home, he came voluntarily to the police headquarters in  Gaza, where he was detained. Palestinian security elements in  Gaza confirm that the man was detained. They refused to say  why, but noted that he is the only person currently jailed in  the Gaza prison.</p>

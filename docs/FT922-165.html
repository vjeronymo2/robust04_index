			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Leading Article: No home, no job YOUNG PEOPLE entering higher education in the UK are privileged in many ways. Universities and polytechnics offer a form of training which can bring rich rewards in later life. They also assist their students in making the transition from living at home to independence, with low-cost accommodation in halls of residence or approved lodgings. For those who will not sample these opportunities, entering the world of work can be much harder. Without a job, most young people cannot afford to live away from home. Yet for many, the best hope of a job lies in moving away from home. Thousands of young people end up on the streets of UK cities, from which the chances of finding employment are greatly diminished. Others languish at home in unemployment blackspots. Providing these young people with opportunities requires the sort of low-cost accommodation that helps students make the transition from home to work. One solution lies in foyers, institutions which have flourished in France for decades by providing young people with affordable accommodation, skills training and help in finding jobs - all under one roof. Two foyer projects are already being piloted in Nottingham and Norwich, with five more due to start later in the summer. The launch yesterday of the Foyer Federation is a welcome sign that the concept is about to take root in the UK. So far the pioneering has been done by the voluntary and private sectors. But it is hard to see how affordable accommodation can be provided in high-cost areas such as London under the present system of housing subsidy. French foyers subsidise some of their costs from commercial activities such as running restaurants. While British foyers might hope to do the same in the future, there is a case for public support now to get them established. The cost of dealing with youth homelessness is significant enough to make foyers a horse worth backing.</p>

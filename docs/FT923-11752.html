			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Warrants offered in Wellcome sale SMITH NEW Court, the securities house, yesterday launched an issue of up to 10m warrants intended for investors buying shares in the Wellcome sale. The tender offer of shares in the drugs group, which closes tomorrow, is expected to raise about Pounds 2.6bn for Wellcome Trust, the medical charity which is reducing its stake in the company from 73.5 per cent to about 35 per cent. The warrants are designed to protect holders from a sharp underperformance in Wellcome's shares compared to the FT-SE 100 index in the three months following the sale. Last week, in another move to help demand for the Wellcome tender, Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securites' offered to buy shares in companies to provide liquidity for potential investors. Yesterday the book building exercise was thought to be going well, in spite of the fall in the UK stock market. Wellcome's share price declined by 5p to 829p. The Smith New Court warrants are priced at 33.6p - roughly 4 per cent of the Wellcome share price. They give holders the right to sell Wellcome shares at a 5 per cent discount to the price Wellcome shares would be if they had moved in line with the index. The base price for the Wellcome performance is the issue price, which is expected to be a few percentage points below the market price. Thus, if the shares underperform the index by more than 9 per cent from the issue price, the warrants will have value. Holders can exercise the warrants at any time during the three-month period up to October 27. They can either use the warrants to sell the shares, in which case there will also be a 0.5 per cent charge to cover stamp duty, or take a cash settlement. Mr Lenny Barshack, director of derivatives at Smith New Court, said the warrants would appeal to investors who believed that Wellcome's shares provided good value but wanted protection against further underperformance. They could buy Wellcome shares and match them with warrants to minimise the downside risk. Wellcome shares have underperformed the FT-SE 100 index by more than 20 per cent since the sale was announced in early March, partly pushed down by short sellers. Had the warrants been in issue since June 1989, buyers would have made money in 8 of the following 35 rolling three-month periods. The warrants will be listed on the Luxembourg stock exchange and Smith New Court will make a market in them.</p>

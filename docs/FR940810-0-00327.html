			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Crystals which have different crystal regularity in two or three main directions are said to be anisotropic. They have a different index of refraction in each of the main directions. When such a crystal is inserted between the crossed polars, the field of view is no longer dark but shows the crystal in color. The color depends on the properties of the crystal. The light acts as if it travels through the crystal along the optical axes. If a crystal optical axis were lined up along one of the polarizing directions (either the polarizer or the analyzer) the light would appear to travel only in that direction, and it would blink out or go dark. The difference in degrees between the fiber direction and the angle at which it blinks out is called the angle of extinction. When this angle can be measured, it is useful in identifying the mineral. The procedure for measuring the angle of extinction is to first identify the polarization direction in the microscope. A commercial alignment slide can be used to establish the polarization directions or use anthophyllite or another suitable mineral. This mineral has a zero degree angle of extinction and will go dark to extinction as it aligns with the polarization directions. When a fiber of anthophyllite has gone to extinction, align the eyepiece reticle or graticule with the fiber so that there is a visual cue as to the direction of polarization in the field of view. Tape or otherwise secure the eyepiece in this position so it will not shift.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After the polarization direction has been identified in the field of view, move the particle of interest to the center of the field of view and align it with the polarization direction. For fibers, align the fiber along this direction. Note the angular reading of the rotating stage. Looking at the particle, rotate the stage until the fiber goes dark or ``blinks out''. Again note the reading of the stage. The difference in the first reading and the second is an angle of extinction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The angle measured may vary as the orientation of the fiber changes about its long axis. Tables of mineralogical data usually report the maximum angle of extinction. Asbestos forming minerals, when they exhibit an angle of extinction, usually do show an angle of extinction close to the reported maximum, or as appropriate depending on the substitution chemistry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 4.5.

This is characteristic of birefringent materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The color depends on the difference of the two visible indices of refraction and the thickness of the crystal. The maximum difference available is the difference between the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  and the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> g <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  axes. This maximum difference is usually tabulated as the birefringence of the crystal.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Survey of Malaysia (13): Silicone ousts spice on betel-nut island / State profile of Penang THERE'S A Nirvana Street in Penang. The name may be a little bit of an overstatement but Penang does have a few heavenly qualities. There's the old funicular railway, built by a wayward Swiss engineer earlier this century, that takes you up to the lush, cool heights of Penang hill. There's the esplanade with its food stalls to suit even the most indulgent of stomachs, the old town shophouses, the Indian shrines and Chinese temples. Penang, 'the betel nut island', was a vital British trading port in the 18th and 19th centuries, a collection point for the pepper, rattan, camphor and opium that was traded back and forth between India and China. But now there is more silicone than spice in Penang. The island - and Province Wellesley across the new bridge on the mainland - has grown to be the main centre for Malaysia's electronics industry, the country's biggest export earnings sector. At the last count, 120 factories in Penang, employing nearly 75,000 people, were either directly involved or in some way connected with the electronics and electrical goods industries. Almost all of the world's main electronics companies are there. Intel, with 6,000 workers, has its biggest off-shore plant in Penang. National Semiconductor expects to export more than MDollars 1bn of products from its Penang plant this year. The Penang Development Corporation (PDC), set up in the late 1960s to promote inward investment, estimates that Penang now accounts for about 50 per cent of Malaysia's total MDollars 35bn electronics and electrical equipment exports. From the first, Penang was a pioneer. The PDC set up the first free trade zone in Malaysia in 1972 and, soon after, the electronics firms began arriving, attracted by plentiful supplies of land and labour, with English language skills readily available. Textile companies also invested heavily, though their importance in the local economy has declined by comparison with the electronics sector. Foreign companies could retain 100 per cent equity holdings if they fulfilled certain conditions, including exporting most of their product. They could also have full repatriation of profits. Over the years, Penang has moved into more sophisticated areas of production  -from purely assembly to actual component manufacturing. It now competes with Singapore in many areas. The infrastructure has been improved, and companies give the efficiency of Penang port as one of the major investment attractions. Linkages have developed with local businesses: a multitude of home grown companies, some big, some merely a front shop room, now act as suppliers to the electronics industry. 'Once we have the linkages in place, we feel more secure about these companies' long-term commitment to Penang,' says Ms Lim Pao Li, of the PDC. 'A large proportion of components is now made locally, but we always have to be aware of the changes in the industry and the problems we face.' The number one problem in Penang, as in many other parts of Malaysia, is a shortage of labour. Almost every factory gate has a vacancies sign. Many hundreds of workers have to be bussed in and out of Penang each day from areas several kilometres away. Foreign workers, mainly from Indonesia, have started to be recruited. Factories complain of an increased incidence of 'job hopping'. Penang realises that, in some of the more labour intensive areas, it will not be able to compete with countries that have sufficient labour - particularly Indonesia, Thailand and most recently, Vietnam. A semi-skilled worker in a Penang factory might earn USDollars 10 per day. In Indonesia the equivalent would be USDollars 1.50 per day. A big increase in land prices is also causing many factories problems. And the delicate racial question is never far away from any aspect of Malaysian life. Penang is looked upon as a mainly Chinese island; but Malays say that, though they make up nearly 40 per cent of the population, they have very little economic power. Increasingly, there are calls from the Malay community for a more even distribution of the growing wealth of the betel nut, now silicone, island.</p>

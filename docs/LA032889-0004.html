			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEY DESERVE A RAISE  </P> <P> We Americans are the people of an idea and not of blood or tribe.  </P> <P> We have come from many places and believe many different things. For that  reason, we rely less than other nations on the unspoken consensus born of  custom and tradition. In their place we have a written Constitution whose  principles are elaborated in a dynamic code of law. To foreigners, the legal  system through which we interpret that Constitution and enforce those laws  often appears baroque and contentious. Sometimes it is. But it also is an  historic engine of equality and equity. Faith in our courts and their judges is  an essential article in the American creed.  </P> <P> But while judges, particularly federal judges, stand high in the public's  esteem, they rank rather low on the legal profession's payroll. That is why we  support Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's recent call for Congress to vote  the federal judiciary a 30% raise.  </P> <P> The chief justice made his request at a rare press conference, called after  Congress defeated a measure that would have given a 50% pay increase to its  members, top officials of the executive branch and federal judges.  </P> <P> Rehnquist, however, made a convincing case for letting a judicial pay increase  stand or fall on its own merits. He called the situation urgent, and facts bear  him out: Over the past 20 years, inflation has outpaced judicial pay raises by  223%. While federal judicial salaries now range from $89,500 for a district  judge to $115,000 for the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, private-sector  legal salaries have skyrocketed. Major law firms in Los Angeles currently pay  their partners more than half a million dollars a year, and at big city firms  across the country, first year lawyers often earn more than $80,000.  </P> <P> Rehnquist argued that the growing gap between judges' salaries and those of the  lawyers who appear before them "poses the most serious threat to the future of  the judiciary and its continued operations that I have observed during my  lifetime." He said that without a pay raise, federal judges, who are appointed  for life, increasingly may use the bench as a step on the ladder toward  lucrative private careers. The American Bar Assn. believes that a quarter of  the country's more than 1,000 federal judges may choose to step down for  financial reasons.  </P> <P> This is a telling point, for, as the chief justice pointed out, the federal  tradition of lifetime judicial service "gives you a different kind of judge,  someone simply devoted to judging rather than looking out of the corner of his  eye for the next political opportunity that comes along."  </P></p>

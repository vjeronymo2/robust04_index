			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Losses on deep mines raise sell-off doubts BRITISH COAL failed to make a profit from its deep-mine operations in the first quarter of its financial year, raising further doubts about its attractiveness to private investors in the forthcoming privatisation. Mr Neil Clarke, corporation chairman, told MPs yesterday that the 30 remaining pits in production made small operating losses in the three months from the end of March. This compares with what British Coal calls 'substantial profits' in its first quarter last year. Mr Clarke's disclosure to the employment select committee raises questions about whether British Coal will be able to match last year's operating profits for both deep mine and opencast operations of Pounds 545m, an improvement of Pounds 123m on the previous year. Although it made an operating profit in 1992-93, exceptional costs of Pounds 1.02bn turned this into an overall loss of Pounds 588m, British Coal said last week when it announced its full-year results. British Coal is struggling with a substantial fall both in sales and in prices. The electricity generators are taking just 40m tonnes of coal this year compared with 65m last year, and at prices at least 15 per cent lower. Mr Clarke said after the committee meeting that in spite of the losses the mines were operating ahead of budget. He indicated that results would improve markedly in the rest of the year. The first quarter was punctuated by a high proportion of holidays. In addition, productivity and efficiency improvements were still coming through. In the first quarter productivity was 25 per cent higher than in the comparable period of last year. The improvement last year on the previous year was 20 per cent. Mr Clarke told the committee that the 22,000 employees who have left the industry since October have received redundancy pay amounting to more than Pounds 500m. During the hearing Mr Clarke was closely questioned by MPs about why he had not informed the Department of Employment earlier about plans, announced this month, to make 3,000 redundancies among white-collar workers. In a critical report earlier this year the committee recommended that large employers, including British Coal, should liaise closely with the employment secretary when making job cuts. Mr Clarke said he had kept the Department of Trade and Industry closely informed of developments. He believed it had relayed information to the employment department. He said British Coal was doing all it could to preserve the largest possible coal industry for the future.</p>

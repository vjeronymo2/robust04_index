			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Customs Department Chairman Viktor </F> Lordkipanidze by Rusudan Lordkipanidze: "The Battle Will Be  Merciless. Georgia Has Its Own National Customs Service": place  and date not given]    [Text] Georgia has had its own customs service for  two years now, but we cannot say yet that everything is perfect  and without flaw in it. Most of the public gives it very poor  marks, and not only that, people think it is a money-grubbing  organization, and not without reason, I think. This is also  attested these days by free-wheeling "black business." Of  course, what kind of performance can you expect when this vital  national service has been reorganized almost four times in its  two years of existence, and its officials and customs personnel  have been replaced similarly. How could all of this not leave  its mark on the service's formation? Judge for yourself: the  Georgian Customs Administration of the USSR Customs Committee  was abolished in February 1992 and the Georgian Customs  Department was formed, after which the Department became part of  the Finance Ministry, only to be removed from it soon after and  become a separate Customs Committee. Last year, again, this  Committee was abolished and the Customs Department was  formed.    "It was all new to Georgia, and it had to be learned  empirically, gropingly, following hunches, and sometimes local  officials put their own pockets' interests first," said the  current chairman of the Customs Department, Viktor  Lordkipanidze, a member of Parliament from Ajaria. He was  appointed to the post, quite unexpectedly to everyone, late last  year. Not much time has gone by since then, but it has been long  enough for this man to become adjusted to his new job and to  think out and shape his own future operations program. So I  talked to him and asked, "Can we say, at long last, that Georgia  has its own national customs service?"    [Lordkipanidze] Georgia's state customs service, the  Georgian  Customs Department, with its own customs agencies, laws, rules,  material-technical base, and cadres, does exist legally and in  actuality. It has been recognized and accepted as a member by  the World Association of Customs Organizations; it is a subject  in our republic's bilateral agreements with other countries; and  its chairman is a full member of the Council of Chiefs of  Customs Services of the CIS and an equal member of the heads of  customs services of other countries.    At a press conference not long ago, Batoni Giorgi Chanturia  (who seems to have maintained his interest in Georgia's customs  service) said that Georgia's entry into the "ruble zone" is  "already underway, inasmuch as Georgia's customs service has  already joined Russia's customs service structure."    If such a political somersault is valid, then we can just as  well turn it around with a back flip and say, "Russia's entry  into the coupon zone is already underway, inasmuch as Russia's  customs service has already joined Georgia's customs service  structure."    And so, if we stop juggling words and look into the thing,  Georgia's customs service is a two-year-old child, just getting  on its feet, still learning and developing, but nevertheless  independent and on its own.    Most of these two years have been taken up by wars to  preserve Georgia's territorial integrity, and customs officials  also put on the uniform. And they fought and died, too.    Even between wars, unarmed customs officials have been  repeatedly pelted by legal and illegal armed formations.    Through its own fault, the customs service--and sometimes  with good reason--acquired the image of a money-grubbing  organization. The control agencies didn't waste time: they  quickly created customs control structures and set up detection  headquarters in the customs office.    [Correspondent] Nobody likes constant control, but it is a  fact that the customs service has not been all that spotless....    [Lordkipanidze] People in every era and in every country  have  had no sympathy for tax gatherers and customs officials. It  cannot be disputed, of course, that the people's wrath is well  founded these days. You have to agree, however, that it's  annoying when you have to suffer not only your own lash but  someone else's whip. We customs officials have enough sins of  our own; don't hang other people's on us.    What we need to know is that the customs inspector is  empowered and obliged to follow customs control procedures (and  he does) only with respect to persons crossing the border at  customs checkpoints, in specially designated customs zones.    Customs checkpoints on land are being created only by  agreement with neighboring countries, and on both sides of the  border.    [Correspondent] How many border customs checkpoints are  there  in Georgia right now?    [Lordkipanidze] There are railroad checkpoints at Gardabani  and Sadakhlo;    highway checkpoints at Kazbegi, Lagodekhi, Samtatskaro,  Tsiteli Khidi [Red Bridge], Ninotsminda, Guguti, Sadakhlo,  Akhkerpi, and Sarpi;    maritime checkpoints at Batumi and Poti harbors;    airport checkpoints in Tbilisi and Batumi Airports.    Hence, anybody else who comes up to you somewhere else, on  the highway or at a crossroads, on a train, wearing a uniform or  not, armed or not, with credentials or not, who passes himself  off as a "customs officer" is nothing but a highway robber and a  criminal.    [Correspondent] I don't suppose that means that Customs  Department personnel are all free of sin....    [Lordkipanidze] Of course not. When we carried out the Head  of State's order "On Planned Measures To Stabilize the Situation  In Lower Kartli," we abolished the Bolnisi Customs Office and  fired all its 60 staffers and officials; in Marneuli we set up a  new customs office. In the Poti Customs Office we fired the  chief, and in Sadakhlo we fired the entire 36-man crew of the  customs post, which both local and foreign citizens had been  lodging complaints against. An investigation is underway, and so  far 26 men have been fired.    [Correspondent] Naturally, you will hire new ones to replace  them. Isn't it possible, though, that one robber will be  replaced by another?    [Lordkipanidze] Most of those who have been fired are not  robbers. It's just that, owing to their own subjective and  objective traits they are not able to meet the required  standards. Let me tell you the requirements which an airport  customs post inspector must meet: a college education,  completion of a special customs school or special courses, a  customs service rank, fluency in Georgian and Russian as well as  a working knowledge of another foreign language, age 35 or  under, a "clean" record, good physical condition, good build and  appearance, a high level of culture, and a certificate from a  narcology clinic (some preference is given to women).    After all this, a half-year contract is signed with the  inspector, which will be renewed after the trial period and  certification.    In the past two years, no instruction has been provided; now  this is given priority.    Since 10 January, training has been provided in specialized  courses for persons recruited for customs service. These courses  will be permanent and will be expanded by drawing upon  qualifications-upgrading groups. An agreement has been signed  stipulating that this year about 60 young people will be  enrolled in one-month courses training customs service recruits  in Moscow and Rostov. About 35 customs specialists will upgrade  their qualifications in Moscow. More than 20 will take  short-term study and training courses under Euro-Association  auspices in customs schools and structures of Europe. By summer,  plans call for opening a customs academy in Moscow, and a number  of our young people will be sent there.    I think that Georgia's Customs Service must be depoliticized  not only on paper but in deed, so that the political ups and  downs taking place in the country cannot influence it. Its work  has to be based on high professionalism and obedience to the law  almost to the point of nitpicking.    [Correspondent] Still, what is your impression of the  customs  service from the inside?    [Lordkipanidze] Like others on the outside, I used to see  two  opposed forces--the smugglers trying to carry prohibited or  unauthorized goods out of the country, currency, and historical  and national treasures, and bring in narcotics, other  psychotropic substances, weapons, ammunition, and so on. On the  other side there were the dedicated customs officials who,  sometimes at the cost of their life, tried to prevent smugglers  and narcotics peddlers from breaking our laws and carrying  material goods away. I respected honest customs officials and  hated those who engaged in extortion and made dirty deals with  smugglers and narcotics importers.    If you can believe it, that's the way it really is. That's  why the battle must be without compromise.    [Correspondent] I believe you have a computerized  export-import reporting network. How has it helped you?    [Lordkipanidze] We found that in 11 months of last year  three  times more goods left Georgia than came in. In another time and  another country this would be taken as a positive; and we would  have taken it that way also if we could be certain that all the  earnings from the exports were coming into Georgia and not  ending up in the safes of other countries.    Only 18 percent of the value of goods shipped out of Georgia  on a barter basis came back in the form of commodities.    We have got used to seeing gas, utility services, and other  bills being paid late or not paid at all. Unfortunately, many  state and private structures owe billions to the state treasury.  We have the ability to work with the National Bank, the  Economics and Finance ministries, the Tax Inspection, and other  departments to draft laws, regulations, and directives and,  through the customs service, stop the commodities and currency  drain and recover at least some of the old debts.    The introduction of an effective record-keeping system has  made it possible to assign the Customs Department the task of  assessing and collecting excise and value-added taxes, but  nothing has been done about the fact that the Customs Department  needs a new assessment and collection system of the kind it is  not used to, and highly qualified specialists to run it.  Therefore, it proved impossible to start this effort on 1  February as the law stipulated.    The other day, however, at our request we went to the Head  of  State, and many essential decisions were made.    [Correspondent] What can you tell us about arming customs  officials?    [Lordkipanidze] At first we asked for a 1,500-man customs  security force with a general in charge in order to accommodate  our official functions. But after several rounds of battle  against the criminal world, my "appetite" got smaller. If border  units are strengthened sufficiently, if they can seal off the  smuggling routes and at the same time secure the safety of the  customs posts, we will be content with smaller, mobile,  fast-reaction detachments, well trained and armed with the best  Alpha and Delta traditions, provided with the necessary  transportation facilities--armored vehicles on land, patrol  boats at sea, and helicopters in the sky. The equipment will be  painted white and have its own insignia.    [Correspondent] What do you wish for most?    [Lordkipanidze] To set up posts on the Psou and the other  side of the Roki Tunnel.    [Correspondent] Is that realistic?    [Lordkipanidze] Absolutely. It's just a matter of time!</p>

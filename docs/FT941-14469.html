			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Observer: Bonndage and other vices Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the newly independent Bank of France, has made much of his plans to appear regularly before the National Assembly, thus balancing the fact that he is no longer under the executive's thumb by making himself 'democratically accountable' to the legislature. But who would have thought that his first parliamentary appearance since the central bank's transmogrification would have been before the German Bundestag? Is that not taking independence a scintilla too literally? Apparently it was just unfortunate that, owing to the assembly's crowded calendar, the boss had to wait to testify at home until his February 2 appearance before the finance committee. Still, whatever the logistics, yesterday's cameo appearance in Bonn cannot but reinforce the unfortunate impression of Germany's out and out dominance of European monetary policy.</p>

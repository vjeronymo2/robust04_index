			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Geronin and Aleksandr </F> Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow April 13 TASS -- "Russia has taken a flexible  stance on ways of settlement of the nuclear problem on the  Korean Peninsula. The most important thing for the Russian  diplomacy is that the problem be resolved," said Russian Deputy  Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov in an interview with ITAR-TASS  on Wednesday.    "Our position presupposes that this problem can be resolved  both at bilateral talks and in the framework of the U.N.  Security Council, but even if this yields no results,  possibilities of an international conference should be used,"  Panov said.    According to Panov, a Russia-suggested idea of holding an  international conference on problems of ensuring security and a  nuclear-free status of the Korean Peninsula is being rejected  neither by China, nor by Japan or South Korea. As for North  Korea, at the present stage, Pyongyang is coming out for the  settlement of the nuclear problem only at bilateral talks with  the United States, Panov said.    The Russian diplomat pointed out that Russia cannot agree  with statements that an international conference will  procrastinate the negotiating process. It is bilateral talks  that impede the solution of the problem, he said.    "One cannot say that this is a bilateral problem only. It  concerns the whole world community once at issue is North  Korea's withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  Moreover, this problem mostly concerns countries located in  close proximity to the Korean Peninsula," the Russian diplomat  said.    He spoke on problems of the Korean Peninsula in connection  with talks between heads of the Russian and South Korean foreign  ministries scheduled on Thursday, which would be attended by  South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu who arrived in Moscow  today.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Colour photocopiers adapted for textiles In the US colour photocopying is being adapted to replace traditional silk-screening to print images on everything from T-shirts to boxer shorts. The Xerox Digital Textile Imaging service (XDTI) feeds images - generated on a PC screen or from any paper source - through a Xerox copier and prints them on to special transfer paper. The paper copy is then sent to the XDTI production centre near Seattle, where the images are heat-transferred on to the textile items. The printed image has a resolution of 400 dots-per-inch, compared with an average of 80 dots-per-inch for silk screen printing. It also eliminates the need for multiple screens and inks.

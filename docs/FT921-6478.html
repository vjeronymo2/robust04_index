			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Water sector to spend Pounds 30bn over 10 years THE WATER industry is expected to spend Pounds 30bn in the next 10 years providing construction companies, civil engineers and process plant manufacturers with their biggest bonanza since the development of North Sea Oil, according to a report published today by the National Economic Development Council. The water industry is one of the few areas of construction where investment is increasing, according to contractors which are suffering badly as a result of falling demand for commercial, industrial and residential property. The council said the recession in other areas of the construction market meant that contractors' prices had fallen, enabling water companies to get better value for money and complete investment programmes below targeted prices. It urged water companies to bring projects forward to take advantage of lower prices. The report by the council's construction industry sector group said spending by water companies in England and Wales had risen by 40 per cent in 1990-91 to Pounds 2.48bn and was expected to have increased to Pounds 2.78bn in 1991-92. It said that contrary to some opinions the large spenders, the water services companies, were on target to meet their projected expenditure programmes and that suppliers and contractors were meeting demands with few bottlenecks. Privatisation of the industry in England and Wales meant it was no longer fettered by public sector spending restrictions. The report said European Community requirements to improve water quality meant companies would not be able to delay investment programmes for which finance was already largely assured. It criticised companies, however, for failing to invest sufficient funds in research and development compared with competitors. Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez of France spent Pounds 20m on research and development in 1990-91, almost equal to the total amount spent by the 10 privatised water services companies and nearly five times that of the largest investor, Thames Water Utilities. There was also a danger of imports being sucked in, particularly from the Far East, as lead times and prices for some products increased. The report said the water supply industry, its contractors and manufacturers should use the UK as a spring-board to break into world markets. Capital spending on water by OECD and some Middle Eastern countries was estimated at Dollars 74bn in 1989 compared with Dollars 3bn in England and Wales over about the same period. Pressure to improve water services in developed countries was growing. New water regulations in the US included 38 new drinking water standards. This had led US utilities to increase prices to fund necessary capital invest-ment. The report said that large integrated French companies previously had been particularly successful at breaking into export markets.</p>

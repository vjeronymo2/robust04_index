			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Association planned for UK derivatives industry A TRADE association to represent the futures and options industry in the UK is likely to be proposed formally within a matter of weeks, following the announcement yesterday of a formation group set up to study the idea. The derivatives industry - estimated by one member of the formation group to employ more than 20,000 people in London, up from 5,000 seven years ago - remains one of the largest interest groups in the City not represented by its own trade association. Until now, it has relied on the efforts of the Joint Exchanges Committee, comprising Liffe, the London Fox, the London Metal Exchange and the International Petroleum Exchange. However, the association is intended to represent the over-the-counter markets as well as exchange-traded ones. All four exchanges are represented on the formation group, along with OM London, the London Clearing House, and representatives from eight houses involved in futures and options. Mr Alastair Clark, of the Bank of England, has been appointed as an observer. The group, which first met earlier this week, is expected to meet twice more in the coming weeks before producing a formal proposal for the association. It is chaired by Mr Brian Williamson, chairman of Gerrard &amp; National and a member of the board of the Securities and Investments Board, who is expected to stand down as soon as the formation group has made its recommendation. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) has applied for membership to the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange in order to broker and execute Liffe's newly-launched Spanish bond futures.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Budget deadlock likely DEADLOCK over the Australian government's budget proposals loomed last night when opposition and minority parties in the Senate blocked an attempt to link planned income tax cuts to revenue-raising measures, Nikki Tait reports from Sydney. The government had sought to make its proposed tax cuts for middle-income earners dependent on, and directly linked to, revenue measures mainly consisting of increases in indirect taxation. These have been strongly attacked by the opposition. An amendment, taking out a government-inserted clause which linked the tax cuts and revenue proposals, was passed in the Senate by 39 votes to 23, after the two minority parties, the Green party and the Australian Democrats, joined the opposition coalition in supporting the change. The single Independent in the upper house, Senator Brian Harradine, sided with the opposition. The legislation will now be referred back to the House of Representatives, which has already approved all eight budget bills. But the government has indicated it requires a link between the bills before it will implement the promised tax cuts, due to come into effect in November. One possibility is that a parliamentary stalemate will ensue and the tax cuts be delayed, with the government hoping it can blame the opposition. Debate on the budget bills was continuing in the Senate yesterday.</p>

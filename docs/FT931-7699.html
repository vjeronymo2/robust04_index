			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Cordero deal confirms RTZ US expansion ONLY FOUR days after revealing a strategic thrust into the US coal mining business, RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining company, is adding to its interests there with the acquisition of Cordero Mining from Sun Company, the US oil and gas group, for Dollars 120.5m (Pounds 85m). Cordero operates a low-cost, open pit mine in the Powder River Basin near the three mines which RTZ is to acquire from Nerco, the floundering US natural resources company for which it has made a Dollars 470m agreed offer. Mr Bob Wilson, RTZ's chief executive, said at the time of the Nerco purchase last week that RTZ hoped to buy more Powder River coal, particularly as some of the oil and gas companies represented there seemed to want to quit the business. He said yesterday the Cordero purchase positions RTZ as a substantial coal producer with about 16 per cent of the Powder River coal production: 'RTZ has now established a coal business in the US producing 29m tonnes a year, all from high-quality, long-life mines. We have put together a substantial new business unit, capable of both organic and acquisitive growth.' No further US acquisitions were now in the pipeline. RTZ intends to sell some of the Nerco assets but initially its gearing (debt as a percentage of shareholders' funds) is expected to rise to 63 per cent after the two deals. Mr Wilson said both the big US credit rating agencies had reaffirmed RTZ's 'double A' rating since the Nerco announcement and 'the ratings are not expected to require further review as a result of this deal'. The Cordero coal mine, the seventh-largest in the US, opened in 1976, is 25 miles south of Gillette in Wyoming. It produces 12.1m tonnes of low sulphur coal a year and 63 per cent of production is sold under long-term contracts to mid-western and Texan utilities. At the present production rate, the mine has a 28-year life. Mr Wilson said there is potential to expand annual output at little extra cost to 15.4m tonnes. Cordero is being acquired free of debt and RTZ expects it to make 'a modest positive' contribution to 1993 earnings. As with the Nerco acquisition, the Cordero deal is subject to US government approval. RTZ expects it to be completed in about 30 days.</p>

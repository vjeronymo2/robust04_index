			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Observer: Knock-down prices If in doubt, pick on the immigrant. Venezuela's large community of Portuguese immigrants is feeling the sharp end of a government drive against inflation and so-called 'price speculators'. President Rafael Caldera's officials have raided enterprises large and small, including many owned by Portuguese immigrants. Among punishments meted out have been confiscations of goods, later sold at 'popular' prices by the authorities. Oddly enough all this is taking place after a diplomatic love-in between President Caldera and Anibal Cavaco Silva, Portugal's prime minister - who paid an official visit to Venezuela in June. What can have passed between them?</p>

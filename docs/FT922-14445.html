			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Tokyo steps up environment role JAPAN HAS invited political and financial personalities from around the world to Tokyo next week to discuss ways of raising money to save the environment, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The Eminent Persons' Meeting on Financing Global Environment and Development on April 15-17 will be hosted by Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), which is staging the Earth Summit in Brazil in June, estimates the global cost of environmental preservation at Dollars 125bn (Pounds 72bn) a year from 1993 to 2000. 'I thought that acting as host for this meeting and holding it in Tokyo would demonstrate Japan's intention to play an active role in solving global environmental problems,' Mr Takeshita said.</p>

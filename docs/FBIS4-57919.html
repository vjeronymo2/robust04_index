			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 19 May (PL) -- Today, Colombian ambassador  to Cuba Ricardo Santamaria emphasized the vigorous development  of relations between the two countries and predicted that these  ties will be strengthened in the immediate future.    In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Santamaria recalled  important events that have taken place in the past few hours as  part of the joint efforts by the two Latin American countries.    Yesterday, Camilo Penalosa, Colombia's deputy minister of  economic development, ended a visit to Cuba in which he led a  group of businessmen interested in investing in the island.  There was also the arrival of the Colombian training ship, Arc  Gloria, which brought a message of friendship to the Cuban  people.    The Colombian and Cuban Civil Aeronautics Directorates have  also signed an agreement allowing for prompt establishment of  regular flights, linking their capitals and other cities in the  two countries.    Commenting on the businessmen's visit, Santamaria explained  that this was a positive step in joint business ventures and  that it had exceeded expectations, as face-to-face meetings were  held with people who want to invest in Cuba.    He said the businessmen identified specific points of  cooperation. As part of the next phase of the talks, they  arranged for a new meeting to be held soon in Bogota with  ranking Cuban and Colombian officials in order to reach specific  agreements. He said the visitors exchanged views on prospects  for Cuba's economy and its future, as well as on new methods of  foreign investment approved by the Cuban state.    The diplomat said this type of visit creates a continuity  that gives Colombians direct knowledge of the opportunities that  exist in Cuba to establish ventures beneficial to both countries.    The topic of the aeronautics agreement recently signed was  broached with enthusiasm by Santamaria, who described this as  the principal object of the diplomatic mission's work in view of  its economic importance.    This is done on the basis of a real market because there are  clear prospects for scheduling several weekly flights between  the capitals and other cities in Cuba and Colombia, as evidenced  by the increase in tourist flights this year, he noted. The  ambassador noted how increased travel between the two countries,  not only of tourists but also of businessmen and respective  government officials, will help strengthen bilateral relations  between the two countries. This important agreement was reached  thanks to Cuba's constructive attitude, which can expect of us  all the loyalty expected of a brother country, he said.    Santamaria referred to the negotiations on expanding the  partial agreement, which would represent a significant increase  in commercial bilateral ties. To this end, the Colombian  Government is now consulting with the private sector on tariff  issues, which would affect over 800 products included in the  expansion and which were the object of prior agreements during  the last meeting in Havana.    We hope to sign the respective document between the Cuban  and  Colombian Foreign Trade Ministries this coming June or July,  based on the work that has been carried out and the technical  meetings that have been held, the ambassador concluded.</p>

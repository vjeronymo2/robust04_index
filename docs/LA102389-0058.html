			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Comedian Joan Rivers and writer Ben Stein have agreed to settle her $50 million  libel lawsuit over his magazine story alleging she joked about the death of her  husband. Rivers agreed to drop the lawsuit and Stein agreed to donate money to  charities of her choosing. Richard Grant, Rivers' publicist, said further  details of the settlement will not be disclosed. The Stein story was published  in GQ magazine in December, 1987. The article described "certain events and  conversations prior to and just after the tragic death of Joan Rivers' husband,  Edgar Rosenberg," the statement said. Rivers contended the conversations never  took place. Stein said he used sources he believed to be reliable. He said the  settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing. Stein and the magazine said they  "sincerely regret any inadvertent imputation of negative or inappropriate  conduct." Claudia Puig  </P></p>

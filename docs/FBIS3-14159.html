So lose not heart, nor fall into despair; for ye must  gain mastery if ye are true in faith. If a wound hath touched  you, be sure a similar wound hath touched the others, such days  of varying fortunes we give to men and men by turns. [Koranic  verses]    Brothers, family, our struggling masses, and our  revolutionaries and mujahidin: I address you to express my  appreciation and that of your brothers in the Palestinian  leadership for your superb steadfastness and courageous stand,  which has shown the great qualities of our people, especially at  this time of calamity and hardship.    After the ugly massacre committed by the murderous settlers  and the occupying army, our entire people stood up to defend  their presence, their sacred places, and their dignity, as well  as the hope they hold in their hearts as they wait for the  moment the ugly Israeli occupation ends and the national  authority materializes, leading the way to the establishment of  the independent Palestinian state, with its capital our holy  Jerusalem.    I address you in sincere and clear words; the words of those  who kept the trust and, at the same time, put their life at  risk, to enable our people to win their future, freedom,  dignity, and independence.    With all brotherly feelings and frankness, I emphasize to  you  the importance of standing fast in these critical days. We  should turn a blind eye to what some people are trying to do by  spreading programmed rumors and a climate of despair.    I tell you very frankly that we are facing one of our  fiercest battles at a time when our people, under the PLO, are  banging, with all their strength, on the doors of independence  and freedom. It comes at a time when the world community is  looking forward to seeing the realization of the Palestinians'  rights amidst all the successive events.    It is also one of a series of battles that we have not  stopped fighting since the first bullet was fired on 1 January  1965. These battles were crowned by the start of the great  national intifadah, which is continuing and growing, and which  will continue to escalate until our peoples's objectives are  realized; that is, until the occupation is terminated and the  independence and freedom of our people, territory, and sacred  places are realized.    The settlements were one of the obstacles that we faced, and  are still facing, in our negotiations with the Israelis. The  world community and the international resolutions support us in  this regard and consider the settlements an obstacle in the path  of peace. Therefore, we were always certain that these  settlements would finally be dismantled and the settlers would  leave our land. What is founded on myths is basically wrong.  Events have confirmed the soundness of our position. The world  has also become aware of the seriousness of this matter.  Disarming the settlers has now become a basic starting point  for dismantling settlements and removing them from our territory.    With the cooperation between units from the Israeli Army and  the armed settlers, we are facing the same situation that faced  our Algerian brothers during the first and second Lausanne  Talks. We faced this dilemma in the same way we faced other  dilemmas in the past. They only strengthened our beliefs and  convictions in the justness of our cause. Therefore, we  underlined this position, which is dictated by the national  responsibility, and emphasized the need to provide international  protection for our people and forced the world community to face  its responsibility as regards this dreadful scheme.    While we were fighting a diplomatic battle in the Security  Council to obtain a UN resolution and discussing among the  Palestinian leadership the ways to run that battle, certain  professionals in stirring seditions were sowing the seeds of  suspicion, passing false judgments, and writing false  statements. We did not pay any attention to their falsehoods  because we have always avoided being pushed into side battles  and we have always believed, and still believe, that the battle  is with the occupying enemy. The battle revolves around the  basic contradiction with the occupiers, it is not aimed at  creating confusion, which is the dream of the enemies of the  Palestinian people, the Palestinian homeland, and the  Palestinian presence. Do not call each other by offensive  nicknames. [Koranic verse]    I tell you, brothers, that we have shouldered the trust,  and taken the pledge and the vow--the pledge of the pious  martyrs and their vow. To honor our responsibility, we must  firmly face all tests and trials and their fierceness should  increase our firmness, faith, and determination. In moments of  trial and challenge we must all stand as one with one aim. We  must think of our responsibilities and search for all means of  confrontation, including the assistance of public opinion and  the bodies of international legitimacy, particularly the UN  Security Council and the international and Arab bodies such as  the Arab League, the Nonaligned Movement, the Organization of  African Unity, the Islamic Conference Organization, and all  friends in the world.    We fought fierce battles in the Hebron massacre, the  Jerusalem and 'Ayn Qarah [Rishon LeZiyyon] massacres, as well as  the Sabra and Shatillah and Dayr Yasin massacres, and the  difficult confrontations in Janin and Rafah, the Triangle area,  Galilee, Nazareth, and the Negev.    We have stopped the negotiations with the Israelis and have  clearly announced that they will not be resumed before our  people have obtained all guarantees to provide international  protection for them and before the powder keg of the  settlements, which is threatening the peace process, is removed  and the perpetrators of the murders have been punished. The  battle will not stop at this stage. We have many other details  and our agenda contains fateful issues that require just  solutions so that just peace can be established.    One of the urgent issues is the question of our detained  brothers in the prisons of occupation. We will neither sleep  nor rest until all of them win their freedom so that they can  participate in the battle of building our national authority and  independent state. We have resolutely refused all enemy  attempts to categorize or classify them and refused the release  of the Fatah detainees alone, despite the fact that they form  the majority of the detainees. We insisted that all must be  treated in the same way because they are the beloved sons of  Palestine.    At these difficult moments, I appeal to you to stand united  to confront this new situation. I ask our people everywhere to  close ranks, realize national unity, and keep their hearts  united at moments of difficulty and trial. We are a people of  martyrs, revolutionaries, and mujahidin. I ask our people to  expel all instigators of sedition and divisions from their  ranks. Despite this darkness, the light of dawn is coming. The  dawn and victory are coming. This ugly repression by the  occupation authorities and their settlers remind us of the  repression, tyranny, and killing that usually intensifies just  before peoples win their independence. One salient example come  to mind at this moment -- the movement launched in Algeria by  the hardline French settlers and their supporters from the  military on the eve of Algerian independence. We must learn  these lessons and understand these signs and defeat the Israelis  extremists who are trying to hinder our triumphant march toward  independence and an independent state whose capital will be holy  Jerusalem. That even the apostle and those of faith who were  with him cried: When will come the help of God? Ah, verily the  help of God is always near. [Koranic verse]    Brothers and sisters, our struggling people. The Israeli  authorities are continuing the same policy despite agreements  signed with them to begin a new phase on the way to establishing  a just peace. The Israeli soldiers are continuing their  repression, attacks, and crimes, firing at children, women, and  the elderly. In this way, Israel has continued to violate the  Declaration of Principles. We have the right to seek all  legitimate means of response and to look for all prospects that  suit us to foil the attempts of circles hostile to peace in the  Israeli military establishment and the armed settlers--circles  that have had free rein to spread destruction and anarchy in  their attempts to stop the wheels of history. We genuinely want  peace, but we reject capitulation.    We seek a just peace and will not submit or surrender. We  will not transform the peace agreement into an agreement of  submission. I tell you that the Palestinian blood will not be  cheap. This blood ignited the torch of our struggle and  jihad--a torch that will not be smothered, with God's help. In  honor of this blood, we will adopt all measures and stands  required by our people's supreme national interests. We greet  all the steadfast people in Hebron and in all parts of our  beloved homeland. Greetings from revolutionaries to  revolutionaries, the pledge of free men to free men.    On the eighth day of this month, the world celebrated  international women's day while the Palestinian women stood  firmly amid fire, bidding farewell to the martyrs and facing the  occupiers' bullets and repression with indignation, sacrifices,  and martyrdom. We greet the great Palestinian woman and we  pledge to her that in the coming years she will celebrate  women's day in a free, independent, and democratic homeland for  the people of free and revolutionary men.    Sisters and brothers, I renew my pledge and vow to you. I  tell you that difficulties will only increase our strength,  faith, and firmness. A hammer breaks glass but flattens iron.  We have taken speedy steps and offered thousands of martyrs and  will not cease our struggle in all forms until our people obtain  their full rights. Let this triumphant march continue. The path  to the independent state still requires sacrifices, struggle,  and suffering. However, our indefatigable stamina and  unconquerable determination will continue. God bless our  people, the generous people of martyrs and sacrifices. In the  name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. God's good  pleasure was on the believers when they swore fealty to thee  under the tree. He knew what was in their hearts and he sent  down tranquility to them; and he rewarded them with a speedy  victory. [Koranic verse]    Revolution until victory.    Your brother, Abu 'Ammar</p>

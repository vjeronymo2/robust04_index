The government invested about 25 million yuan in the  construction of markets in recent years. Some 99 market places  were established or reconstructed with the building area  totalling more than 100,000 square meters.    The investment in the markets greatly improved efficiency.  Last year the transaction value on free markets in urban and  rural areas in Tibet was more than 900 million yuan, accounting  for 47 percent of the region's total retail sales.    The development of markets has enhanced the commodity sense  of farmers and herdsmen and markets have played a growing role  in promoting the production of agriculture and animal husbandry.    Tibet has also set up some specialized markets for trading  in  herbs, animal products, timber, rolled steel and automobiles.    It has opened 28 markets on the frontiers to increase its  trade with neighboring countries such as India, Nepal and Bhutan.    This year Tibet will set up auction markets and a job  placement center so as to promote its market economy.</p>

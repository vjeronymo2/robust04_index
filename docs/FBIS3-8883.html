			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Immediately after the swearing-in ceremony of the  new Slovak Government, Slovak President Michal Kovac addressed  the members of the new government.    [Correspondent Anna Samelova] President Michal Kovac has  just  finished his address to the new Slovak Government. I shall  acquaint you with the most important ideas in his speech.    At the beginning, President Michal Kovac said that, even if  governmental changes were a natural part of the political life  of democratic countries, the Slovak Republic was still too young  a state not to experience every such change with particular  sensitivity and tension.    He told the new Cabinet ministers that, apart from  fulfilling  the duties deriving from their offices, they would have to calm  a population that had been made to feel insecure, and they would  have to conciliate the incomprehensible and dangerous hostility  among various groups of citizens.    He went on to say--I quote: You have entered the government  I am inaugurating today on the basis of the agreement made among  a number of political groups. You represent a very broad  spectrum of views. Within the extremes of this spectrum, there  is something that you all can and must share--protecting the  interests of the young Slovak state and the substantial majority  of its population. You must make the Slovak Republic a  recognized part and a reliable partner of democratic Europe as  soon as possible. You must enable the citizens to provide a  comfortable life as soon as possible, without worrying about the  bare necessities of life.    In the next part of his speech, President Kovac asked the  members of the government not to think of their inauguration as  starting from zero. Rather, they should preserve the continuity  of the government and the state and become the guarantee of this  continuity. They should become a government that does not want  to abolish but, rather, create, one that wants to continue  everything worthwhile done by the previous government.    In this connection, Kovac went on to say that the Slovak  parliament disagreed with the autocratic style of the prime  minister and some members of the previous government, refuted  the significant trend toward the concentration of power, and  made a stand for the protection of democracy and morality in  political life. This, however, does not mean, President Kovac  said, that the good results of the previous government and its  prime minister and everything useful that they did for the  Slovak citizens should be discredited.    The president then thanked Vladimir Meciar and his  government  for every positive step of his Cabinet and praised, in  particular, the merits of Vladimir Meciar for the creation of  the Slovak Republic's state sovereignty.    He also said it was a good sign that the political  representatives of our Hungarian fellow citizens had also  expressed support for the new government and, in this way, had  declared their loyalty to the Slovak Republic. This makes it  possible to implement a political line that would enable all  groups among the citizens of Slovakia to see the new government  as their own.    The circumstances in which this government has been formed  and the current political reality, President Kovac went on to  say, establishes as one of the government's most important tasks  the securing of a dignified and calm run-up to the elections in  such a way as to remove any possible doubts about democracy in  the Slovak Republic.    President Michal Kovac then described three conditions for  creating a favorable--i.e., peaceful--atmosphere in our society.  One of them is the cooperation of all constitutional  institutions--the president, the government, and the parliament.  The second is proper relations between the government and the  opposition and their mutual respect. The third is the  cooperation of the government with the state administration on  lower levels, without insensitive and directive interference  from above.    Of equal importance are proper relations with the  institutions of local self-administration.    According to Kovac, the first condition for creating a  positive image about Slovakia at home and abroad, as an  attractive state with good prospects, is to put public life at  home in order.    The president said he believed that the new government would  recognize its great opportunity to send an important and  long-awaited signal abroad that Slovakia was a consolidated and  stable country, that its democratic character could create a  good foundation for all-round, useful cooperation with every  serious political or commercial partner.    The president said at the end--I quote: The citizens of the  Slovak Republic deserve a good government that gives preference  to their interests over the interests of influential egoists.  They deserve a government that caters for a peaceful life for  all citizens without any preference, whichever political camp  they belong to or even if they belong to no political camp. You  have the opportunity and also the duty to become such a  government. With this trust, I have given you today the letters  of appointment as members of the Slovak Government, and, with  this trust, I wish you professional and personal happiness, that  citizens understand all of your decisions, and that, in the  shortest time possible, the population name you the government  of successful cooperation. With these words President Michal  Kovac ended his speech.</p>

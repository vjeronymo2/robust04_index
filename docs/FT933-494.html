			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / World Bank ready to help peace process THE World Bank is ready to move ahead with economic help for the Israeli-occupied territories, South Africa and Vietnam, Mr Lewis Preston, the bank's president, said yesterday, writes Peter Norman. Declaring that 'we are well prepared to invest in peace,' Mr Preston said the bank had been working 'over the last several years' with all parties in South Africa to help draw up an economic support programme. The bank had been working on policies for the occupied territories over the past year. Speaking at the opening of the IMF and World Bank annual meetings, he said that the world was changing faster than at any time since the second world war and the bank was having to change too. Developing countries had become a powerful force in the world economy. In the past five years, they accounted for more than a quarter of the rise in global imports. They were expected to contribute about a third of the growth of world output over the next five years. East Asia was 'positioned to become the world's fourth major growth pole by the end of this decade'. But their economies and problems were differentiated. Fast growth in east Asia contrasted with persistently high levels of poverty in Africa. To improve its effectiveness, the bank had: Changed its organisational structure to focus on poverty reduction as its main objective and rapidly increased its activities on the environment so that environmental projects have become the fastest growing section of its portfolio. Boosted lending to the private sector and tripled over three years its support for 'human resource development,' such as education. Taken steps to improve the quality of its loan portfolio. Expanded public access to its documents and set up an independent inspection panel to strengthen accountability.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Air France in Euro Disney deal EURO DISNEY, the theme park east of Paris, said yesterday that it had appointed Air France its sole official airline and would not be renewing contracts with British Airways, Aer Lingus, Lufthansa and Alitalia, Michael Skapinker reports. Euro Disney said that after a year of operation it had decided to abandon its practice of having a preferred airline in each of its main European markets. It said it wanted Air France to represent it throughout Europe. Earlier this month Euro Disney had announced that Mr Robert Fitzpatrick was resigning as chairman to make way for Mr Philippe Bourguignon, a Frenchman. The four airlines whose contracts are not being renewed were 'preferred travel partners', which meant that they were permitted to use Euro Disney promotional material and logos in their advertising. Euro Disney said its decision to drop British Airways was not related to controversy surrounding the UK carrier's 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin Atlantic. Air France will become Euro Disney's preferred carrier immediately throughout Europe, except for the UK, Ireland, Germany and Italy, where it will assume the role from the beginning of April.</p>

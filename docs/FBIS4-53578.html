			<p>BFN     [Text] A new political party is being formed in Vanuatu by  a breakaway faction of the National United Party [NUP] of former  prime minister Father Walter Lini. The People's Democratic  Party is led by three government ministers who were expelled  from the United Party last week. They are Deputy Prime Minister  Sethy Regenvanu, Health Minister Edward Tabisari, and  Communications Minister Cecil Sinker. The three make up the  junior partner in the coalition government of the Union of  Moderate Parties. They have been joined by the former  agriculture minister, Oneyn Tahi, who accused the NUP of being  dictatorial when he resigned from the party.    Mr. Regenvanu said in launching the new party last night  that  the objective of the People's Democratic Party would be a fair  sharing of resources to the advancement of Vanuatu and its  people.</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Jobs loss in London 'to hit record' UNEMPLOYMENT IN London will rise to a post-war high of about 510,000 or 13 per cent in 1994, according to the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry's annual economic review. The report predicts that nearly 100,000 more jobs will be lost by 1994, with much of the rise coming from service sectors and construction. Official figures understate London's job losses as they do not include all commuters, it adds. Over the past two years 300,000 jobs have been lost in London. Ms Jacqui Ginnane, the chamber's chief economist, said: 'Our forecasts show that the London economy will remain weak into the mid 1990s.' The chamber expects GDP in London to grow by only 0.6 per cent in 1993 after falling by 2.4 per cent this year. Some parts of financial and business services, which account for nearly a quarter of London's GDP, may see better trading next year but will continue to improve productivity and cut jobs, it argues. Manufacturing, which after several years of decline accounts for only 13 per cent of London's GDP, is expected to raise output by 1 per cent in 1993 after a 2.2 per cent fall this year. The report blames weakness in consumer demand for much of the lack of recovery. Consumer spending is expected to grow by only 0.9 per cent next year after falling 1.2 per cent this year. Ms Ginnane said: 'No single sector is strong enough to lead the way out of recession and we must therefore look to public-sector investment.' London's perceived affluence had resulted in under-investment in the capital, she added. London's Economy: Trends and Prospects, London Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 071-248 4444. Pounds 95.</p>

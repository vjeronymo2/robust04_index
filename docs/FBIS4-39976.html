			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer Mikhail Zotov] A news conference took  place in the government building on Krasnaya Presnya in Moscow  today. Its theme was the intensification of the fight against  crime which the power ministries are planning in the near future.    Vladimir Rubanov, deputy secretary of the Security Council,  said that the benefit gained from the additional anti-crime  measures, calculated according to UN methods, should be about 10  trillion rubles. Five trillion rubles will be spent on the  measures themselves, and the Security Council will oversee the  conduct of the campaign.    Aleksey Ilyushenko, acting procurator general, said that the  procuracy would coordinate this work. In view of the provisions  of the draft law on the fight against crime which permit the  Interior Ministry to introduce agents into commercial structure,  to create sham firms, and to work with securities, journalists  raised the question of corruption. Viktor Yerin replied to this:    [Begin Yerin recording] We have special structural units  which directly and on their own initiative engage in operational  work among their own personnel, revealing unscrupulous people.  [end recording]    [Zotov] And although Viktor Yerin considers that one must  not  violate the law oneself while fighting illegality, the  participants in the news conference on intensifying the fight  against crime were unanimously of the opinion that if the  legislation was not in accord with the necessary measures to  combat crime, it must be changed.    Sergey Stepashin, director of the Federal  Counter-Intelligence Service, pointed out to those assembled  that the counter-intelligence service was restoring its  investigative apparatus and that about 800 experienced personnel  had already returned.    [Begin Stepashin recording] The president gave the go-ahead  and draft decrees are now being prepared by [word indistinct]  together with us, and these decrees on creating a directorate of  active operations will be signed, most likely next week. It is  rather broader than the Vympel group. It will be a directorate  not only of the central apparatus but will also operate in a  number of regions, in particular in St. Petersburg, in  Krasnodar, in Yekaterinburg, in Novosibirsk, and in Murmansk.

The U.S. Congress has just approved, and  President Clinton has sanctioned, a new law granting subsidies  to private shipyards. For the next 10 years, 70 of the 151  ships that comprise the U.S. merchant fleet will receive $2.1  million per year to finance their operations.    This law is the most important piece of maritime legislation  to be approved since the United States approved the first  subsidy for the sector in 1936 (now they subsidize the salaries  of the sector employees). The law was sponsored by Deputy Gerry  E. Studds of the Democratic Party, Massachusetts. It was  approved in Congress by 347 votes to 65. It seeks to stimulate  naval construction in the country and to strengthen the U.S.  merchant fleet which was reduced from 620 ships 28 years ago to  151.    The subsidy will be granted to all merchant ships sailing  under U.S. flag that are suitable for military use. The subsidy  will help U.S. shipyards to make their shipbuilding prices  competitive on the international market. If U.S. shipyard  prices are higher than those of another country, the U.S.  Government can also grant subsidies to shipowners who choose to  have ships built abroad.    Sergio Salomao, president of the National Union of Maritime  Navigation Enterprises (Syndarma), has said this new subsidy  enables U.S. shipowners to make new investment, increase the  level of their services, and reduce still further their freight  prices which are already about 30 percent less than those of  Brazilian companies.</p>

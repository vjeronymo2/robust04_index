			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Hodgson confirms thirst for Hoskins MR HOWARD Hodgson, one of the more flamboyant entrepreneurs of the 1980s, yesterday returned to the London stock market as the biggest shareholder and chief executive of Hoskins Brewery, the Leicester-based real ale brewer. The move, which ends almost a year of friction between the brewer's board and disgruntled shareholders, added 20p to the company's shares when dealing resumed on the USM after a three-month suspension. The shares closed at 76p. Mr Hodgson said yesterday: 'I believe Hoskins represents an excellent opportunity for us to expand the business into a substantial public company with growing profits and earnings.' He heads a new but experienced management team with Mr James Roe, a former director of NM Rothschild, who becomes non-executive chairman; Mr Shaun Dowling, chairman of Hartstone Group and a former director of Guinness, and Mr Bill Caldwell, who retired last year after 22 years as a partner in Price Waterhouse, are appointed non-executive directors. Coopers &amp; Lybrand have been appointed as the company's financial adviser, and Peel Hunt as its stockbroker. Mr Hodgson has paid Pounds 303,500, or 55p a share, to acquire a 9.6 per cent stake in Hoskins from the Hoar brothers who have been running the company. Other members of his team have bought a further 3.4 per cent. Mr Barrie Hoar, the former chairman, and Mr Robert Hoar, a director, together with their families, have also disposed of another 9.5 per cent holding which has been placed with institutions. The Hoars, who have twice faced shareholder moves to remove them in the past year, received about Pounds 715,000 from the deals which value the company at Pounds 3.14m. The family retains a 7 per cent interest. Mr Barrie Hoar will remain a non-executive director for the time being but his brother has resigned from the board. A group of dissident shareholders which had been challenging the Hoar brothers' management of the company yesterday formally withdrew their requisition for an extraordinary meeting. Mr Hodgson approached the Hoars a week ago after the collapse of Hoskins' negotiations with Swithland Estates, a private company run by Mr Adam Page, former chairman of Midsummer Leisure. Swithland was proposing to reverse some of its theme bar businesses into Hoskins - which owns four pubs as well as a brewery - in exchange for 41 per cent of the equity. 'James Roe and I spent several months putting our team together and searching for the right opportunity,' Mr Hodgson said. The new team aims to increase distribution of Hoskins' beers, building present production from 1,300 barrels a year to 5,000, but has no ambitions to become a large-scale pub retailer. 'In view of the narrow base of its business operations, the company's best long-term interests may well be served by developing the business into complementary areas,' Mr Hodgson said. The company plans to embark on a series of acquisitions though Mr Hodgson said no targets had yet been identified. 'Our intention is to look for mature businesses, not start-ups or turnrounds, that are cash generative and in expanding markets. Our small head office - to which we have yet to recruit a finance director  - would act as a portfolio manager, overseeing a number of profit centres rather than getting involved in the day-to-day running of the businesses.' Mr Hodgson used similar acquisitive tactics to build his family firm of funeral directors, which he bought for Pounds 14,000, into PHKI, the UK's largest quoted funeral services company with a capitalisation at one time of Pounds 100m. In the process, he transformed the public image of the undertaker by introducing stretched Volvo limousines in midnight blue and dressing his staff in Portland grey livery. He was named USM Entrepreneur of the Year in 1987 but resigned as chairman of the company in 1991, selling his shares for an estimated Pounds 6.5m. Last year, he published a book about his experiences, entitled How To Become Dead Rich.</p>

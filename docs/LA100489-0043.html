			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISUNITY IN L.A.;  </P> <P> BLACKS FACE GRIM FUTURE IN POLITICS  </P> <P> For the black political community in Los Angeles, the future became grimly  obvious in the autumn of 1986.  </P> <P> The city's senior black leadership had gathered to anoint the next of the  chosen, the politician they hoped would succeed retiring David S. Cunningham  Jr. in the city's perennially powerful 10th District City Council seat.  </P> <P> The selection was pivotal. The council's two other blacks -- physically frail  Gilbert Lindsay and Robert Farrell, soon to be targeted by a recall effort --  held tenuously onto power. A unanimous selection could have installed the  eventual successor to Mayor Tom Bradley as the city's foremost black  politician.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Felt Spurned  </P> <P> But discord ravaged the effort.  </P> <P> Bradley and Cunningham endorsed one candidate. Many women supported another.  Some politicians backed former State Sen. Nate Holden, who eventually would  win. Young blacks, ignored by their elders, felt spurned.  </P> <P> "There was an air of distrust," Bradley recalled. "We could not get a  successful coalition."  </P> <P> Since then, the schisms have intensified. Politically, the black community in  Los Angeles is riddled with divisions, its once-certain unity split between  honored elders and anxious young, between the sometimes contradictory ambitions  of women and of men, between traditionalists and those who seek a new black  agenda.  </P> <P> While Bradley, now 71, serves what most believe will be his final term, no  dominant black political figure has arisen to eventually assume the mayor's  mantle of leadership. Many black activists in Los Angeles worry openly about  holding onto other black-controlled seats.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Critical Confluence  </P> <P> The divisions come at a critical confluence, as the community confronts the  rising political surge of Latinos and Asians and copes with the  conflict-of-interest controversy clouding Bradley, who for 16 years has towered  as a symbol of black political success.  </P> <P> The concerns of the city's blacks are far from isolated. Indeed, they flow from  a troubling national phenomenon: Despite the emergence of some powerful black  politicians, the promise of a generation ago -- a heady time when desire and  opportunity conspired to fling open the doors to public office -- has hardly  been fulfilled.  </P> <P> Mark Harris, a 32-year-old Los Angeles native regarded as one of the brightest  stars of the incoming generation of black political activists, describes the  future bluntly.  </P> <P> "Black elected officials are an endangered species," Harris said.  </P> <P> With few exceptions across the nation, blacks ushered into office by the civil  rights movement have grown old in elective jobs that have proven thus far to be  dead ends. Young, politically active blacks, frustrated that their elders have  not moved up, are increasingly looking to challenge them for primacy. Latinos  and Asians increasingly pose a challenge.  </P> <P> Nationwide, the number of black elected officials has grown each year since  1970 -- but the rate of increase has slowed to a crawl. In California, despite  the prominence of elected blacks such as Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, blacks  hold 1.6% of elected offices, well below their nearly 8% share of the  population. Black officials themselves see little chance of mounting a  successful run at statewide office, and few are optimistic that their numbers  will increase significantly.  </P> <P> "We had a surge, we reached a plateau -- and we've leveled off for some period  of time," Bradley, now in his fifth mayoral term, said in an interview.  </P> <P> To Harris and many others, the only hope for a resurgence of black politicians  comes in a delicate arrangement of coalitions between blacks and other  minorities -- and an unprecedented effort by black politicians to run for  office in areas dominated by white voters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Historic Reluctance  </P> <P> But that will require both an easing of racial tensions and a complete reversal  of white voters' historic reluctance to support the ambitions of blacks. Harris  recently confronted a reminder of just how long the odds are:  </P> <P> The airport shuttle bus eased up to a Century City office tower where Harris,  an elegantly turned-out senior executive for the California State Bar Assn., a  graduate of UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall law school and a seasoned alumnus of  myriad political campaigns, was to attend a meeting. A traffic jam marred the  tower's entrance.  </P> <P> The shuttle bus driver, a white, remarked on his passenger's race: "Now that  you're here, I guess all those cars can get parked."  </P> <P> For blacks in Los Angeles, the roster of current black elected officials reads  like a tribute to the elections of the 1970s, testimony to how much was  accomplished then -- and how little things have changed since.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, most of the black state and high-ranking city officials are in  their 50s -- at least. Councilman Gilbert Lindsay is 88; U.S. Rep. Augustus  Hawkins is 81; Bradley is 71. Councilman Nate Holden is 61 and Rep. Mervyn  Dymally is 63. Locally based legislators Bill Greene, Teresa Hughes, Willard  Murray, Diane Watson, Maxine Waters and Julian Dixon range from 51 to 58.  </P> <P> Among the politicians frequently mentioned as contenders for Bradley's mayoral  job, in contrast, are 37-year-old Michael Woo, 40-year-old Zev Yaroslavsky,  41-year-old Gloria Molina, 46-year-old Richard Alatorre -- all members of the  City Council -- and 39-year-old City Atty. James K. Hahn. Each represents a  younger generation and other political constituencies -- Asian, Jewish, Latino  and white.  </P> <P> There is no widespread discontent with the black leadership simply because of  their age. But many politically active blacks are concerned that -- without an  infusion of youth -- other groups represented by younger and more dynamic  politicians will move to the forefront. According to blacks, challenges to the  elders have thus far been forestalled by the black community's loyalty to its  political trailblazers.  </P> <P> That loyalty and sentiment has masked a growing ineffectiveness on the part of  some senior black politicians, said one member of the city's black political  elite.  </P> <P> "The community pays a tremendous price for sentimentality," he added, echoing  the private concerns of many of his peers.  </P> <P> If many of the blacks now in office are troubled at their difficulty in moving  up the political ladder, young blacks who have been waiting on the sidelines  for their chance are even more frustrated.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Choice  </P> <P> One young political aspirant cites a local commandment: "Thou shalt not  criticize, nor worse yet run against, an incumbent in the black community."  With the logjam, though, some young blacks say they have no choice but to  challenge their elders at the ballot box.  </P> <P> "The joke around the country is that California has the oldest black elected  leadership -- once you get into office, you die in office. It's guaranteed,"  said 35-year-old Inglewood Councilman Daniel Tabor, the first vice president of  the National Black Caucus of Local Elected Officials.  </P> <P> Tabor tried to compete and felt the consequences. In 1988, he challenged Curtis  Tucker for the state Assembly seat that the 70-year-old Tucker had held for 14  years. Tabor lost in a battle punctuated by Tucker's vows of revenge.  </P> <P> Still, Tabor vowed, "There are going to be skirmishes, maybe even wars within  the African-American community for political leadership. You begin to wonder,  'How are you going to do this peacefully?' and I just don't see a peaceful  solution. We need new, aggressive thinking . . . but unless we take the people  out who are already there, we're not going to get it."  </P> <P> The next race likely to attract the younger generation will be an expected 1991  clash between two blacks -- Councilman Robert Farrell and challenger Kerman  Maddox -- for the seat Farrell has held since 1975. In late 1987, Maddox helped  lead what proved to be an unsuccessful recall effort against Farrell, whom he  criticized as not responsive to the community's concerns. While Farrell is only  51, he carries the support of older black leaders, who were angered by the  35-year-old Maddox's recall effort.  </P> <P> According to Maddox, "this tremendous gap" has emerged between his generation  of politically involved blacks and their older counterparts.  </P> <P> "A lot of us feel, 'How much longer do we have to wait before we get an  opportunity? How much longer will Gil Lindsay be there? How much longer for Gus  Hawkins?' "  </P> <P> David S. Cunningham III, a Los Angeles attorney and son of the former  councilman, is less inclined than Maddox to chastise older politicians. Still,  he said wryly: "Martin Luther King at 26 was ready for a leadership position.  Unfortunately, if we had someone like that today, he might be confronted with  the response, 'You're much too young and your ideas are sort of radical.' "  </P> <P> The younger generation is banking that conditions in the black community have  deteriorated to the point where loyalty to the elders might be discarded. The  younger blacks stress a two-pronged approach on issues: More emphasis must be  placed on black entrepreneurship and economic development in the inner city,  and black officials at all governmental levels must work together to solve  problems such as drug use and gang warfare.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Liberally Oriented Leanings  </P> <P> But the young -- like their elders -- recoil from being defined solely by  inner-city issues, and in many ways they share the same liberally oriented  leanings of their forebears.  </P> <P> "I care about the environment; I care about public schools, not because I can't  afford private schools," said Los Angeles lawyer Cynthia McClain-Hill, one of a  group of young black professionals working as fund raisers and advisers for  black politicians. "I'm concerned about oil drilling because I like the beach a  lot."  </P> <P> To the young, the entrenched politicians have prevented a growth in political  activism among poorer blacks by failing to rally voters with registration  drives and the like. They also criticize the elders for failing to groom  replacements with ties to the poorer communities and of refusing to work  together to benefit the poor.  </P> <P> To the old, the younger generation has moved so quickly to trade its education  for personal financial gain that it has lost sight of fellow blacks who have  not made it. Few of the young, compared to past generations, have dedicated  themselves to public service, the elders say. The elders look to the youthful  ambitions with a mix of offhanded disdain -- and fear.  </P> <P> "Even though the old guard's a little long in the tooth, they have not become  politically senile," said the Rev. Cecil L. Murray, the senior minister at  First A.M.E. Church, the oldest black congregation in the city. "The danger is  if they (the challengers) divide the black electorate. . . . It frightens me,  but as I look at reality I see the division will cause us to lose some  territory."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sharp Concern  </P> <P> Losing territory is of sharp concern. Blacks are generally under-represented as  it is, and like all political minorities have more confidence in  representatives who share their background than in those who do not.  </P> <P> The division between generations comes into stark relief in the persons of  Almena and Melanie Lomax, two members of a highly political Los Angeles family.  Almena Lomax, who admits to being more than 70 when it comes to age but loses  her candor there, remains optimistic about the chances for black politicians  overall. And she dismisses entirely the notions that young leadership is needed  for the future.  </P> <P> "Dianne Feinstein -- she's no ingenue," Lomax said, referring to the former San  Francisco mayor and current Democratic gubernatorial candidate, who is 56. "Why  do we have to have somebody under age 45?"  </P> <P> But to her daughter Melanie Lomax, a 38-year-old attorney and former general  counsel for the local NAACP, the emergence of younger leaders armed with a  newly sculpted, economics-dominated black agenda is essential. Without them,  she characterizes the chances for black political success as "bleak."  </P> <P> "She likes to remind me of the accomplishments of her generation," Melanie  Lomax said of her mother. "I acknowledge all her generation has done, but it's  time for a new generation. I tell her, 'It's time for the second revolution.' "  </P> <P> In Almena Lomax's younger days, when the civil rights movement suffused the  black community with unity, the way to political prominence was clear and  alliances were simplified: blacks and Jews worked together, their efforts  uncomplicated by the relatively small population of Latinos and Asians.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Numbers Mounted  </P> <P> Propelled by the civil rights struggle and in particular the landmark Voting  Rights Act of 1965, the numbers of black elected officials mounted in the  1970s, in Los Angeles and elsewhere. In California, Wilson Riles won election  as state schools superintendent and Mervyn Dymally moved from the state Senate  to the lieutenant governor's office.  </P> <P> Locally, some who already held office, such as Bradley, moved up. Others who  today serve as the core of black leadership -- Rep. Julian Dixon, State Sen.  Diane Watson and Assemblywomen Maxine Waters, Teresa Hughes and Gwen Moore --  won elective office.  </P> <P> But the last major shift upward came a decade ago, in 1978, when  then-Assemblyman Dixon ran successfully for Congress, Watson won the Senate  seat, and Moore captured the Assembly position. And at those levels, it has  turned out, they stayed.  </P> <P> With the exception of the 10th District contest, one political consultant said,  "there's been a lid on political opportunity in Southern California for  virtually a decade. . . . There's been no turnover, no deaths, no moving up."  </P> <P> The reasons are varied. Across the nation, the close of the 1970s ushered in a  wave of conservativism that swept Ronald Reagan and others into prominence.  Democratic politicians felt the force of the conservative onslaught -- perhaps  none more so than blacks, who for many whites had come to personify liberal  politics and bygone issues.  </P> <P> In 1975, when Watson won election to the Los Angeles city school board, the  debate over school busing was in full flower. She attributes much of her  political prominence in those days to the integration battle, and the fact that  she alone "looked like the litigants. . . . Here I am, black, and I'm defending  all these little black children."  </P> <P> Now, she said in an interview in her Sacramento office, "there's more interest  in economic development than there is in civil rights. . . . Integration is no  longer an issue. The issues have changed."  </P> <P> At the same time, nationally as well as locally, politics became a more  expensive exercise, giving an edge to incumbents -- who overwhelmingly are  white. The power of incumbency is particularly strong in the absence of a  potent opposition force, such as the political machines that have guided events  in other cities.  </P> <P> Without such a structure, according to Lorenzo Morris, an expert in black  politics from Washington's Howard University, Los Angeles and California veered  to "the politics of personality." Such a system, he said, benefits a central  figure such as Bradley or Assemblywoman Waters, but does little to pull forward  succeeding generations of politicians.  </P> <P> Morris contrasts the lack of structure today with circumstances at the height  of the civil rights movement, when organized groups such as the Student  Nonviolent Coordinating Council, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference  and the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People "socialized the  people into political action." While the latter two groups -- and another black  community power base, the church -- still exist, black officials say they have  far less pull than a generation ago.  </P> <P> "Basically, we have been disenfranchised of a political structure," Morris  said.  </P> <P> The biggest barrier to blacks in politics, as in all fields of endeavor, has  been the lingering specter of racism.  </P> <P> Bradley's 1982 gubernatorial campaign made an indelible impression on black  politicians. With money and prominent Establishment politicians behind him,  Bradley came within 52,295 votes of defeating Republican George Deukmejian --  out of 7.5 million votes cast. A host of polls found that from 5% to 15% of the  voters -- well over the margin -- refused to vote for Bradley because of his  race.  </P> <P> Bradley attributes his loss not to racism but to a surge in voting by gun  advocates angered by his support of a gun control measure on the ballot. But  most other black leaders disagree.  </P> <P> Political scientists state flatly that, given racism, Bradley's electoral  success in a white-dominated city is exceptional.  </P> <P> Apart from Bradley, the state's most prominent black politicians have gained  clout by working up the leadership ladder, as opposed to winning over the  electorate. Assembly Speaker Brown and Congressman Dixon, chairman of the House  ethics committee, are frequently cited examples.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Electoral Success  </P> <P> Figures gathered last year by the Joint Center for Political Studies, a  Washington institute that researches black political issues, show that  electoral success for blacks thus far has been largely limited to  black-dominated districts. There are no black governors or U.S. senators, and  only two of the 23 blacks in Congress -- one of them Ron Dellums of Oakland --  represent white-majority districts.  </P> <P> Of the top 12 cities represented by black mayors -- as measured by city  population -- all but Los Angeles are at least 40% black. The number of black  mayors of cities with populations over 50,000 decreased from 34 in 1987 to 28  in 1988. All were replaced by whites. A UC Berkeley survey shows that in recent  elections, black mayors across the country won 7% to 20% of the white vote --  again far less than the level Bradley has achieved.  </P> <P> "There has been no real progress in blacks getting elected outside of black  districts," said Bruce Cain, associate director of UC Berkeley's Institute for  Government Studies. "The Bradley phenomenon, the (Wilson) Riles phenomenon, is  still fairly isolated."  </P> <P> Most of the 6,829 blacks in office as of 1988, by the Joint Center's count,  were in municipal and school board jobs that politicians of any race first  seek. But blacks increasingly are finding that there is less chance of upward  movement for them than their white peers, political scientists say.  </P> <P> "One reason you see black mayors in so long is they really can't use it as a  springboard," said Charles Henry, associate professor of Afro-American studies  at Berkeley. "It's sort of on the top of the ladder for them."  </P></p>

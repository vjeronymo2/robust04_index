			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Sima Qadmon </F> at the Knesset on 23 March]    [Excerpts] [Qadmon] Sir, had you known eight months ago  what you know today, would you have started the whole peace  process?    [Rabin] [passage omitted] I knew peace had Israeli enemies.  I  found it very hard to believe that an Israeli could commit a  loathsome crime such as the one committed at the Cave of the  Patriarchs, but can we say that we ruled it out altogether?  After all, even today some politically mad person could go to  some West Bank Arab marketplace, open fire, and kill people.  There is no certainty that this can be prevented, just as I  cannot guarantee that a terror squad will not open fire at a bus  on one of the many roads on which Jews travel.    At the time, I made a distinction between political and  security settlements. The political settlements were set up in  the heart of Judaea and Samaria, and the issue of providing  security for the residents was not considered. They did not set  up clusters of settlements such as the Qatif Bloc. The  settlements are isolated, and in between them and on the roads  there are Arab settlements. The Army escorts settler children to  and from school, making 700 such escorts a day. A large part of  the Army is tied down in guarding installations, routes, and  escorting busses, instead of fighting terrorism. The only basic  solution to this reality, if there is basic solution, is a  political solution backed up with military might. [passage  omitted]    [Qadmon] Let us discuss one thing you may regret -- the  Shamgar Commission of Inquiry.    [Rabin] The commission exists and is made up of very  distinguished members. It was set up by a government decision  that I supported. I have a lot of respect for its work, despite  the difficulties it adds to the work of Army commanders in the  field. Naturally, they will consult legal advisers more than in  the past, which may be good. I believe I will be called to  testify before the committee, and I believe it is my duty to do  so.    [Qadmon] But you opposed it. Why did you surrender if you  believed that it would cause damage?    [Rabin] I thought that since such an offer was raised at the  cabinet, and since it had support, it would be a mistake to  bring it up for a vote. This would have started a public debate  on whether or not to establish a committee. I do not fear the  committee. Today, it exists. I am certain its distinguished  members, mainly its chairman, will study the case, investigate  it, and issue conclusions that will be recommendations for the  government.    [Qadmon] Did you not say the committee would cause damage  to the Israel Defense Forces [IDF]?    [Rabin] I never said that. In general, the press often  carries quotes that are very far from the truth. What I said  was that the committee would impose an additional burden on the  work of IDF officers and others. They are preoccupied with the  investigation, and each one fears for himself, mainly those  directly involved. This is a very complex and sensitive matter.  For the 1.8 million Palestinians living in the territories, we  are an occupying army, an occupying government. On the one  hand, we should provide for the security of that population; on  the other hand, in their mind, we are an occupying force. As  such, under international law, we should run life in the  territories, Jewish as well as Arab.    This is a very complex situation, further complicated by the  political settlements. It is also complex from the aspect of  security because it has created thousands spots of daily  friction on the roads and in places where the two populations  work together. Naturally, when emotions run high, there is no  end to the areas of contact, friction, and possible  confrontations of all kinds. Sometimes these things occur in the  background of some incident, certainly in the wake of the Hebron  massacre. This time, people who are not members of terror  groups, swept up by national-religious-fundamentalist-Islamic  zeal pull out knives and stab others. Since September, we have  prepared for Jewish riots. Nevertheless, since this issue will  be examined by the committee, please understand that I cannot  elaborate.    [Qadmon] And yet, the commission found there is an order  prohibiting soldiers from shooting at settlers under any  circumstances.    [Rabin] I will not comment on that. This issue is being  investigated by the commission. It remains to be seen in what  context the order was issued and what orders are being referred  to. Because this is what the state commission of inquiry is  working on, I believe that it would be inappropriate for me to  comment on this question in an open interview. [passage omitted]    [Qadmon] Is the five-year long interim period necessary?  Why should Goldsteins in both camps be given five more years to  attempt to blow up the entire enterprise? After all, at the end  of that period we are expecting a Palestinian state.    [Rabin] We will make no progress without the interim period.  The main achievement of the Declaration of Principles is the  following: The issue of Jerusalem will not be dealt with during  that period, and the opposition can chatter as much as it likes.  No country in the world has recognized the unification of  Jerusalem, but that has never prevented an Israeli Government  from viewing united Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty as the  capital of the Jewish nation. Our problem is how to provide  freedom of worship for other religions as well. To me, this is  the Jewish test of the State of Israel. Not only guarding the  integrity of Jerusalem, but also being tolerant to worshipers of  other religions who really need Jerusalem to perform their  religious rites.    The second thing is maintaining the settlements, not  uprooting them. The third, is the IDF's overall responsibility  for the security of Israelis on the roads and in the  settlements. The fourth thing is responsibility over external  security along the Jordan River, international border with  Egypt, and in the area between Nitzana and the Gaza Strip. If  we have to deal with solving these problems without first  creating a different reality -- without making the Palestinians  realize what it means to be in charge of the fate of 1.5 million  Palestinians, provide them with food, labor, housing, health,  and education -- it would not have been possible. There is no  doubt in my mind that this is what we should hope for --  creating a new reality that would facilitate dealing with a  solution no later than two years after the implementation of  Gaza and Jericho First.    [Qadmon] But a Palestinian state will still be waiting at  the end of the five years, will it not?    [Rabin] Who said so? I do not want to deal with the  solution to that now. I am against the establishment of a  sovereign, independent Palestinian state west of Jordan. We  will complete the agreement on Gaza and Jericho and secure its  implementation and the next stage. This is very important: both  reaching an agreement as well as implementing it. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ABSENCE OF NORTHWEST DEAL SETS PAN AM STOCK FALLING  </P> <P> Pan Am Corp. dashed speculation of an impending deal with Northwest Airlines  today when its board of directors ended a regularly scheduled meeting without  making any announcement.  </P> <P> "The board meeting concluded shortly after noon," Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela  Hanlon said.  </P> <P> "The company will have no announcement as a result of the meeting."  </P> <P> That announcement burst the bubble of a two-day rally that saw Pan Am's stock  rise 25%.  </P> <P> Speculation of some type of deal between the two airlines had driven Pan Am  stock up to a peak of $4 a share this morning, compared with $3 a share at the  close of trading Friday.  </P> <P> But after Pan Am announced the board meeting had ended without any statement,  the stock fell. In afternoon trading, Pan Am was off 37.5 cents at $3.375 a  share.  </P> <P> Hanlon declined comment on speculation that the board discussed a deal,  possibly a merger, between Pan Am and Northwest at the meeting.  </P> <P> "The company, in line with longstanding policy, will not comment on speculation  of that sort," Hanlon said.  </P> <P> Northwest also said it had a policy against commenting on speculation about a  potential deal. A spokesman for the Minnesota-based airline, however, said no  announcement of any kind was planned.  </P> <P> Speculation was sparked Monday by Pan Am's Teamsters Union, which said the  airline's board would consider a deal under which Northwest would buy the New  York-based carrier.  </P> <P> Last year Pan Am tried to buy NWA Inc., parent company of Northwest Airlines,  but the airline instead agreed to a buyout offer led by Los Angeles investor  Alfred Checchi.  </P> <P> Pan Am, troubled by thorny labor relations and growing competition on  transatlantic routes, has been searching for a buyer or partner for years.  </P></p>

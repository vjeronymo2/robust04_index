			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper and aluminium lead base metals back into bull run Base metals' bullish bandwagon appeared to be back on course yesterday after Wednesday's setbacks. The London Metal Exchange's three months delivery copper price climbed back above the psychologically significant Dollars 2,400-a-tonne mark while the aluminium market moved towards its next upside resistance area. Other LME contracts were also higher, with three months zinc just managing to regain its toe-hold above Dollars 1,000 a tonne and lead equalling its recent 20 month high. 'The other metals were looking softer, but when copper and aluminium start to go higher, people change their views,' one trader told the Reuters news agency. Once the three months copper price became re-established above Dollars 2,400 fresh speculative buying emerged to maintain it, and the market's firmness was underpinned by a narrowing in the discount for cash metal. The 'contango' (as the discount is known in the trade) against three months metal was reduced from Dollars 18 to Dollars 15. Aluminium also benefited from a resurgence of speculative buying, which helped the three months position clear the Dollars 1,440-a-tonne level and reach a Dollars 38-month high before running into resistance near Dollars 1,450. At the close it stood at Dollars 1,444.50 a tonne, up Dollars 10.75 on the day and Dollars 38.25 on the week so far. Traders told Reuters that the recent change in sentiment - with voluntary output cuts generally expected to start wearing down stocks soon - pointed to upside objectives of about Dollars 1,460 being secured before long. The tin market continued to match moves in the LME's major metals, with early losses being negated in the afternoon's general rally. However, there was not enough enthusiasm behind the buying for prices to break significantly higher and the three months position closed at Dollars 5,667.50 a tonne, up Dollars 22.50 on the day. Nickel prices had been pushing higher from the start of trading, with some fresh buying helping the three months price to break through Dollars 6,400 and reach Dollars 6,500 a tonne at one stage. Chart-based resistance emerged around that level, however, and the price closed at Dollars 6,482.50 a tonne. But that still represented a gain of Dollars 39.50. Traders explained zinc's relatively lacklustre performance - up Dollars 1.50 at Dollars 1,001 a tonne - as a reflection of the heavy stocks burden that is still overhanging the market.</p>

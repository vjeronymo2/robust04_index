			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Quality Software makes strong advance to Pounds 604,000 Quality Software Products' shares rose 10p to 391p yesterday, as the Gateshead-based accounting software developer more than quadrupled pre-tax profits from Pounds 143,000 to Pounds 604,000 in the first half of 1994. The results will be welcomed by investors concerned about the health of the computing services sector in the wake of a series of disappointing results from other companies, especially in financial software. It also suggests that QSP is on track with Universal OLAS, a large-scale accounting package which has cost the company about Pounds 16m to develop over the past six years. It has now sold the package to 19 clients at an average price of Pounds 200,000. Turnover rose 10 per cent to Pounds 7.27m (Pounds 6.61m). Earnings per share increased from 2.1p to 7.2p and an interim dividend of 1p is declared. Gearing has been reduced to 21 per cent from 32 per cent. The company has continued to invest heavily in Universal OLAS with Pounds 2.3m committed last year. The product, a modular system which runs on a broad range of computing hardware and software, is now virtually complete and new developments have been initiated to create support for executive decision making and group working. Mr Alan Mordain, chairman, said that good progress had been made in increasing sales of products and services, expanding geographically and obtaining reference sites. QSP's US partner, Global Software, has made its first sale of Universal OLAS to Avis in New York. It is expected that further partners will be announced within 12 months.</p>

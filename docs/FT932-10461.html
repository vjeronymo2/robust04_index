			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / International Company News: Klockner weakened by losses at steel unit KLOCKNER, the German trading house, has recorded a DM56.6m (Dollars 35.3m) net loss for 1992, nearly twice the DM30m loss it forecast in March. This compared with a DM74m loss in 1991. The company said provisions of DM92.5m for its loss-making steel subsidiary, Klockner-Werke, partly accounted for the deficit. Klockner owns 20 per cent of the steel group and is its largest single shareholder. The steel subsidiary filed for protection from its creditors earlier this year. This week a local court in Duisburg opened the composition procedure, the legal steps which fall one step short of outright bankruptcy. Mr Helmut Burmester, chairman of Klockner, welcomed the court decision, which he said, provided 'optimism regarding our short-term liquidity problem'. Klockner's group deficit would have been limited to about DM6bn but for the problems at Klockner-Werke, the company said. Sales at Klockner remained stable in 1992 compared with the previous year, standing at DM10.6bn. First-quarter sales remained unchanged at DM2.5bn. Klockner explained that it had doubled its investments in 1992, bringing them to DM550m. These included acquisitions in Switzerland, Italy and the US in particular. Klockner said it was confident about further business this year following improved earnings and sales in the last few weeks. However, Mr Burmester stressed a rationalisation programme was needed in view of growing costs and uncertainties over demand.</p>

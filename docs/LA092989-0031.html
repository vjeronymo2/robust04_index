			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'WAR PARTY' REVIVES A TRAGIC AMERICAN GAME  </P> <P> The time-honored game of cowboys 'n' Indians is revived with self-consciously  tragic results in "War Party" (citywide), which, for all its appealing players,  tense action and intriguing plot devices, is not the feel-good hit of the fall.  </P> <P> The setup is unique but strangely familiar: In modern-day Wyoming, a small band  of youthful Blackfeet is being methodically hunted down in the wilderness for  an ill-perceived crime against white men. Those lawmen brave or silly enough to  come after them meet extremely violent resistance.  </P> <P> The dilemma facing the befuddled Indian heroes toward the morally ambiguous  climax is whether to surrender or to fight to the finish, either way  perpetuating centuries of historically gory injustice.  </P> <P> Yes, this is just what it sounds like: "First Blood" meets "Do the Right  Thing."  </P> <P> The Sly-versus-Spike clash of sensibilities is an irresistibly bizarre one, but  both those predecessors had queasy resolutions that were felt by many viewers  to be troublesome. And terrific as much of the buildup in "War Party" is, you  just know there's no conceivable way the film makers will have come up with a  climax worthy of its crescendo. And you're right.  </P> <P> For its first half or so, though, "War Party" shapes up to be one of the  shrewdest, uncanniest, nerviest action pictures of the year.  </P> <P> Director Franc Roddam has worked with small youth ensembles before  ("Quadrophenia," "Lords of Discipline"), and there is telling detail in the way  he and writer Spencer Eastman show an Indian community through the eyes of its  youth, who sense that their parents have sold their souls to blend in with the  white municipality but aren't quite aware just how much heritage has been shed.  </P> <P> These kids aren't particularly bright, or brave; like their  soon-to-be-mortal-enemy Anglo counterparts in the town, they like to drink and  smoke dope and indulge in casual foreplay on horseback.  </P> <P> A prologue portraying the systematic slaughter of an Indian tribe 100 years  earlier segues into the arrival of long-haired lead player Sonny Crowkiller  (Billy Wirth) in a pickup truck, listening to a rock tape that any young white  stoner might have on -- a quintessential '70s party anthem with Free's Paul  Rodgers singing "Baby, it's all right now . . . we're so happy together!"  </P> <P> The irony in that nice touch is subtle but clear, and it's established early on  that, for all the surface assimilation, there's trouble brewing between the two  races that will explode in violence.  </P> <P> The occasion comes when a 100-year-old battle between Indians and settlers is  re-enacted to lure tourists during a centennial celebration. (The ease with  which the Blackfeet agree to re-create a battle in which their forefathers were  wiped out is implausible, but no matter.)  </P> <P> One malcontent drunk decides to shoot-'em-up for real, and before anyone can  figure out what happened, violence is begetting violence and history is  skipping on its groove, as Wirth and Kevin Dillon and two other Indian males  retreat on horseback to the woods, planeloads and truckloads of vigilante  locals close behind.  </P> <P> The cross-cutting between hunters and prey is initially nerve-wracking, then  drags. The appearance late in the game of a bounty hunter played by M. Emmet  Walsh -- a character actor who has saved many a movie -- promises a pick-me-up,  but he actually slows this one down, since his character has so little to do  with the plot.  </P> <P> Offering even less of an assist is an alcoholic medicine man who plays much the  same Greek-chorus function as the town drunk in Spike Lee's movie, only far  less successfully. And in this case, the final act of doing the right thing  seems far more senseless than anything Lee could have concocted on a  mind-bendingly hot day.  </P> <P> Roddam and Eastman deserve credit for having the courage of their convictions  in not trying to paste a sunny resolution onto their bleak (and justifiably  R-rated) story. But while their "War" goes out with a literal bang, it wraps up  with a symbolic whimper, one that finally seems to exploit a situation begging  to be treated without war-whooping cliches or fatalism.  </P> <P> It's their "Party," and they'll cry if they want to; real-life Indians may be  excused for failing to RSVP.  </P> <P> 'WAR PARTY'  </P> <P> A Hemdale presentation.

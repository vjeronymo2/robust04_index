			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Greycoat Greycoat's management, which ran the property company into the ground, now faces another big embarrassment. Having forcefully argued that the company had no future if the Postel rescue package was voted down, the management is now obliged to try to prove the opposite to disbelieving shareholders. The arbitrageurs who have piled into Greycoat's preference shares and blocked the deal clearly believe there is a better alternative for themselves, at least. Perhaps they draw inspiration from Amstrad where the obdurate shareholders who voted down Mr Alan Sugar's plans to take the company private must feel vindicated by the subsequent recovery in its share price. But the parallels are inexact. Greycoat is surely right that it can no longer continue to exist in its current form. But that is not quite the same as saying it cannot exist at all. If Greycoat were put into receivership, there would certainly be little prospect of any relief for preference shareholders. The banks' loans are well secured on the properties and the receivers would have no obligation to hang on for a recovery in values. Administration may offer more promising chances of some salvation. But the real hope is that there is a better alternative offer for refinancing Greycoat's assets lurking in the wings. It could conceivably be that the intimidating presence of Postel may have deterred bidders from making themselves known before. That slim hope will now be put to the test.</p>

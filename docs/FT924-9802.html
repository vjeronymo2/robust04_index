			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Owen claims wide acceptance of Bosnia proposals THE constitutional proposals for Bosnia and Hercegovina made by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the United Nations and European Community peace negotiators, have had a far wider acceptance than has so far been recognised, the latter said in London yesterday. Lord Owen, who was addressing the annual dinner of Britain's Diplomatic Writers' Association, was speaking only a day after some of Bosnia's Serbian leaders announced they were pulling out of the international peace talks in Geneva. They were reported to be withdrawing from the talks until their 'basic demand' for an ethnic division of Bosnia was met. Lord Owen, however, claimed that no-one had openly challenged the 'extremely strong human rights safeguards' or the rigorous procedures whereby ethnic cleansing could be reversed, 'over the years', by individuals wishing to return to their homes in Bosnia-Hercegovina. 'On the fundamental point of the need for more than three provinces, not just a three-way split between Moslem, Serb and Croat, it seems to have passed unnoticed that we have won the support of the key Moslem and Croat decision-makers,' Lord Owen said. Under the Vance-Owen proposals, Bosnia would be divided into 7-10 units along economic, rather than ethnic lines. The Croats, for instance, believed that there was a natural case for a separate province encompassing Bosanki Brod, in Posavina, which was not linked geographically to a province in West Hercegovina, Lord Owen said. In this context, he stressed that there was no evidence to support the claim that the Bosnian Serbs had forced their way into Bosanki Brod as a result of a secret deal with the Croats. Lord Owen said that, given the views of some of the Bosnian Serb leaders, it had come as no surprise that they had rejected the peace negotiators' proposals 'at this stage.' No more naked challenge to the authority of the international community could be found than the statement by the head of the Bosnian Serb army, General Ratko Mladic, who had said that his army and the Serb republic was a fact. 'Whether the world wants to recognise it or not is their affair,' the general had added. But that was a challenge which the world would not shirk, Lord Owen said. The principles adopted by last summer's London peace conference on Yugoslavia were not just 'Boy Scout' maxims; they were based on realpolitik. 'It is not just morally wrong to tolerate ethnic cleansing and territorial aggrandisement, but it is against our vital interests. To abandon those principles would weaken us all when dealing with the problems created by the collapse of the Soviet Union.' Moreover, the Islamic world would hold a justified grievance against the world, and particularly Europe, for centuries ahead, if it acquiesced in the Moslems being driven out of their homes and living as a beleaguered people forever.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Q &amp; A  </P> <P> Q: Despite the relatively difficult borrowing environment, I think that the UAL  Corp. buyout by its unions has a 70-30 chance of succeeding. What odds would  you lay? -- Goleta, Calif.  </P> <P> A: I would guess that there is only a 30% chance that this deal will ever be  completed. Sources I have who are close to foreign banks have been telling me  for months that the Japanese were very embarrassed by the failure of the UAL  deal to materialize last October, and that they are now extremely reluctant to  go along with these new plans.  </P> <P> Of course, there also have been a lot of changes in the international situation  since last October. The political events in Eastern Europe have given bankers  plenty of opportunities to invest their money without getting involved in iffy  deals in the United States.  </P> <P> Lastly, the rising level of bad real estate loans in the United States is  making our bankers very skittish. And I don't think that they are dying to  invest in UAL, which could easily turn into a chaotic situation with unions  fighting unions.  </P> <P> On top of that, there are a myriad of other problems inherent in the airline  business that could worry the banks. Will fuel prices remain as favorable as  they are now through the life of the UAL transaction? Will the opening of new  air routes to Japan hurt UAL's business? Can Gerald Greenwald, the former vice  chairman of Chrysler Corp. and a stranger to the airline business, work some  magic in his new job as head of UAL?  </P> <P> And remember, there is no investor putting up any of his hard-earned money in  this deal. All the unions are doing is granting wage concessions of about $2  billion over a five-year period.  </P> <P> I think that the banks ultimately will say: "There are easier ways to earn a  buck."  </P> <P> But my opinion is not a universal one. I recently spoke with the head of one of  the United States' other big airlines, and I happened to ask his opinion on the  chances of the UAL deal going through. He said he believed that the UAL deal  was a cinch. As long as the bankers get assurances from the unions that workers  are willing to take additional wage cuts -- if necessary -- to make the deal  work, the banks have nothing to lose.  </P> <P> Citing the same risks I mentioned above, plus the death of the junk bond  market, the highly rated arbitrage department at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. recently  told clients that there was only a 50-50 chance that the UAL deal will be  completed.  </P> <P> Q: I'm interested in investing in the stock market using no-load mutual funds.  Is there a publication on the subject? I'd prefer one that gives a list of the  best-performing no-load mutual funds and how to contact them. -- St. Louis  </P> <P> A: There are plenty of publications that keep track of the performance of  no-load mutual funds and give addresses and phone numbers for the funds'  managers.  </P> <P> One is the "Mutual Fund Sourcebook," published by Morningstar Inc., 53 West  Jackson St., Suite 460, Chicago, Ill. 60604. The encyclopedic soft-cover book  categorizes the funds according to their risks, lists the funds' portfolios,  gives investment criteria and performance. The cost is $60.  </P> <P> Another is "The Handbook for No-Load Fund Investors," published by the No-Load  Fund Investor, P.O. Box 283, Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. 10706. It costs $42 and  contains the performance records and other information on 1,200 no-load and  low-load mutual funds.  </P> <P> Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating service, and Lipper Analytical Services, a  research firm, put out something called "Mutual Fund Profiles" that costs $117  and contains reviews of the 1,000 largest stock and bond funds -- both load  funds and those that charge no fees.  </P> <P> Q: I purchased 100 shares of General Motors stock in the early 1980s. But my  brokerage firm went out of business, and it said all the cash and stock in my  account was being mailed to me.  </P> <P> I received that letter, which was sent on March 15, 1989. But in February,  1989, GM had declared a 2-for-1 stock split. I never received the additional  100 shares, and I haven't been receiving any of the dividends on those shares.  </P> <P> I am nearing retirement and would like to locate this 100-share certificate and  the dividends that I haven't received for a year. Is there any way you can cut  through the red tape to help me? -- Torrance.  </P> <P> A: The red tape has been cut.  </P> <P> First Chicago Corp., the transfer agent for the stock, will reissue the  dividend checks and will send you an affidavit of loss for the certificate for  the 100 shares. You won't have to post an indemnity bond to get the new  certificate; it will be sent to you promptly.  </P> <P> The folks over at GM were very helpful in resolving your problem. Other readers  should take note that the investment relations department of most major  companies can help resolve stockholder problems like this one.  </P> <P> According to GM, here's what happened in your case: The certificate for the 100  post-split shares was sent to you in early 1989, and all the dividend checks  have followed. But it appears that when your account was transferred from the  defunct broker to discount broker Charles Schwab, your name and address were  registered incorrectly.  </P> <P> Confusing the situation even more was the fact that your Social Security number  isn't the same as your taxpayer identification number, which GM says is unusual  for an individual investor. So when the transfer agent punched your Social  Security number into the computer, you didn't show up as a shareholder in GM.  </P> <P> Anyway, the problem has been resolved, and you can now retire in peace.  </P> <P> Q: I found two shares of White Eagle International Inc. stock in my husband's  papers after he died. I'm sure it is worthless, but I'd like to know for sure.  -- Palm Springs.  </P> <P> A: Your instinct is good. According to R. M. Smythe &amp; Co., which  specializes in tracking down long-lost stocks, White Eagle had its charter  cancelled in 1983. The stock is worthless. JOHN CRUDELE  </P></p>

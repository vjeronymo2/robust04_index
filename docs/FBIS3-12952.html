			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nasir 'Arif] </F>   [Text] Ziyad Abu-Ghanimah [former Islamic Action Front  leader] has strongly attacked the Muslim Brotherhood, accusing  the group of arrogance in dealing with those who work in the  Islamic field.    He charged that, for the last 45 years, the group has failed  to develop from the domination of individuals, differing from  one leader to another, to collective institutional action based  on established plans, bylaws, and restrictions that are not  influenced by changes in posts or the officials in charge.    Abu-Ghanimah criticized the Muslim Brotherhood leadership,  of  which he used to be a member, because of their recent decision  to exclude him from the organization and because of their  refusal to hold a frank dialogue with him in order to serve the  march of the group itself.    In a lecture at the Shuman Foundation entitled "Views and  Experience in the Islamic Movement," he said: I had hoped that  the brotherhood leaders would consider me the devil himself and  come to hold talks with me, especially since they know that even  Almighty God talked to the condemned Satan. How can they  refrain from having a dialogue with someone who was a member of  the Muslim Brotherhood before some of them were even born?    He said: I still invite them for an open dialogue anywhere  and at any time they decide in order that the whirlpool of  secret instructions and statements that, in most cases, lack  truth and objectivity will end.    Following this, Abu-Ghanimah began to review his experience  in the Muslim Brotherhood since late 1940's, when Jordan was --  like all eastern Arab states -- full of nationalist feelings  against colonialism and Zionist ambitions and when parties drew  the masses into these parties by transferring their nationalist  feelings. He said he first joined the Arab Muslim Youths Party,  which combined the principles of the Muslim Brotherhood and the  Ba'th Party. That experience did not last for long, and he then  joined the Muslim Brotherhood due to his religious leanings and  his admiration for the convoys of Muslim Brotherhood mujahidin  who were participating in jihad against Jews in Palestine.    Abu-Ghanimah noted that, after more than 45 years of  experience, he feels that he is dutybound and that it is in the  interest of the Islamic movement, particularly the Muslim  Brotherhood, to make this review, through which he will present  the fruit of his personal experience within the group. He  stressed that, before this review, we should be aware of the  following:    - We, as Muslims, have no doubt that the great Islam and its  commendable teachings are infallible and everything else is  fallible. In other words, no Muslim or Islamic movement --  leaders or members -- can claim they are infallible.    - Consequently, the Muslims -- movements and individuals --  may be right or may be wrong. Therefore, there is no harm if an  Islamic movement admits its mistakes when it is wrong. This  will raise its position among the masses and reinforce their  confidence in it. However, the leadership who lacks confidence  in its cadres and masses is the one that fears to reveal its  mistakes.    - Addressing the negative points of, or the mistakes  committed by, the Islamic Movement -- the Muslim Brotherhood --  does not at all imply vengeance or slander, as some claim. It  is not aimed at inciting its enemies against it. Addressing the  negative points is geared primarily toward the interest of the  group and does not go beyond the self-criticism known in Islam  during the era of Prophet Muhammad and his companions.    Abu-Ghanimah noted that it is fair to acknowledge that his  experiences within the Muslim Brotherhood contain a great many  positive points as well, thanks to God first; to his adherence  to the teachings of Islam; to teaching thousands of youths, men,  and women on the path of Islam; to reviving the call for Islam  at the beginning of the century; and to enlightening the Muslims  on their decisive issues.    Abu-Ghanimah then touched on the negative points he  registered throughout his time as a member of the Muslim  Brotherhood.    We should be brave and admit that the Brotherhood's  experience in Jordan has not been perfect and we should admit  the mistakes. We should not hide behind the argument that every  movement keeps secrets to conceal its negative aspects and  mistakes. These negative aspects, which I recorded though my  experience with the Muslim Brotherhood, can be summed up in the  following points:    - One of the most complicated problems facing the Muslim  Brotherhood is the fact that it lacks an authoritative reference  to record the history of the group from the time it was founded  in 1944 until now.    - The group lacks a system to assess its march in the  various  phases. Throughout the 45 years of its life, not a single study  to appraise its progress has been conducted for any of the  phases through which the group in Jordan had passed. This is a  major shortcoming because an appraisal every now and then will  reveal the positive and negative aspects and serve the group's  march.    - Members of the group will not accept any criticism of them  or their group, whether that criticism comes from a friend or a  foe, to the extent that they consider any criticism against  their group to be directed against Islam itself.    - The group deals with other people working in the field of  Islamic action in a patronizing and arrogant manner. It wants  them to be subordinates and not comrades in the march to serve  Islam. This negative aspect, which the Muslim Brotherhood in  Jordan is still facing, explains the gap between the group and  their Muslim brothers in other groups.    - Throughout the 45 years of its life, the group has failed  to institutionalize its action. This means it failed to  transform group actions from an individualistic basis, which may  differ from one leadership to another, into institutionalized  actions that are based on mission-oriented institutions that do  not change with the change in leadership positions or the  persons responsible for the Brotherhood's work. All attempts to  change the Brotherhood's work from individual efforts into  institutionalized ones have failed.    - Despite the importance of the media in the missionary,  intellectual, political, and social work of the group, the  Muslim Brotherhood failed to follow a clear media policy with a  practical mechanism that depends on an institutional media organ  to cover the requirements of the group in the media field.    - In addition to the weak performance of the Muslim  Brotherhood in the field of education and the increasing daring  in slandering one another, the phenomenon of loyalty to  individuals, rather than to the Islamic call or to the group,  has prevailed. It is important to note as well the group's  tendency to make decisions that please the decisionmakers. Many  decisions made by the group leadership proceeded from personal  whims and were not in the interest of the group.    Abu-Ghanimah concluded his lecture by saying that his  frankness will anger some and please others, noting that he will  not be swayed by angry responses since he believes that he is  telling the truth. He said: I advise the small clique in the  leadership, who will not appreciated my words, to react to what  I said by thinking long and hard about these negative aspects,  to study them, to discuss their causes, and to rectify them. If  they fail to correct matters they should leave their jobs before  the problems increase and the situation worsens.    At the end of the lecture, Dr. As'ad 'Abd-al-Rahman,  moderator of the symposium, opened a dialogue between the  lecturer and the audience. Abu-Ghanimah said the negative  points he mentioned are the ones that he can address publicly,  adding that the members of the group themselves are talking  about many other things. This frank talk will not please many  members of the group. He added that there are many things that  must be kept within the group.    Asked if this public criticism of the Muslim Brotherhood  will  develop the performance of the group and help it continue its  march, Abu-Ghanimah said: This should render the group a great  service of which it has been in need for the last 45 years.</p>

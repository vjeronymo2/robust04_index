			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> MCDONNELL DOUGLAS PLANS LAYOFF  </P> <P> McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. will lay off more than 10% of its employees by  Feb. 23 because of reduced defense spending by the government, company  President William P. Brown announced today.  </P> <P> The move will involve about 400 workers each at the company's base plant in  Mesa, Ariz., and at its California Manufacturing Center in Culver City.  </P> <P> The company employs 5,900 in Mesa and 1,650 in Culver City.  </P> <P> "We must reduce our work force to meet the reality of our delivery schedule  with the U.S. Army," Brown said in a prepared statement from Mesa.  </P> <P> The Mesa plant has been producing Apache helicopters for the Army at the rate  of 10 per month. Brown said that number would be reduced to six a month in June  under a contract that ends in mid-1993.  </P> <P> He said the company still has good prospects of international sales of Apaches.  </P> <P> The other step in the company's retrenchment is elimination or delay of  discretionary spending, Brown said.  </P></p>

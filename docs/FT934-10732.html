			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Mexico gives way to US over Nafta - Decision reflects government's desperation to have pact passed THE US said yesterday that Mexico had made concessions over trade in sugar, citrus, vegetables, flatglass, wine and home appliances in a move seen as an attempt to win US congressional passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, broke the news after extended negotiations with Mexican officials, ending a long-running US effort to correct perceived weaknesses in the three-nation pact with Canada and Mexico. Most of the changes have been included in the administration's implementing legislation, delivered to Congress yesterday . The Mexican government's decision reflects its desperation to have Nafta passed. In giving in to US pressure, it has in effect broken its repeated promise not to reopen the original treaty. However, the pact has become the cornerstone of foreign and economic policy. Were it rejected, the political and financial costs for President Carlos Salinas's administration could be significant. There is a presidential election next year and rejection of the treaty would play into the hands of the nationalist opposition. Failure of Nafta could also destabilise the peso. Mr Kantor said Mexican officials had agreed to negotiate accelerated tariff reductions on flatglass, wine and appliances on the first day of Nafta implementation. Speaking later, Mexico's trade minister, Mr Jaime Serra Puche, said the reductions would only apply with the agreement of affected industries. Mr Kantor added that production formula had been agreed to prevent a surge of sugar imports into the US. On vegetables and citrus, tariffs would be increased if import prices fell to an agreed level. The concessions on sugar, although nominally made by Mexico's private sector sugar industry, were without doubt given on the orders of the government. While Mexico is a net importer of sugar, US producers had been concerned that it would turn to sweetening soft drinks with corn syrup and export the resulting surplus in sugar to the US. Under the Nafta, Mexico and the US agree to eliminate all barriers to sugar trade within 15 years. The concession on glass may come as a blow to Vitro, the near monopoly glass producer, and one of Mexico's largest industrial companies. It had fought tenaciously for a long phase-in period for free trade in flat glass products. The US administration has been having great difficulty cobbling together the necessary 218 votes in the House of Representatives by November 17, and strategists say it is vital to get at least the appearance of momentum. President Bill Clinton yesterday hosted another in a series of White House extravaganzas, featuring Nafta endorsements from every living recipient of the Nobel Prize for economics and dozens of former cabinet officials. Yesterday, Mr Kantor announced two new Democratic converts. By the administration's count, this brings pro-treaty votes to about 197.</p>

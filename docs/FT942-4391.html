			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Irish health insurance move Private health insurance in Ireland will be opened up to competition but new entrants will be prevented from 'cherry-picking' the low-risk sector of the market, according to government proposals published this week. An EU directive on non-life insurance comes into force next month, and the proposals are intended to ensure Ireland's compliance with the directive in the health insurance sector, by allowing other EU groups to enter the Irish market. New entrants to the market would all have to offer a basic cover package to all comers. Insurance companies would not be allowed to discriminate against members opting for their schemes on the grounds of age, sex, or health status. A non-profit making voluntary health insurance scheme, the VHI, has operated alongside the public health service since 1957, and now has 1.3m members - over one third of the population.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] To ensure the correct implementation of the new  taxation system and the stability of the market, the Guiyang  City Commodity Price and Tax Bureaus recently formulated the  regulations to ensure price stability after the taxation system  reform is introduced. The main contents are as follows:    1. It is necessary to conscientiously implement the spirit  of the 4 February notice by the State Planning Commission and  the State General Administration of Taxation on maintaining  price stability after taxation system reform is carried out.  All [word indistinct] are prohibited from [words indistinct]  and forcing up commodity prices at will and disrupting the  market.    2. As the economy grows overall, tax burdens in enterprises  will not be increased. If the tax burdens in enterprises which  introduced the new taxation system increase, in principle, they  should not increase prices. Because their tax burdens have  increased by too wide a margin, enterprises in localities which  want to increase prices should get the approval of the commodity  price bureau.    3. As the current ex-factory price, wholesale price, and  retail sales price already contain taxes, all [word indistinct]  are prohibited from increasing the burdens on consumers by  applying value-added and other forms of taxes. As far as the  commodities which are sold at reduced prices are concerned,  production, allocation, and wholesale departments should  indicate on the price tags that taxes are not included in the  reduced prices.    4. The different profit rates from marketing wholesale and  retail sales of consumers capital goods, including agricultural  capital goods such as chemical fertilizers and farm chemicals,  should remain unchanged; that is, they should be calculated at  the present taxable prices. All expenses should be collected  from the different profit rates. All enterprises and units are  prohibited from expanding the rates without authorization.    5. Commodity price departments in urban districts should  strengthen supervision and inspection over market prices. Those  who adjust the prices of commodities whose prices are set by the  state without the approval of the commodity price bureau, or  increase their prices because of miscalculations resulting from  a misunderstanding of the situation, or force up their prices by  capitalizing on taxation system reform, should be ordered to  make prompt corrections and, moreover, they should be dealt with  according to relevant state laws and regulations.</p>

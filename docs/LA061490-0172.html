			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE WON'T SUE ACCOUNTANTS WHO AUDITED LINCOLN  </P> <P> The state agency that regulates accountants decided Wednesday that it would not  sue any of the three accounting firms that performed audits or worked on the  financial statements of the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan and its bankrupt  parent company, American Continental Corp.  </P> <P> Instead, the 12-member State Board of Accountancy voted unanimously in a  closed-door session to continue with its ongoing investigation to determine if  any disciplinary action should be taken against California-licensed accountants  in the scandal, according to Jack Kazanjian, a Fresno accountant and board  president.  </P> <P> The board, during a special meeting on the Lincoln matter, decided not to  pursue civil litigation now because there is "far too much information" yet to  be learned, Kazanjian said.  </P> <P> The board has authority to discipline licensed accountants and to sue  accountants and accounting firms for violations of state business laws that  prohibit false and misleading statements. About 23,000 large and small  investors in American Continental debt securities -- as well as a host of state  and federal agencies and politicians -- relied, in part, on financial audits  and other statements by the accounting firms about the health of American  Continental.  </P> <P> The primary accounting firm targeted by investors in pending litigation is the  former Arthur Young &amp; Co., now called Ernst &amp; Young. Other defendants  are Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. and the former Touche, Ross &amp; Co., now  Deloitte &amp; Touche.  </P> <P> The investors now hold about $250 million in worthless securities after the  company filed for bankruptcy on April 13, 1989. The following day, regulators  seized Lincoln. The S&amp;L is expected to become one of the nation's biggest  thrift-repair jobs, costing taxpayers at least $2 billion.  </P></p>

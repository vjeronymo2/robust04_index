			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Saved by diversification - Heavy Industry JAPANESE shipbuilders had full order books last year, although new orders fell, while steelmakers were bruised by a drop in private construction orders and softer demand from the car industry. Kobe Steel is likely to have the honour of reporting higher net profits than Nippon Steel, the world's largest steelmaker. While Kobe's net profits are forecast to fall from Y29bn to Y12bn, it will beat the Y4bn forecast at Nippon, and better than other leading makers, which expect to break even. Kobe is fortunate that its diversification programme began long before the peak of steel demand in the mid-1980s, when other Japanese makers were inspired to pursue projects in electronics, theme parks and bicycle building. Steel accounts for about 48 per cent of sales, machinery 30 per cent, and aluminium and copper 22 per cent. The returns at Kobe and other steelmakers would have been worse but for a quadrupling of export orders to China for the year.</p>

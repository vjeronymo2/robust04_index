			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "Side Fires"] </F>   [Text] Greece is under fire on all national issues,  including the Aegean, the Macedonian issue, the Cyprus issue,  and the rights of the Greek minority in Albania. The fire comes  from the United States and from the EU [European Union], it is  combined and coordinated. The target is obvious.    In the Aegean, friends and allies want full restoration of  Greek-Turkish relations. They are indifferent to Greek rights.  They want the friction stopped; this is what interests them.  With their actions, they are encouraging Turkey to provoke a  crisis in the Aegean in order to force a meeting between Greek  Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and Turkish Prime Minister  Tansu Ciller under conditions that will be negative for Greece.    This is the reason why suddenly the United States raised,  particularly with its written statement, the issue of air space  by challenging Greece's 10 mile limit. For many years now the  United States has not gotten involved, at least publicly, in  this Greek-Turkish dispute. It also asked for the disarmament  of our planes. Furthermore, the WEU [Western European Union]  upgrades Turkey's position despite the just objections of Greece.    Concerning the Macedonian issue, we are pressured by the  United States and Europe to make the first step toward solution  of the issue. In addition, the French National Assembly refuses  to ratify Greece's accession to the WEU as long as the Greek  embargo against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM] is still pending.    On the Cyprus issue, U.S. President Bill Clinton and British  Prime Minister John Major are exerting pressure on UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to change his report in order to  satisfy the Turkish Cypriot side. As for the Greek minority in  Albania, the United States maintains its doubts that the  minority is persecuted and that minority rights are violated.    The outline of these actions by friends and allies are  convincing that Greece is under pressure. The pressure is  suffocating. There are dangers and the immediate one is in the  Aegean. A Greek-Turkish crisis would also affect the  developments of other national issues. That is why Greece should  be careful with its moves and reactions. It should not fall into  the trap of provocations.    The Greek Government avoids Turkish provocations, and this  is  correct. This is not a time for pseudo-bullying and hectoring.  Greece is also refraining from deteriorating its relations with  its friends and allies, and this is right. But it should be  careful. Deterioration of relations is one thing, but it is  another to remain firm in its demand to place these relations  based on justice and respect of the country's national rights.    It is necessary for the government to activate and guide its  foreign policy carefully and firmly. It should seek and secure  the agreement of the opposition as well. The danger is in the  Aegean. With daring moves, it should constructively close  national issues with Skopje and Albania. This move will also  weaken Ankara's provocations and its support in the United  States and Europe.</p>

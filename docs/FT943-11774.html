			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Harmony Property cuts its deficit to Pounds 455,000 Harmony Property cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 2.13m to Pounds 455,000 in the 52 weeks to March 27. Turnover rose 66 per cent from Pounds 5.69m to Pounds 9.47m, of which Pounds 5.18m was from acquisitions. During the year, the USM-quoted property and hotel group bought a portfolio of properties from British Land for Pounds 5.35m. This was financed by the issue of 66m shares. This, added to purchases made the previous year, gives the company a Pounds 7.5m asset base generating rental income of Pounds 750,000 a year. In January, Harmony sold six public houses for Pounds 300,000 to Leisuretime Inns, satisfied by the issue of 3m shares and resulting in an 15 per cent stake in the unquoted pubs group. Harmony plans to sell the remaining six freehold and one leasehold pubs. 'I think we can look back with satisfaction on the progress made during the year,' said Mr John Main, chairman. Since the year-end, Harmony, which has applied to join the main market, has bought a portfolio of properties for about Pounds 7m from Mr Bruce Owen, who became an executive director in May. It has also a conditional agreement to buy a further portfolio from Mr Owen for Pounds 2.45m, which will be financed though a mixture of cash and shares. Losses per share were 0.46p (5.87p).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Air Force Aviation Chief Col Aleksandr </F> Abrahamyan by A. Dokholyan: "Flight `In Armenian'"]    [Text] The Air Force, one of the most important  components of modern armed forces, is, for understandable  reasons, a new thing for us. Up until recently we would look at  military aircraft appearing in the sky overhead with an interest  purely for the hardware itself. We now experience a conscious  awareness that those intrepid souls up there are sons of  Armenia, our boys. At first our joy was mixed with doubts: would  Armenia, which lacks vital necessities of life, be able to  handle such a burden?    In spite of all this, however, on 26 July we celebrated  the first anniversary of our Armed Forces. We are talking with  Air Force Aviation Chief Col Aleksandr Abrahamyan.    [Abrahamyan] In a structural sense we have essentially  stabilized, and we are presently deploying our subunits.  Instruction of young pilot personnel has also commenced.    [Dokholyan] Military aviation in Armenia is a new  thing. How have you resolved the problem of specialist  personnel?    [Abrahamyan] The fact is that we have started from scratch.  Thanks to the efforts of our ministry, however, we received  first-rate pilots, pilots who in the former Soviet Union had  completed advanced training school. And we ourselves began  training pilots locally. Many of these are today flying modern  aircraft. We are now operating in Arzni, the Republic of Armenia  Ministry of Defense Aviation Training Center.    [Dokkholyan] Aviation, especially military aviation, is  an expensive pleasure, as they say. And our republic is  presently experiencing an economic crisis. I would imagine that  this in all probability has an adverse effect on your work as  well.    [Abrahamyan] Yes, it does. There are many difficulties and  basic problems. The government and ministry support us, however.  We are allocated an adequate amount of fuel. Otherwise, we would  not be able to perform military missions.    [Dokholyan] What kind of living conditions do the  pilots have?    [Abrahamyan] The good news is that in our republic, as was  the case in the former Soviet Union, they understand the  importance of and give priority to aviation. Only 2 or 3 of our  pilots have not received individual apartments. First on our  list of tasks is to provide them with an apartment.    [Dokholyan] Do you work in cooperation with CIS states,  with the Russian Federation?    [Abrahamyan] Of course we are working in that direction.  Everything, however, depends on Armenia's financial solvency.    There are also issues pertaining to internal matters:  violations of military regulations, desertions, etc. We are  endeavoring to eliminate such things.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   In the course of an informal get-together with  primary-rank enlisted personnel, the latter indicated that they  were not so dissatisfied with economic difficulties and  difficulties with daily life (although pay is extremely low) as  they were upset by the demeanor of "money-possessing" young men  (strange as it may seem, even such as these sometimes grace us  with their service in our army). At times it is difficult even  for command personnel to "communicate" with them. One of the  noncommissioned officers came right out and stated: "A person  with more money than you can shake a stick at comes and stands  in front of you and tries to dictate special conditions for his  son."    It is a situation with which many of us are quite  familiar. We encounter such phenomena all the time. The reasons  for and the roots of this phenomenon are well known. The army is  not an entity separate from society, and certainly it is  subjected to the influence of the moral and ethical standards  which exist in society. However, we should have kept such market  relations out of the Armenian National Army at any price.    In spite of all the problems and setbacks, however, the  Republic of Armenia Air Force exists today. Col A. Abrahamyan  replied as follows to the question: "If it became necessary  today, could they defend our skies?" -- "It is our duty to do  so." And it is the duty of all of us to strengthen the National  Army.</p>

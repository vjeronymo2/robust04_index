			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 25 (BTA) -- The present state of  bilateral relations and prospects for their development, the  conflicts in the Balkans and in Transcaucasia were the main  issues which Armenian Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan, who  arrived on a three-day visit this morning, discussed with  Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. They signed an  agreement on cooperation in culture, science and education.  Later on Papazyan and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of  Trade Valentin Karabashev signed a trade and economic  cooperation accord. These are the first bilateral documents  signed by Bulgaria and Armenia.    "I believe the two agreements would provide the legal  framework for the relations which Bulgaria and Armenia are  willing to develop on the basis of their historical links",  Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov told reporters.  He was optimistic about the relations between the two  countries. His view was shared by his Armenian counterpart.  "Considering the historical relations between our countries, we  must promote our relations at all levels", Mr. Papazyan said.    The two foreign ministers agreed to start preparations for  the signing of an agreement on friendship and cooperation  between Bulgaria and Armenia. Mr. Daskalov has already received  Armenia's draft agreement. The Bulgarian proposal is also under  way and the agreement will be signed as soon as the experts are  ready with it, Mr. Daskalov told reporters. The two foreign  ministers exchanged information about the situation in the  Balkans and the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, the two countries'  relations with the neighbouring countries and the priorities in  the foreign policies of Bulgaria and Armenia.    Mr. Daskalov and Mr. Papazyan discussed the possibilities  for  activating the economic contacts which are now hampered by the  regional conflicts in the Caucasus. They discussed the  possibilities for joint actions within the Black Sea Economic  Cooperation, for promotion of relations in culture, art and  education.    The promotion of bilateral relations in the economy was high  on the agenda of the talks between Papazyan and Bulgarian Trade  Minister Karabashev. Under the trade and economic cooperation  accord, Bulgaria and Armenia grant each other a most favoured  nation status in tariffs, indirect taxes and other charges on  imports, payments and in the sales, shipment, storage, etc., of  goods on the domestic market. The accord expires in five years  and can be automatically extended. It provides for the exchange  of economic information and the establishment of an  intergovernment committee on trade-economic and  scientific-technological cooperation.    Papazyan and Karabashev shared the view the level of  bilateral trade is far lower than what it can be. Trade in 1993  amounted to $1.5 million, down from $3 million in 1992. "We  coordinated a programme for further cooperation", the Armenian  minister said after meeting with Karabashev. A package of  economic agreements is to be prepared and is expected to be  signed within a few months. "Such a package is a must, as we  should lay the legal groundwork of our relations", said the  chief Armenian diplomat.    The promotion of relations was further discussed at  Papazyan's meeting with National Assembly Deputy Chairman Yordan  Shkolagerski. "There have never been any problems between the  Bulgarian and Armenian peoples", said Shkolagerski. About  20,000 Armenians live in Bulgaria and they are well-integrated  in public life here, according to him. Papazyan and  Shkolagerski committed themselves to establishing friendship  groups in the two parliaments.    Papazyan will tomorrow visit Plovdiv and meet in the evening  with representatives of the Armenian community in Bulgaria. On  Wednesday he will be received by President Zhelev.</p>

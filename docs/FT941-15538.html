			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Arts: Profitable revenge for Lloyd's loser Manya Igel is the stuff of TV documentary dreams: a widow, a stranger to this country, who was taken in by the siren voices of Lloyd's of London and lost her hard earned Pounds 100,000. But Manya Igel is also an art dealer and she is gaining a profitable revenge by commissioning each year a painting which warns of the pitfalls of Lloyd's. Last year artist Alfred Daniels painted 'The Buskers of Lloyd's' depicting three former Names, one shirtless, in penury outside the tubular Titanic. It quickly sold, to the wife of a Lloyd's Name for Pounds 1,650. This year Daniels has painted 'The Corporate Rope'. Are the bowler hatted executives of the City companies that Lloyds sees as its financial salvation propping it up, or is the rope so frayed that it is bound to tumble? Priced at Pounds 1,800 it will be on Igel's stand at Art 94, the contemporary art fair which opens at the Business Design Centre in Islington on January 19. Manya Igel will also be showing such popular Establishment artists as Ken Howard, Bernard Dunston, Diana Armfield and Mary Fedden. As she ruefully admits 'I wish I'd put all my money into paintings. Then if the worst came to the worst I could have got something for them.' Art 94 gives 70 dealers the chance to discover whether the upturn in the art market has finally arrived. Prices start at Pounds 50, but anyone spending over Pounds 1,000 qualifies for a two flights for the price of one offer on a Virgin Atlantic flight to the US. Virgin Communications is showing off its art collection at the Fair, including works by Paula Rego, Tony Bevan and Fiona Rae. The enthusiast is not Richard Branson but Robert Devereux, chairman of Virgin Communications. Virgin now shows contemporary artists in its Upper Class Clubhouse at Heathrow and recently sold a Glynn Williams sculpture to David Bowie.</p>

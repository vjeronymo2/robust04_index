			<p>BFN     [Text] Our correspondent reports that al-Nabatiyah  residents are tense following rumors that terrorists belonging  to the Faithful Resistance and Hizballah have arrived in the  Iqlim al-Tuffah region from the al-Biqa' during the past two  days. The residents think that the terrorists have arrived to  carry out operations against the Israeli army and the South  Lebanese Army [SLA] in retaliation for the kidnapping of Mustafa  al-Dirani and the raid against the Hizballah training center  near Ba'labakk, knowing that this will expose the residents to  danger.    Informed security sources told our correspondent that the  Israeli army and the SLA will respond with force to any  terrorist operation carried out by Hizballah terrorists and  their followers.</p>

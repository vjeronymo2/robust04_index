			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Gould urges increased public borrowing to help recovery Mr Bryan Gould, the Labour MP who chairs the Full Employment Forum, yesterday called for a Pounds 10bn increase in government borrowing and a cut of 2 percentage points in short-term interest rates in next week's Budget. He said the government's focus on reducing the Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement demonstrated that ministers 'have no idea how to help the economy recover from recession'. He urged Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to raise the level of demand by increasing public investment, reducing interest rates and allowing the pound to fall. 'It is not zero inflation but recovery and full employment which should now be the top priority,' he said. 'You do not recover from recession by making people poorer.' Mr Gould, a former shadow trade and industry secretary who stood against Mr John Smith in the Labour leadership contest last year, set up the forum six months ago to put pressure on the Labour leadership for a return to explicitly Keynesian economic policies. More than 35 Labour MPs have joined, giving the forum more support than the leftwing Campaign Group, formerly the main vehicle for backbench opposition to the leader-ship. The forum hopes to attract members of the 'soft' traditionally left Tribune Group, which now includes leading moderates such as Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary.</p>

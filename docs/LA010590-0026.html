			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUROR FAIRNESS WOULD BE ON TRIAL  </P> <P> Now that we have him, can we give him a fair trial? That's the question that  lawyers around the country are asking on the heels of Manuel Noriega's dramatic  surrender to American authorities.  </P> <P> There are no easy answers, because there is really no precedent for a jury  trial of a deposed dictator charged with drug crimes.  </P> <P> Never before in American history has a jury of 12 ordinary Americans been asked  to sit in judgment on a major foreign policy goal of a President. Brave  soldiers died in order to bring Noriega to justice. Can we really expect jurors  to decide that these soldiers died in vain if they conclude that Noriega is  probably guilty but there is a reasonable doubt?  </P> <P> In previous situations where American foreign policy has demanded the  conviction of deposed tyrants -- for example, at the post-World War II war  criminal tribunals -- the cases were submitted to judges or to courts-martial,  rather than jurors. The same was true of the trial of the murderers of  President Abraham Lincoln at the close of the Civil War. It is expecting far  too much from ordinary jurors to insist that they maintain a presumption of  innocence when the President has put the prestige of our nation behind the  claim that Noriega is a common criminal.  </P> <P> Noriega has the option of waiving a jury trial and asking for a judge, but he  has the constitutional right to demand a jury trial that is fair. The Noriega  case poses a challenging test for the American judicial system. Juries work  best in small cases involving obscure defendants. They do not work well in  highly publicized cases involving notorious defendants. And they are at their  worst when their patriotism is pitted against the rights of the defendant.  </P> <P> Judges, who are given the protection of life tenure, are supposed to assure the  independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers. The federal judge  who presides over the Noriega case will have more than the fate of Manuel  Noriega in his hands. The integrity of the American system of justice will be  on trial in that Florida courtroom.  </P></p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Seaq problems distort weak market A DIFFICULT week on the UK stock market came to an unhappy close yesterday when nervousness over the outlook for US markets was compounded by problems with the Stock Exchange electronic reporting system. Share price quotations, and therefore calculations of market indices, were 'indicative only' from 9.45am to 2.00pm, causing postponement of the expiry of the November FT-SE Traded Option and considerable disruption to trading. These technical mishaps tended to mask the market's increasingly concern over reports that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development had called for a two point rise in US interest rates. Weakness in US bonds unsettled sentiment in London at the close of business. At 3,108.0, the FT-SE Index, down 17.5 on the day, was above the worst. But traders agreed that the period of more than four hours without firm screen price quotations had cast doubts on the reliability of the final picture. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, more closely linked to direct telephone negotiations on share prices, continued to advance, gaining 2.8 to 3,455.3. Seaq volume totalled 514.4m shares, down from 706.3m in the previous session. Share prices were easier from the market opening and by the end of the session, the Footsie had retained less than nine points of the week's gain. 'The stock market has achieved very little over a week that brought excellent news on domestic inflation and employment as well as the success of the NAFTA vote in the US,' said the head dealer at one leading securities house. The government bond market had a quiet session, however, making little response to the late weakness in US Federal bonds. Short-dated gilts eased back a touch but hopes for a base rate cut were not seriously challenged. The longer end also closed a shade easier as the market digested this week's flow of economic data. Uncertainty in the US bondmarket, quickly reflected in a fall of 11 Dow points on Wall Street during London hours, brought falls across the range of US-influenced stocks. While losses were mostly small, there was little joy among pharmaceuticals, oils and the conglomerates. Domestic stocks, which benefited earlier in the week from the improved October Retail price index, were also lacking supporters yesterday.</p>

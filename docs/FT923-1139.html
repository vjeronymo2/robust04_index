			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Unione Italiana Reinsurance Company of America - Correction OUR survey on reinsurance (Financial Times, September 7) referred to Unione Italiana Reinsurance Company of America Inc. as financially troubled. We accept that the decision taken by the parent company Unione Italiana Re to divest its US operation was a voluntary strategic one and that, when taken, the company was, and remains financially sound. We apologise for the error.</p>

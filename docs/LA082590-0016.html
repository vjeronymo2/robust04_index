			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKING FOR A SIGN OF HOPE FROM RAIDERS  </P> <P> We realize the Raiders did not have a great year last year, but after watching  all the games that were shown on television, it was clear that Steve Beuerlein  outplayed Jay Schroeder.  </P> <P> I've talked to many football fans, and we are all confused as to why Schroeder  was signed immediately and Beuerlein still hasn't signed for a smaller amount.  There is probably some explanation for this and, as a Raider fan, I would  appreciate knowing.  </P> <P> HOWARD C. GULICK  </P> <P> Ontario  </P></p>

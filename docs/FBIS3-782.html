			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ventersdorp March 14 SAPA -- Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] leader Eugene  Terreblanche was on Monday unfazed by events in Bophuthatswana,  saying the AWB would be built up to be even stronger levels than  it was.    Addressing a news conference in Ventersdorp, he accused  Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen of having betrayed the  Afrikaner. By going to Parliament, Gen Viljoen would now go on  to the paylist of African National Congress [ANC] President  Nelson Mandela.    Asked whether the AWB's hasty retreat from Mmabatho, during  which it lost three men, did not dent the AWB's credibility, Mr  Terreblanche replied: "I do not know how you can ask such a  question. It is only because you don't have the facts and are  not part of my people and my nation."    He said the AWB lost only three men in Mmabatho while eight  were wounded, compared to 50 dead and 280 injuries on the part  of the Bophuthatswana security forces, and this pointed to a  brilliant victory for the AWB.    He was not sure whether there would be elections from April  26-28, because the country was headed for a revolution.    Mr Terreblanche wanted to know how Gen Viljoen could secure  a  volkstaat [homeland] for the Afrikaner if he became part of a  communist election.    Speaking in the hot Ventersdorp town hall, and flanked by a  row of AWB officers, he said Mr Mangope had been toppled because  Gen Viljoen's forces could not handle the situation in Mmabatho  after the AWB had been ordered out.    The SADF [South African Defense Force] then moved in and  handed over the control of Bophuthatswana to the ANC and the  South African Communist Party.    Mr Terreblanche said the Mmabatho events had been a  communist  plot, and he had been ordered out of the city because he would  not have allowed the administration to fall to communists. He  had been betrayed by communist elements in the Bophuthatswana  and South African Government. "I fought the lot of them. They  posed as loyal people to their own governments."    There were heated exchanges with journalists during question  time. Some journalists at the conference still bore black eyes  sustained during encounters with rightwingers in Mmabatho.    Mr Terreblanche denied that his forces shot dead any women  in  Mmabatho, saying such casualties should be ascribed to crossfire.    Bophuthatswana's former minister of state and Freedom  Alliance Chairman Rowan Cronje had by now managed to give away  two fatherlands, he said.    He added that the AWB would consider rendering assistance to  kwaZulu if such help was requested.    South Africa was now close to confrontation and revolution,  and the borders of the volkstaat would be drawn by the outcome  of war. Mr Terreblanche said the Transvaal and [Orange] Free  State, and northern Natal and Richards Bay would form part of  the volkstaat, minus the homelands in these areas.    President F W de Klerk could not count on the loyalty of the  defence force if he wanted to use it against the rightwingers  and the nation, and he would be unable to counter the African  National Congress/SA Communist Party revolution. "We are  heading for chaos, not an election. We are heading for a  revolution, not peace and prosperity."    Asked again whether the AWB had not retreated from  Bophuthatswana with its tail between its legs, Mr Terreblanche  said: "Ag please, don't you want to ask a real question." He  accused the journalist who posed the question of being part and  parcel of the communist conspiracy.    Mr Terreblanche said dockets had been opened to investigate  the public execution of two wounded AWB men in Mmabatho and the  AWB would not rest until the guilty persons had been brought to  court. A senior AWB officer said funeral arrangements for the  three AWB dead had not yet been finalised.</p>

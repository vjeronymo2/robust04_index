			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (9): The home of Coca-Cola - Soft drinks company is at the forefront of Atlanta community projects - It all began in Atlanta / A look at the remarkable story behind the world's best-known trade mark Coca-Cola may not be the biggest company in Atlanta: in terms of sheer head-count, Delta, AT&amp;T, BellSouth and Lockheed employ more people. But it is the company most commonly associated with the city, and without doubt the one with the strongest historical links to it. Indeed, the company's best-selling product, the Coca-Cola soft drink, was born in Atlanta more than a century ago. According to legend, the first Coca-Cola syrup was brewed up in the city on May 8, 1886 by Dr John Pemberton, a local pharmacist, in a three-legged brass pot in his backyard. Dr Smith carried a jug of the product down the road to Jacobs' Pharmacy where it was tasted, pronounced good, and placed on sale as a soda fountain drink at 5 cents a glass. Coke has come on a bit since then: today, it is the world's most ubiquitous consumer product, the world's best-known trade mark and by far the world's best-selling soft drink. If you include the company's other products - notably, Fanta and Sprite - Coca-Cola accounts for nearly half the world's annual consumption of soft drinks. How did Coca-Cola do it? It helped that people liked the drink (ingredients of the early version included coca leaves and cola nuts, producing an exhilarating cocktail of cocaine and caffeine). But there was more to it than that. Much of the company's early growth was attributable to the business acumen of Asa Candler, an Atlantan who bought the business from Dr Pemberton and greatly expanded it through innovative advertising. Then, in 1919, the Candler family interests sold the company to a syndicate led by Ernest Woodruff, another Atlantan, for Dollars 25m - at the time, the biggest financial transaction the south had seen. Before long, however, the company was in trouble. There were legal disputes with bottlers, sugar prices were turbulent, imitators were rampant and sales were down. There was even talk that the company could go under. But in 1923, Ernest's son, Robert Woodruff, was elected president. This highly successful businessman was to lead the company for the next six decades. One of Robert Woodruff's most astute moves was to embark on a big international expansion for Coca-Cola. To a large degree, the foundations for this expansion were laid during the Second World War when Woodruff declared it his objective 'to see that every man in uniform gets a bottle of Coca-Cola for 5 cents wherever he is and whatever it costs the company.' The result was that 64 bottling plants were shipped abroad and billions of bottles of Coke were consumed. The reason this proved so important was that the presence of Coca-Cola did more than lift the morale of the troops. In many areas, it gave people their first taste of Coca-Cola - a taste they obviously enjoyed. And when peace returned, the Coca-Cola system was poised for the rapid international growth that continues today. This explains one of the big differences between Coca-Cola and its rival PepsiCo, the US manufacturer of Pepsi-Cola. In the US, Coke struggles to outsell Pepsi. But in the rest of the world, the only big markets which Pepsi has been able to dominate are those from which Coke was at one time excluded for political reasons, such as the former Soviet Union and the Middle East. The result is that Coke now gets about 80 per cent of its operating profits from outside the US, while the figure for PepsiCo's beverage division is barely 16 per cent. Although Coca-Cola is easily the world's biggest soft drinks company, and growing bigger by the day, it cannot afford to relax. Recently, competition from private label colas has been an irritant in the US, Canada and the UK, and in the US Coca-Cola is having to react to the rapid growth of alternative beverages such as iced teas and fruit juice drinks, introducing its own range of 'natural' drinks. But the company's strong profits growth suggests it is doing the right things: last year, net income rose by 19 per cent to a record Dollars 2.2bn, excluding unusual items. For Atlanta, it is just as well. Apart from the fact that Coca-Cola and its bottling affiliates provide employment for nearly 8,000 people in the city, the company has a reputation for being Atlanta's leading corporate citizen, pursuing a long-standing strategy of philanthropic involvement in the community. This philanthropic involvement began with Robert Woodruff, whose contributions to Atlanta's arts, to cultural organisations and to educational communities amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars over his lifetime. The tradition has been continued by the company itself - not least through the creation in 1984 of the Coca-Cola Foundation, an organisation dedicated to supporting excellence in education. Examples of the foundation's work in Atlanta over the last year or so include a Dollars 2m contribution to Clark Atlanta University to support teacher eduction and to develop a School of Public and International Affairs; a contribution of Dollars 1m to Morris Brown College to support faculty chair endowments and the Presidential Scolars Program for African-American students; and a Dollars 1m gift to Georgia State University for the renovation of the Rialto Theatre and two nearby buildings to help revive the historic Fairlie-Poplar district. In the arts field, Coca-Cola makes contributions totalling more than Dollars 1m a year to about 40 organisations. It recently pledged Dollars 500,000 to the Martin Luther King Jr Center which aims to advance the non-violent philosophies fo Dr King in the ares of training, research and education. And it made a Dollars 1m commitment to the Atlanta Project, an initiative established by the former president Jimmy Carter to fight poverty and hopelessness in the inner city. Atlanta's business leaders are unstinting in their praise of Coca-Cola's contribution to the city - 'if every company were as community-minded as Coca-Cola, we would have a Utopian city here,' says Mr Gerald Bartels, president of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. 'They are always in the forefront of any community project with their money, with their leadership, with whatever it might take.'</p>

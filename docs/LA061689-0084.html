			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Jerusalem's High Court of Justice lifted an Israeli ban Thursday on the  controversial movie "The Last Temptation of Christ," stating that only an  extreme attack on a subject justifies limiting free expression. Golan Globus,  the film's distributor in Israel, welcomed the ruling of the five-judge panel  and said it will screen the movie next week in Tel Aviv. The Israeli Film  Censorship Board had banned "The Last Temptation of Christ" in October, saying  the movie by American director Martin Scorsese would offend Christians and  violate Israeli law against harming religious feelings. The film portrays Jesus  as weak-willed and confused about his divine mission. A hallucination sequence  includes Jesus having sex with Mary Magdalene. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

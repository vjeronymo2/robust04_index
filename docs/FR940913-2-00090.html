LACBWR is located 19 miles south of La Crosse, Wisconsin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Identification of Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed action would allow DPC to: (i) make limited changes in the facility or procedures as described the Decommissioning Plan; and (ii) conduct certain tests and experiments not described in the Decommissioning Plan, without prior NRC approval. The licensee requested, by letters dated August 2, and August 5, 1994, that the NRC issue an order that revises the Decommissioning Order to allow DPC limited flexibility under its Decommissioning Plan. This action is consistent with the flexibility under 10 CFR 50.59 afforded to a licensee authorized to operate a production or utilization facility and afforded by other Decommissioning Orders issued by the NRC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Need for the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The LACBWR has been shut down since April 30, 1987. All spent fuel has been removed from the reactor and is stored in the fuel element storage well. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee's authority to operate LACBWR was removed by license Amendment No. 56, dated August 4, 1987. The licensee is authorized to possess but not operate the LACBWR. The NRC in its Order (Decommissioning Order) of August 7, 1991, directed DPC to decommission the reactor facility in accordance with its Decommissioning Plan and the Commission's regulations. This action was taken in response to the licensee's application for authorization to decommission the facility, dated December 21, 1987, as revised February 22, 1988, September 9, 1988, September 30, 1988, January 26, 1989, March 28, 1989, June 6, 1989, October 3, 1989, July 25, 1990, May 10, 1991, and July 25, 1991. Neither the August 7, 1991, Decommissioning Order which directed the licensee to decommission the reactor facility, nor the approved Decommissioning Plan, contained an approved procedure that would allow the licensee to: (i) make changes in the facility or procedures as described the Decommissioning Plan; or (ii) conduct tests or experiments not described in the Decommissioning Plan, without prior NRC approval. The LACBWR is currently in SAFSTOR in accordance with the approved LACBWR Decommissioning Plan. This Confirmatory Order would modify the Decommissioning Order and allow the licensee to: (i) make limited changes in the facility or procedures as described the Decommissioning Plan; or (ii) conduct certain tests or experiments not described in the Decommissioning Plan without prior NRC approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed action, procedural in nature, does not involve any significant environmental impacts. The proposed Confirmatory Order modifies the Decommissioning Order to allow the licensee to: (i) make changes in the facility or procedures as described the Decommissioning Plan; or (ii) conduct tests or experiments not described in the Decommissioning Plan without prior NRC approval provided they do not involve an unreviewed safety question or a significant environmental impact not previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the proposed action does not involve a change in plant operation or configuration, there is reasonable assurance that the proposed action would not increase the probability or the consequence of an accident or reduce the margin of safety. No changes would be made in the types or quantities of effluent that may be released offsite. Further, there would be no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative radiation exposure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the NRC concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed action does not affect non-radiological plant effluent and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the NRC concludes that there are no significant non-radiological impacts associated with the proposed action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives to the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the NRC has concluded that there are no measurable environmental impacts associated with the proposed action, any alternative with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative would be to deny the request. This would not significantly reduce environmental impacts of plant decommissioning and would result in reduced flexibility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative Use of Resources <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Environmental Assessment included as an enclosure to the Decommissioning Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Agencies and Persons Consulted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This Environmental Assessment was prepared by the NRC staff, primarily within the Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, Rockville, Maryland. The NRC staff consulted with a representative of the State of Wisconsin regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action, and the State did not provide comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based upon this Environmental Assessment, the staff concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the NRC has determined not to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the proposed Confirmatory Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee application for the order dated August 2, and August 5, 1994, which is available for public inspection at the Commission Public Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the La Crosse Public Library, 800 Main Street, La Crosse, Wisconsin 54601. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 2nd day of September, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Michael F.

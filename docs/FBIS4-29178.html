			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The DPRK's Withdrawal From the IAEA Will Not </F> Bring a Solution to the Nuclear Issue"]    [Text] On 13 June, North Korea announced its decision to  immediately withdraw from the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA).    Although the act was meant to oppose an IAEA resolution to  freeze technical aid to the country, it runs counter to the  international community's hope for nuclear nonproliferation.  Thus, it is very regrettable.    It is unclear whether this is Pyongyang's final attitude  toward the problem of the country's suspected nuclear weapons  development. But its withdrawal from the IAEA will not bring a  solution to the issue. We again call for the country to hear  the opinion of the international community.    Prior to Pyongyang's announcement, Japanese Foreign Minister  Koji Kakizawa visited South Korea and China to discuss the  DPRK's suspected nuclear program with his counterparts.    In Japan-ROK talks, the two countries agreed that the time  has come for the UN Security Council [UNSC] to take appropriate  measures, including economic sanctions, and that such measures  should be aimed at encouraging North Korea to change its  attitude.    Meanwhile, in Japan-PRC foreign ministerial talks, China  questioned the effectiveness of sanctions and stressed the need  to resolve the issue through dialogue.    In this sense, China has not changed its cautious approach  toward imposing sanctions. However, considering the fact that  the PRC did not express clear opposition to sanctions, and that  it abstained from a vote on the IAEA resolution calling for the  freeze of technical aid to the DPRK, it can be said Beijing has  indicated some flexibility in dealing with the issue.    In talks with the United States, Japan has asserted  implementing phased sanctions. It said the United Nations  should first adopt a "resolution of warning," and then it should  lay an embargo on the export of weapons and suspend technical  aid to the DPRK, and finally it should implement all-out  sanctions, including the suspension of remittances to the  country.    Some U.S. newspapers reported the Japanese assertion,  commenting: "Japan is reluctant to carry out economic sanctions  against North Korea." The Japanese Embassy at Washington  strongly rebutted it, saying: "The report is inaccurate."    In a series of talks, Foreign Minister Kakizawa reiterated  Japan's position that although it strongly hopes for resolving  the issue through dialogue, "Japan will take responsive measures  within the limits of the Constitution if the UNSC makes a  decision."    Japan has taken a position against nuclear proliferation.  Thus, if the DPRK promotes nuclear development, it will affect  the basis of Japan's security policy.    Japan, the United States, and the ROK should not be in  disarray over a basic policy toward the DPRK. Otherwise,  Pyongyang will continue to take a hard-line attitude.    It is very regrettable that when the nuclear issue has  entered a serious situation, Japan has made no in-depth  discussions on the matter.    The government has failed to discuss fully the nuclear issue  because of opposition parties' attempt to nail cabinet ministers  down with a slip of tongue to urge them to step down. At the  same time, the government has avoided discussions on detailed  measures to deal with the issue. This is problematic.    At a 13 June House of Councillors' Budget Committee session,  officials of concerned ministries and agencies were asked about  the issue of imposing sanctions on the DPRK. Without exception,  they all answered: "We are studying measures, but we cannot  disclose them." If the government continues to take such an  attitude, there will be no progress in discussions on the  nuclear issue. It will also remain unclear what the "within the  limits of the Constitution" means.    Senior officials of both ruling and opposition parties are  concerned about what will happen after the budget bill is  enacted. They are only arguing whether they should submit a  motion of no confidence against the cabinet or the cabinet  should resign en masse. Such an attitude is tantamount to the  evasion of responsibility to be assumed as people's  representatives and will endanger the nation's future.</p>

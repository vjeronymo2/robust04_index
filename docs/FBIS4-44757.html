			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Consultant: Strong Growth in Optical </F> Communications Market"; Subheads: "Impetus from Heavy Demand for  Local Area Networks and Network Routing"; "Expansion in Asia and  Europe"]    [Text] Frankfurt--Stimulated by the rapidly increasing  demand for beam waveguides for local area networks [LAN] and LAN  routing, the optical communications market should more than  double internationally from $4.4 billion in 1992 to an estimated  $9.1 billion in 1999, according to a market report by the U.S.  consultancy firm of Frost and Sullivan, Inc.    The report also predicts that the beam waveguide cable will  lose its relative importance as a current driving force for  market growth in proportion as market focus shifts to shorter  communication paths and this should lead to greater demand for  optical transmitters, receivers and routing facilities.    As predicted by the consultants, beam waveguide cable will  shrink from 59 percent of the total market in 1992 to 44 percent  in the year 1999, whereas receivers will increase in the same  time period from nine to 17 percent since new technologies will  facilitate connecting a number of receivers to shared  transmitters. Market share for transmitters, in turn, will rise  from 24 to 27 percent, for connectors, from six to eight percent  and for couplers, from three to four percent.    Originally, beam waveguides were installed above all on U.S.  long-distance networks. But when expansion of the system was  able to be mostly concluded in recent years, beam waveguide  installation shifted to international traffic and increasingly  to LANs and LAN routing.    Up until now the optical communications industry has been  dominated by North America, accounting for 48 percent of  turnover in 1992. According to the report, there is likely to be  a decrease since shipments from Pacific Rim countries can be  expected to increase from 21 to 25 percent and from Europe, from  20 to 23 percent. Pressure to compete globally will increasingly  move to the center of planning by manufacturers operating  internationally.    The consultants expect that there will be increased  installations of beam waveguide systems. On the other hand they  will be curbed by costs that still continue to be comparatively  high. A large number of new market participants will be joining  the global competition and strategic alliances are likely to  attract a sizable share of the international market. As regards  the micro-electronic undergirding for optical communications,  the analysts proceed on the assumption that opto-electronically  integrated circuits, even in the early phase of their  development, are likely to be an increasingly attractive  emergent and cost-effective alternative to the current status of  component engineering, since they will contribute considerably  to enhanced system performance. It is highly probable that fiber  optic amplifiers will displace expensive electronic regenerators  in optical long-distance communications systems.

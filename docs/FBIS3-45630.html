Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Jan. 20 (CNA) -- Taiwan investors are  welcome to explore the insurance market in Mainland China, a  senior mainland insurance executive said here Thursday [20  January].    Li Yumin, president of Mainland China's insurance  association, made the remark upon his arrival at Chiang Kai-shek  International Airport. Li led a 20-member delegation to Taiwan  for a seminar on cross-Taiwan Strait insurance cooperation.    The mainland's insurance market is expected to be  liberalized  after Mainland China becomes a member of the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Li noted, adding that prospects for  the mainland insurance industry are good.    At present, there are no Taiwan investments in the  mainland's  insurance industry, while more than 30 foreign insurance  companies have established representative offices in Mainland  China, he pointed out.    Li, also chairman of the People's Insurance Company of  China,  and his 20-member mainland delegation will attend the  cross-strait insurance forum January 22-25 at the Grand Hyatt  Taipei.    The three-day forum will be the second of its kind. The  first was held in Beijing and Shanghai in September 1992.  [separate sessions were held in those cities]    Sponsored by the National Insurance Institute, the forum  will  focus on insurance rules and regulations, future trends, and the  division of social and business insurance.</p>

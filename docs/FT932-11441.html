			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / International Company News: Support for Kodak head INDEPENDENT directors of Kodak, the US film-to-pharmaceuticals group, yesterday issued a statement of support for Mr Kay Whitmore, the embattled chairman, but also insisted the company's performance 'must be improved significantly', writes Martin Dickson in New York. The statement followed a plunge in Kodak's share price last week when Mr Christopher Steffen, its new chief financial officer, quit after just 11 weeks because of differences with Mr Whitmore. Kodak's outside directors said yesterday the board expected management to submit a comprehensive plan, including expense and debt reduction and strategic focus, between now and September. They said they were committed to achieving 'significantly greater shareholder value in 1993 and beyond' and fully supported the efforts of Mr Whitmore and senior managers to accomplish this.</p>

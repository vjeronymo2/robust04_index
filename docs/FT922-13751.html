			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Wayward Bulgaria returns to path of reform: Plans for the privatisation of state enterprises have put Sofia back in the International Monetary Fund's good books BULGARIA'S economic reform programme is back on course following a brain-storming session involving officials from Phare, the European Community's special technical assistance programme for eastern Europe, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the recently elected Bulgarian government. Also at what one Phare official described as 'a very big round table' were experts from Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. 'Their presence was important for all of us,' explained Ms Tania Brisby, a consultant at DFC, a Spanish firm which Phare is financing to advise the Bulgarian government. 'They made valuable contributions about their own experiences on privatisation.' The end result is a privatisation bill which parliament is now debating. 'It is a very flexible bill. Its aim was to allow for all types of methods of sale,' explained Ms Brisby. These would include public auctions and tenders, and will be open to foreign investors. Pushing through this privatisation bill is crucial. It will put Bulgaria back on the reform track; it will secure a second World Bank tranche of Dollars 100m which was delayed because the reforms were slowed down; it will attract much-needed foreign investment; it could bring an earlier end to the recession. The bill envisages: Establishing a privatisation agency to implement the programme. Privatisation is expected to be a lengthy process because 95 per cent of Bulgaria's enterprises are state-owned. Transforming state or municipally owned enterprises into joint stock companies for partial or total sale. Placing proceeds from privatisation in a special bank account to cover part of the privatisation expenses. Allocating 20 per cent of the stock or shares of privatised enterprises to a mutual fund established by the government. An additional 20 per cent of the proceeds from privatisation will be allocated to the same mutual fund. The fund will be used to finance transfers to social security funds, and for compensating former owners. The mutual funds will be managed by the privatisation agency. Bulgaria, like Hungary, has avoided the cumbersome Czechoslovak-type voucher scheme. Giving employees of the state or municipal companies which will be transformed into joint stock companies options to subscribe on preferential terms for up to 20 per cent of the shares. The preferential price will be half the share price. The number of preferential shares an employee can hold will depend on length of service. Bulgaria, unlike Czechoslovakia, has also avoided giving shares away free. A year ago, Bulgaria was well on the course to economic reform. A coalition government introduced the first phase of an IMF-backed stabilisation programme to introduce tight monetary policy which would slash subsidies, curb inflation, and reduce soft bank credits to enterprises. The implementation of the initial phase of austerity measures had a much greater impact on Bulgaria than several of the other east European countries. The reforms were introduced at a time when trade with the former Soviet Union, which had accounted for more than 65 per cent of Bulgaria's foreign trade, was collapsing. The country's enterprises were in no position to find new markets. Second, Bulgaria was dependent on the Soviet Union for about 70 per cent of its energy supplies. The switch to the dollar clearing system, and Russia's own economic problems led to sharp falls in energy supplies to Bulgaria. The loss of the Soviet market, and energy shortages accelerated the decline in industrial output. In 1991, output had fallen by 27.8 per cent compared to 1990. Over the same period, imports fell by 17 per cent, and exports rose by 0.1 per cent. Higher food prices and wage increases kept the inflation rate at around 80 per cent. By the end of 1991, unemployment exceeded 400,000, or more than 10 per cent of the labour force. Also, Bulgaria had little access to fresh loans from western governments or commercial banks, mainly because all loans to Bulgaria were frozen after March 1990, when the communist government imposed a moratorium on all payments of interest and principal on its western commercial and government debts. Until the Bulgarian state recently agreed to guarantee its hard-currency debt of Dollars 9.6bn to its commercial creditors, there was little prospect of negotiating a long-term rescheduling of that loan. The government, headed by Mr Filip Dimitrov from the Union of Democratic Forces, is now saddled with this debt. In the meantime, Bulgaria has been relying on an IMF stand-by arrangement, which last year totalled Dollars 150m, and the first of two World Bank structural adjustment Loans, which total Dollars 250m. Despite the economic hardships of the reforms, the public backed them. But in the latter half of 1991, the pace of reforms slowed, largely because Bulgaria was preoccupied with the presidential and parliamentary elections. In addition, internal bickering in the parliament, where the communists remain the largest opposition party, virtually paralysed legislation, particularly on privatisation and land reform. The delay in pushing ahead with the reforms prompted the World Bank to consider withholding a second tranche of Dollars 100m. There were also fears that the recession would be prolonged. Hence the present sense of purpose. 'Bulgaria lost the momentum over the past few months,' a World Bank official said. 'But the privatisation bill shows it is now getting back on the rails.'</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir in Cyprus: Admiration and concern for a compatriot's acts - North London's Turkish Cypriot community talks about Asil Nadir to Gillian Tett THEY have not yet created a proverb about him. But in the smoke-filled cafes frequented by the Turkish Cypriot community in north London the verdict yesterday on Mr Asil Nadir was tinged with more than a touch of poetry - and paradox. 'He is a so-so hero - we admire what he has done, but also fear it,' said Ahmet, a waiter in a Dalston cafe which serves the large Turkish Cypriot community in Dalston, Hackney and Islington. The reasons for the fear among Cypriot business people are clear. An estimated 100,000 Turkish Cypriots now live in Britain, owning scores of small businesses, restaurants and shops. Although yesterday most were keen to distance themselves from Mr Nadir, they acknowledged that the media attention that has surrounded his departure could make an already difficult business climate even harder. 'This will certainly affect the honest Cypriot businessmen,' said Mr Husein Enver, manager of a small printing company. 'We already face a lot of prejudice. But now people will say: 'You're from the place that that fellow Nadir is from, the place of crooks.' And who can blame them?' Part of the problem they face is, as Mr Enver points out, the Cypriot community's reputation for concentrating in marginal businesses. 'We are like the Jews were a generation ago - we're doing the textiles, rag trade and other small businesses,' said Mr Enver. However, textile traders insisted that their business could survive the problems of prejudice. 'This kind of thing has happened before - and we're still here,' said the manager of one of the largest Cypriot textile companies. With close business ties binding together the Turkish Cypriot families - including those of Mr Nadir and Mr Ramadan Guney, who posted Pounds 1m of his bail - the Cypriots form a distinctive group by any immigrant standards. 'Integration is not always very good,' said Mr Munir Essel of the Dalston Turkish Cypriot Cultural Association, who admits that many of the older generation who came to the UK in the peak immigration years between 1958 and 1962 - a movement that brought nearly a fifth of the total Turkish and Greek Cypriot population in Britain - still have problems com municating with English offic-ials. But in spite of the concerns, Mr Nadir's support among his compatriots yesterday was undeniable. 'He is more popular now than ever before,' said Mustafa, a retired shopkeeper, as he sat drinking Turkish coffee in a cafe. His neighbour, Hasan, a self employed accountant added: 'We are very angry about the lack of justice. We think he has been picked on because he is a foreigner. So we think he was absolutely right to do what he did.' Meanwhile, Mr Osman Kemel, owner of the cafe, said: 'He has employed a lot of people - he is a good man. And you can't blame the Turks for what has happened.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Wandile Zote from the "Newsline </F> program; italicized passages in vernacular]    [Text] [Zote] This was not a flight over enemy territory by  SADF [South African Defense Force] war planes, as they used to  do in the past. It was a fly-past to mark the dawn of a new  political era in South Africa. This was 10 May this year,  during the inauguration of South Africa's first black president,  Nelson Mandela.    Not far from the podium where a few minutes ago Mandela had  taken the oath of office stood the new National Defense Force in  its new uniform. Next to President Mandela stood the chief of  the National Defense Force [NDF], General Georg Meiring, the man  entrusted with the task of molding the new army. In spite of  his past as the chief of the SADF, which fought viciously to  defend apartheid, Meiring has earned the respect of some, if not  all, of his former enemies.    His major task of integrating the SADF, Umkhonto we Sizwe  [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing; MK], the Azanian  People's Liberation Army [APLA], as well as the armies of the  former TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states, is  a daunting one, indeed. The process got off to a shaky start a  few months ago, when MK recruits at Wallmannsthal stoned and  torched the car of their chief of staff, Siphiwe Nyanda. Their  complaints varied from poor catering services and facilities to  allegations of racism by former SADF officers. These, however,  have been denied by MK commanders at Wallmannsthal.    [Former MK Commander Stephen Kobe] The company which is  supplying the food now is a new company. That was from the  first company which was catering, which was supplying food here.    [Zote] Did that have anything to do with racism?    [Kobe] No, no. It was just the spoiled kind of food.    [Zote] Wallmannsthal is situated north of Pretoria, and it  is  here that former MK cadres are assembled in preparation for  integration into the National Defense Force. On arrival at this  assembly area, young men and women have their names checked  against a list submitted by their regional commanders. It is  this process of registration that has become a source of  conflict between former cadres and their commanders at  Wallmannsthal.    [First unidentified MK cadre, in English and Xhosa] The only  thing that can fix this problem is the MK and the  state president. The commander in chief of the army must  intervene because we could not have stayed in  Angola for so many years. The next thing, when we go  back to the army, awaiting integration, then we find there are  people who do not appear in the MK list.    [Second unidentified MK cadre, in Xhosa] Those that  have been chased away, what have they come back to do? This is  not right, these Boers are fooling with us.    [Third unidentified MK cadre, in Zulu] My problem is  that these guerrillas who were sent back home must be taken in,  and these other recruits should be sent away so that everything  can run smoothly. Otherwise there is going to be corruption  around here.    [Zote, in Zulu] Which recruits are you talking about,  sister?    [Third unidentified MK cadre, in Zulu] These SDUs  [self-defense units] all over this place and those trained  at KwaMashu, wherever, Johannesburg, they should be sent away  and then all the authentic guerrillas should replace them.    [Zote] The task of winning the hearts and minds of the  soldiers in the new NDF is giving military planners sleepless  nights. They now admit they knew from the start that  integration will not be an easy process. Recently about 2,000  new recruits were dismissed from Wallmannsthal, because their  names did not appear on the submitted list, and some of them  were not members of MK. Not willing to accept their fate, the  recruits, still carrying their personal belongings, marched on  Shell House, the ANC headquarters in Johannesburg, to register  their protest.    In a bid to appease its members, the ANC accused the  commanders at Wallmannsthal of high-handedness. This is  surprising, considering that former MK commanders who are now  based at Wallmannsthal actually endorsed the dismissals. In  fact, those commanders have criticized the ANC for politicizing  what they perceive as a military matter.    [Former MK Commander Edward Mabiletsa] The communication  lines between ourselves as former full-time members of the ANC  are gradually being eroded, because there is a requirement that  for us to proceed with the integration of the armed forces, and  to continue a career as professional soldiers, we have to be  apolitical. We do not represent the ANC in Wallmannsthal, or  any other party. So there is a deliberate move on our part to  erode that kind of link.    [Zote] Colonel Terence Murphy is from the old SADF, and Mr.  Gilbert Ramano is an MK veteran, and they are both at the helm  of the integration process at Wallmannsthal. They are both  confident about the success of the process, and they say no  problem at Wallmannsthal is insurmountable. To underline his  commitment to the new South Africa, Mr. Ramano says he wants to  see an end to the singing of freedom songs at the army base. He  says the songs are no longer desirable in the new army, which  seeks to be nonpolitical.    Meanwhile, political mudslinging between Gen. Meiring and  commanders of the former liberation armies about how integration  should be handled have added another dimension to the problem.  Media reports quote Gen. Meiring as having said a minimum of 30  years in the army would be required before anyone could qualify  to become a general in the new army. Both APLA and MK have  described Meiring's utterances in this regard as irresponsible.  One may as well ask who should determine the standards for the  new NDF.    [Meiring] There are a number of people in the nonstatutory  forces that served for a long time. The present minister served  for more than 30 years in this capacity, so if he were to be in  the NDF as such, he could be aspiring for such a rank.    [Nyanda] Statements which are made about qualifications into  the general staff, or into the higher echelons of the military  establishment, may be irritating, but in some instances, in many  instances, they actually are correct. I think if, for instance,  there are appointments from our ranks into that general staff --  if I am appointed, for instance, into the general staff -- it  will indeed be a political appointment, but it does not mean  that we are not equal to the tasks, and of course, it is an  exaggeration to say 30 years.    [APLA Chief Commander General Daniel Mofokeng] Our view will  be that the issue must be discussed thoroughly with all the  forces involved, and as you are saying correctly, that is a  criterion, or the former SADF criterion. But inasfar as the age  is concerned, that will have to be discussed thoroughly. In any  case, when coming to the appointment of generals, it is a  question of the cabinet and the Parliament.    [Zote] There is also disagreement about the racial  composition of the new army, and whether affirmative action can  be applied without sacrificing the high standards required of a  modern army. Georg Meiring believes it is not necessary for the  army to reflect the nature of the South African society in its  composition. However, Siphiwe Nyanda disagrees, and he feels  affirmative action is necessary to address the imbalances of the  past, where the number of blacks in the old SADF was kept down.    [Meiring] The NDF will not, of necessity, reflect a specific  stature of the country as a whole. It will contain the best  people for the job in a colorless society.    [Nyanda] The South African National Defense Force would  reflect to a large degree South African society. However, the  echelons, the hierarchy, the top echelons of the South African  National Defense Force would not in the short term -- we hope  that in the immediate and long term it will.    [Zote] While the integration of all other armies is taking  place, APLA's position in the new national defense force remains  unclear. Gen. Meiring says APLA cadres who wish to join the  army can only do so as individuals. This, he says, is because  the PAC was not represented in the Transitional Executive  Council [TEC] subcouncil on defense which drew up the guidelines  for the integration process.    [Meiring] No APLA member was on a list. In fact, APLA didn't  form part of the process, the TEC process until that time more  or less, and there was not a list presented by APLA to include  their cadres to be included into the SANDF. Therefore, the APLA  members are not automatically members of the SANDF.    [Mofokeng] We are still here engaged in the process of  integrating APLA as an organ, and APLA as a structure, and the  issue of APLA being integrated is at the level of the  presidency. I think you will remember that Comrade Makwetu, the  president of the Pan-Africanist Congress, met the head of state,  Comrade Nelson Mandela, to discuss about the issue.    [Zote] Inspite of all the problems that have occurred during  these early stages of the integration process, all sides are  optimistic about its success. The big test, however, will come  during the second stage of integration when former MK and APLA  cadres meet their former enemies from the SADF at the barracks.  In military circles hopes for reconciliation between former  enemies are in danger of turning into distrust. Since the birth  of a new South Africa there have been reports of ugly incidents  at barracks. Whether a solution will be found in time before the  situation slides further into anarchy remains to be seen.</p>

The result was 'somewhat below' directors' initial expectations and the shares slipped 9p to 80p. Turnover from continuing activities improved from Pounds 13m to Pounds 13.4m, with household textiles accounting for Pounds 6.08m (Pounds 4.81m) and garments for Pounds 6.55m (Pounds 7.59m). There were lower earnings per share of 2.87p (5.19p). The interim dividend is a same-again 1.85p. The directors said an office had been established in Shanghai which would enable the group to keep abreast of the 'rapidly developing' supply base in China.</p>

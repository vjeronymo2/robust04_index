			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The revised DHHS guidelines modify the temperature range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within which a specimen must fall in order to avoid creating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a reason to believe that a urine specimen has been altered or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substituted. The old range is 32.5&hyph;37.7C/90.5&hyph;99.8F. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new range is 32&hyph;38C/90&hyph;100F. Part 40 references are being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changed to conform with the DHHS revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Clarification of Chain of Custody Requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 40.25 contains a number of references to use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chain of custody documentation in the handling and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transportation of urine specimens. Recently, an arbitrator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misinterpreted these provisions, determining that a chain of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> custody was invalid, and that the test must be canceled,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because persons involved solely in the transportation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intact shipping container did not make a chain of custody  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entry. This interpretation is contrary to Part 40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures, wholly unnecessary in order to preserve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrity of the process, and, if followed, would result in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wholesale disruption of the DOT testing program. As DHHS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recently pointed out in its revised drug testing guidelines,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Since specimens are sealed in packages that would indicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any tampering during transit to the laboratory and couriers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> express carriers, and postal service personnel do not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> access to the chain of custody forms, there is no requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that such personnel document chain of custody for the package  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during transit.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department interprets its  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> existing  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions as not requiring couriers, postal employees, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other personnel involved in the transportation of urine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specimens to make chain of custody form entries. Likewise,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department interprets its  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> existing  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> rules as not requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making entries on the chain of custody form when a sealed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipping container is put into or removed from temporary,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secure storage. In present &sect;40.25(c), for example, handling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or transportation of a specimen from one ``place'' to another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be accomplished through chain of custody procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department interprets this as meaning that as long as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is an entry from an individual authorized to release  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the specimen from the collection site ( ``Place''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another from an individual authorized to receive it on behalf  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the laboratory (``Place''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2), the persons who perform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intervening, ministerial transportation services (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> couriers, truck drivers, airplane pilots, postal service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees, mail room employees) need not make such entries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Present paragraph 40.25(h) authorizes chain of custody  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation to be ``enclosed'' in the shipping container for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipment to the laboratory. This container is sealed with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tamper-evident tape. As a program matter, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommends enclosing chain of custody documentation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipping container, as opposed to attaching it to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exterior of the container, since this minimizes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likelihood of loss of or damage to the documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interpreting the rule to require persons performing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intervening transportation services to make chain of custody  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entries would nullify this important provision of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to make chain of custody entries, intervening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transportation personnel would have to break the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tamper-evident seal, dig out the documentation, make an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entry, reinsert the documentation, and re-seal the container.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of course, a shipping container with a seal that had been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broken and re-sealed a number of times would make it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unlikely, if not impossible, for a valid test to be conducted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the specimen it contained. The Department could not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpret its regulations to create such an absurd result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Present &sect;40.25 (k) directs the use of a chain of custody  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form ``from the point of collection to the final disposition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the specimen.'' This provision directs that every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual ``in the chain'' be identified. Unlike authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection site and laboratory personnel, who actually handle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the specimen, intervening transportation personnel are not,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly speaking, ``in the chain'' at all, a point which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department has understood to be consistent with long-standing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case law in a variety of contexts. Consequently, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department never understood or intended this language to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that intervening transportation personnel make chain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of custody entries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A related issue, raised in the same arbitration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision, concerns temporary secure storage. That is, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection site person conducts the test, fills out the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> custody and control form, places the specimen and form in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sealed shipping container, and places the container in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secure, temporary storage at the collection site, where a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> courier picks it up subsequently for transportation to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory. Again, any tampering would be revealed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tamper-evident seal. Here, too, requiring an entry in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chain of custody for putting the package into and removing it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the temporary secure storage is unnecessary and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disruptive. Alternatives, such as not sealing the chain of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> custody documentation in the shipping container until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately before pickup, or attaching the chain of custody  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation to the outside of the shipping container when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is ready for pickup, multiply the possibilities for error.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We emphasize that the collector should, as a matter of good  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice, document in its own records the times at which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sealed shipping containers are put into and removed from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary secure storage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notwithstanding the Department's reasonable construction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of its existing regulatory language, which has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communicated in the past to persons raising the question, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least one arbitrator did misinterpret these provisions. To  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent the possibility of any such mistakes in the future,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department it taking this opportunity to clarify its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. To this end, we are adding language very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar to that of DHHS to &sect;40.25 (c), (h), and (k), as well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as an additional sentence that strongly emphasizes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underlines that chains of custody need not include entries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from such personnel in order to be valid. In addition, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendments to these paragraphs make clear that the absence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entries in the chain of custody relating to the putting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> package into or retrieving it from temporary secure storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the collection site does not invalidate the chain of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> custody.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is making this amendment effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately, because it is essential to protect DOT drug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing procedures from misinterpretations that, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> followed, could invalidate virtually all chains of custody  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for DOT drug tests, even though they follow Part 40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. This necessity constitutes the good cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by the Administrative Procedure Act to make a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation effective without the normal 30-day effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Untestable, Inadequate, or Unavailable Split Specimens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In split sample testing, there could be situations in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the primary specimen reaches the laboratory unscathed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but the split specimen does not. Instead, the split specimen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is untestable, inadequate, or unavailable. For example, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> split specimen container may have leaked, leaving an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inadequate amount of urine for testing. What is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory to do? To answer this question, which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department has been asked on a number of occasions, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adding a paragraph to &sect;40.29. The paragraph directs the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory to go ahead and test the primary specimen in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> usual way. The laboratory then sends the result of the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the primary specimen to the MRO in the usual way. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test result from the laboratory was a confirmed positive, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the MRO verifies the result as positive, then the employee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has 72 hours to request a test of the split specimen. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the employee does so, the MRO will pass the request on to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory. It is only at this point, and not before, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the laboratory informs the MRO that the split specimen is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> untestable, inadequate, or unavailable. The MRO would then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancel the test. This approach is consistent with existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOT guidance and the DHHS guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

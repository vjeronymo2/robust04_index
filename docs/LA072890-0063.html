			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOUISIANA GOVERNOR VETOES STRICTEST U.S. ABORTION BILL  </P> <P> Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer on Friday vetoed the nation's most restrictive  abortion bill, saying the measure was insensitive to the rights of rape  victims.  </P> <P> The veto was a major setback to anti-abortion activists who had hoped the bill  might lead to a test of the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing  abortion.  </P> <P> Roemer, who describes himself as "pro-life," said the bill "does not meet even  the minimum standards set by me long ago." And he went on to criticize the  state legislators who rushed the anti-abortion bill through by grafting it to  another that banned flag burning.  </P> <P> The bill would have prohibited abortions except to save the life of the mother,  and in cases of aggravated rape and incest reported to police and a physician  no more than a week after they occured. Doctors who performed illegal abortions  could have been sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $100,000.  </P> <P> The veto marked yet another chapter in this state's highly-charged controversy  over the abortion issue. Earlier in the legislative session Roemer had vetoed  an even tougher bill that would have allowed an abortion only to save the life  of the mother. An attempted override failed by only three votes.  </P> <P> And it also marked the second time this year that anti-abortion forces have  been thwarted by a Democratic governor they had long considered an ally. In  March, Gov. Cecil D. Andrus of Idaho vetoed anti-abortion legislation that also  presented a direct challenge to Roe vs. Wade.  </P> <P> "In both cases, we've had a betrayal by a governor who has been on the record  as pro-life," said Burke Balch, the state legislative director of the National  Right to Life Committee, the nation's largest anti-abortion organization.  </P> <P> Anti-abortion legislators in Louisiana said that they would attempt to call a  special session Aug. 18 to attempt a veto override, and might even attempt to  revive the first, tougher bill. But the majority of both houses must agree by  mail to such a meeting, and no special session to override a veto has ever been  held in the state.  </P> <P> "I think he's (the governor) trying to play all sides and I think politically  it will catch up with him," said State Sen. Mike Cross, a leader of the  anti-abortion contingent in the Legislature. "He's playing wishy-washy with the  people of this state."  </P> <P> Those who favor legal abortion were elated with the veto. "There's an old  saying that says oppression against men is a tragedy, oppression against women  is a tradition," said Terri Bartletti, the executive director of Planned  Parenthood in Louisiana. "By the governor's veto today he is saying that he is  tired of that tradition and that he is ready for a new one for the men and  women of Louisiana."  </P> <P> But Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action  League, noted that with the recent retirement of liberal Supreme Court justice  William J. Brennan Jr., "the right to choose is really hanging by a very  fragile thread. We won this particular skirmish, but it's a very long war."  </P> <P> Since the Supreme Court indicated last year that it is willing to allow states  more leeway in restricting abortion, 350 bills proposing new abortion limits  have been introduced in 41 state legislatures, she said.  </P> <P> At a press conference, Roemer said his office had been deluged with thousands  of letters and telephone calls, and that "neither extreme served their case  well."  </P> <P> Despite protests to the contrary by anti-abortion legislators, Roemer said he  was asking no more than he did five months ago when he outlined what kind of a  bill he would sign.  </P> <P> He said, among other things, that a seven-day period for reporting a rape was  unreasonable and that the bill did not take "simple rape" into account at all,  defined as situations where a woman is incapable of resisting, such as when she  is drunk or drugged or mentally incapacitated.  </P> <P> "Forcing a rape victim to report to law enforcement officials and seek medical  treatment, all within seven days of a crime, is an onerous burden," he said.  "Under this bill, sheer trauma or ignorance would force a woman to bear and  give birth to a child conceived in brutality."  </P> <P> Roemer also said the vetoed bill was too vague and did not answer such  questions as who, besides the doctor, might be held liable if an abortion is  performed. The liability could be interpreted to include relatives who, for  instance, paid for the operation, he said.  </P> <P> Roemer said that he came to his decision after paying more attention to what  women were telling him.  </P> <P> "They deserve to be listened to," said Roemer. "This (Legislature) did not  listen at all." Only three of the 144 state legislators are women.  </P> <P> Even if the anti-abortion bill had passed into law, both sides agree that it  could have taken years to reach the Supreme Court.  </P> <P> In previous cases, the court has upheld relatively modest restrictions on  abortion, but it has stopped short of overturning Roe vs. Wade.  </P> <P> Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has urged restraint until the court has been  presented with a case where "the constitutional validity of a state's abortion  statute actually turns on the constitutional validity" of Roe vs. Wade.  </P> <P> Abortion opponents conceded that, with Roemer's veto Friday, no such case  appears on the horizon unless there is an override by the Legislature later in  the summer.  </P> <P> Kennedy reported from Baton Rouge and Tumulty from New York. Free-lance writer  Garry Boulard also contributed to this story from Baton Rouge.  </P></p>

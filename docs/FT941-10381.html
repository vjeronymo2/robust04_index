			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Simon sells Unichem Intl in drive to reduce debt Simon Engineering, the maker of access equipment including fire rescue gear, yesterday agreed to sell Unichem International to the Western Company of North America for Dollars 19.8m (Pounds 13.2m) cash. The sale is part of the group's plan to raise Pounds 40m through disposals as part of a drive to cut debt. Since Mr Maurice Dixson became chief executive in a boardroom shake-out last September group debt has been cut from Pounds 148m to below Pounds 120m. In December, Simon sold its 50 per cent share in TR Oil Services for Pounds 6.2m. This disposal, coupled with the sale of Unichem International, substantially ends Simon's involvement in chemical services. Unichem International, based in Houston, had sales of Pounds 20.4m and trading profits of Pounds 1.3m in 1992, the latest year for which audited accounts are available. Net assets were Pounds 1.6m.</p>

After Jason Cohen singled McGuire to third, Serna was relieved by Najar, who  gave up a game-tying single to Bobby Kim.  </P> <P> Del Marine followed with an run-scoring double, driving in Cohen. After De La  Cruz relieved Najar, Jeff Marks drove in Kim from third with a squeeze bunt.  </P> <P> Right-hander Patrick Treend (3-3) pitched his third consecutive complete game  for the Conquistadores.

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (17): A severe message from Hermes - Moves to reduce the German insurance agency's deficit will mean difficulties for smaller companies - Export credit agencies / The user's view WHILE state export guarantees remain one of the most important tools for German exporters, new restrictions on credit the former Soviet Union have curbed access in the past 18 months, and moves to reduce the deficit of the Hermes insurance agency, which allocates the state guarantees, will increase coverage prices. Small and medium-size companies, which form the backbone of Germany's export-driven industry, stand to lose most from these developments. Reifenhauser, a family-owned company with 1,000 employees, exports more than 60 per cent of its engineering products and has paid for Hermes export guarantees for several decades. The company is now feeling the pressure of the changes in policy. 'We are now experiencing new difficulties but these are also based on political realities abroad and on the necessity for Hermes to assess risk realistically,' says Stefan Fabricius, a director at Reifenhauser. Reifenhauser belongs to the thousands of west German companies regularly using Hermes guarantees for their exports. In 1992, Hermes coverage was increased by 3.7 per cent to cover exports worth DM39.2bn, bringing total coverage to DM160.9bn for the year or 24 per cent of total German exports. This increase largely reflects new guarantees given in 1991 to the former Soviet Union. Since the break-up of the communist block, the volume of guarantees allocated to exports to eastern Europe and the Middle East has steadily increased at a cost to developing countries. But default on payment by companies in the former Soviet republics to German companies has forced the Hermes agency to review its policies. Government officials say the agency's total exposure to the ex-Soviet Union amounts to DM54bn. Russian companies alone account for DM48bn. These figures, however, include contracts on which payment has not met maturity date. Officials will not give figures for debt which has not been repaid in time. Indemnifications worth DM955m given by Hermes to German companies in 1992 are largely responsible for the widening deficit of the agency, which increased to DM2.3bn last year. As a result, the German government cut coverage to the former Soviet Union to DM4bn for 1992 and 1993. This limit has already been reached this year, prompting Hermes to issue halt the issuing of new guarantees except where this would otherwise lead to significant job losses in places such as east Germany. Moreover, coverage is now extended only to companies based in east Germany or manufacturing their end products in that part of the country. For Reifenhauser, which has a tradition of supplying the region, these policies have hampered business at a time when it is already fighting a domestic recession and the difficulties of maintaining its international competitiveness. Many west German companies have denounced the measures. Energy groups say the move will halt much needed exports for the modernisation of power plants and mines in the former Soviet republics. They argue that such investments would secure hard currency for their eastern partners in the long term and should qualify for state guarantees. The Mittelstand - medium-sized companies - have also been particularly angered by the new policies. Reifenhauser says the restrictions favour large companies which have been able to invest in production plants in eastern Germany. 'This is often not the case for a smaller company which can no longer now qualify for the guarantees,' says Mr Fabricius. Ways have been found round the problem through processes such as complex barter deals. Reifenhauser now sells its sheet extrusion equipment to a Russian enterprise manufacturing plastic bags and foils. These are then bought by another west German company and marketed in Germany. Part of the receipts from the sales are used to repay Reifenhauser. Similar barter arrangements have been struck by other Mittelstand in west Germany as solutions to the new limits. Manufacturers of mining equipment in the Rhur valley recently formed a consortium led by a German coal importer to supply Russian mining companies, for example. Restrictions have also been put on guarantees advanced for exports to Poland. Local clients now have to be registered with a leading Polish banks before Hermes guarantees can be extended. While this has not affected Reifenhauser's business in the country, the company points out that younger Polish enterprises are finding it hard and expensive to qualify and import foreign equipment. Similarly, in Iran clients are required to be accredited with the state bank before German exporters can apply for Hermes guarantees, a measure introduced at the end of 1992 after Iran's payment record deteriorated. Reifenhauser says, however, that Hermes guarantees have been useful in other areas, especially in India and China in recent years. In China, the company has paid export insurance to cover three to five years' financing deals. While Chinese clients previously paid in 30 days, they now have recourse to longer financing following foreign exchange limitations introduced by the Chinese government. But Reifenhauser expects Hermes guarantees to become more expensive soon and fears the additional financial burden for German exporters who are already suffering from high production costs. Plans to include the groupings of countries in risk categories - with higher premiums charged for those considered less safe - have been under discussion for some time. At present a fixed rate is charged by Hermes to cover up to 90 per cent of the value of an export contract, regardless of the destination. But the introduction of this system, scheduled to take place earlier this year, has been fiercely opposed by German industry which argues that higher premiums would hamper local exporters already suffering under recession.</p>

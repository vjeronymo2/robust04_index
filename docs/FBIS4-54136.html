			<p>BFN     [Text] Hiroshima, May 24 KYODO -- Government officials and  disarmament experts from some 20 countries, mainly in the  Asia-Pacific region, opened a four-day United Nations conference  on disarmament Tuesday [24 May].    But North Korea, branded as the major security risk in the  region because of its alleged nuclear weapons program, did not  send a delegation to the annual gathering for the second year in  a row.    China, Pyongyang's close ally, canceled its participation at  short notice, citing the date of the conference as inconvenient.    While the organizer, the U.N. Center on Disarmament Affairs,  was eager to stress that China's absence "has no political  meaning," the prevailing opinion at the conference is that the  cancellation is due to the controversy over the nuclear issue.    Welcoming the 62 participants, Yoneo Hirata, parliamentary  vice foreign minister, pledged that Japan will not aim at  becoming a military power.    "We reconfirm our basic policy not to turn into a military  power, but to develop an active policy of contributing to  disarmament," Hirata said.    He called on North Korea to dispel suspicion that it plans  to  build nuclear weapons by fully accepting international  inspections of its nuclear facilities.    Speaking at the first plenary session on "disarmament  through  regional dialogue," Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)  President Yohei Kono proposed that all nuclear powers discuss  nuclear disarmament at a special conference in Hiroshima next  year.    Kono urged the atomic powers to show their devotion to  nuclear disarmament by concluding a comprehensive ban on nuclear  tests by August next year, which marks the 50th anniversary of  both the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only  cities in the world to have sustained a nuclear attack, and the  establishment of the United Nations.    Discussions at the conference are expected to focus on the  promotion of security in the Asia-Pacific region and on the  extension of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which  comes up for renewal in 1995.    In the past, the 1968 international treaty, which aims at  curbing the spread of nuclear weapons and fissionable material  to nonnuclear countries, has been extended for five-year periods.    The nuclear powers, first of all the United States, have  proposed to extend the NPT indefinitely, an approach opposed by  many nonnuclear states on the grounds that such a move would  perpetuate the nuclear "club" of Britain, China, France, Russia  and the U.S.    After the end of the official part of the conference Friday,  the participants, including New Zealand's minister for  disarmament and arms control, Douglas Graham, and Russia's Ednan  Agayev, director of analysis forecasting at the Foreign  Ministry, are scheduled to meet with A-bomb survivors at a  public symposium.    Earlier in the day, the disarmament experts visited the  Peace  Memorial Museum and prayed at the memorial cenotaph for victims  of the atomic bombing in Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park.    Similar meetings have been held every year in Japan since  Kyoto hosted the first session in 1989. This year's conference  is the sixth of its kind.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Observer: Home truths Gender-exclusive it may be, as Observer has already pointed out, but the JO Hambro Businessman of the Year Award has managed, unlike some such prizes, to avoid looking foolish - largely by sticking to such indubitable pillars of the business world as Sir Christopher Hogg (1993) and Sir David Scholey (1990). To date, only 1984's titleholder, Gerald Ronson, who spent time in jail in connection with the Guinness affair, constitutes a bit of a blip. So this year's winner, Sir William Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, steps effortlessly into the eminent line-up - except for the little matter, to which he himself alluded yesterday, of his having only been back in the UK for 14 months after a 40-year absence. Appropriately enough, it fell to Lord Kingsdown, governor of the Bank of England when the latter made Purves's residence in London a condition of the Midland takeover, to make the award. How he must have enjoyed commending Purves for his 'personal courage, fortitude and modesty' - Purves, the proud Scot who, whatever he now thinks about his London sojourn, famously dislikes being told to do anything by anybody.</p>

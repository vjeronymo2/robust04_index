			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): 'One-stop shopping' trip under way Local business partnerships will be invited to bid for government funds to set up 'one-stop shops' - new advice centres planned to help businesses gain ready access to information. The government expects to put 15 of the shops on offer in the first stage of a programme intended to create a national network of 200. 'Towns can bid for finance. If we get the first ones right, there will be such pressure that private and public sectors will co-operate to extend the concept,' Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, told the annual conference of the Small Business Bureau, a Conservative party small business pressure group, last week. The government expects to complete its blueprint for the network within the next few weeks.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Devonport and Rosyth dockyards to be kept open: Rifkind postpones submarine decision THE government yesterday pledged that both the Rosyth and Devonport Royal Dockyards would be kept open, but postponed a decision on the vital question of which will win the contract to refit Britain's nuclear submarine fleet. Its indecision after months of speculation immediately provoked opposition taunts that ministers are in tactical retreat and paralysed by fears of a new public uproar over job losses. Coming after the furore over pit closures and the U-turn on infantry cuts, senior ministers are acutely aware that the ferocious battle over the submarine contract will have wide-ranging political ramifications. Rosyth in Fife is Scotland's largest single industrial employer while the future of Devonport, in Plymouth, is regarded as equally vital to the economic health of the south-west. A final verdict had been expected early in the new year despite continuous lobbying by MPs and commercial interest groups from both towns. Justifying the postponement in a parliamentary written answer, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, claimed that tenders submitted for the multi-million pound scheme 'may significantly understate the likely eventual cost of the work'. He added that the yards would now be asked to re-evaluate the likely costs and that the government would also study 'other related matters further' before coming to a final decision. Downing Street officials said later it was feared that both yards had underestimated the costs of building submarine servicing facilities in order to secure a contract that would save thousands of threatened jobs. No date was given for a final verdict. The decision angered Devonport, the favourite to win the contract, but was a relief to Rosyth. Opposition politicians were quick to seize on the retreat as fresh evidence of indecision and uncertainty at the highest levels of government. Mrs Margaret Ewing, speaker on defence for the Scottish National party, said the announcement did nothing to end the uncertainty and left workers 'dangling at the end of a string'. Both Devonport and Rosyth, which have been under separate private sector management since 1987, regard the submarine work as vital for their survival. Mr Rifkind confirmed that the scope and nature of nuclear refitting work meant it must be allocated to one dockyard. But he explained that the government's intention was to keep both royal dockyards functioning as necessary to promote competition in the refitting of the surface fleet. For the nuclear submarine contract, ministers had already decided against the initial bid from Rosyth, which was for a new yard costing Pounds 267m. Devonport put in a Pounds 162m bid to rebuild an existing facility, and Rosyth responded with a bid of Pounds 147m to restore old docks for four new Trident nuclear submarines. Devonport said it could do the equivalent work for Pounds 131m. The refitting contract would mean work for the next 30 years for the chosen docks, and support Devonport's workforce of 5,000 or Rosyth's of 4,000. Mr Mike Leece, managing director of DML, the consortium which runs Devonport, said the yard was 'seriously disappointed' by the delay. Babcock Thorn, which manages Rosyth, said the decision was 'as good as far as it goes', but the battle to win the Trident contract would continue. Army cuts row Page 8 Editorial Comment Page 17</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] By 10 votes to three, the Supreme Court today ruled  that the Amnesty Law is not applicable in the murder of former  Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier.    The Supreme Court justices thus rejected a request filed by  the attorneys of [General Manuel Contreras and Brigadier Pedro  Espinoza], the former chiefs of Dina [National Intelligence  Directorate], who claimed it was unconstitutional not to apply  the 1978 Amnesty Law to Orlando Letelier's murder in 1976.    The ruling stipulates that the attack perpetrated in  Washington will not be granted this benefit. Moreover, the  Supreme Court enumerates several other elements in which it  reiterates that in not applying the Amnesty Law to this lawsuit  it is by no means acting arbitrarily.    [Begin prosecuting lawyer Juan Bustos recording] The  fundamental thing within a rule of law is precisely to go after  and condemn those who commit crimes. The contrary would be  something exceptional, something which in general should not  occur within a rule of law. [end recording]    The defense attorneys for Contreras and Espinoza still have  another appeal pending. In addition, they appealed the judgment  by Judge Rodolfo Banados, who sentenced the former Dina chiefs  to seven and six years' imprisonment respectively.</p>

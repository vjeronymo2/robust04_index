			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman-AKHIR KHABAR--Instructed by PLO Chairman Yasir  'Arafat, PLO Executive Committee member Yasir 'Amr left for  Damascus for talks with Syrian officials following the increase  in tension between Damascus and the PLO.    Sources close to the PLO said 'Amr's mission is to try to  ease tension and stop the media campaigns Damascus is launching  against the PLO leadership as a result of the signing of the  Oslo and Cairo agreements, which Damascus views as deviation  from unified Arab position in the Arab-Israeli negotiations.    The sources said 'Amr will brief Damascus about what is  going  on in Cairo, and will discuss the cordon states meeting and the  possibility for the PLO to participate in it.    'Amr was a member of the Syrian Arab Socialist Ba'th Party  during the 1960's and 1970's, and he was a former member of the  party's Regional Command.    The visit is taking place at a time when the PLO leadership  is facing a real crisis as a result of Israeli procrastination  and blackmailing in Cairo talks.</p>

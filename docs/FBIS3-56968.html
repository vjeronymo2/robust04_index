Leading  Russian nuclear disarmament specialists expressed real fears  about the condition of the Ukrainian nuclear arsenal. The  stockpiles are overloaded, the personnel are poorly trained, and  proper servicing is not carried out. Given this situation,  Russian plants are prepared to dismantle all Ukrainian warheads  within two years. The ball is now in the Ukrainian leadership's  court.

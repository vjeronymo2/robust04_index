			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SANDS OF SAN LUIS REY: MINERS LEAVE FEW TRACKS FOR RIVER'S PROTECTORS  </P> <P> The benign appearance of the riverbed belies the controversy that surrounds it:  a river that is more often dry than wet, running more than 30 miles from the  base of Palomar Mountain to the Pacific at Oceanside.  </P> <P> At its easternmost reaches, kids in swimming trunks, wearing old tennis shoes  to protect their feet from the rocks, take innertube rides for short spurts of  excitement. It runs along Indian reservations, posh golf resorts, thoroughbred  horse ranches, unending fields of tomatoes and strawberries and an old  California mission. At the west, it winds beside a junkyard before dissolving  unspectacularly into the ocean.  </P> <P> To the passer-by, the river is perhaps most noteworthy for its banks of willows  and cottonwoods. The more discerning wildlife expert values it as the seasonal  nesting home to the least Bell's vireo, a small, gray songbird listed on state  and national endangered species lists.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coveted Natural Resource  </P> <P> For these reasons, the river's rural neighbors prize it as a natural resource  best left untouched by man.  </P> <P> But it's not. The sandy bottom of the San Luis Rey River is being bulldozed,  scooped, sifted and trucked by the hundreds of loads weekly to asphalt and  concrete companies throughout San Diego County, feeding growth's insatiable  appetite for raw building materials.  </P> <P> Here, along the river, is 70% of the county's reserve of construction-quality  sand available for commercial use. Today's riverbed may be, literally,  tomorrow's new home foundation, swimming pool, stucco wall, tile roof and  asphalt pothole patch.  </P> <P> And therein lies the dilemma facing those who live near, or want to preserve,  or want to use, the San Luis Rey River: how best to raid its rich sand deposits  without disturbing its neighbors -- whether they be endangered songbirds or  residents who sought out the rural ambience of a quiet life in the back  country, punctuated instead now by the roar of a parade of sand and gravel  trucks.  </P> <P> It is an issue that is pitting residents like Dominic Savoca against sandmen  like Roger Gordon and professional bureaucrats like Ruth Potter and wildlife  experts like Larry Salata.  </P> <P> "In the time I've lived here -- 12 years -- they've gone from one or two mining  operations to absolutely wild," says Savoca, an insurance salesman who thought  his move to Bonsall from the Los Angeles area would spare him, among other  things, commercial truck traffic and reward him with, among other things, a  slice of nature.  </P> <P> So upset is Savoca that, at his urging, a citizens' activist group, Bonsall  Area for a Rural Community, has agreed to finance a professionally produced  videotape of the river, shot both from the ground and from a helicopter, "to  raise public awareness of what is happening to the San Luis Rey river basin."  </P> <P> The video, expected to cost about $1,000, will be distributed to local  libraries and a host of federal, state and county government agencies. Savoca  wants to show them both the untouched, pristine banks of the river and active  sand-mining operations. He says he is not only convinced that the public  doesn't realize what's happening to the river, but that some government people  who are supposed to be safeguarding the river don't fully comprehend the scope  of the sand mining.  </P> <P> There may be some support for his cynicism. No single government agency is  charged with overseeing sand mining in the river, and the county of San Diego,  which has the primary responsibility, is woefully undermanned to give the river  the attention it deserves, county officials say.  </P> <P> No one is even sure how much sand is being taken out of the riverbed.  </P> <P> "I understand that the county is growing and it needs building material. That's  fine," says Savoca. "But why can't the government and the businesses organize  themselves and spread out the mining -- take some from this river, some from  another? Why do they have to screw up an entire river?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Success Its Own Undoing?  </P> <P> In a sense, the river's own success story as a sand supply may be its own  undoing. Government surveys of available construction-grade sand have  identified the San Luis Rey River as the most extensive cache of available sand  in the county, measured in the billions of tons as the material is washed down  into the valley from the abutting range of hills and mountains, including  Palomar.  </P> <P> Sand is one of California's natural resources, and state policy allows it to be  mined. Local governments -- in this case, the county of San Diego and the city  of Oceanside -- are not allowed to prohibit sand mining and can only put  restrictions on the operations when they issue permits.  </P> <P> The legitimate sand miner has to jump through a series of bureaucratic hoops  before he can turn his first shovel of sand. Among the agencies that either  require permits or, at the least, monitor sand-mining operations are:  </P> <P> * The local land-use agency, whether it be a city or a county, which sets the  conditions and restrictions for sand mining -- including how much sand can be  taken out, from where and the amount of truck traffic to be allowed.  </P> <P> * The regional Water Quality Control Board, which raises an eyebrow whenever  someone tinkers with stream beds or appears to be a potential polluter of the  water, especially when mining goes below the river's water table.  </P> <P> * The county Air Pollution Control District, which is concerned about the  amount of sand dust being kicked up.  </P> <P> * The San Diego Assn. of Governments, which has no direct land-use control over  the river but which, on behalf of local governments, suggests policy to balance  the need of commercial sand miners against environmental concerns of the river.  </P> <P> * The state Department of Fish and Game, which worries about the destruction of  riparian habitat. Of special concern is the least Bell's vireo, which nests in  the very willows and trees that bulldozers might knock over in their quest for  sand.  </P> <P> * The California Department of Transportation, which is concerned that, if too  much sand is taken out of the river, highway bridge supports and abutments  might become eroded and weakened.  </P> <P> * The California Division of Mines and Geology, which, among other things,  wants to make sure that, when a mining operation is completed, a reclamation  plan is implemented to return the site to its original state.  </P> <P> * The U.S. Soil Conservation Service, which is concerned whenever a river is  tampered with because of the effect -- positive or negative -- it might have on  soil erosion and flooding.  </P> <P> * The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which doesn't care if sand is taken out of  the river but wants to know if any sand is piled up in the riverbed during  processing, because that is technically a discharge back into the river and  comes under the governance of the federal Clean Water Act.  </P> <P> * The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which, on behalf of the Army Corps of  Engineers, monitors whether riparian habitat is affected during any sand  piling.  </P> <P> * The Environmental Protection Agency, which concerns itself with a myriad of  environmental laws and guidelines and is the ultimate federal authority when  sand miners and the environment are at loggerheads.  </P> <P> Just getting the initial go-ahead from the county requires an extensive  environmental review, said Roger Gordon, who has gone through the process so he  could extract sand from the river where it winds through Bonsall, not far from  Savoca's home.  </P> <P> "We had to do biological, archeological, traffic, historical, hydraulic,  hydrologic and soil studies," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Little Time for Monitoring  </P> <P> Although nearly a dozen public agencies might have reason to look over sand  miners' shoulders, government officials concede that they have little time,  energy or money to do so.  </P> <P> About 10 companies now take sand from the river, but the total amount of sand  being taken out is unknown.  </P> <P> "There are all these agencies involved, and still we can't seem to get a handle  on sand mining," bemoaned Ruth Potter, senior regional planner for Sandag, the  San Diego Assn. of Governments. "It's hard to even find out who's doing the  sand mining, because the permits go with the property (owner), not the  operator, and operators have come and gone," she said. (Property owners lease  out or assign mining rights to contractors.) "I've checked with the county, but  we just can't get a good fix on everyone who's out there. Sometimes we simply  spot a sand truck leaving an area. Some companies seem to dig wherever and  whenever they please.  </P> <P> "The San Luis Rey is a strange area. A lot of them up there don't like  regulations, and they go out and do what they feel they can get away with and  later worry about how to deal with whatever problem there may be," Potter said.  </P> <P> "We don't even know how much sand is coming out of the river because no one  will tell you. They don't want their competition to know," she said.  </P> <P> Usually, the county will limit the number of truckloads of sand any given  operator is allowed to haul off the site any given day. Roger Gordon, for  instance, says he is limited to 35 truckloads daily.  </P> <P> But Sue Gray, the county's chief enforcement officer for building and zoning  violations, says it is "difficult for us to know" if the companies are  complying.  </P> <P> "We don't have the staff to count the number of trucks coming out of any given  site," she said. "We'll maybe spend an hour or two periodically (watching), and  figure out a daily average. If we get complaints, we'll spend more time on it.  And some pits have to maintain records of how many trucks leave."  </P> <P> But, Gray added, "We don't have the manpower to monitor these operations on a  weekly basis."  </P> <P> The county has a mixed record for enforcement, having shut down some operations  temporarily while they got proper permits, after the fact, and shutting down  other operations altogether after they failed to come in compliance. How much  sand was taken out of the river illegally is not known.  </P> <P> Other operators say a few bad apples have tarnished the industry's reputation,  and say they, by and large, are following the rules.  </P> <P> Roger Gordon readily acknowledges, for instance, that on some days he runs more  than the 35 truckloads of sand he is allowed by his permit. But, on other days,  he says, he sends fewer trucks out of the river bottom and, on balance, he says  he is running his business within the permit guidelines.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Projection of Need  </P> <P> Bill Healy, deputy director for community planning at the county's Department  of Planning and Land Use, said officials have asked the sand-mining industry to  fund a $50,000 study to project sand extraction rates for the future, based on  the expected needed for sand from the river. But so far the industry has not  forwarded the money for the study.  </P> <P> "We want to do an inventory of the mineral deposits throughout the whole county  and develop policies to reconcile the environmental sensitivities of the river  with the need to mine the sand deposits in the river," he said. "There's no  plan in existence that I know of that looks at the total amount of sand that  can be extracted in any given year," Healy said. "But the supply won't dry up.  The problem is finding where the deposits are located and determining the  environmental impacts in removing those deposits."  </P> <P> That's a concern of people like Larry Salata, a biologist with the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service and an expert on riparian habitats -- like that of the San  Luis Rey River, which he knows intimately.  </P> <P> Indeed, Salata has traveled the river and found sand-mining operations that he  suspects may not be permitted and has passed the information on to the Corps of  Engineers.  </P> <P> "There are at least two major sand-mining operations that are currently  operating without the benefit of a Corps permit," he contends. "Maybe through  ignorance, or for some other reason, they fail to coordinate with all the  appropriate agencies."  </P> <P> Corps of Engineers officials confirm receipt of Palata's complaint, but haven't  had time to investigate the matter fully, they said.  </P> <P> John Winn is the only Corps ecologist assigned to San Diego. He arrived about a  month ago from Mobile, Ala., where he is permanently assigned, and expects to  return there in another month or two. He's in San Diego only temporarily,  filling a job that had gone unstaffed for several months before his arrival.  </P> <P> Most of his time, Winn said, is spent inspecting housing developments to  determine the effect -- including water and silt runoff -- they will have on  streams, rivers and lagoons.  </P> <P> "I've spent a couple of hours driving along the river, and I talked to one  fellow who insisted he had the proper permits," Winn said. "But I haven't had  the time yet to check him out in our files. I hope to do that (this) week.  </P> <P> "The rarest habitat you have is stream-side vegetation in a desert environment,  like this one," said Winn.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Can Be Beneficial  </P> <P> Officials point out that, if done properly, sand mining has its benefits.  </P> <P> "If done properly, it can open up a flood way and prevent flooding over the  river banks," noted Vic Smothers, who is with the Fallbrook office of the U.S.  Soil Conservation Service.  </P> <P> The pits that are dug in the excavation process can fill with water and  themselves become stop-off resting areas for migratory birds, he added.  </P> <P> Those same pits will fill with more sand that is washed downstream in the rainy  season, giving the operator more material to be scooped up and delivered to his  customers.  </P> <P> But, if too many excavation pits are grouped too close together, water can rush  downstream after having dropped off its sand load, and the dynamics of that  so-called "hungry water" can scour the stream bed -- and eat away at the  footings of bridges and abutments.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's a plan on where these pits are located," Smothers said.  "The basic premise seems to be, 'We need the sand; we have an industry that  demands it, and it's necessary in the economy of urban development.' But I'm  not sure there's a reasonable approach to it along the river. Sand should only  be mined at its replenishment rate -- and we don't know what that rate is."  </P> <P> Salata's concern is possible damage to the habitat.  </P> <P> "The problem these (sand-mining) operations create is the destruction of  wetland vegetation that, in some cases, is occupied by federal endangered  species," he said. "The least Bell's vireo, for instance, occupies a habitat of  several components, including willows that take 5 to 10 years to develop. When  you remove that from a riverbed, obviously there's a long-term lag associated  with replacing it, even if you replant tomorrow."  </P> <P> Furthermore, he noted, altering a stream bed can change the water flow  downstream, affecting habitats well out of view of the mining itself.  </P> <P> "We've never assessed the cumulative affects of sand mining in a particular  drainage, like the San Luis Rey River," Palata said. "Potentially, sand mining  is not an incompatible activity, assuming the technology exists to recreate the  resource values that are impacted so there is no net loss. But, at this point  in time, that ability has yet to be demonstrated.  </P> <P> "The challenge is to ensure there's no loss of valuable wetlands, yet making  those resources available for public use," he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TITLE MAKER  </P> <P> I must clarify a point concerning Lawrence Christon's Jan. 17 review of the  Jerry Seinfeld performance at the Bren Events Center, UC Irvine. Seinfeld did  not bill himself as "America's most imitated comedian" or "the King of  Observational Comedy." I created those titles as a promotional tool.  </P> <P> I apologize to Mr. Seinfeld.  </P> <P> LANCE MACLEAN  </P> <P> Programs Director  </P> <P> Associated Students  </P> <P> UC Irvine  </P></p>

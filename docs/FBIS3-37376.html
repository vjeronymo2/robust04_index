The Party's chairman Vyacheslav Grechnev told the congress  delegates that the Party is being forced to protect the  interests of the Russian middle class: representatives of the  creative intellectuals, of small and medium businessmen, of  youth, war and labor veterans, that is of the majority of  Russia's population.    The party is needed, said Grechnev, because the country  faces  the threat of annihilating a vital stratum of society. Russia  is threatened by the prospect of becoming a country of the  proletariat.    Speakers said that the party was conservative and against  radicalism of any form.    The Party sees as its allies any political forces in the  country are oriented around the priority of the state being the  guarantor of freedom, the rights and dignity of its citizens.    Grechnev said that during the next parliamentary elections  the Party expects not simply to win seats in parliament, but to  form a majority in it.    The Party of the Majority has its representatives in 50  Russian regions, said its leader.    Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov sent a message of greetings to  the  delegates.    Observers believe that the Party considers the possibility  of  nominating Luzhkov for presidency during the 1996 elections.</p>

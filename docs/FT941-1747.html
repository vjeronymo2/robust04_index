			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / World Trade News: New bridge to Singapore The governments of Malaysia and Singapore have signed an agreement to build a MDollars 2.3bn (Pounds 568m) second bridge linking the two countries, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur. The work on the Malaysian section - about two-thirds of the total 2km length of the structure - will be carried out by United Engineers, a company closely connected to the dominant United Malays National Organisation political party. About 50,000 vehicles use the existing bridge and severe congestion problems have developed.</p>

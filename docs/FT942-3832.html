			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Grip of steel The European Commission will try to breathe life into its moribund steel plan this week. Wednesday's meeting will focus on whether Italian state subsidies can be provided to close 6m tonnes of capacity in the Brescia. The original scheme, promoted by Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, was shot down on the grounds that such aid was legally dubious. His fellow industry commissioner, Mr Martin Bangemann, is attempting to revive the Brescia scheme so that the overall plan of cutting 19m tonnes of capacity can be salvaged. What happens in Brescia is of little relevance to British Steel, which does not produce steel rods, the speciality of the Bresciani companies. Brescia cuts are more relevant to direct rivals such as ASW. But even it would have derived few benefits from the original Brescia scheme. Though some capacity would have been cut, the Bresciani producers would have been able to continue producing at similar rates and would have been financially stronger as a result of the subsidies. More important for British Steel is whether the European steel industry has seen its last round of state aid. The Commission would do better to ensure this is genuinely the last round rather than seeking further capacity cuts. Not only does it look odd to be demanding plant closures at a time when the European economy is picking up. A firm line on subsidies would provide the best guarantee that overcapacity does not become a problem in the next recession. Steel makers would then know they could not rely on their governments to bail them out.</p>

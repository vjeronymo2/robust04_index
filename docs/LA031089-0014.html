			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC 10 BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> COUGARS BEAT DUCKS, 78-56, MUST FACE ARIZONA TODAY  </P> <P> Washington State dispatched Oregon, 78-56, Thursday night in the opening round  of the Pacific 10 basketball tournament at the Forum to earn the right to play  No. 1-ranked Arizona.  </P> <P> The Cougars may feel like sacrificial lambs for the Wildcats in today's  quarterfinal game at3 p.m.  </P> <P> "I thought we played great," WSU Coach Kelvin Sampson said. "I think Washington  State is playing its best basketball. Tomorrow (today) is March 10, and in the  minds of 99.9% of the people in this country, our season will end on March 10.  That doesn't matter to us.  </P> <P> "This team is playing as well as it can play. As far as Arizona is concerned,  maybe that's not good enough."  </P> <P> But it was good enough to beat Oregon.  </P> <P> Forward Brian Quinnett scored 18 points, all in the first half, as the Cougars  cruised past the Ducks. Quinnett left the game after picking up his fourth foul  with 13:15 remaining in the second half and sat on the bench for almost 10  minutes before returning.  </P> <P> By the time Quinnett came back with 3:38 left, the Cougars had the game safely  in hand.  </P> <P> Forward Brian Wright and guard Harold Wright added 14 points each for WSU.  </P> <P> Washington State is 10-18 overall. Oregon, which lost its last nine games,  finished the season with an 8-21 record.  </P> <P> "I think the mental toughness has kind of gone out of us," Oregon Coach Don  Monson said. "We just don't seem to get over the hump."  </P> <P> Forward Randy Grant led the Ducks with 23 points.  </P></p>

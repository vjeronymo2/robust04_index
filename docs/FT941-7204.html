			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sharp advance at WestLB Westdeutsche Landesbank, the largest of Germany's public sector banks, yesterday reported a 45 per cent increase in operating profit for 1993, to DM803m (Dollars 456.2m). Net profit was up 53 per cent to DM334m compared with DM218.6m in 1992, according to figures released by the bank in Dusseldorf. The main factors behind the sharp improvement were a 24 per cent increase in net interest income, up from DM2.47bn to DM3.08bn, and a 56.5 per cent increase in profits from trading, which increased to DM301m. With total assets of DM320bn - up from DM274.2bn in 1992 - WestLB, house bank to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, is Germany's third largest bank, and the only public sector institution able to compete directly with the big private-sector rivals. The state government's shareholding amounts to 43 per cent, with savings banks controlling 33 per cent, and local authorities the rest. WestLB said its risk provision was increased by 63 per cent, from DM596m to DM972m, reflecting not only a provision for the bank's lending operations, but also its assessment of the risks involved in its investment and equity portfolio.</p>

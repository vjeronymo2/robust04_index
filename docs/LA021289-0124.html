			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HUNGARIAN REFORMER'S VIEW ON 1956 REVOLT APPARENTLY REJECTED  </P> <P> A Communist Party spokesman indicated Saturday that party leaders have rejected  a Politburo reformer's reassessment of the 1956 revolt as a popular uprising.  </P> <P> Spokesman Emil Kimmel told Hungarian Radio that speakers at a crucial Friday  session of the 108-member Central Committee said there should be no  "single-word summary formulations" to reassess the past.  </P> <P> Politburo member Imre Pozsgay startled the nation Jan. 28 by saying the 1956  rebellion against Soviet control was "a popular uprising." Officially, it was  called a counterrevolution.  </P> <P> The meeting resumed Saturday with the media reporting few specifics.  </P> <P> Pozsgay said his assessment was based on findings of a Hungarian Communist  Party commission investigating four decades of Communist rule in Hungary.  </P> <P> Prominent Central Committee member Gyula Horn, also state secretary at the  Foreign Ministry, hinted late Friday that Pozsgay's stance was not accepted by  most members.  </P> <P> Varying only slightly from the official stance, Horn said on television that  the meeting's "very careful assessment" showed the revolt "started as an  uprising, some may call it a 'popular uprising,' but later on it turned into  something which could be termed a counterrevolution."  </P> <P> State media displayed none of their new openness in reporting on Friday's  closed-door session. It was not known what was said by Pozsgay and other senior  officials.  </P> <P> According to Kimmel, the speakers supported the basic idea expounded in a  report submitted by Communist Party chief Karoly Grosz, which says "one can  establish order without a reform, but the reform may not be instituted without  order."  </P> <P> He also said Grosz called for an action program for the future. Grosz's speech  has not been published and no other details were disclosed.  </P> <P> Communist Party spokesman indicated Saturday that party leaders have rejected a  Politburo reformer's reassessment of the 1956 revolt as a popular uprising.  </P></p>

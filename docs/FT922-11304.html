			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / The Afghan Crisis: At the palace the president gives way to a semblance of order A LOOK inside the simple, elegant, book-lined bedroom of the deposed Afghan President Najibullah suggests all must have been calm until the day he tried to flee Kabul aboard a waiting UN aeroplane, then was turned back by his erstwhile militia allies at the capital's airport, reports Steve Levine in Kabul. The presidential quarters gave no sign of a hurried exit. This weekend, though, there was little calm on the green lawns and among the fountains of the presidential palace grounds. At 3:47 pm on Saturday, men loyal to the mujahideen commander Mr Ahmed Shah Masood sneaked through the adjacent Afghanistan National Bank and into the grounds. Mr Najibullah had gone into hiding in Kabul the day before. Now the rebels, in battle for control of the capital, were rifling the presidential guards' stores for weapons and ammunition. They took up position on the palace roofs and placed tanks in the drive. One guerrilla fixed his tank in a tight circle, playfully spinning the vehicle round and round in the dirt. At the back perimeter wall yesterday morning, militia allies of Mr Masood fought a machine-gun and mortar skirmish against fighters controlled by mujahideen rival Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and positioned at the foreign ministry. The militia unit, under the command of an ethnic Hazara named Abdul Chirik, was protecting a communications centre - an aluminium pole sticking up from the top of a tank, reinforced by electrical wiring fixed to the wall. At one of the palace's five gates, another rebel commander, allied with Mr Masood and calling himself Moel, stood near a smoking brick building. 'We want peace, but they want war. We had to run them out,' he said of Mr Hekmatyar's fighters. However, in the palace grounds yesterday, Mr Masood's men were maintaining relative order. In a building next to Mr Najibullah's quarters, Hazara militiament strolled about, collecting booty in sacks. Ethnic Tadjiks at the front door checked the sacks and forced their looter allies to leave most of the booty. 'You are not a Moslem,' one Tajik admonished a Hazara carrying a sack, sending a tin teapot he had been trying to steal bouncing across the floor.</p>

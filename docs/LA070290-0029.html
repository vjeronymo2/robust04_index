			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MANDELA WATCH  </P> <P> The Heart of Rock 'n' Roll: Grammy winner Bonnie Raitt, who performed at the  freedom rally honoring Nelson Mandela in Oakland Saturday, said Mandela told  her that he credits the Wembley rock concert tribute to him two years ago with  focusing attention worldwide on the anti-apartheid struggle. She said Mandela  was especially pleased by the number of young people who were politicized about  the issue, thanks to the concert. Raitt, who talked with Mandela at the African  National Congress fund-raiser Friday night, said that's why Mandela made a  special point of thanking musicians at this year's Wembley concert.

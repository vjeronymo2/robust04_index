			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Japanese job market weakens Japan's unemployment rate remained at 2.8 per cent last month, but the labour market weakened significantly as companies tightened up on costs. There were only 64 jobs on offer for every 100 applicants in April, down from 66 in the previous two months and the lowest ratio for just over seven years. Companies are freezing the intake of new recruits and cutting back on part-time workers, in an effort to avoid heavy redundancies. Despite the signs of economic recovery, sectors like cars, electronics and banking still have surplus staff and capacity. The labour market is likely to continue to flag. The lifeless job market is a feature in the prolonged weakness of consumer spending, shown by a 4 per cent annual decline in sales at leading department stores and supermarkets last month, the 24th consecutive monthly drop. However, signs of an upturn in consumer sentiment are present in a boom in discount sales and imported consumer goods.</p>

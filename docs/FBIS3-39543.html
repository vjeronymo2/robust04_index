			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Helmut Kohl by Martin S. Lambeck; </F> place and date not given: "A Disgrace for Social Democracy"]    [Text] [Lambeck] Mr. Chancellor, next week the IG-Metall  trade union will decide in a strike ballot on whether or not to  go on strike. Do you still see a chance of preventing a strike  at this unfortunate time?    [Kohl] I will not interfere in the wage negotiations. I am  a convinced supporter of autonomy in collective bargaining.  However, I think of the 4 million unemployed and of the urgent  need to ensure with all our strength a climate that is  beneficial for investment so that further job losses can be  stopped. Therefore, I would welcome it very much if every  opportunity were used, right up to the last minute, to reach  agreement. I refer to the example of the agreement in the  chemical industry. That was a sensible agreement.    [Lambeck] What should a sensible agreement in the public  sector be like?    [Kohl] In the public sector I am in a different situation  than regarding the aforementioned wage negotiations. As  chancellor I represent one third of the partners in the wage  negotiations, in this case the employers. I do not want to give  you any figures here now. However, the following principles  apply:    1. Everyone, including the trade unions, know the situation  with regard to public budgets.    2. We all know -- perhaps now more than in the past -- how  important a secure job is. A job in the public sector is a  secure job. This is an important asset; and, I think, this must  also be taken into consideration. I myself have already pointed  out that the budget situation does not permit any increases in  the public sector. We should think of the social situation of  the affected individuals. I would imagine that we would offer a  different settlement for the lower wage groups than for those  who get higher salaries.    [Lambeck] The latest mediation procedure involving the  nursing-care insurance once again threatens to fail. Do you see  any chance of a compromise at the last moment?    [Kohl] I am in favor of trying up to the last moment to get  nursing-care insurance through parliament and to reach a  positive agreement. In a few years we will have more than 3  million people over 80. This demographic development shows that  the number of senior citizens is increasing considerably. The  decision is overdue. I myself do not understand the entire  controversy at all. And I believe that millions of our  fellow-citizens do not understand it, either.    What is the problem? Everyone agrees that nursing-care  insurance is necessary, the only differences of opinion are  about compensation. In Germany an employee has an average  annual leave of 30 working days. In addition, there are 12 to  14 public holidays. Added up, this is eight weeks of annual  leave and free time. The point is whether we are ready to give  up two holidays in such a way that the holidays remain but are  not paid. In a country that has the longest vacations in the  world I find it absurd that we are still quarreling.    [Lambeck] There have been discussions about the contacts of  the Social Democratic Party [SPD] and the Bonn coalition with  the former GDR [German Democratic Republic] leadership. The SPD  now speaks of mudslinging. Is the past here being turned into  an election issue.    [Kohl] The SPD always speaks of mudslinging as soon as  things get unpleasant for them. What is the real issue? The  real issue is not the Stasi files. The facts are being  distorted deliberately. First, the point is that after the  construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 all laender together  established the recording office in Salzgitter. The purpose of  this documentation office was to record the barbaric human  rights violations committed against German citizens in the GDR.  This small office had a great psychological effect in the  former GDR. I know from former prisoners, who were in Bautzen  or in other prisons in the former GDR, that many people  cherished the hope that the evil deeds of the henchmen there  would not go unpunished in the long run. After all, it was no  coincidence that in his Gera Demands Honecker demanded that this  office be abolished. He made this demand at every occasion,  also when he talked to me. I think it is a disgrace that the  SPD-governed laender canceled their subsidies to the  documentation center. They did it just to do Mr. Honecker a  favor. This has nothing to do with Stasi files or with  mudslinging. It is a disgrace for the great, traditional German  social democracy, which has otherwise advocated human rights.  Advocating human rights in Guatemala is one thing, but  advocating human rights for fellow German citizens in the GDR is  something quite different. And when Mr. Rau now calls himself  the presidential candidate of all Germans, he must explain to  the 17 million Germans in the former GDR why he stopped  financing this documentation office in 1988 when he was minister  president of North Rhine-Westphalia.    The other big demand of the SED [Socialist Unity party of  Germany] leadership under Honecker referred to the recognition  of an independent GDR citizenship. Once again one does not need  the Stasi files to prove that the majority of the SPD leadership  wanted to meet this demand had they won the Bundestag elections  in 1987. This would have had disastrous consequences for the  refugees from the GDR in Hungary and in Prague in 1989. I do  not intend to permit the SPD to tell me what to say.    [Lambeck] Let us turn from the problems in Germany to the  situation in the Balkans: The NATO ultimatum to the Serbs has  made the situation around Sarajevo relatively calm. Now the  bloody war is raging in other Bosnian regions instead. Does the  credibility of the United Nations and NATO continue to suffer  because of that?    [Kohl] All those who talk about credibility have not found a  panacea, either. I am very, very happy that the common NATO  decision exists. I am also very happy that President Clinton  has now accepted a certain leadership role for the United  States. I myself have emphatically advised him to do so.    I also think that we have to make every effort to integrate  Russia and Boris Yeltsin in this decision. I myself have  discussed the matter with Yeltsin several times. Now there is  once again an opportunity to put an end to this horrendous war  in the Balkans and, above all, to the terrible suffering of the  people.    [Lambeck] Will the Bundeswehr provide logistical support in  the event of NATO air strikes in Bosnia, if the allies ask you?    [Kohl] For well-known reasons, the Bundeswehr itself cannot  provide any troops for operations in the former Yugoslavia. If  it is necessary to provide logistical support outside the  territory of the former Yugoslavia and if we are asked to do so,  I am strongly in favor of it.    [Lambeck] Russia has serious reservations about NATO air  strikes on Serbian positions. Now it is known that you, Mr.  Chancellor, have a particularly close and good relationship with  Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Are you mediating between the  United States and Russia regarding the issue of Bosnia?    [Kohl] We Germans cannot presume to have a mediating role in  this connection. I have excellent personal and friendly  relations with both Yeltsin and Clinton. I try to be helpful  within the framework of my capabilities.</p>

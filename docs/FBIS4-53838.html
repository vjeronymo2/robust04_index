			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- The Guyanese Committee  for Repatriation of War Prisoners Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, was  inaugurated in Guyana on May 14.    Chairman of the Guyana Committee for Support of Korea's  Reunification Walter Bipat was elected chairman of the committee  at the inaugural meeting.    The chairman in his speech said the committee would actively  join in the worldwide movement for the repatriation of Kim and  Ham to the northern half of Korea.    A statement adopted at the meeting said the refusal of the  South Korean authorities to repatriate them is a harsh criminal  act contrary to humanitarianism and the international law.    Noting that the old men Kim and Ham earnestly want to be  repatriated to the northern half of Korea and their families,  too, aspire after their return to the bosom of the Republic, the  statement demanded the South Korean authorities to immediately  send them back to the northern half of Korea.    Chairman of the Peru-Korea Institute of Culture and  Friendship Angel Castro Lavarello sent a letter of protest to  the traitor Kim Yong-sam in demand of the repatriation of the  old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan.    He in the letter expressed solidarity for the just demand of  the Korean people and the progressive people of the world to  send them back to the northern half of Korea so that they may  meet with their families.</p>

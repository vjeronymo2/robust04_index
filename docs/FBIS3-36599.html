During the meeting Aliyev said that development of  political,  and economic relations with Russia is of a strategic importance  for Azerbaijan. He also said that Baku will do anything to  maintain the many sided relations with its northern neighbour.    Touching upon the Russia's mediation role in the regulation  of the Armenian-Azeri conflict, Geydar Aliyev said, that  "Armenian party forwards the unacceptable conditions, and what a  shame that Special Russian Envoy Vladimir Kazimirov, in fact,  took a pro-Armenian position."    In his turn Russian Ambassador said that "Moscow understands  the processes happening in Azerbaijan and the positions of our  countries coincide in many aspects." Shonia also said that  Russian leadership is ready for any cooperation with Azerbaijan.  Then the meeting continued behind the closed doors.    Meanwhile, as a source at the Russian Foreign Ministry told  the Moscow correspondent of TURAN news agency, Moscow began  "twisting Azerbaijan's arms" recently, trying to force it to  receive the Russian plan for the regulation of the  Armenian-Azeri conflict. According to the information available,  Russia insists on the acceptance of the plan, presented by  Vladimir Kazimirov last week. As reported the idea of the plan  is - the parties to the conflict declare cessation of  hostilities, then Russian troops are stationed in the conflict  zone, and the Armenian forces withdraw from the southern regions  of Azerbaijan (Dzhebrailskiy, Fizuliskiy, Agdamskiy). After all  this is implemented, the sides will begin the discussion of the  political status of Nagorno-Karabakh and the question of the  Armenian withdrawal from Kelbadzharskiy region of Azerbaijan.</p>

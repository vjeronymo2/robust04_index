			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Frail Deng makes annual parade Deng Xiaoping, China's reclusive senior leader, yesterday made a rare appearance on state television to mark the lunar new year holiday. It was the first time the 89-year-old Deng had surfaced publicly since January last year when he was also shown attending an official ceremony on the eve of Chinese new year. Chinese TV devoted seven minutes to its coverage of Mr Deng's visit to Shanghai where he has celebrated new year since 1988. He was shown greeting municipal leaders and inspecting a recently-completed bridge over the Yangtze. Mr Deng appeared more frail than last year and required the constant help of two of his daughters. The ageing leader's voice was not heard. Millions of Chinese viewers could hardly have avoided the impression that his life is slipping away, but his routine new year appearance was clearly aimed at reassuring people he was still able to fulfil annual commitments. Failure to show himself in Shanghai at this time would have strengthened rumours that his health problems were terminal. He has been variously reported to be suffering from prostate cancer, and also to have been afflicted by a stroke. China's leadership has been preparing for Mr Deng's death, but his departure would leave an enormous gap at the top, ushering in a period of political uncertainty. Since a high profile visit to southern China in early 1992, Mr Deng has been urging speedier change, as if he realised time was running out for him to ensure his reforms endured. China's official Xinhua news agency reported that Mr Deng had been in Shanghai for two months, during which time he had visited the city's new Pudong development zone, its leading hotel, main shopping street and famous Bund along the city's waterfront. Mr Deng was said to have recited a poem after viewing Shanghai's achievements: 'Watching in joy roads built today is better than reading for scores of years,' Xinhua reported. Mr Chen Yun, another of China's aged leaders, was also shown on television welcoming the new year. Mr Chen, an economic conservative, has often been portrayed as a leading opponent of Mr Deng's 'growth-at-all-costs' strategy.</p>

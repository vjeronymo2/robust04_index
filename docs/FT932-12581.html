			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / World Trade News: Mexico turns to import curbs as deficit grows - The door is less open to free trade ONCE proud of its free trade credentials, the Mexican government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has taken a series of measures in the past few months to curb imports and to protect some of the country's most inefficient industries. The change in policy has created some resentment in those countries affected and sits uneasily with the Mexican government's goal of joining a wider North American free trade area. However, after witnessing a 262 per cent increase in imports over the past five years and seeing many of its largest industries hurt by foreign competition, the government has evidently decided enough is enough. Earlier this month it imposed duties of up to 1,105 per cent on about Dollars 225m of imports from China, including clothes, shoes, textiles and toys that it alleges were being dumped in Mexico below cost. These later duties have been imposed before an investigation on the effects of Chinese dumping on Mexican industries has been started. Were China a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, such duties would have been a breach of the trade body's regulations. Since September last year the government has introduced quality standards and regulations for imports that make exporting to Mexico more difficult, banned British beef for what it said was health reasons, then raised tariffs on all beef to 15 per cent. It also reduced the duty-free allowance at the border to just Dollars 50. This last measure provoked riots at several border towns by Mexicans who regularly do their shopping in the US. In February, the government imposed countervailing duties on Dollars 116m of steel exports from six US companies, after alleging the steel products were being dumped on the Mexican market. The duties range from 0.8 per cent to 39.3 per cent. While the measures are consistent with Mexico's membership of Gatt, they reflect a change in the government's objectives. In the past, the government encouraged imports to put pressure on Mexican companies to lower margins and increase productivity. But now officials seem more concerned about the effect of imports on employment and the current account deficit. Mr Jacobo Zaidenweber, a textile producer, and private sector adviser to the trade ministry during the talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement, says: 'The government used to be very rigorous in promoting free trade. But now that there is a huge deficit and inflation is under control, there is a little fine-tuning. We see a new willingness of the government to correct the distortions of the market because of the changed priorities.' A trade ministry official says: 'The perception I have is that industries are worried about cheap imports and the government has responded, but only when competition is unfair.' He adds that the government remains committed to free trade. Anti-dumping duties were only necessary, he says, because the economy was open, and had never been needed in Mexico's protectionist past. The government's decision to help selected industries reflects an increased political sensitivity to the private sector at a time when the economy is slowing (growth was just an annualised 1.9 per cent in the fourth quarter last year) and because elections are due next year. The new barriers will protect those industries that have been worst affected by Mexico's trade liberalisation. The toy industry, now protected by a 351 per cent tariff against Chinese imports, was seriously affected. According to Canacintra, a business chamber, sales of Mexican toys fell by 24.5 per cent last year. The textile sector, now protected from Chinese imports by tariffs ranging from 54 to more than 500 per cent, has also suffered. In the past seven years the Mexican government had cut import tariffs from 50 per cent to 20 per cent, and eliminated import licences that were often never available. But the result has been a flood of cheap, mainly Asian imports. The domestic textile and clothing sector shrank by 5 per cent last year alone. Hundreds of textile companies have closed, with thousands of jobs lost. A government official admitted last year that there was some connection between the new regulations on imports and a desire to improve the trade balance, but he thought the effect would be temporary as importers became accustomed to the new procedures. Mexico's current account deficit last year was Dollars 22.8bn, with monthly imports about Dollars 4bn in the last nine months of the year. However, in January and February the growth in the deficit slowed markedly, with February's shortfall at Dollars 1.24bn. While part of this reduction may be explained by the new measures, the reduction in economic growth also should have curbed the appetite for foreign goods.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said Turkey  continues to carry out a slanderous campaign against Greece and  to bring unfounded charges by invoking events that are obviously  contrary to the reality. The spokesman made the above statement  when he was asked about the government's comment regarding the  confession of the Kurdish fighter who was tortured by Turkish  authorities into saying that he had been trained at a camp for  terrorists in Greece. Venizelos underlined once again that our  country will not contribute to the effort to cultivate false  tension. We call on Turkey, the spokesman said, to stop  implicating Greece in its internal problems. The Greek state  authority, Venizelos stressed, controls the whole of its  territory which is open and accessible to everyone, especially  to journalists. Finally, the government spokesman expressed the  government's regret for the confirmation of brutal violation of  human rights, such as in the case of detained persons subjected  to torture to sign forged confessions.</p>

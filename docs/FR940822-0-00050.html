			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Foundation invites each finalist to an interview with a regional review panel. Panels evaluate Truman Finalists primarily on: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Leadership potential including vision, sensitivity, and communications skills; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Commitment to a career in government or elsewhere in public service; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Intellectual strength, analytical abilities, and prospects of performing well in graduate school. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1801.23  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendation by panel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Each Panel is asked to recommend to the Board of Trustees the name of one candidate from each state in the region to be appointed as a Truman Scholar. The Foundation may authorize each region review panel to recommend additional Scholars from the States in its region. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The recommendations are based on the material required under &sect;1801.17 and, as determined in the interview, the panel's assessment of each finalist in terms of criteria presented in &sect;1801.22. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1801.24  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Nomination of seniors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) In the event that a regional review panel determines that none of the finalists from a state meet all the requirements expected of a Truman Scholar, it does not have to provide a recommendation. The Foundation will carry over the Scholarship for that state making two Scholarships available the succeeding year. Seniors will be eligible to participate the succeeding year as well as juniors. Institutions may nominate up to three seniors for this extra Scholarship in addition to three juniors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) If additional nominations are made under paragraph (a) of this section, the applications must meet the requirements of Subpart B of this part, and are considered under the procedures of this subpart. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1801.25  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Selection of Truman Scholars by the Foundation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Foundation names Truman Scholars after receiving recommendations from the regional review panels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart D_Graduate Study and the Work Experience Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1801.30  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Continuation into graduate study. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The Foundation will not conduct a new and separate competition for graduate scholarships, nor will it add new Truman Scholars at the graduate level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Only Scholars who satisfactorily complete their undergraduate education and who comply with &sect;1801.31 shall be eligible for continued Foundation support for an approved program of graduate study. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1801.31  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Approval of graduate study programs by the Foundation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) By December 1, Scholars desiring Foundation support for graduate study the following academic year must submit a proposed program of graduate study to the Foundation for approval. The graduate study program proposed for approval may differ from that proposed by the Scholar when nominated for a Truman Scholarship. Factors to be used by the Foundation in considering approval include being consistent with: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Field of study initially proposed in the Scholar's Nomination and Supporting Information Form; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Graduate school programs given priority in the current Bulletin of Information; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Undergraduate educational program and work experience of the Scholar; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Preparation specifically for a career in public service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Foundation approval in writing of the Scholar's proposal is required before financial support is granted for graduate work. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Scholars must include in their submission to the Foundation a statement of interest in a career in public service that specifies in detail how their graduate program and their overall educational and work experience plans will realistically prepare them for their chosen career goal in government or elsewhere in the public service. The Foundation issues guidelines to help Scholars prepare their proposals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (d) After completing his or her undergraduate studies, a Scholar may request in writing each year a deferral of support for graduate studies. Deferrals must be requested no later than June 15 for the succeeding academic year. Scholars failing to request a year's deferral and to receive written approval from the Foundation will lose one year of funding support for each year for which they fail to request and receive deferrals. Total deferrals may not exceed four years unless an extension is approved by the Foundation. Extensions are generally granted only for Scholars attending graduate or professional school and supported by other scholarships or private resources or for Scholars with commitments to the uniformed services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1801.32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible colleges and degree programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Truman Scholars at the graduate level may use Foundation support to study at any accredited institution that offers graduate study appropriate and relevant to their public service career goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) They may enroll in any relevant graduate program for a career in public service.

Each Scholar is eligible to receive up to $3000 for the senior year of undergraduate education. Scholars in graduate programs planning to receive degrees in one to two years are eligible to receive up to $13,500 per year or $10,000 (adjusted annually from January 1985 to reflect increases, if any, in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics), whichever is less. Scholars in graduate programs requiring three or more years of academic study are eligible to receive up to $9000 per year for a maximum of three years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1801.42  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Definition of ``fee''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fee <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , in this part, means a typical and usual non-refundable charge by the institution of higher education for a service, a privilege, or the use of property which is required for a Scholars' enrollment and registration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1801.43 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Allowance of books. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

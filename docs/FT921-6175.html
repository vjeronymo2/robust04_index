			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Observer: Augury US Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady has offered a possible way out of Britain's green-shoots/withered-shoots debate. Expressing his optimism to the US Society of Business Economists this week, he announced: 'I see robins on the lawn.' Picturesque; but not strictly applicable over here. The American robin is a quite different bird from the British variety - larger, gaudier, and never seen on Christmas cards. So if British optimists want to take the Brady line, they must nominate a migrant. And pessimists must come up with a bird of ill omen. Traditionally, an owl. But owls on the lawn? Hardly.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Authority to oppose BAe airport British Aerospace's con-troversial attempt to develop its Filton airfield near Bristol as a commercial airport is to be opposed by the local planning authority, Roland Adburgham writes. A public inquiry into the scheme is to be held after BAe appealed to the environment secretary. This followed the delay by Northavon district council in deciding on the application, which was submitted last September. Northavon council yesterday unanimously decided that, had it still been in a position to decide on the application, it would have refused it because of the airport's adverse environmental impact, especially on noise levels. The council's officers had recommended refusal. BAe wants to have scheduled services to make more use of its Filton runway. It believes this would help to safeguard the future of its adjacent plant, where 5,000 people are employed. Although the plans are supported by many in the region's business community there is vociferous opposition from local residents.</p>

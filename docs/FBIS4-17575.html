			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 25 -- Co-chairmen of the Democratic  Russia Political Movement Lev Ponomarev and Gleb Yakunin sent on  Monday an open letter to Russian President Boris Yeltsin with a  suggestion that he put off the signing of the memorandum on  civic peace and accord, which is scheduled for April 28.    The Democratic Russia leaders justified their position by  referring to an article published by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in  the liberal daily paper IZVESTIYA. They said the nationalist  leader's article contained expansionist desires and  anti-constitutional appeals. Expressing their opposition to  "civic accord" with Zhirinovskiy, the Democratic Russia leaders  said he should either publicly renounce the anti-constitutional  appeals or not be allowed to sign the treaty.</p>

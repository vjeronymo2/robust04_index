			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / International Company News: Saurer acquires GIG in share exchange SAURER Group Holding, the Swiss textile machinery and engineering group controlled by Dr Tito Tettamanti, has acquired Gruppo Industriale Ghidella (GIG), an Italian motor components maker, through an exchange of shares. The deal means Mr Vittorio Ghidella, chairman and owner of 93 per cent of GIG's equity, will receive a roughly 25 per cent voting stake in Saurer and become its chairman. Mr Tettamanti, who has a 35 per cent voting position, will be chairman of the twin company, Saurer Group Investments. The exchange of shares is to be made on the basis of the audited net asset value of the two groups at the end of 1991. Saurer estimated that the 217,000 shares to be issued for GIG shareholders would be valued at about SFr670 apiece, making the deal worth roughly SFr145m (Dollars 102.80m). GIG specialises in transmissions for agricultural and industrial vehicles. It had sales last year of L223bn. Saurer has been active on the acquisition trail in the past year, buying Schlafhorst, a big German manufacturer of textile machinery in June and Xaloy, a US maker of components for injection moulding machines, in December. Mr Tettamanti said Mr Ghidella would take overall responsibility for the group. The two agreed that Mr Ghidella might buy further shares of Saurer to bring his holding up to the level of Mr Tettamanti's.</p>

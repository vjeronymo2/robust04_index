It effects no significant changes in the current relationships between the federal government, the states and their political subdivisions in connection with these programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Executive Order 12606, the Family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this proposed rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. Under the proposed rule, applicants and participants, and adult members of their families, are required to sign and submit consent forms authorizing the verification or collection of certain information necessary for determining eligibility for or level of assistance under the covered programs. Consent forms to permit verification of information provided by the family are already required. This proposed rule would prohibit the collection of information which is not necessary to verify the income of an applicant or participant, and makes the consent form valid for 15 months. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this proposed rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D.

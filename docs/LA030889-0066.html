			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL;  </P> <P> 7-RUN RALLY LIFTS RIO MESA OVER ALEMANY  </P> <P> Sophomore Dmitri Young had three hits and five runs batted in and Rio Mesa High  pushed across seven runs in the decisive sixth inning as the Spartans defeated  Alemany, 13-8, in a Westside tournament game Tuesday at Rio Mesa.  </P> <P> Trailing, 8-6, in the bottom of the sixth, the Spartans launched their assault  when Young scored Carlos Cendejas from third with a single.  </P> <P> A sacrifice fly by Steve Soliz tied the score, 8-8, and the Spartans took their  first lead when Alemany's Jeff Daniels threw a wild pitch that allowed Young to  score from third.  </P> <P> Rio Mesa (2-1) got to Daniels for one more run, then touched up reliever Matt  Delavinge for three more when Cendejas, batting for the second time in the  inning, ripped a bases-loaded double down the left-field line.  </P> <P> Alemany (2-1) led, 6-0, entering the bottom of the first, but Young, the state  freshman player of the year last season, belted a two-run home run. Young  employed his power again in the fourth, drawing Rio Mesa to within 8-6 with a  two-run homer to left-center field. DAVID SALKIN  </P></p>

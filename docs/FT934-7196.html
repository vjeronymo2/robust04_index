			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (7): Hand made in Britain . . . but at a price - Across London craftsmen are still creating top-quality products ONE OF the great misconceptions of our time is that the British are no longer any good at making things. Happily, the British remain skilled manufacturers, particularly of top-quality made-to-measure goods. Across London there are still small craftsmen creating beautifully made luggage, shoes, riding-boots and hats. It is possible, not only to buy top quality, traditional luggage, but also to commission your own special portmanteau from companies such as Tanner Krolle. 'We are one of the few companies in the hand-made leather industry still able to offer a bespoke service. We see each bespoke item as a challenge and take great pride in being able to make our client's dreams come true,' says Philip Davis, managing director. Commissions have included a hand-crafted case to house an old master painting; a made-to-measure compartmentalised suitcase that serves as an office, an overnight bag and, most important, a seat on which to rest in between airline connections; and a jewellery case in leather, tanned specially to a client's wife's favourite shade of blue. The firm's work is distinguished by excellent materials ranging from bridle-hide to ostrich, solid frames in tempered steel and proper brass locks. The same high standards of craftsmanship are apparent in the work of case maker Simon Baker, a former fashion designer who abandoned the fleeting charms of plastic for the more enduring appeal of leather. 'The British craftsman has always had a vocational attitude to his work, and will go to great lengths to produce the perfect item,' says Baker. He says he senses a revival of interest in durable, artisan-produced goods. Baker studied leather construction at Cordwainers College in London and, after a period as a restorer, perfected a method that combines the best of traditional Victorian craft techniques with lighter materials and more contemporary construction. Everything is stitched by hand and lined in leather. His work is handsomely robust and is generally made from the most hard-wearing bridle hide he can find. It is especially popular with photographers, who order portfolios and cases with special compartments to carry equipment. Other commissions include a case that combines the facilities of an attache case an overnight bag and a large music case. 'If people can draw, I can make it,' says Baker, whose prices start at Pounds 400. Britain also produces bespoke shoes. Some of the most beautiful are made by Cleverley in London's Royal Arcade. The shoes are distinguished by a wonderfully elegant chiselled toe and its products have graced the feet of Sir Laurence Olivier, Gary Cooper and Clark Gable and boast a committed following. 'There is absolutely no substitute for a bespoke shoe,' says director George Glasgow. The shoes are made the same way today as they were at the turn of the century. Glasgow, and his partner John Carniera, go to enormous lengths to 'jiggle the twin imperatives of shape and comfort. A new client is shown around thirty basic styles from which he decides exactly what he wants. His feet are then measured and a last carved. A paper pattern is then cut to fit the last and the shoe is cut-out.' A meticulous process follows involving five craftsmen and several fittings before the shoes are completed. Cleverley charges Pounds 750 which, although pricy, is considerably less than other better known makers and is excellent value for money. Also excellent are British-made riding boots. Some of the best are to found at Schnieder Boots in Clifford Street, London W1. Rudolf Schnieder is a third generation bootmaker who, as his name suggests, was originally from Germany, but found Anglo- Saxon life so 'fascinating' that he settled in England. He says: 'The British make very good craftsmen because they still take their glorious past seriously and feel almost patriotically-obliged to do a good job.' Schnieder's firm makes a vast range of of boots of all equestrian types for clients including royalty, the army and several Olympic teams. His bespoke boots are incredibly dashing, are made entirely by hand and fit like a glove. They also bear the princely price-tag of Pounds 2,000. For less well-lined pockets there is a range of factory made-to-measure styles, from Pounds 600, and sets of ready-to-wear models in 11 different fittings for as little as Pounds 239. Made to measure is of course not restricted to leather goods. British handmade suits and shirts are justly famous, but many might be surprised to know that it is still possible to order bespoke hats. This steamy craft endures at the Dickensian premises of S Patey. Patey makes top hats, academic mortar boards, riding hats, bowlers and all manner of ceremonial headgear. The hats are made-to-measure using an elaborate machine called a comformater. All the manufacturing processes are done by hand and involve building ad shaping layers of shellac-impregnated cotton into elegant headwear that exactly fits and flatters in the way a soft off-the-peg hat never could. Prices start at Pounds 125. Even the smallest sartorial embellishments can be custom-made. Longmire, in St James's, London, hand-enamels or engraves cufflinks and blazer buttons to order. The firm obligingly claims to be able to depict any subject including a coat-of-arms, family crest and tartan, a pampered pet, a favourite sport, hobby, car or painting, corporate logo, racing colours and yachting burgees. The workmanship is of a very high standard: a single design can take up to three days to be immortalised in miniature. Prices start at Pounds 1,000. Finally, the edible custom-made accessory: the monogrammed chocolate. Gerard Ronay, Britain's most recherche and expensive chocolate maker, will embed initials or other simple designs on after-dinner bitter chocolates,(Pounds 22 per pound plus Pounds 1 per chocolate personalised) and will even produce a personalised box actually made of chocolate (Pounds 20). Self-indulgence indeed. John Morgan is Associate Editor of GQ Magazine.</p>

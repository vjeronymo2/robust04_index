			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotes in Creole] </F>   [Text] Julio Larosiliere, senator of the southeast [as  heard], says he is willing to accept the leadership of the next  cabinet. I am not campaigning because of my status as senator,  but if I was called, I would not hesitate to become the next  prime minister, he stated. Moreover, he said he is competent for  such a post.    [Begin Larosiliere recording] "I must clearly tell you that  it is not a matter of [word indistinct]. It is a matter of  capability, it is a matter of sacrifice." At this time, Senator  Larosiliere is a man who can perform the functions of prime  minister in Haiti. If I could not, I would say: No, I cannot.  But I feel I can. So, if I am invited, if this post is offered  to me, "I will accept, and I believe it is one of the best  choices that could be made. If some believe that I am taking  steps just so I can become prime minister, I can say other  things are involved." I think that I am here to serve the  nation, but I will not take any steps because I have a mandate  as senator; I am very proud to be a senator and I would be happy  to remain in Parliament to do that job. I am repeating the  following for you: If "they see that I can contribute to a way  out of the crisis, I am ready; and I believe the people as well  as President Aristide, the Armed Forces, and all sectors in this  country will not send flowers to me--so to say-- because I do  not hold the post, but I am sure that the results will be  positive if I do occupy this post." [as heard] [end recording]    This was Sen. Julio Larosiliere, who is available to occupy  the post of prime minister.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, speaking at a  Foreign Affairs-Unification Committee meeting today, said that  the remark by Thomas Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of  State for East Asian Affairs, urging the ROK to abolish the  National Security Law does not represent an authoritative view  of the U.S. Government, but was merely a presentation of his  personal opinion.    Minister Han Sung-chu said that the government is planning  to  make an official inquiry to the U.S. State Department through  diplomatic channels about the background and intent of Deputy  Assistant Secretary Hubbard's remark.    Minister Han said that although the U.S. side referred to  the  National Security Law in connection with the human rights issue  in the ROK before the civilian government was launched, no such  reference has been made since the start of the civilian  government. Moreover, the U.S. State Department's human rights  report notes drastic improvement in the ROK's human rights  situation.</p>

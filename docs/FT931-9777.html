			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading STOCK index futures had a volatile session in which fears of further rights issues alternated with bid speculation in the banking sector, writes Joel Kibazo. An initial retreat in the March contract on the FT-SE after opening at 2,835 was brought about by news of the Trafalgar House rights issue. That was quickly shrugged off and March reversed direction, pulled forward by the cash market. But it ran into another bout of selling at mid-morning as bid talk and speculation of further rights issues again went round the market. However, buying from a leading US house sent March into positive territory again and this time it touched the day's high of 2,842. Then, weakness in sterling led to further selling that was encouraged by the early poor performance on Wall Street. March finished at 2,834, up 7 from the previous close and around 3 points above the underlying cash market, after turnover of 8,480 contracts. In traded options, most of the day's activity centred on the stock options. Bid specu-lation in TSB continued and it was the most actively dealt option with a total of 5,159 lots. It was followed by Cadbury-Schweppes with 1,159 lots transacted and Glaxo with 1,405. Trafalgar House, on announcing its rights issue yesterday, was also busy. Total option market turnover came to 29,205 contracts.</p>

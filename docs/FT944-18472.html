			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Brazil votes with Cardoso tipped to win Brazil yesterday held its biggest round of elections in 40 years, with last-minute opinion polls predicting that Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a sociology professor turned social democratic politician, was set to become the country's next president. Three opinion polls, conducted at the weekend and released yesterday, showed him with a big lead over his nearest rival, Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers' Party. According to the largest poll, by Datafolha, Mr Cardoso was to win 48 per cent of the vote against Mr da Silva's 22 per cent. It also suggested Mr Cardoso had a lead of nine percentage points over all the other candidates combined. If he does take more votes than all his rivals, he will win the presidency without the need for a second round next month. Mr Cardoso was cheered by supporters when he left his Sao Paulo home to vote early yesterday. He said he felt 'very emotional' amid the excitement. Advisers said he would wait until Wednesday before commenting on the results. Also yesterday, Brazil was electing state governors, two thirds of the federal senate, and all seats in the federal House of Representatives and state legislatures. Voting is compulsory and big queues were expected at polling stations as nearly 95m Brazilians, including 8.5m illiterates, chose among 12,000 candidates. Electoral authorities expect to need 10-15 days to count the votes. The first results, probably from urban areas of Sao Paulo state, were not expected until this afternoon at the earliest. Mr da Silva, who led in opinion polls until July, said he remained confident that there would be a second round. He described the election as 'illegitimate' because of the support Mr Cardoso has received from the government. The latter, who resigned as finance minister this year to seek the presidency, is the man most closely linked with Brazil's new currency, the Real, which has led to a sharp fall in inflation. Mr da Silva also repeated accusations that Mr Cardoso's party had distributed false ballot papers in which Mr da Silva's name appeared in the wrong place. The left-winger candidate suggested these papers were designed to confuse illiterate voters. The elections were generally reported to have been peaceful. However, in the north-eastern state of Alagoas, where nearly half the state's electoral judges are under police protection after receiving threats, early reports suggested voting had been delayed in four districts after allegations of electoral fraud.</p>

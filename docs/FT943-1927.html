			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Polish PM accused over sell-off delay A political row over the future of Poland's long-delayed mass privatisation programme erupted yesterday, revealing mounting frustration at months of inaction by the Polish prime minister, Mr Waldemar Pawlak. Mr Wieslaw Kaczmarek, the privatisation minister, accused Mr Pawlak of blocking the scheme, which was launched four years ago and has limped through five successive governments. The delays have angered potential foreign participants in the scheme and alarmed the international financial institutions which view privatisation as a test of Poland's reform intentions. Poland's letter of intent for its last Dollars 800m (Pounds 516m) IMF standby agreement promised enactment of the privatisations. This promise will soon be tested when Poland asks the IMF for Dollars 400m to help fund the Dollars 1.9bn initial costs of the commercial debt reduction agreement which comes into force at the end of next month. The release of IMF funds will only follow a review of the letter of intent. Mr Kaczmarek is from the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), the largest party in a coalition with the Peasants' party (PSL) led by Mr Pawlak. He told a meeting of the privatisation council, an official advisory body, yesterday that it was no longer a question of 'mere delays' but that 'brakes had been put on the scheme'. Up to 450 state companies are due to be handed over to 'National Investment Funds' (NIFs) run by foreign and local management groups, with shares in the funds distributed to Poles at a nominal fee. The previous Solidarity government approved 350 companies over a year ago and short-listed 19 management groups. Most are alliances between Polish institutions and western banks. Mr Kaczmarek has been waiting since July for Mr Pawlak to approve 100 more companies for the scheme. He also expected his signature on a list of members and chairmen of the supervisory boards to oversee the funds before Mr Pawlak left on Tuesday for a visit to China. Mr Pawlak departed without signing either. Meanwhile, Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, the SLD chairman, was in London this week complaining that the delay over signing the privatisations into law was part of a pattern of delay and obstruction from a stubborn coalition partner. Mr Pawlak, for his part, has criticised the sell-off for giving too great a role to foreigners in the management of the funds. Mr Pawlak's failure to approve the last tranche leaves potential fund managers increasingly restive. Mr David Glasgow of Kleinwort Benson warned that further delay could adversely affect the bank's participation in other Polish projects. Several foreign bidders have spent up to Dollars 1.5m preparing for the scheme and have been waiting for two years in the hope of what could be significant rewards.</p>

His 365 days in the homeland were really impressive days  embroidered with the noble love and obligation and the  unbreakable bonds of kinship between the illustrious leader and  an ordinary soldier.    The 43 years of Yi In-mo in a "hell on earth" and his one  year in the earthly paradise make us picture to ourselves the  incarnation of great human love that has made a dead tree  blossom.    Yi In-mo served as a war correspondent in the period of the  fatherland liberation war unleashed by the U.S. imperialists 40  odd years ago. During the war, he got heavily wounded and was  taken prisoner, leaving his fate unknown.    The great leader President Kim Il-song awarded a certificate  of the bereaved family of a revolutionary martyr to Yi In-mo's  family in 1968 when his fate was not known, expressing  unquestioned trust in the soldier.    After it was known that he was alive and he fought  undauntedly for 34 years in prison, the great leader, very  pleased that his trust in him was not in vain, decided to confer  the title of the Hero of the Republic upon him, highly  appreciating his patriotic faith and will.    Immeasurable are the efforts exerted by him to bring an old  soldier on sickbed at a tip of South Korea back to Pyongyang  where his wife and a daughter were waiting for him.    At the time he was sent back to the North, he was, indeed, a  "dead man." His internal organs were all abnormal and he was  suffering from serious malnutrition, pyothorax and general  famine by medieval tortures for more than 12,400 days in prison.    Even officials concerned of the South wondered if he could  reach Pyongyang alive.    Yi In-mo, however, expressed his admiration for the  fascinating reality of the North three days after he was  embraced by the Republic and began writing some 70 days after.  It was some 100 days after he returned to the North that he  left the sickbed and toured different places of the socialist  homeland together with his family, seeing its imposing reality  at first hand.    The great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il have always shown deep loving care for his  health and life over the last one year. More than 100 kinds of  tonics and expensive medicine sent by them for his health and  their precious teachings on more than 120 occasions and deep  love on over 40 occasions have brought him to the culmination of  happiness and glory.    Yi In-mo has visited time-honored Mangyongdae, Mt. Paektu,  the ancestral mountain, the Tower of the Chuche Idea, the arch  of triumph, Pabal-ri, his home town, and other places of the  homeland.    Touring the homeland, he has keenly felt that the love and  trust of the illustrious leader is not confined to him but  reaches all of the people.    Therefore, he, out of the absolute worship to the  illustrious  leader, wrote poems "On My Fate," "Thought of Love" and "Song in  Praise of Faith and Will" and words of the song "We Will Win  Because You Are Leading Us" and other works singing of the noble  love of the Workers' Party of Korea, and today contributed a  full-length article titled "We Are Blessed With Sagacious  Leader" to NODONG SINMUN.    This is not only what Yi In-mo said from the bottom of his  heart but the unshakable faith of the entire Korean people.</p>

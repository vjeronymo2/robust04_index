			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (18): Biggest surge since 1948  -Bombay's finance markets are thriving Bombay's financial markets are booming, fuelled by the biggest surge of foreign portfolio investment since India's independence. The city is filled with international fund managers, stockbrokers and merchant bankers touting for business. Hotels are full. Office space in Nariman Point, the heart of Bombay's business district, is at a premium. Recruitment agencies are on the prowl. 'It's like Seoul was in 1986,' says one Hong Kong-based fund manager. Even though equity prices fell sharply immediately after last month's Budget, the stock market is more buoyant than at any time since the 1992 securities scandal. The Bombay Stock Exchange's 30-share index, which hit a post-scandal low of 2150 last summer, almost doubled to 4,236 just before the Budget. The rise has come amid signs of a modest recovery in Indian industry after more than two years of stagnation. But the real trigger for the markets has been a flood of foreign buying, far above the expectations of officials at the finance ministry, who opened the market to non-Indian investors only at the end of 1992. As late as last September, foreigners had bought a mere Dollars 150m of stock, so time-consuming were the procedures for securing permission to enter the market. But by the year-end, the figure was over Dollars 1bn and now stands above Dollars 1.3bn. About 150 institutions have now registered with the Indian authorities - around 90 are active buyers. Large overseas funds dedicated to India which have yet to buy stock - notably Dollars 500m funds managed by Morgan Stanley and Robert Oppenheimer, the US investment banks. Mr GB Desai, the Bombay Stock Exchange president, says: 'With so much buying by foreign institutional investors the mood is very positive.' In addition, foreign fund managers have bought about Dollars 1.2bn in Indian companies' Euroissues, including substantial offerings from Reliance Industries, the petrochemicals and textiles group, the State Bank of India, the country's largest bank. In the pipeline is a Dollars 1bn issue from Videsh Sancahr Nigam, India's international telecommunications carrier. While the post-Budget correction could temporarily delay some issues, at the time of writing it does not seem likely to cause any longer-term disruption. Indian companies have taken advantage of this demand to issue record amounts of new equity to help repay old loans and raise funds for new projects. The total market capitalisation of the Bombay Stock Exchange has topped Rs3,000bn. Nevertheless, the first flush of enthusiasm for Indian stocks could soon fade. The driving force behind last year's surge in foreign buying was principally a hunt for new developing countries in which to invest following big increases in east Asian markets. This was coupled to moderate enthusiasm about India's economic reforms. But as fund managers crowded into Bombay, driving up prices, so some important concerns have emerged. The first is that leading Indian equities are not cheap by world standards, with the 30-share index trading on a composite multiple of 50 times earnings - up from 30 a year ago. Smaller stocks trade on multiples as low as 10: these are the real investment jewels of modern India but identifying the suitable ones takes time and the markets in them are often illiquid. The next problem is the archaic trading, settlement and stock transfer systems, which can cause delays of up to six months between payment and the formal registration of share-ownership. If entering such a market can be difficult, then getting out might be even harder - especially if, at some future date, foreign fund managers all go for the exit at the same time. The biggest bottleneck now is in custodial services - the handling of the paperwork connected to share trading which is usually done by a custodian bank on behalf of an investor. The three international banks offering services in Bombay - Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Standard Chartered Bank and Citibank - were overwhelmed by the investment surge. Hongkong bank and Citibank, the two bigger operators, placed curbs on new accounts and recruited extra staff to clear the backlog. Hongkong bank said early this month that the backlog had virtually been cleared though the trading curbs were still in place to make sure the paperwork did not swell again. The Securities and Investment Board of India, the markets watchdog, authorised regulatory changes including the use of 'jumbo' transfer deeds and share certificates to ease the transfer of large lots. Indian banks are also offering to act as custodians for foreign investors. However, Mr SS Nadkarni, the Sebi chairman, says the real solution will come with the introduction of computerised trading, combined with computerised settlement and share registration. These changes are to be introduced over the next two years. Also, the Bombay market will steadily become more accessible to foreign investors as more foreign-owned financial services companies establish themselves. Fourteen foreign-owned stockbrokers have been permitted to open offices - though they are limited to dealing with foreign investors and cannot yet join the stock exchange so must trade through Indian brokers. The exchange has recently opened its doors to corporate membership, including joint ventures between foreign companies and local partners, though none has yet been admitted. Moreover, the Sebi has done much to improve standards of honesty in the market. Dealing with the 1992 securities scandal, in which money was illegally siphoned out of banks into equities, has given Sebi an ideal opportunity to start cleaning up bad practices including over-charging clients, mixing client and own account trading, insider dealing, tax fraud and poor book-keeping. 'There's a much more salubrious atmosphere at the BSE now,' says Mr Nadkarni. Sebi has this year also recorded a considerable success in reforming the exchange's informal forward market, called badla, which has been widely used for untransparent trading. Eventually the government plans to replace badla with a formal futures and options market. The remarkable progress in creating modern capital markets contrasts sharply with much slower reforms elsewhere, notably in the state-owned banks which dominate the banking system. The government has partially liberalised interest rates and rules controlling loan markets, though important restrictions remain notably an obligation on banks to lend a chunk of their funds directly to the government and lend a further slice to politically-favoured groups such as farmers and small businessmen. The state-owned banks will face tougher competition following the licensing of nine new private sector banks, the first in 30 years which will join the existing 55 (including 24 foreign-owned). The government is also planning to sell off up to 49 per cent of state-owned banks. The State Bank of India, the largest, has gone to the market raising Rs32bn in shares and bonds and reduced the state-controlled stake from 98 per cent to 66 per cent. Other stronger banks will follow Meanwhile, banks have been forced by new accountancy rules to reveal the full extent of their bad debts for the first time - Rs100bn-Rs110bn at the end of March 1993 for the 28 national banks. The government, which earlier injected Rs40bn into the banks, has put in a further Rs57bn over the last year with another Rs57bn promised in 1994-95. However, none of this will change the state-controlled nature of the banking system. As Mr C Rangarajan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, says: 'In five or 10 years' time there will still be a state-dominated banking system.' If the system is state-owned it is difficult to see how banks will be forced to become genuinely competitive. Cutting loss-making branches, shedding staff, introducing labour-saving computers. None of this will come quickly. As Mr N Vaghul, chairman of the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India, a diversified development bank, says: 'The capital and banking markets have changed. The next logical step is institutional change. But the government is shying away from it.' The other major financial market dominated by the state is insurance, where two giants - the Life Insurance Company and the General Insurance Company - monopolise services. The finance ministry is considering a report recommending liberalisation, including the licensing of privately-owned insurance companies. But competition will not transform the market, unless the the state-owned groups are also turned over to private hands. Barring accidents, the prospect for Indian financial markets is of further rapid growth in size, including increasing participation for foreign investors and financial services. In new markets, private initiatives will dominate. But in the traditional bedrock of the financial system, particularly in banking, government influence and/or interference is likely to remain pervasive. The result could be an uneasy balance between old and new: computers and manual typewriters, faxes and messenger boys, million dollar deals and one rupee revenue stamps.</p>

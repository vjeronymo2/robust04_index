			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with IAEA Director General Hans Blix by Gerhard </F> Bitzan; place and date not given: "North Korea Must Allow  Nuclear Inspections"]    [Text] [Bitzan] How strong is the nuclear threat today  after the end of the Cold War?    [Blix] If I take a look at the international media, I  actually have the feeling that the spread of nuclear weapons is  the biggest danger in the world, and that there are numerous  states in the world that are only waiting to buy or build their  own nuclear weapons -- without any control. However, one must  also see the progress: A number of former risk states,  including Brazil and Argentina, but also South Africa, have  voluntarily given up their nuclear ambitions. There will be  nuclear-free zones in Africa and Latin America, and even in the  Middle East, talks on such a zone are under way.    [Bitzan] Has the collapse of the Soviet Union not made the  proliferation of nuclear weapons uncontrollable?    [Blix] It has certainly increased the danger. Ukraine, for  example, has not joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.  Then there is also the risk of the "leakage" of know-how and of  nuclear material from the former USSR. Yet, so far we have not  seen a single case of the illegal export of enriched uranium,  which is required for atomic bombs. As far as plutonium is  concerned, the quantities were very, very small -- grams or  milligrams.    An increasing number of developing countries are able to  develop nuclear weapons if they use all their funds on this  project. Yet the danger that has often been conjured up -- that  this could happen overnight -- does not exist at all.    [Bitzan] Do you believe that Saddam Husayn might again build  a bomb?    [Blix] After many years of work, we reassessed Iraq's  nuclear program. We know how the supply worked, where the  materials and the know-how came from. We are certain that  something like that will not happen again as long as the control  continues.    [Bitzan] What were the reasons for the differences between  the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] and North Korea?    [Blix] During inspections and analyses, we discovered, as  early as in 1992, that more plutonium existed than was declared.  Only a few additional grams, but also kilograms might be  involved. We do not know. This is an unpleasant development and  it strengthens our doubts regarding their statements. Our  long-term problem is: How much plutonium do they possess beyond  the quantities already declared, and where is it?    The current conflict has a different background. Our  inspections were stopped at the most important site -- in the  laboratory where used fuel rods are being separated and  reprocessed. We were not allowed to carry out the required  tests.    North Korea cited the fact that the inspectors demanded more  than was stipulated in the agreement as one reason for its  behavior. This is a completely unfounded accusation. At the  moment there are no positive signs coming from Pyongyang.    [Bitzan] Will there be any sanctions?    [Blix] The initiative now lies with the UN Security Council.  There is the firm wish among the Security Council to urge North  Korea to allow the inspections. However, I do not think that  there is currently a tendency toward sanctions. Nor do I  believe that the United States is interested in a military  escalation. It is making great efforts to explain that the  "Patriots" are only of a defensive nature, and that they are  only the response to the harsh language of the North.    [Bitzan] North Korea has repeatedly threatened to leave the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Has this danger now increased?    [Blix] North Korea has threatened to do so, but so far it  has refrained from taking such a provocative step. However,  this would not change the reality: The world wants to ensure  that it cannot produce any nuclear weapons. The pressure on  Pyongyang would be the same.</p>

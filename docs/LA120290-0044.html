			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> FOOD;  </P> <P> WHAT'S SMOKIN'?  </P> <P> IF YOU LOVE the outdoorsy flavor of meats and fish smoked slowly over hickory  or mesquite but aren't crazy about getting out the smoker for small quantities  of food, consider the Stovetop Smoker Cooker. It allows you to prepare just  enough for one meal -- in very little time and without the bother of constantly  running outdoors.  </P> <P> It consists of a heavy stainless-steel pan that looks like a cake pan, a drip  tray, a cooking rack and a lid. You simply place the chips in the pan, then add  the chicken breasts, fish, even vegetables atop the food rack, and cover. Any  fat drips into the tray below, and the food steams healthfully in its own  juices, while the wood chips impart a smoky flavor.  </P> <P>  C.M. International's Stovetop Smoker Cooker is available at Mrs. Gooch's and  Gelson's markets.ROBIN TUCKER  </P></p>

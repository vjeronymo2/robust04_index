			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: Kuala Lumpur mirage may prove fruitful - The Emerging Investor When Nomura Securities announced early last week that it was setting up a multi-million dollar fund to invest in the Malaysian stock market, Kuala Lumpur traders thought the rescue boat had finally arrived. The Kuala Lumpur market was one of the world's high flyers last year, rising 98 per cent. This year the story has been different. Analysts said that the new Nomura fund could be investing as much as MDollars 7bn (Dollars 2.7bn) in Malaysian stocks. There were hopes of an upturn in a market that had dropped 20 per cent since the beginning of January. In the event it was all something of a mirage. Somewhere along the line someone had got the figures wrong. Yes, the Japanese were investing - but the figure was closer to MDollars 700m than MDollars 7bn. Yet a bullish breeze is beginning to blow through Kuala Lumpur. Daily trading volumes have increased from only 50m shares at the end of May to an average of more than 300m last week. Foreign institutions have become cautious about what is regarded as one of the most volatile bourses in the region, but locals are piling back in. 'The amount of liquidity in this market is fairly amazing,' says Mr Lum Ming Jang of Phileo Peregrine Securities in Kuala Lumpur. 'It was the retail sector, not the institutions, which drove the market to all-time highs at the end of December and in early January. After a few months rest it looks like the individuals are coming into the market again - the difference now is that while volumes have increased there has been no big jump in values.' 1993 was the year Kuala Lumpur firmly established itself as the leading market in south-east Asia. The retail sector caught stock market fever. On some heady days last year trading volumes in Kuala Lumpur exceeded those of New York. Kuala Lumpur became a favourite off-loading point for foreign funds searching for investment opportunities in Asia. Out of an estimated total of Dollars 20bn that was transferred from developed markets to the bourses of Asia Pacific over the year, about Dollars 4bn went to Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur's market capitalisation rose more than 150 per cent in 1993 to MDollars 620bn: the KLSE now ranks fifth in terms of market capitalisation in Asia Pacific behind Tokyo, Osaka, Hong Kong and Sydney. Kuala Lumpur also has a significant influence on the smaller Singapore bourse. It is estimated that up to 60 per cent of Singapore's daily trading volumes are in Malaysian stocks, traded on an over-the-counter basis. After the euphoria of last year and the sharp correction in early January, there seems little consensus on future market trends. Mr Eugene Morais, a regional director at Baring Securities, says that with the Malaysian economy expected to grow at well over 8 per cent this year he is advising clients to overweight Kuala Lumpur stocks on a regional basis. 'The good quality rather than the more speculative stocks are the ones to go for in this quiet period' says Mr Morais. Mr Manu Bhaskaran, a regional analyst with Crosby Securities, has a more cautious view. 'Kuala Lumpur is still the most expensive market in the region with p/e's running at 23 or 24 times. In the long term prospects are good but investors should be wary.' Most of Malaysia's economic fundamentals look good. Exports grew about 20 per cent in the first two months of 1994. After a sharp drop in both foreign and domestic investment last year there was a large jump in investments in the first quarter of this year. Officials are confidently predicting annual growth of more than 7 per cent over the next 25 years. The government has committed itself to a multi-billion dollar infrastructure programme. Infrastructure related stocks are some of the hottest items on the market. On the negative side, imports, much of which comprise capital equipment like aircraft and power generation materials, have surged this year. Inflation is edging up to near the 5 per cent cent level. In the past local investors have paid scant regard to fundamentals. In Malaysia politics and business are closely interlinked. Political connections are often viewed as more important than balance sheets. The shares of companies with known or perceived links to figures in the government hierarchy were the star performers last year. A main reason for the recent retail rally has been talk of a general election, possibly as early as August. The government led by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, is in no danger of losing its strong control over virtually every aspect of the nation's life. Elections, however, are a time when so called 'money politics' comes to the fore, of the granting of favours to politically supportive groups and companies. A combination of rising interest rates in the US and falling bond prices caused a sizeable chunk of foreign funds to be withdrawn from the Malaysian market this year. Many institutional fund managers, frightened by the highly speculative nature of the market, baled out before the plunge in share values. One factor that has made foreigners wary of Kuala Lumpur has been a number of abuses in share transactions and the lack of market transparency. In recent months a newly formed Securities Commission has made considerable progress in righting some of the more blatant deficiencies of the market. The SC has issued strict new guidelines on corporate manoeuverings such as reverse takeovers and backdoor listings. Locals have blamed the SC for this year's market malaise. 'There is no use having a clinically clean market if it's a dead market,' said one broker. 'Misinformation and rumour mongering, not regulations, stand in the way of a fundamentally sound market,' countered Mr Mohamed Abdul Majid, the SC's chairman. International fund managers say policy changes by Bank Negara, the central bank, have been a dampener on market activity. In January Bank Negara started imposing a series of measures to prevent foreign speculation on the ringgit, the Malaysian dollar. Fund managers say a lack of consistency in Bank Negara policy, coupled with troublesome regulations on the movement of currency, has deterred many foreign investors. The Japanese, however, seem undeterred by the negative factors. The amount of funds from Japan being invested might not be as spectacular as at first envisaged but it's still being seen as a significant move. 'We are very bullish on the Malaysian market,' said one Japanese fund manager. Not everyone will follow Japan's lead. Late last year Japanese investors plunged into the Malaysian market - and got badly burnt.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          17/6/94   Week on week change Stock                       Country  Dollars close  Dollars         %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Guney Biracilik              Turkey      1.4791      0.5377     57.12 Alarko Holding               Turkey      1.1093      0.3840     52.95 Koc Holding                  Turkey      0.9003      0.2930     45.85 Eczacibasi Yatirim           Turkey      0.1560      0.0448     40.35 Aygaz                        Turkey      0.2219      0.0521     30.70 Cukurova Elektrik            Turkey      0.3087      0.0679     28.22 Malaysian Airline System   Malaysia      2.4477      0.5220     27.11 Brisa                        Turkey      0.0949      0.0200     26.74 Kordosa                      Turkey      0.2605      0.0506     24.10 Bagfas                       Turkey      0.2315      0.0432     22.97  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

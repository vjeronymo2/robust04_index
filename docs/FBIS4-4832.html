			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Indochina correspondent Harish Mehta] </F>   [Text] It has been billed as Indochina's big-ticket  economic enterprise. Backed by Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and  Vietnam to harness the potential of the region's largest river,  the 4,350 km-long Mekong, the multi-billion dollar project will  ultimately create three large economic zones in the region's  most backward areas.    Should China and Myanmar [Burma] join in, the investments  flowing in is expected to turn into a flood.    The four Mekong countries envision the setting-up of the  Strategic Study Projects, comprising the three large economic  zones, along the course of the river and its tributaries that  flow through Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.    These zones will come alive with 11 hydroelectricity  generation plants, half a dozen harbours and bridges, and an  ambitious agriculture and irrigation programme to be cranked  into motion by multilateral loans.    But politics often got in the way of economics.    The future of the 37-year-old Mekong Committee -- a  four-country group that coordinates the development -- is in  jeopardy due to differences among the four.    The four dissolved the committee in December 1992 and agreed  to forge a new deal on sharing the river water. However, a  September 1993 deadline for setting up a new committee passed  without agreement being reached.    Thailand has now blocked Cambodia's bid to rejoin a new  Mekong Committee until a water-sharing pact is hammered out.    Cambodia, which quit the committee when the Khmer Rouge took  over the country in 1975, is however, supported by Vietnam and  Laos. Phnom Penh officials have repeatedly told Thailand not to  link the membership issue with the water sharing pact.    But Thailand, facing a severe drought, wants more freedom in  using water. However, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia would like the  four to reach prior consensus before any water is used.    Tie Limthong, deputy permanent secretary of the Cambodia  National Mekong Committee told BUSINESS TIMES [BT] this week:  "Cambodia has not yet been re-admitted to the Mekong Committee.  A date for the next committee meeting has not yet been set."    Other differences are over inclusion of China and Myanmar in  the Mekong Committee. Thailand recently proposed the inclusion  [of] both countries, but as the other three members were not  enthusiastic, the proposal was dropped for the time being.    Efforts to get the committee running are on, and a  breakthrough is expected. The committee's work has since been  carried out by an interim committee financially supported by the  United Nations.    In the face of this dithering, the well-fleshed out economic  zones will have to bide their time.    The first one, called the Upper Mekong Navigation zone lying  up-stream in the north, consists of Myanmar, Laos, and small  parts of Thailand, Vietnam, and China's Yunnan province.    The concept to build effective navigation and transport  systems on the river and its tributaries will benefit a wide  swathe from Jinghong in China's Yunnan province, down to Luang  Prabang in Laos, covering distance of about 700 km.    The Mekong Committee says that riverine and cross-border  trade between Laos, Thailand, China and Myanmar will increase  from the present annual level of 20,000 tonnes to over 250,000  tonnes in the year 2000 -- of which 210,000 tonnes are expected  to be transported on the Mekong River, and the remaining on its  tributaries such as Nam Ou in Laos.    To prevent bottlenecks from choking off the Mekong, the  committee plans an ambitious study.    Economic development in the zone was boosted with the recent  completion of a landmark 700 metre-long bridge over the Mekong  connecting the Lao capital of Vientiane with Thailand.    This makes it possible to drive from Singapore to China  across Malaysia, Thailand and Laos. The US$30 million (S$  [Singapore dollars] 47 million) bridge was funded by Australia.    However, Laos was cool to a Thai proposal to build a second  bridge over the Mekong. The Lao government told the Thais to  wait until the country's internal roads and telecommunications  had improved.    Landlocked Laos has also been eyeing prospects of trade with  the Chinese province of Yunnan. Both countries have opened a  river route to accommodate 150-tonne barges.    Cars from Thailand travel through Laos to markets in Yunnan,  and business is booming as middlemen en route take their cuts.    The Upper Mekong Navigation area is also the focus of a  major  road development programme. Last year, Thailand, Laos, Myanmar  and China agreed to set up transport links through the remote  Golden Triangle -- a move that will give the booming southern  Chinese provinces their first overland access to Southeast Asia.    A second economic zone is the Southern Lao Transport  Corridor  straddling southern Laos, northern Cambodia and central Vietnam.    The development rationale for this area is to provide  landlocked Laos with access roads to a seaport in Vietnam.    Lao Deputy Prime Minister Khamphoui Keoboualapha told BT  that  his country plans to build a deep seaport in Quang Binh in  central Vietnam, financed by a build-operate-and-transfer scheme  or multilateral loans.    The idea for a port and a road linking Laos with Vietnam was  first suggested several years ago by Laos' late president  Kaysone Phomvihan. Thailand entered the picture when former  Thai premier Chatchai Chunhawan adopted the concept as a way to  flesh out his policy of turning Indochinese battlefields into  marketplaces.    Thailand, too, is keen to build economic ties with Vietnam  and wants to extend a road from Thailand to Vietnam through  Laos. Under this plan, Laos would serve as a land-bridge for  Thailand to enter Vietnam.    The region is integrating ever closer with an agreement  between Thailand and Laos to build a road linking the  north-eastern Thai province of Ubon to the southern Lao province  of Champassak.    A third economic zone that goes by the name of Inland  Navigation Strategy stretches in a wide arc across Cambodia and  encompasses a small part of southern Vietnam.    The thrust is on improving river-borne transport of people  and cargo that is crucial to the predominantly agricultural  Cambodia economy.    Destroyed by the long civil war, the river's infrastructure  such as ports and bridges need urgent repair, and large parts of  the river are silted and need to be dredged.    By far the biggest investments are being drawn into building  electricity-generating plants in all three economic zones. As  many as 11 plants are to be built along the course of the Mekong  and its tributaries in Laos, Cambodia and Laos in addition to 11  existing plants.    The Mekong basin possesses a potential to generate 58,000 mw  [megawatts] of hydroelectricity. Studies show it would be  technically and economically feasible to harness about 37,000  mw. Of this amount, a mere 245 mw -- less than one per cent of  the basin's potential -- has been exploited through the  construction of 11 dams along the tributaries.    These include the Nam Pong and Lam Dom Noi in Thailand and  the largest, the Nam Ngum in Laos with an installed capacity of  150 mw -- 80 per cent of which is exported to Thailand.    Power projections in the lower Mekong basin show that demand  will rise three-fold from about 10,000 mw in 1990 to 24,000 mw  in 2000. Thailand will account for about 70 per cent of the  demand and require an additional power generation capacity of  about 1,000 mw a year from the year 2000 onwards.    To hook up the Mekong region, an integrated transmission  system is planned to link the river-based generating plants  which will be economically more attractive than either isolated  national grids or several parallel regional systems.    While this is still in the distant future, another regional  system is set to take off. Next week, Vietnam will be fully  linked with a new 1,500-km power line connecting the Hoa Binh  hydroelectric plant, 74 km north of Hanoi to Phu Lam in Ho Chi  Minh City.    The 500 kv [kilovolts] transmission line will supply 2.5  billion kwh [kilowatt hours] for Vietnam's southern cities.    While large projects are the order of the day, the Mekong  countries are also keen on micro-hydropower to accelerate rural  electrification.    Micro plants -- already operational in some Indochinese  countries -- are considered environmentally safe compared with  diesel generators which have mushroomed all over Cambodia and  Vietnam in order to beat the power shortage.    Micro plants, moreover, do no dislocate huge numbers of  people from their homes and their ecological impact is much  less. For instance, the 20 mw Nam Mae Kham power project in the  Thai part of the lower Mekong basin will enable the state to  reduce electricity generation by a diesel plant to help meet  demand in Chiang Rai which is just 40 km from the plant site, in  addition to supplying 5,000 farming families in the area.    It's a different story in Laos where mini-hydropower plants  supplying only the domestic market often turn out to be costly  as the power market to be served is small and the energy price  low in comparison to the investment.    Still, a 115 kv transmission line from Nam Ngum to Luang  Prabang is being planned as a first step to electrify remote  northern Laos.    But the line's full power-carrying capacity cannot be  utilised during the initial years of operation due to the small  domestic power market. However, by connecting various small  power plants to the line, the line can operate at full capacity  right from the start.    After Laos, Cambodia has the second-largest hydropower  potential of over 8,000 mw. At present, the country has a few  plants, each with a capacity of less than 10 mw and a combined  capacity of 85 mw.    Construction of some of Cambodia's projects, such as Prek  Thnaot dam, commenced in 1969 but stalled due to the war. The  process began again in 1989 but got bogged down in issues  relating to resettlement of some 11,000 people.    The Mekong projects also involve enormous river works such  as  rehabilitating Phnom Penh port which threatens to become a major  bottleneck in the water transport system if further expansion is  not carried out early.    All this must wait until the Mekong Committee gets its act  together.</p>

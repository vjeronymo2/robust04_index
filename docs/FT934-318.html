			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / An explosion on the edge of town: Retailing in eastern Germany has overtaken the west No matter from which direction you drive into eastern Germany's main cities, the landscape is unforgettable. It is not just the amount of work being carried out on the infrastructure, but also the extraordinary expansion of giant shopping centres, built on greenfield sites since unification. The explosion is understandable. Before 1989, retailing in eastern Germany was under-developed in choice and size - there were 0.3 square metres of retail outlets per person in eastern Germany, compared with west Germany's 1-1.2 sq m. The sector was monopolised by the Konsumgenossenschaft co-operatives which consisted of department stores, supermarkets and small outlets; and the Handelsorganisation, the state-run retail sector. After unification, both chains were broken up. Parts were sold, others were forced into liquidation as west German retailers rushed in. Eastern German consumers went on a spending spree. By 1993 the east had caught up with the west in terms of outlets. It had 2.6 shopping centres per million inhabitants, compared with 1.8 in western Germany. But the authorities in eastern Germany's main cities are beginning to question the benefits. Mr Ralph Kausch, of the Leipzig's branch of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, has no doubt who the losers are: 'The cities'. A struggle is taking place between the local councils, on whose land the shopping centres are based, and the city governments, who want to win back consumers. 'The shopping centres are chiselling away at the small retailers in the city,' says Mr Kausch. Compared with western Germany, where about 80 per cent of the large department stores/shopping centres are located in the inner cities, only 20 per cent are in eastern Germany. 'More importantly', continues Mr Kausch, 'we are losing out financially because we are not receiving tax from the turnover of the large stores.' He reckons Leipzig is being deprived of tax on an annual DM900m (Pounds 360m) turnover. It is a different story for the local councils, who receive the turnover tax. For example, the small council of Gunthersdorf, west of Leipzig, where the 100,000 sq m Saale Park shopping complex is located, is expecting the park to record a turnover of DM850m by 1995. Gunthersdorf has a population of 650. But why have cities such as Leipzig, Dresden and Berlin been unable to attract the retailers into their centres and can they reverse the trend? Retailers have stayed away because of exorbitant land prices and contested property rights, whereas out of town they have found available land, investment grants and no green lobbies or awkward planning regulations. Ms Irena Krause, a senior official at Leipzig's planning department, says that after the Berlin Wall came down, 'there was no clear definition of property rights in the cities. But title was uncomplicated in the countryside. Land was snapped up, often very cheaply, maybe for DM3m a square metre. The local councils wanted to be part of the boom. They pushed through planning permission and got new roads in return.' Mr Stefan Brendgen from Jones Lang Wootton, the UK property consultants, says retailers seeking land in the heart of east Berlin would have had to pay DM20,000-DM30,000 a sq m in 1992, the boom period. Because of these circumstances, Mr Cy Schluter, a retail analyst at CSFB in Frankfurt, believes that the retailing environment in the east is more advanced than in the west, where development has been hindered. 'The large retailers could see the advantages of opening up in eastern Germany and seized them.' But can the large shopping centres in eastern Germany continue to reap the benefits from an explosion in consumer spending? Next year Hornbach, the large home improvement department store, expects its four outlets in eastern Germany to account for a quarter of its total turnover, which last year exceeded DM750m, largely because more people are renovating their homes and the housing stock will soon be privatised. Other branches, however, may be vulnerable - the food industry for instance. 'They face the most competition. Supermarkets are badly located. They are not near the centre,' says Hornbach. The large retailers also face the prospect of a decline in consumer spending and lower purchasing power - incomes in eastern Germany are on average about 30 per cent lower than western German levels. The Cologne Institute for Economic Forecasting reckons that after annual average growth in private consumption of about 3.5 per cent between 1990 and 1992, the rate of growth has slowed to about 1 per cent this year and will be lower next year. The decline should still be less steep than in western Germany. But, as Mr Kausch says, 'it's hard to make any firm conclusions'. In eastern Germany retailing 'is still a moving target. But it is time the inner cities responded to these vast shopping complexes by making the centres more attractive to the consumer. That will take time. I hope we are not too late.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Following the continuation of the Serbian forces'  offensive on Maglaj, Alija Izetbegovic, president of the  Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, sent a letter to the chairman  of the UN Security Council, in which he says the following:    The Security Council's Resolution 900 is undoubtedly useful.  We believe that it will encourage the process of calming the  armed conflict throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina even more.  However, it has not yet protected Maglaj, which has been under  a siege for nine months and has been subjected to a general  offensive by the Serbian forces in the past month.    The aggressor is constantly increasing pressure by  introducing new weapons withdrawn from around Sarajevo. Several  tens of thousands of people in the besieged town will not be  able to put up resistance for much longer against the  technically incomparably much stronger attacker.    The situation is critical and requires an urgent action of  the Security Council. It is necessary to halt the attacks  immediately and send international observers and peacekeeping  troops to the besieged town. Otherwise, there will be another  genocide.    If the international community allows this to happen through  its passivity, all progress made in the past month would be  devalued. If, on the other hand, the tragedy of Maglaj is  prevented with a resolute action, this will give a new impetus  to the process of establishing peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Esteemed sir, I beg you that the Security Council  immediately  adopt a decision appropriate to the gravity of the situation.</p>

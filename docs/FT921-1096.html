			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Atomic agency orders Iraq to destroy N-site THE International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has ordered Iraq to start destroying facilities at the al-Atheer site south of Baghdad, a complex which the agency says is central to Iraq's efforts to develop a nuclear weapon. An IAEA-led team of United Nations inspectors will arrive in Baghdad on April 5 to supervise the dismantling, which will be among the biggest demolition jobs undertaken by UN teams overseeing Iraq's compliance with Gulf war ceasefire resolutions. Mr Maurizio Zifferero, who is leading the IAEA and UN nuclear inspection efforts in Iraq, said by telephone yesterday that 12 or more buildings and their contents will have to be destroyed of what he called 'the most important component in its development of an enriched uranium weapon'. The ordered destruction will be the most important test of Iraq's declared willingness to co-operate more fully with the UN after the dressing down received before the Security Council earlier this month by an Iraqi delegation led by Mr Tariq Aziz, the deputy prime minister. The order follows four days of talks between the IAEA and Iraqi experts in Vienna during which officials from the complex and the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission tried to persuade the agency that the al-Atheer site was used for civil purposes. But yesterday the agency issued a statement saying that it remains convinced that al-Atheer was 'designed for special processes needed for nuclear weapons development and manufacturing' and that its destruction should begin in April. Mr Zifferero said that despite the Iraqi officials' resistance to destroying al-Atheer, there were nevertheless signs of greater willingness to co-operate with the UN since Mr Aziz's appearance in New York. He also said that although the UN inspectors may still discover 'some surprises' in Iraq's nuclear weapons programme, he was confident that the largest part of Baghdad's covert nuclear programme had been identified. An Iraqi delegation will open talks with UN officials in Vienna tomorrow on the possible limited resumption of oil sales to help meet Iraq's humanitarian needs, pay for UN weapons inspectors in Iraq and offer some compensation for victims of the invasion of Kuwait. Iraq last year rejected a UN mechanism to permit the sale of Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 920m) worth of oil for these purposes on the ground that it violated the country's sovereignty. Most observers suggest that the latest round of talks are unlikely to provide any swift agreement by Iraq to resume oil sales. Iraqi officials have been quoted in recent days as saying they will not accept any mechanism which in its view interferes with its internal affairs.</p>

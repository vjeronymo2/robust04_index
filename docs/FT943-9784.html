			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Mid Kent accepts Ofwat price controls Mid Kent Holdings said price controls imposed on its Mid Kent Water subsidiary by Ofwat, the water industry's regulatory body, fell short of what it wanted but that it had decided to accept the limits. 'Although the K factors determined fall short of those considered desirable to fulfil services to customers described in our market plan, we have decided to accept the determination,' the directors said. 'It is inevitable, with the curtailment necessary in expenditure, that not all customer expectations identified in the plan will be met,' they added.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Cedras says he will not leave Haiti: US officials make contact with military junta's missing police chief Francois General Raoul Cedras, Haiti's military leader, has repeated that he will not leave the country after he steps down from power next month. He told CBS TV in a interview on Wednesday night that the Haitian constitution 'forbids exile' and that, in any case, the agreement reached with the US delegation headed by former President Jimmy Carter did not require it. However, US officials in Washington were able to report that contact had been established with the third member of the military junta - Col Michel Francois, the police chief, who was not a party to the Sunday agreement and whose whereabouts had been unknown. A senior US military officer had a 1 1/2 -hour meeting with Col Francois at police headquarters to discuss crowd control. This follows the violence used by Haitian police against crowds on Tuesday, and the arrival of 1,000 US military policemen on Wednesday. Although the US, and UN Resolution 940, which authorised a military operation to restore elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, called on the ruling army elite to resign and go into exile, few expected Gen Cedras would flee unless explicitly required to do so. Last Thursday President Bill Clinton had demanded in his TV address that Gen Cedras leave the country or face an invasion. But Mr Clinton has subsequently said it was sufficient that Gen Cedras and other military officers leave power - though adding that he expected them also to leave the country. Gen Cedras's decision to stay has bitterly disappointed Aristide supporters who hoped that the army generals and police chief, who usurped power in a 1991 coup and had ruled the country ruthlessly since then, would be eliminated with the arrival of US forces. But President Aristide himself late on Wednesday finally accepted the logic of the Sunday agreement, having withheld approval for nearly three days. The prospect of the continued presence of the junta in Haiti also increases the pressure on Haiti's parliament to pass an amnesty law in the next three weeks as required by the agreement. The military-backed Haitian government yesterday asked parliament to pass such a law. The government also said it would 'very soon' announce a timetable for votes to elect more than 2,000 senators, deputies, mayors and local officials. Meanwhile, as more and more US troops arrived and took to the streets of Haiti, military commanders in Port-au-Prince sought to clarify the rules of engagement for personnel on the ground. After several incidents of political violence in which US troops were ordered not to intervene, Mr Clinton declared that a repeat of Tuesday's violence 'cannot and will not be tolerated'. Defence Department officials said the safety of US servicemen would, however, remain paramount. As of yesterday morning the exact circumstances of such intervention were still being worked out. Ultimately, the decision was being left in the hands of individual US servicemen. 'People on the street must use his or her best judgment. In the end it is up to that individual soldier or sailor (to decide whether or not to) intervene,' a US army spokesman in Port-au-Prince said. The news that US soldiers were now ordered to protect people seemed to have been welcomed. In the streets by the docks, where business was brisk yesterday, Pierre, a former businessman now working as a driver, said things had already changed. 'I worked all night last night - I would not have done that before, I wouldn't have even gone out of my house. . . people are not afraid today.' At the US embassy, the mood was generally buoyant and the beginning of the US peace-keeping operation was viewed as a great success. 'Haiti today is better off than it was yesterday and better off yesterday than it was the day before,' said Mr Stanley Schrager, US embassy spokesman.</p>

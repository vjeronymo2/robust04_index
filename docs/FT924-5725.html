			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Attack disrupts production at Leeds Group One of the printing works of Leeds Group suffered an arson attack over the weekend and will be out of full production for several weeks, possibly until after Christmas. The attack was on Walsden Printing where three of the four printing machines were damaged. Repairs have already started and the undamaged one has already resumed production. Both Sharps and Strines, the other printing divisions, are working for Walsden, but there will be some disruption to Walsden deliveries and sales will be affected in November and December. Leeds is confident it is fully insured for the repairs and consequential loss.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Arts (Openings): Mantua The first exhibition to be devoted to the Renaissance genius Leon Battista Alberti opens at the Palazzo Te on Saturday. He not only left a legacy of marvellous buildings (two in Mantua), but his brilliant theoretical works on painting, sculpture and architecture put those arts on a par with literature and philosophy in the 15th century. The show includes computer-constructed scale models, drawings, miniatures and first editions, lent by American and European museums and private collections.</p>

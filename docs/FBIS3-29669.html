South Korea, however, cannot accept  them because of the position of North Korea and Russia, said the  official, adding that therefore the government is considering  other steps to cope with them, such as turning to the U.N. High  Commissioner for Refugees (HCR).    "Many of those North Korean loggers who escaped Siberia  logging yards had come in contact with the South Korean Embassy  in Moscow and Consulate General in Vladivostok for permission to  enter South Korea," he said. Those who contacted South Korean  missions in Russia reached 100 to 150 so far, he said.    The official said there are 16,000 to 20,000 North Korean  loggers in Pyongyang-run logging yards in Siberia, and hundreds  of them are known to have escaped the logging yards and been  roaming through Russia. He said that if Seoul accepted them, it  is apt to offend North Korea and that Russia, too, is not  interested in sending them to South Korea because of its  relations with North Korea.    "At the moment, the government is asking Russia to recognize  the escapees as international refugees and ensure their safety  and basic rights," the official said.</p>

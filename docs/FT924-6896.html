			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Nigerians ponder political uncertainty and economic crisis: Michael Holman analyses why the country is facing the most critical period in the 32 years since it became independent WITH a mixture of resignation and apprehension, Nigerians are preparing for one of the most critical periods in their country's turbulent 32-year post-independence history, beset by political uncertainty and gripped by a deepening economic crisis. No one was surprised when General Ibrahim Babangida announced on Monday that the presidential election due be held next month would be delayed until June. Presidential primaries last August had been marred by rigging and other electoral malpractices by both the Social Democratic party (SDP) and the National Republican Convention (NRC). But doubts surrounding the country's transition to civilian rule are unlikely to be set at rest by yesterday's decision. Both parties have to rebuild in the wake of the president's earlier decision to sack their executives, a task made more difficult by Monday's ban on all 23 presidential candidates from contesting the new round of primaries. Nor is it clear how the authorities will be able to eliminate the electoral fraud that seems endemic, judging by past polls in 1979 and 1983. For many Nigerians, a civilian government, whatever its credentials, remains the lesser of two evils. Hence the forthright warning from Olusegun Obasanjo, the retired general who led Nigeria's military government from 1976 to 1979 before handing over to a civilian administration, toppled in a 1983 coup. Stick to January, he urged Gen Babangida: 'Any prolongation of military rule  .will amount to war against the sovereign rights of people in Nigeria to choose their own leaders.' Yet a weak civilian government invites military intervention, and this remains uppermost in Gen Babangida's mind, say government officials. It may well be that he set himself an impossible task when he set about reforming Nigeria's political system. 'It will not be an overstatement,' an editorial in the Vanguard newspaper declared in 1986, soon after the launch of the transition programme, 'to say that Nigeria in all the years of her independent existence, has not even started to approximate the prerequisites for building a modern nation state.' 'Economically, unbearable poverty is still the highest common denominator. Politically, disorder has become the basic mode  .. Socially, we are bewildered by our own decay and morality  ..especially of the elite class.' In a laudable but ultimately impractical attempt to root out corruption in politics and override ethnic and religious allegiances, President Babangida imposed the SDP and the NRC on Nigerians. Their manifestos, written by civil servants, were broadly similar, committing the parties to the economic reform programme which Gen Babangida hoped would be the second part of his legacy to Nigeria. The programme, launched in 1986, has effectively lapsed. A further devaluation of the Naira last March appeared to signal a fresh start, but by mid-year it was clear that fiscal and monetary targets were not being met. A policy agreement with the IMF has not been renewed, and prospects of an early agreement are remote. The painful consequences is that one of the greatest single obstacles to economic recovery remains unresolved: Nigeria's crippling Dollars 30bn external debt. Last year, notes a recent World Bank report, debt service obligations totaled nearly Dollars 6bn, compared with export earnings of Dollars 12bn. The servicing burden was eased at the start of this year when the government implemented an agreement with commercial bank creditors. Some Dollars 3.3bn was converted under a cash buyback option, while the remaining Dollars 2bn was exchanged for collateralised bonds. While this significantly reduced the debt, it was of little comfort to the average Nigerian. After five years of the structural adjustment programme, external debt had risen from Dollars 19.6bn in 1985 to around Dollars 30bn today. The economic balance sheet has further disturbing figures. External debt servicing commitments on current projections will run at around Dollars 5bn a year for the rest of the 1990s. 'This is not compatible with any recovery programme,' said a senior donor official yesterday. 'Nigeria is a net exporter of capital - how can it revive its industrial sector or revive social services under these conditions?' 'Nigeria is now in a vicious cycle,' he continued. 'Mismanagement and corruption means that there will be no debt relief. But without debt relief, the economic crisis deepens, and the solutions become more difficult.' Even the most sympathetic of donors concede, however, that the statistics tell only part of the story. Much of the money borrowed during the boom years of the 1970s was squandered on projects either misconceived or mismanaged, invariably involving vast kickbacks. Far from obtaining a sound return on money invested in telecommunications or steel, these sectors are a liability - inefficient and costly drains on resources. Critics make a second point. Had Nigeria followed through with the reforms initiated in 1986, and kept to the terms of successive IMF agreements, the country would today be eligible for the so-called Trinidad terms. In theory around half of Nigeria's Dollars 17.8bn Paris Club debt could be written off. In practise,it would have proved less, for some of the Paris Club governments are less supportive of the terms than others. But Britain at least, Nigeria's largest official creditor, would have been willing to act. At the same time, Nigeria's drastic fall in per capita income from around Dollars 1,000 at the end of the 1970s (a figure distorted by an unrealistic exchange rate) to under Dollars 300 could have been cushioned. The country is eligible for concessionary borrowing from the IMF under the Fund's extended structural adjustment facility. But the essential precondition is IMF endorsement of economic policy. Now in his eighth year in office, Gen Babangida is presiding over a country in disarray. 'We want to go down in history as having staked our credibility on a viable and democratic workable third republic,' he told Nigerians on Monday night. History may well come to a different conclusion.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] State President F.W. de Klerk says the decision to  replace the defense force with the National Peacekeeping Force  [NPKF] in Thokoza was a mistake. On a radio talk show last  night President De Klerk said he had at one stage tried to stop  the deployment of the peacekeeping troops in the East Rand  township, but that it was then already too late. He said the  government and the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] should  take responsibility for the blunder.</p>

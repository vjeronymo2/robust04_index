			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Also, we believe that the implementation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS) fee schedule has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contributed largely to the increase in the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physicians participating in the Medicare program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nonparticipation is discouraged by the ``limiting charges''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed under physician payment reform.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We will continue to pay incentive bonuses to any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carrier that achieves an increase of at least one-tenth of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one percent in the participating physicians' rate or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proportion of payments for participating physicians'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services in the carrier's total service area. Carriers that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve an increase in physicians' participation or payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for participating physician services of less than 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage points will be paid a partial incentive payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Carriers that achieve an increase of at least 2 percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points, but less than 4 points, will be paid the full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incentive payment. Carriers that achieve an increase equal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to or greater than 4 percentage points will be paid a bonus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for each additional 2 percentage point increase over and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above the initial 2 percentage point increase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As required by section 1842(c)(1)(B) of the Act, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of the total incentive payable to carriers is one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the total payments to carriers for claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing costs for the fiscal year. The total incentive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pool is calculated by summing the total claims processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs reported by each carrier in fiscal year (FY) 1985 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiplying the total by one percent. The total claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing costs in that fiscal year amounted to $380  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> million. Therefore, carrier bonuses in FY 1995 will be one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of this amount or $3.8 million. Fiscal year 1985  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been used as a base because it reflects the claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing costs and workload at the inception of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating physician program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purpose of determining each carrier's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility for an incentive payment, we make two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparisons. We compare the carrier's physician  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation rate after the latest enrollment period with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the physician participation rate after the prior enrollment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date. We make a similar comparison of the proportion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered charges for services by participating physicians  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the quarter following the enrollment period with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those of the quarter following the prior enrollment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We intend to use whichever difference yields the higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage increase to determine eligibility for award of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the incentive payment. Currently, we issue carrier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incentive payments by September 30 following each annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrollment period. The amount of these payments will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in line 11 (other) of the carrier's Notice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Budget Approval, Form HCFA&hyph;1524.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Criteria and Standards_General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Basic tenets of the Medicare program are to pay claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promptly and accurately and to foster good beneficiary and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider relations. Contractors must administer the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare program efficiently and economically. We have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed a contractor management program for FY 1995 that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sets expectations for the contractor; measures the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance of the contractor; evaluates the performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against the expectations; and, takes appropriate contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action based upon evaluation of the contractor's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance. The goal of performance evaluation is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that contractors meet their contractual obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We measure contractor performance to ensure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following objectives are met: contractors do what is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required of them by law, regulation and HCFA directive; do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it well; and continually improve what they do. We have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restructured contractor evaluation into five criteria,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to meet those objectives. This restructuring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effort considered comments from HCFA components as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficiary and provider groups which have commented on past  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statements by People's Deputies Ihor Yukhnovskyy, Viktor </F> Pynzenyk, and Mykhaylo Kosiv, cofounders of the Nonparty  Professionals' Electoral Bloc "New Wave"]    [Excerpts] [Yukhnovskyy] [passage omitted] The Ukrainian  nation is facing the most crucial task -- building the state and  working for its benefit. It is easy to criticize government  activities, but it is difficult to assume leadership, rule the  state, make decisions, and foresee their consequences. This is  why small and big political parties should come together to  resolve these principal problems.    Take inflation, for example, the devaluation of the  Ukrainian  karbovanets, the unjustifiably high exchange rate of the U.S.  dollar and the Russian ruble. One of the sources of inflation  is the erroneous postulate that the former can be curbed by  restraining wages. It is only true in some cases, when wages  exceed a certain reasonable level. However, in Ukraine, the  situation is quite different. People's wages are so low that  their purchasing power in fact equals zero. People are losing  interest in work and discipline.    Can anything be done to alleviate the situation?  Undoubtedly, yes. This includes the functioning of customs  offices on all the borders, an increase in wages on the basis of  introducing a land tax, the introduction of a tax on the active  part of enterprises' capital stock. These measures must be  accompanied by the privatization of land and state property. Of  course, monthly wages should be increased to a certain  reasonable limit of say, $90. The next step toward curbing  inflation is regulation of the nation's banking system. The ban  on bank credits was a desperate measure and amounted to  acknowledging complete disability to run the financial system.  [passage omitted]    Overwhelmed by our domestic problems, we seldom speak of our  foreign policy. Unfortunately, the latter is conducted so  inadequately that Ukraine's rating in the world community is  very low. We are irresolute in our relations with Russia and  the newly independent states. This important aspect will also  depend on those who assume power.    Political contests sometimes resemble military drills and  children's games played by grown-ups. We should not look for  harsh words leading to political divisions within society. We  need an increase in mutual respect and trust on all levels.    We are standing on the threshold of elections. We should  rally around a centrist electoral bloc.    [Pynzenyk] A lot of people are asking the same question:  Can we overcome the crisis and halt the skyrocketing inflation?  Do we have experts capable of leading our state to prosperity?    I can give positive answers to all those questions. We have  every chance of exiting the current situation. Many people  believe that the latter is a result of reform. However, it is  the irresoluteness and inconsistency of reform, as well as  attempts to revert its progress that have caused the dramatic  deterioration of the situation, impoverishment, corruption,  embezzlements, and the flourishing of the shadow economy.    Two major factors are determining the critical situation in  Ukraine's economy: the leadership's lack of political will and  professionalism. The problem of drafting a program for putting  an end to the crisis does not exist. The problem lies in the  high echelons' will to implement this program. [passage omitted]    Unfortunately, time and again, we witness the mass  incompetence of officials entitled to make crucial decisions.  These people often hide behind beautiful phrases while, in  fact, only caring about their own personal well-being.    There are a lot of specialists in Ukraine ready to assume  responsibility for changes in people's lives. However, no  individual efforts can change the situation. There is the need  for a team of professionals enjoying appropriate  political support.    Only professional resolute measures can save the situation.  The experience of Poland, the Czech Republic, Latvia,  Lithuania, or Estonia proves that there is no option to such  measures.    Today, our people have a unique chance to create political  prerequisites for reform (through the legislative elections) and  to form (by means of the legislature) a professional government.    We are the masters of our fate and we have no right to pass  our hardships of today onto our children and grandchildren.    [Kosiv] [passage omitted] We are being ruled by Russified  turncoats who do not want to and never will consolidate  Ukrainian independence. They are doing everything to prevent  stabilization in production and banking, as well as to halt  reform. State functionaries, red managers' corps, and the  leadership of the agroindustrial complex use all available  mechanisms to prolong their control over national property,  because this property is easy to steal.    We do not have to invent anything special. The Baltics, for  example, were in a similar situation but they endured Russian  pressure, launched market processes, and set out upon the path  of civilized development. Will we be able to elect a Supreme  Council able to form a government of the independent Ukrainian  state?</p>

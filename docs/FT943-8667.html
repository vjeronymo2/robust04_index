			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Carsberg asks trade court to review net book agreement Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, has asked the restrictive practices court to review the net book agreement, one of the most controversial issues in British publishing. It is the first time in 30 years that the court has examined the NBA - an agreement between publishers preventing retailers from selling most books at less than the net price set by the publishers. Sir Bryan has taken evidence since last November from more than 100 publishers, booksellers, wholesalers, librarians and literary agents about the agreement, and has concluded that it operated against the public interest. He must now convince the court that there has been a 'material change' in the book market since it last reviewed the agreement in 1964. The Publishers Association said yesterday it was 'deeply disappointed' that Sir Bryan was putting the UK book retailing system at risk. The association said the majority of publishers believed the agreement helped them sell a wider range of books more effectively, and the agreement was vital to the survival of independent bookshops. The Booksellers Association, representing more than 90 per cent of book retailers, was 'surprised and dismayed' by Sir Bryan's decision. It said abolition of the NBA would lead to higher book prices overall and the closure of many shops. One large retailer, however, welcomed the review. Pentos, owner of the Dillons chain, has campaigned vociferously for abolition of the agreement. It argues that by preventing discounting, the NBA keeps the prices of books artificially high and limits the numbers sold. Dillons said removal of the agreement would lead to an improvement in publishing quality and in the public perception of the book trade, by allowing greater competition between booksellers. The Office of Fair Trading said the first court hearing was expected before the end of the year, but hearings could continue for some time.</p>

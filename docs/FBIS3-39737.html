			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has just given a  news conference after meeting leaders of the main political  parties in France to brief them on the situation in Bosnia.  Edouard Balladur:    [Begin Balladur recording] Since yesterday, we have been  able  to see that our firm stand, which we had called for, and which  was initiated by our country and our diplomacy, has been a  success. At the moment we speak, we can say that it was a  success. This does not necessarily mean that everything has  been solved, and many problems remain to be solved.  Nevertheless, our assessment of the situation at this stage  shows that the alliance's decision, acting within an  international mandate, has, for the most part, been respected.  Is this a definitive situation, is it a lasting situation? The  future will tell, but it is our duty to [words indistinct].    Our attention now turns to the follow-up to this action from  the point of view of a lasting solution to the problems of  Bosnia- Herzegovina. This first of all means a solution of the  situation in Sarajevo, with the restoration of free movement,  the lifting of the siege, and the international administration  of the city, which seems to many to be the only way of providing  a lasting solution to the problem. Second, it means the  solution of the problems facing a number of other towns or  regions in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which have been designated as  safe areas, and which sometimes have not been safe areas, and  where the situation remains unchanged. Finally, it means a  solution of the overall problem of Bosnia, in other words  progress towards a lasting peace.    You know that the European Union has drawn up a plan. This  plan is on the table. It is not a rigid plan, it can still be  debated, and we are quite prepared to discuss it with our  partners within whatever framework or organization. What is  essential is that, thanks to this action, we can gradually move  towards a solution of the situation in Bosnia. [end recording].</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / People: Spencer - trial run for academe One of the UK's best regarded economic commentators is moving to the academic world in a move which may set a new trend for City analysts who feel like a quieter life. After eight years in the City, Peter Spencer is taking over as professor of monetary economics at Strathclyde University for an initial two-year period. He will continue to work roughly a day a week at the Kleinwort Benson investment bank, where he has been chief economist since 1991 in charge of an eight-strong team. Spencer, 43, worked as an economist at Lehman Brothers and CS First Boston after entering the City in 1985, just before Big Bang, from a 13-year career at the Treasury. Spencer explains that the move, which will involve a 'large' drop in salary, is part of a long-term plan to give himself more time for serious economic research as opposed to serving up the kind of off-the-cuff comments on economics which City analysts are renowned for. 'I've never been quite sure if I am an academic or a City commentator and now I am trying to be a bit of both,' he says. Spencer admits he will not miss the high-pressure City environment in which clients and traders are increasingly quick to spot errors of judgment made by economists. He himself suffered last year in the aftermath of Britain's exit from the ERM because he had been one of the relatively few City commentators arguing right up to the event that sterling would not drop out of its fluctuation bands. Among Spencer's achievements has been his contributions to research on the 'divisia' measure of monetary growth - a field which some believe could provide a new way of monitoring economic fluctuations. In readiness for the move to academe, Spencer and his family have been saving a lot of his City salary rather than spending it, so he reckons the job switch will not be too financially onerous.</p>

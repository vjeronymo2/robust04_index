			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / North Yemen missile wounds 20 in Aden North Yemen's military forces, continuing to seek a military victory over their southern opponents, yesterday launched missile attacks on Aden in defiance of an overnight United Nations resolution calling for a ceasefire in the month-old civil war. Southern leaders, acknowledging the seriousness of the situation, repeated their appeals for international help to end the fighting. At dawn yesterday, hours after the UN issued its call for a ceasefire, northern forces fired two missiles at the city. One exploded over the Sheikh Othman district, wounding 20 worshippers at a mosque, while the other was brought down by southern anti-missile barrages, causing no injuries. Mr Abdul Rahman Ali Al-Jifri, vice-president of the breakaway south, condemned the attacks and appealed to the international community to bring more pressure on the north Yemeni leadership to stop the war. He acknowledged the south's position was serious and that the next 24-36 hours would be crucial in its fight against the north. Northern military units continued their ground advance on Aden, capturing the village of Sabir, about 8 miles from the outskirts of Aden. Other northern units, advancing eastward from Tur Al-Baha, were also reported to have arrived at Sabir and were poised for a final joint southward thrust to Aden. The sound of heavy explosions resounded through Aden as southern jets resumed bombing runs from the airport, attacking northern troops based at Zinjibar, about 45 miles east of Aden. Though bombed by northern jets nearly a month ago, Aden airport remains operational for military aircraft and has provided the backbone of the south's defence since hostilities began on April 27. Southern military officials said they still had air superiority over the north. The northern leadership has stepped up its drive against the south during the past week, aiming to achieve a military victory before international pressure can be brought to end the war. Apart from increased attacks on the military front, northern forces have also struck at civilian targets. Eight children were reported injured on Wednesday after a bombing raid on Aden by two northern jets aiming at an oil pipeline. The jets dropped Soviet-made bombs containing 30-40 smaller explosive canisters. Similar bombs loaded with nuts and bolts hit Aden a week ago, causing extensive civilian injuries, western observers said.</p>

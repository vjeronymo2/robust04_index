			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Arafat faces storm over self-rule jobs Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, is likely to face a storm of controversy among Palestinians in the occupied territories over his appointments to the Palestinian national authority almost immediately after he seals today's Palestinian self-rule agreement. Details of Mr Arafat's provisional list for the 24-member authority, which will govern the Gaza Strip and West Bank enclave of Jericho before elections due later this year and which will act as a de facto cabinet, reveal that he is determined to stack it with loyalists and members of the Palestinian diaspora. Palestinians who live in the occupied territories are critical of the agreement and deeply suspicious of their leaders who have lived in exile for several decades. The 'insiders' want a real slice of power in the self-rule authority. Officials of Mr Arafat's Fatah faction of the PLO have warned of a mutiny unless Mr Arafat includes many of the younger local leaders who emerged during the intifada - or uprising. However, according to senior PLO officials in Cairo and Jerusalem the authority, to be headed by Mr Arafat, will be largely drawn from outside the territories and from within Mr Arafat's loyal political factions. The list includes Mr Hakam Balawi, PLO ambassador to Tunis, who will be in charge of security; Mr Yassir Amr, a Jordan-based Fatah central committee member, to head the education department; Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo, a PLO executive committee member, to take charge of communications; Ibtisem al-Wazir (Umm Jihad), wife of the assassinated PLO's former number two Khalil al-Wazir (Abu Jihad), who will oversee women's issues; and Mr Ahmed Qurie (Abu Ala'a), a Fatah central committee member and Arafat loyalist, who will be finance 'minister'. The only two Palestinian 'insiders' are Mr Faisal al-Husseini, PLO leader in the West Bank, in charge of liaison with Israel and Mr Zakaria al-Agra, the PLO boss of the Gaza Strip. PLO officials say the list, which has been partially leaked in Jerusalem and Cairo, could be made public today. Other officials say the PLO is determined to wait until the Palestinian police force takes control of the self-rule areas before risking a backlash which the list may provoke.</p>

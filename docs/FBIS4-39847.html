			<p>BFN     [Text] Kirghiz [Kyrgyz] President Askar Akayev said in  Bishkek that the Russian exodus from Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan]  spelt catastrophe for both his republic and Russia, which was  unable to give roof to many thousands of its sons and daughters.    Akayev explained the emigration of ethnic Russians from  Kirghizia by the imperfection of the local economic reform which  cause a slump in the living standards and overall  disillusionment.    According to Akayev, 918,000 ethnic Russians lived in  Kirghizia back in 1990. They accounted for 21.2 percent of the  Republic's overall population. As of 1 April 1994, though,  there were some 750,000 ethnic Russians in Kirghizia. They made  up 17 percent of the overall population. In four years, Akayev  said, 170,000 Russians had left Kirghizia. That inflicted  irreparable damages on the Kirghiz economy.    Akayev agreed that the social and political problems, for  example the introduction of Kirghiz as the Republic's official  language, were largely to blame for the wave of emigration.  And, Akayev said, Russian-speaking entrepreneurs stood little  chance in Kirghizia, and discrimination against ethnic Russians  was, indeed, a fact of everyday life.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOES SEEK VETO OF EXEMPTION TO AIRPORT LAW  </P> <P> Opponents of a bill exempting Los Angeles County from a new law aimed at  controlling growth around California's airports are launching a last-ditch  effort to persuade Gov. George Deukmejian to veto the legislation.  </P> <P> Caltrans, the city of Los Angeles and an airport advisory panel plan to  recommend a veto of the bill, which is bound for Deukmejian's desk after  clearing the Assembly last week on a 51-18 vote.  </P> <P> The measure passed the Senate last month.  </P> <P> The bill, by state Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach), would exempt the  county from a 7-month-old law that puts teeth into statutes designed to ensure  that new development is compatible with the state's 269 airports.  </P> <P> Without the exemption, far-reaching regulations could be placed on development  near Los Angeles International Airport, as well as airports in other parts of  the county, including La Verne, El Monte and Burbank.  </P> <P> Supporters of the bill to exempt Los Angeles County from the law say the county  is special because the land around most of its airports is already densely  developed.  </P> <P> But foes of an exemption for Los Angeles County argue that regional airport  planning is needed to promote air safety and minimize the exposure of homes and  businesses to aircraft noise.  </P></p>

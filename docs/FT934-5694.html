			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / The Business Traveller: Tips on tipping at the table in London - Nicholas Lander offers an answer to a perennial riddle How big a tip should you leave in a UK restaurant? Many British diners are unsure and visitors from countries with fixed service charges are often completely bewildered. There is no uniformity to the service charges in UK restaurants. Restaurateurs offer a bewildering set of options at the bottom of their bills. These fall into four main categories: Prices include service and VAT. In the UK, all menu prices include VAT by law. But the phrase 'service and VAT included', the one most commonly used in the rest of Europe, usually appears only in hotel restaurants and coffee shops and the most expensive restaurants. Even in the latter, pay attention. One of London's finest restaurants, La Tante Claire, quotes service inclusive prices but then, when you pay with a credit card, incorporates the latter at the top of the slip but leaves the service box empty making it very easy for you to pay the service charge twice. This is an iniquitous habit that can prove very costly to the business traveller. A percentage called 'service' appears on the bottom of your bill. The percentage must be displayed on the menu (10, 12.5 or 15 per cent). This is an expensive system for the restaurateur because National Insurance contributions have to be paid on this additional amount. For this reason it is usually replaced by 'Optional service charge'. A misleading phrase because you are often left feeling that it is not optional at all. It has been criticised by the Department of Trade and Industry but is sadly only too common. 'Service charge is not included, gratuities at the customers' discretion'. This is the phrase used by a large number of restaurants and one that creates confusion and embarrassment for the customer. Whichever system is adopted, almost every UK restaurant today pools all tips and service charges and then shares them out on a points system (based on experience and ability) to the waiting staff via their wage packets. There is no advantage in leaving cash other than in small restaurants or as an extra appreciation of excellent service. Many restaurants are trying to raise the service charge to 15 per cent but this, unless the service is exceptional, is excessive. If service is optional, 12.5 per cent is an adequate reward for attentive service.</p>

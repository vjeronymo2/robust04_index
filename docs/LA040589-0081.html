			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WHO WON?;  </P> <P> NFL TEAMS UNSURE OF IMPACT AFTER FREE AGENCY  </P> <P> For the last two months, National Football League teams essentially have  swapped special teams players, which should make for some exciting kickoffs  next season.  </P> <P> Actually, the impact of this free agent activity -- the final count had 229 of  619 unconditional free agents changing teams -- is impossible to gauge until  play begins this fall. The Washington Redskins spent much time and money  (approximately $800,000 in signing bonuses) on the project, which ended at  midnight Saturday.  </P> <P> The Green Bay Packers signed a league-high 20 players, although a new 80-man  training camp limit means they might not have room for many upcoming draft  picks. Major cuts could come after minicamp. The Kansas City Chiefs signed 17  free agents, the Redskins 15 and Cleveland 14.  </P> <P> The Houston Oilers suffered a mass exodus, losing 15 players. "Have you ever  been hunting?" Oilers Coach Jerry Glanville asked. "Well, if they shoot a deer,  they take a knife out and gut him. We've been gutted."  </P> <P> Some teams grew disinterested. The Bears felt they shouldn't sign other teams'  loose baggage. The Bears and Bengals picked up no one, though Chicago did  deliver an offer sheet to Houston defensive end Ray Childress.  </P> <P> "The only winners," Bears personnel director Bill Tobin said, "are agents,  airlines, telephone companies and doctors."  </P> <P> Good doctors actually were a necessity, considering most of the unprotected  players were injured reserve types or hurt in some way. In Dallas, the Cowboys  seemed certain wide receiver Mike Sherrard's brittle leg -- broken twice --  would scare away interested teams and left him unprotected. Bet a San Francisco  physician reportedly passed Sherrard on a physical and advised the 49ers to  lure him. The final deal was close to $1.3 million over three years.  </P> <P> Regardless, there are those in the players' union who find this reckless free  agency to be a fraud, that the owners designed it to influence a Minneapolis  federal judge in an upcoming antitrust trial. And the union, to back its  argument, points out that protected players -- the prominent quarterbacks and  running backs in the league -- stayed put.  </P> <P> "You know," responded Giants General Manager George Young, "I can't understand  why the union is mad Dan Marino can't be more of a millionaire than he already  is."  </P> <P> Actually, owners might not have lost much money with these signings. By  reducing training camp rosters to 80, they're saving cash that was spent on  these free agents.  </P> <P> But was it advisable spending? According to sources, the two highest  unrestricted free-agent contracts went to nose tackle Bob Golic (from Cleveland  to the Raiders) and quarterback Gary Hogeboom (from Indianapolis to Phoenix).  Both reportedly will earn $600,000 next season.  </P> <P> In the NFC East, the activity varied.  </P> <P>  -- Washington Redskins: Of the 15 players signed, it's possible only one will  start -- punter Greg Horne. General Manager Bobby Beathard said last week he  only expects former Rams lineman Fred Stokes ($125,000 signing bonus) and  guard-tackle Ray Brown (formerly with Phoenix) to emerge as first-, second- and  third-down contributors. The rest are special teamers, though Beathard said he  hoped that tight end Mike Tice (Seattle) would bulk up and maybe play more.  </P> <P> The Redskins wouldn't mind fast development from two new cornerbacks, Martin  Mayhew (from Buffalo) and Eugene Profit (from New England). With cornerback  Darrell Green on the trading block and cornerback Brian Davis having a history  of injuries, both newcomers could find themselves in the thick of a New York  Giants game. Also, wide receiver Stevie Hobbs (from Kansas City) runs a  4.4-second 40-yard dash and could emerge as their kickoff and punt returner,  though he's tiny.  </P> <P> And why all the long snappers? The team has three -- Ralph Tamm (from the  Jets), Mike Morris (from Phoenix) and last year's starter, Dave Harbour. The  coaches want someone who can not only snap, but also play a position, and Tamm  and Morris have that capability. Harbour, meanwhile, wasn't big enough last  year to help out on the line, but this season he wants to try out as a blocking  tight end.  </P> <P>  -- New York Giants: -- At last report, they had signed only four-three  defensive players and a long snapper. One is safety Greg Cox from the 49ers,  and though he was merely a wedge-buster, Cox got $75,000 to sign and base  salaries in the $200,000 range. Nose tackle Jim Burt, like the Redskins' Russ  Grimm, turned down a substantial raise (from the Packers) and will be welcomed  back with a few other Giants who decided to stay put. "We'll take 'em all  back," Young said. "These guys don't have leprosy or anything."  </P> <P>  -- Phoenix Cardinals: They signed 11, the method being to tease players with  their warm weather. One signee was Reggie McKenzie (from the Raiders), brother  of the Redskins guard Raleigh McKenzie. Actually, the Redskins pursued Reggie  McKenzie, too, but didn't want to get in a bidding war because Raleigh McKenzie  is a protected free agent and about to negotiate a new deal. If Washington had  given a bundle to Reggie, starter Raleigh would've become more difficult to  sign.  </P> <P>  -- Philadelphia Eagles: Coach Buddy Ryan keeps handing his right outside  linebacker spot to ex-Bears. A year ago, Todd Bell converted from strong  safety, but got steamrolled. Now, Ryan has signed Al Harris from the Bears, and  Bell's back in the secondary. Ryan thinks the Bears were silly to use Harris as  a defensive end and predicts he'll be a stellar linebacker in Philadelphia.  Other signings (the Eagles had five) included speedy running back Mark Higgs  from Dallas and punt returner Henry Williams from Canada.  </P> <P>  -- Dallas Cowboys: New Coach Jimmy Johnson says he was too busy evaluating his  own players to see anyone else's. Of Dallas' five signings, two are ex-Redskins  -- center Eric Coyle and tight end Anthony Jones.  </P></p>

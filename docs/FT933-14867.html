			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / International Company News: Final Cray bonus tranche likely THE FINAL tranche of a share-option based incentive bonus package, worth in total between Pounds 25m and Pounds 35m, for the former chairman and three senior directors of Cray Electronics, is likely to be triggered tomorrow when the group announces its 1992-93 results. The complex three-part bonus package was approved by Cray shareholders in December 1989 when a new management team led by Sir Peter Michael, the former chairman of UEI, was installed after the company was widely criticised for its accounting policies and forced to revise its profits downwards. The four beneficiaries of the scheme are Sir Peter, who stepped down as chairman at the start of last month, his successor, Mr Roger Holland, Mr Jeff Harrison, finance director, and Mr Jon Richards, group managing director. Under the terms of the scheme, devised by SG Warburg, Cray's financial adviser, the four executives were entitled to subscribe for cut-price deferred convertible shares and deferred redeemable shares, depending on the group's share price and its financial performance measured by earnings per share. The share price has risen sharply over 12 months, closing at 161p on Friday, and results, boosted by disposals and timely acquisitions, have bounced back from a Pounds 2.79m pre-tax loss in 1989-90 to pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.5m in 1991-92. As a result the pre-conditions triggering the first two tranches of the incentive scheme have already been met. The size and value of the third tranche of share options depends upon the level of earnings in the year to April 30, and the share price at the time of conversion. The potential value of the share option incentive scheme raised some eyebrows at the time - one analyst said he was staggered by its size. However it was defended by Sir Peter who said the incentive was 'fair for a very difficult job,' given the risks.</p>

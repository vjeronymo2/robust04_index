			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPAN COULD BUY BRITISH JUMP-JETS  </P> <P> Japan has opened contacts with Britain and the United States over a possible  purchase of Harrier jump-jets to reinforce its air defenses, British air  industry sources said today.  </P> <P> They said Japan has approached British Aerospace and McDonnell Douglas about  the Harrier 2, which is being developed especially for use at sea and which is  a refinement of the original Harrier vertical-takeoff aircraft.  </P> <P> Japan is considering a number of planes, including the U.S. F-15, to protect  its sea lanes up to 1,000 miles from its shores. The aircraft would go into  service in the mid-1990s.  </P> <P> The British-designed Harrier can take off and land vertically, allowing it to  operate easily from large ships or small land bases.  </P></p>

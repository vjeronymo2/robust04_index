			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Travel: Galicia marches forward into the past - Is it celtic magic that makes this area of Spain refuse to become part of the present? Nicholas Woodsworth braves the elements as he tries to find out There is some strange power about on the damp, green, western-most edge of Europe. I am not a superstitious person. I will run a mile from mystics, astrologers, mistletoe-draped Druids or new agers. But enrobe me in mist on a sheep-cropped hillside, lash me with a couple of rain-driven Atlantic gales, then set me by a fire in a stone village with a bottle of something strong. In circumstances such as these, I am just about willing to admit that even in today's modern Europe, some old celtic magic is still at work. How else could you explain Galicia, a place that should not really exist? I can understand rain, moody introspection and an overbearing sense of the past in places further north. West-coast Ireland, the hills of Wales, remote villages in Brittany - all are natural homes for brooding spirits. But Spain? This is supposed to be the land of hot sun and exuberant passions. There are many superficial explanations for Galicia's special character. Some cite its remoteness and inaccessibility. It is a long way from the tourist costas and cut off from the rest of Spain by the Picos de Europa mountains. Others cite its under-development and rural 'backwardness', a word that sounds odd in forward-looking Europe until you run into your first Galician ox-drawn plough or solid wooden cartwheel. Still others put it down to the weather: the unending series of Atlantic squalls and storms that keeps the Galician hills lush and green year-round but discourages mass tourism, economic development and fiery temperaments. Whatever the reason, it is all as un-Spanish as you could imagine. I still say it is celtic magic. The celts arrived in Galicia in the 6th century BC, and have not let go since, despite Roman occupation, Visigoth invasion, Moorish marauding and Franco's fascism. It is perhaps not inappropriate that Francisco Franco was a Gallego. He shared the same values of devout catholicism, strong family ties and attachment to homeland as his countrymen. The old ways are still there, but Gallegos have fared better in post-Franco Spain. Today they can pursue their own strongly nationalist credo, speak their own language and ignore the rest of the country and the world precisely as they like. In fact, much of their considerable energy, as far as I can make out, goes into creating inertia. For no matter what politics Irish, Welsh, Breton and Gallego nationalists profess, celtic blood will out. Their ancient race will continue to march forward into the past, towards history, often bloody and tragic, and towards a soulful, collective tribal memory. Even the casual visitor will see age-old forces at work, a tug-of-war in which tiny Galicia is pulling itself away from a homogenised Euro-future. Further, it is winning. The howling wind that blew rain horizontally into Cape Finisterre was too much for me, and I retreated from my lonely cliff-top post overlooking the sea. Finisterre - literally, the end of the earth - is the western-most point of continental Europe, and takes the full force of the Atlantic on its jutting chin. Its lighthouse was not yet lit as I made my way along the Costa do Morte, the coast of death, to the shelter of the fishing port of Camarinas. Only the suicidal would venture out to sea in such weather, and the harbour was full of boats. But the village itself, in early evening, seemed dead as well. There was not a soul in its streets, bars or shops. Even finding a place to stay was difficult. Here on the wild and storm-battered northern rias (drowned river valleys) provisions for tourists are rarer than they are in the warmer, more protected ones to the south. But in the Hotel Plaza, a homey place where the elderly proprietors made space for me by their sitting room fireplace, I solved a mystery. The entire population was attending a street carnival up at the church to celebrate the coming feast-day of the village's patron saint, San Xurxe - Saint George to you and me. I wandered over to see how Gallegos let loose. On the way, I noticed what a mish-mash of a village Camarinas was. Gallegos have traditionally built with the slate and grey granite of the hills that surround them. Even the crops so laboriously produced with plough and scythe and sickle are stored in granite. All over the village were vast hand-hewn horreos, oblong grain silos with peaked roofs, perched 6ft above the ground on mushroom-shaped stone piles. Invariably topped with stone crosses, these bizarre and ancient constructions lend an unworldly air to the Galician countryside. But Gallegos have failed to grasp the aesthetics of contemporary building. In the post-Franco years easy credit brought a construction boom to a people who had lived the same way in the same houses for hundreds of years. Gallegos used concrete the same way they used stone. The result is fairly messy. The street up to the Camarinas church was a hodge-podge of rough, unpainted, concrete-slab houses, road-side heaps of straw and manure, fields of cabbages, impromptu car parks, horreos with washing drying beneath them, and a couple of empty bars with televisions blaring away. An innovative village festival committee had hired a rock group from a distant city and the band was doing its best to pretend it was still in the 20th century. But it was getting little encouragement from the villagers. Coloured lights, wailing guitars, tight leather trousers, smoke-machines - nothing seemed to raise a reaction from the inhabitants of Camarinas. Hands in pockets, berets pulled over weathered faces, the villagers stood in the street staring impassively at the temporary stage as the rockers went into wilder and ever more desperate displays of abandon. Song followed song; there was not a hand-clap, not a cheer, not a smile of amusement or derision. It ended, mercifully, in a sudden downpour. The crowds ran for cover, the stage lights flickered and speakers crackled as water invaded the makeshift wiring. There was a last pathetic wail, a crash of static, and all was plunged into darkness and silence. Enthusiasm ran high, though, with the advent next morning of a more solemn and traditional celebration. I woke to the sound of lugubrious music and opened the window to a cloudy sky and a brass band in threadbare blue uniforms winding its way through the streets. Hard on its heels came a traditional Galician band, with the same mournful drone played on the same bagpipes you can hear in Scotland. The celts were never great ones for innovation. After circling the town a number of times, stopping on each circuit for a quick round at the harbour-side bar, the bands returned to the church. The entire village filed inside, the men in their sombre Sunday best climbing to an upper gallery, the women and children in the pews below. Even here the miracle of modern technology failed to adapt itself to Galician life. Failing to master the hand-held remote control unit that switched on and off the mass's recorded music, the priest behind the altar found himself with an organ cantata on the rampage. But after mass the plaster statue of Saint George, complete with horse and fiery dragon, was hoisted to the shoulders of four village stalwarts. Three times around the church they went, followed slowly by the congregation and the village's collection of stray dogs. The wind blew, the rain fell, church bells pealed, rockets were fired into the air with great explosive bangs, and the bands played on. It was magnificent. I did not stay for further celebrations of tribal bonding, but took advantage of a break in the weather to drive out to Cape Vilain on the far side of Camarinas for a picnic. At the end of the cape I discovered a wind farm, 25 towers supporting 25 vast propellers whirling and moaning ceaselessly in the wind. They were as impressive in their way as the ancient horreos scattered about. Perhaps the wine I had with lunch was stronger than I imagined. Or perhaps I was coming under a Galician spell. As I lay on the rocks looking up at the towers, a curious idea came into my head. What, I wondered, if this wind farm were some enormous celtic deception  - not generating power at all, but, by the steady turning of its propellers, a device intended to pull Galicia imperceptibly further out into the Atlantic, away from the modern continent of Europe. It might take 1,000 years or so, but what is that to the celts?</p>

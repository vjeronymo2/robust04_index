			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Letter: Promotion of science beyond the media circus Sir, Your leader writer ('How to advance British science', August 28) is right to diagnose the task of expounding the scientific view of our world as too important and pervasive to encapsulate in one week's media circus each year, of the kind that traditionally accompanies the meeting of the British Association. The need to explain the world we inhabit is great, and our efforts to do so are continuous, but I am sorry that you succumb to the view that what is not universally visible in the media does not take place. In particular, your leader writer's remarks do less than justice to an extensive and successful programme of lectures, master classes and teachers' workshops that fill our historic Lecture Theatre nearly every weekday throughout the school year. Since last autumn some 20,000 young people have had the chance to watch experiments and hear accounts of subjects as diverse as electric sparks and the movements in the earth's crust. As to co-operation between the Royal Institution and the British Association, you need look no further than the contribution that we have traditionally made to the BA meeting itself in the form of a repeat performance of one of our celebrated discourses; this year the show put on by Michael and Wendy Gluyas on sound and music was a highlight of the week in Southampton, with 100 or so people being turned away from the door. The RI and the BA co-operate closely, both in organising their own activities and in contributing, with the Royal Society, to the work of the Committee on Public Understanding of Science (COPUS). What we do is in many respects complementary. Whether the over-riding cause that we both serve - of bringing the public to awareness of the power and limits of science as a way of making sense of our world - is best served in unity or diversity, is something we will both continue to keep in review. Professor Peter Day, The Royal Institution of Great Britain, 21 Albemarle Street, London W1X 4BS</p>

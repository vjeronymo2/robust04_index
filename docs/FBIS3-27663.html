Mustafizur Rahman hosted a banquet on Thursday  [24 February] evening in honor of the visiting Chinese  Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen .    Qian Qichen arrived here on Thursday at 14:00 for a four-day  official goodwill visit to this South Asian country. Bangladesh  is the second leg of his five-country tour including Pakistan,  Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Iran.    At the welcoming banquet, the Bangladesh foreign minister  said, "China is a valuable friend of Bangladesh. We cherish  this friendship."    The Bangladesh foreign minister praised China in its  modernizing drive and economic reforms. He believed China will  play an increasingly important role in global trade and economic  relations.    The Bangladesh foreign minister also briefed Chinese guests  on the ongoing market-oriented economic reforms and  poverty-alleviation efforts in his country.    In his speech, the Chinese vice-premier said, "Under the  personal care of the leaders of our two countries, the two sides  are carrying out fruitful cooperation in the economic, trade,  scientific and technological, cultural and other fields and have  supported each other and cooperated closely in international  affairs."    Qian said that developing countries should strengthen  coordination and cooperation to preserve peace and stability,  promote common economic growth so as to establish a new  international political and economic order.    Qian also praised Bangladesh for its unremitting efforts in  promoting good-neighborly and friendly relations among the SAARC  [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation] countries and  in enhancing regional cooperation.    Qian described the recent allegations about the so-called  "China threat" and even China's expansion into the Indian Ocean  as absurd and utterly groundless. "We have made it clear on  many occasions that China unswervingly pursues an independent  foreign policy of peace and will never seek hegemony," he said.    He stressed, "China is and will remain a force for  preserving  world peace and stability."</p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / KIO set to change investment strategy THE KUWAIT Investment Office is changing the mix of its investments having been left with an 'unbalanced portfolio' after the crisis sale of around half its assets following the Gulf war. According to a financier with a close knowledge of the KIO - which has between Dollars 30bn and Dollars 35bn (Pounds 18.3bn) under management, down from a peak twice as great before the Gulf war - the London-based body is also returning to a policy of becoming a more passive investor in companies. In the 1980s, the KIO was known as an aggressive purchaser of big strategic stakes in politically sensitive companies, such as BP, the UK oil company, and Midland Bank. The fund has become reluctant to exceed the 3 per cent level of equity investment at which an interest in any quoted UK company must be disclosed, unless the investment is regarded as an outstanding prospect. The financier said the pressure on the KIO to remit funds for the rebuilding of Kuwait has eased. On the other hand, the fund does not expect to receive new injections of funds from the Gulf for at least a year. The sell-off of investments in the past year is understood to have left the KIO with an inappropriate mix of assets. It is now turning its attention to 'rebalancing' its remaining investments. Large new investment funds will not be available to the KIO until Kuwait's oil production has returned to its pre-war level of 1.5m barrels a day - a target the government is confident of reaching early next year. It is understood that Mr Ali Rashaid Al-Bader, the KIO's new president, will oversee a relatively cautious investment strategy and avoid high-profile investment manoeuvres. Current management is understood to be keen to avoid initiatives such as Ercros, the Spanish chemicals group in which the KIO holds a 39 per cent stake. The KIO has been drawn into complex negotiations to rescue the group. But indications that the KIO is preparing to pump more money into Ercros support the view that it is not about to extricate itself from Spain altogether. Nor is it expected in the short term to offload large publicly disclosed equity interests such as its 9.9 per cent stake in BP.</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> DOUBLE TROUBLE: Two of our fave-rave guitarists are Stevie Ray Vaughn and Jeff  Beck. So imagine our delight to hear that the rock hot-rods (who are both  signed to Epic Records) have teamed up for a 25-city tour, beginning Oct. 25 in  Minneapolis. The duo (who are expected to do an L.A. date in early December)  will alternate as headliners -- and it's very possible that they'll be jamming  together at the end of each show. . . . Linda Ronstadt's new "Cry Like a  Rainstorm . . ." album features (count 'em) four new Jimmy Webb songs,  including "I Keep it Hid" and "Shattered." . . . If you haven't seen the new  issue of Hits Magazine, open it -- and keep opening it -- to find a special  three-page nude centerfold photo of Capitol promo chief John Fagot. Labeled  Hits Magazine's "Airplay Mate 1989," Fagot is pictured reclining on a couch,  with a rose in one hand and a phone -- a promo man's No. 1 weapon -- in the  other. Asked to describe Fagot's physique, Hits editor Lenny Beer quipped: "How  do you feel about whales?" . . . And Rhino Records (the Westwood Boulevard  record store, not the label) is touting its "Grand Opening Expansion"  celebration with a series of wacky discount specials (You already missed  "Mediocre Student Day" where co-eds with C-level or below report cards received  a free bargain-bin album). Coming Tuesday is an event guaranteed to raise  hackles at most record companies: "Home Taping Day," when blank cassettes will  sell at a 20% discount. (Rhino is also hosting in-store live concerts,  including one on Thursday at 8 p.m. by Dave Alvin).  </P></p>

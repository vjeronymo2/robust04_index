			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Japanese parties 'within days' of tax reform deal Officials of the three parties in Japan's coalition government last night said they were within days of unblocking a long-standing deadlock over controversial tax reforms. They are aiming to reach an outline accord, by today or tomorrow, to extend this year's Y5,500bn (Pounds 35bn) income tax cut to next year and make a permanent cut of Y3,500bn thereafter, said officials. Coalition members were also moving towards increasing the unpopular 3 per cent sales tax by an unspecified amount in April 1997. The government was hoping to release its tax package yesterday, but was held up by the Social Democratic party's continued reluctance to accept any rise in sales tax. The SDP, many of whose members were elected last year on a promise to scrap sales tax, yesterday agreed to leave a final decision to Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the party leader and prime minister. The final details, closely watched by an anxious US government, will have a critical influence on domestic demand, just as Japan is at the early stage of a tentative, consumer spending led economic recovery. This is the biggest test of the unity of the coalition of conservatives and socialists since it took power at the end of June. Mr Lawrence Summers, US treasury undersecretary for international affairs, yesterday urged Japan to ensure 'there is no premature withdrawal of fiscal support for recovery'. Japan had failed to carry out its promise to deregulate, to create an economy driven by consumption and demand, he said. 'There is not enough strength in demand to dispel caution about the outlook,' said Mr Summers, a view likely to be confirmed with today's publication of Japan's gross domestic product for the second quarter to June. Washington wants the rise in sales tax to be delayed as long as possible, to give full scope for domestic demand for imports to reduce the huge trade surplus. The tax package will therefore influence the US stance on whether to impose economic sanctions on Japan, a decision due in 10 days' time, the deadline for an elusive US-Japan trade accord. A divided Japanese government last year agreed a one-off Y5,500bn tax cut for 1994, pending further debate on a rise in consumption tax, sought by the finance ministry, which is eager to bolster its declining tax revenue. Another factor in the delay has been the insistence of the New Harbinger party, the smallest member of the coalition, that any rise on sales tax must be accompanied by cuts in spending on government administration. Not surprisingly, civil servants have resisted the NHP's plan, the latest round in a long power struggle between politicians and the bureaucracy.</p>

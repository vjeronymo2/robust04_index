			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Marek Borowski, deputy prime minister and minister  of finance, has tendered his resignation from the post he holds.  This ensued after the prime minister did not accept the proposal  of the deputy prime minister regarding, above all, a clear  outline of the division of prerogatives within the government.    Marek Borowski, justifying his decision, said that the  so-called Deputy Finance Stefan Kawalec affair ought to be seen  in a wider context, which is made up of many statements by the  prime minister. In the view of Marek Borowski, they undermine  his activity as deputy prime minister. Marek Borowski viewed  the statements of the prime minister as a particular vote of no  confidence.    We still do not know if Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak has  accepted Marek Borowski's resignation.</p>

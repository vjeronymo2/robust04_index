No, don't be facetious, there wasn't any television in 1890. The answer, of course, is 1993: the schedule is today's. As so often in the summer radio is a better bet. That burgeoning broadcaster Neil Kinnock presents Pick Of The Week on Radio 4 (7.20). Radio 3 provides a live relay of tonight's BBC Prom in which the Austro-Hungarian Haydn Orchestra makes its Prom debut. Naturally enough they play a good deal of Haydn: the chorus from his oratorio 'The Return Of Tobias', the short cantata 'The Storm', and Symphony No 97 in C (7.30). In Science Now Alun Lewis reports on the annual meeting of the British Association For The Advancement Of Science (8.50 Radio 4). Channel 4 begins another run of Paul Merton - The Series with the star of 'Have I Got News For You' once again installed behind the counter of his kiosk (10.30).</p>

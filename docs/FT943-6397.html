			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Incomes on the rise in US Personal incomes in the US rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent in July, the sixth straight monthly increase, outstripping the 0.2 per cent increase in consumer spending, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Income after taxes also rose 0.5 per cent. The increases follow a rise of 0.1 per cent in June income and disposable income. Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased by 0.2 per cent in July, coming after a revised 0.5 per cent rise the previous month. The July figures for income and spending were generally in line with analysts' forecasts and show the economy is growing at a moderate pace. The savings rate, which represents savings as a percentage of disposable income, rose to 4.1 per cent in July from 3.7 per cent in June. Wages and salaries, a component of income closely watched by the markets for signs of inflationary pressure, also rose 0.5 per cent. The PCE deflator index, an inflation measure, rose to 129.7 in July from 129.2 in June.</p>

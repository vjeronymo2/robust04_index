			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Food: I dined on garlic - Eating in France FINDING MYSELF alone in Aix-en-Provence, I booked dinner at the Clos de la Violette (Tel: 43.23.30.71). It is reckoned to be the city's best restaurant and I have no reason to argue with this view; until now my experience of eating in Provence's prettiest city has been worse than dire. The central theme of the menu terroir (regional menu) was garlic: first there was ravioli filled with brousse (ricotta-like curd cheese) and garlic and accompanied by snails fried in garlic; then there was a slab of salt cod served on a bed of garlic puree; next came little lamb trotters stuffed with garlic served with a quite superb potato puree made with olive oil and poured into a tulip of potato crisp. Three courses of garlic. I thought; how are they going to manage to get garlic into the cheese? Where there's a will there's a way: the 'opus' of brousse was crammed full of it, and there was no point in turning to the salad for relief - that too had been treated. The desserts, I should add, were garlic-free. Fortunately I like garlic; anyone who does not should stay well clear of Provence. I like Aix, too. The next morning, exhaling similar air to the other inhabitants of the city, I took a stroll around the old market by the town hall. Stalls had sprung to life after the short winter recess. There were the usual piles of Provencal vegetables and mounds of white asparagus from the Card. A punnet of local strawberries cost me 50p. In the cheese shops were mounds of brousse. A local fishmonger was telling a housewife how a slab of conger eel would enhance her bourride, or fish soup. Fish soup is rather more a feature of the coast. I am a coward when it comes to Marseille and have often foregone the pleasure of an authentic bouillabaisse in order to get clear of the port as quickly as I might. Up the coast from Marseille I ate a good fish soup at the Auberge du Port in Bandol (Tel: 94.29. 42.63), it was accompanied by the usual rouille (a liaison of chilli peppers, garlic, potatoes and olive oil), a bowl of grated cheese and small pieces of toast. In theory you put the cheese and rouille on top of the toast and pour the saffron-scented soup over. In the Auberge du Port the soup was already in the bowl and the only solution was to float little boats of rouille on the surface. I am told that one of the pleasures of life in Marseille is that you can buy sea urchins from street vendors. I adore sea urchins - a delicacy unknown in Britain. Lunching near Bandol one day, I sat with my host while he prepared 50 or so for the table. Using an instrument which looked like a cross between a pair of forceps and garden shears, he cut the molluscs in two; the bit you eat is the star-shaped orange 'coral': the urchin's genitalia. Sea-urchins are not expensive: in Aix they were selling for about Pounds 1.50 a dozen. The country between Marseille and Toulon produces a lot of strong red wines which marry unhappily with the predominantly fish diet of the coast. In most cases restaurants recommend roses, which have the ability to deal with the spiciness of a fish soup or bouillabaisse. Another solution is to cook the fish in red wine. At La Hostellerie Be'rard (94.90.11.43) in the unspoilt village of La Cadiere d'Azur, just behind the coast, they prepare an old recipe for salt cod cooked in a reduction of fish stock and strong, inky-black local wine. The same wine accompanies the fish like a dream. Just across the valley from la Cadiere is le Castellet and the Michelin-starred Castel Lumiere (94.32.62.20). Here Bouzigues oysters are wrapped in spinach and quickly poached. A main course was local lamb wrapped in a packet of flaky pastry with nutmeg. The local lamb presents something of a problem for the uninitiated. Caught on the hop immediately after shearing, you can be forgiven for mistaking Provencal sheep for goats. Their flesh too, whiter than most lamb, has a gamey, muttony character which is light years away from West Country or Welsh lamb. Lamb as pungent as this requires a different treatment: garlic in the majority of cases. Although kid is popular at Easter, goats are generally bred for milk rather than meat. The best brousse will be made from goats' milk, although a lot of cows' milk brousse has become available. Goats are also responsible for Provence's only exported cheese: the Banon. Banons can be creamy or hard and are generally recognisable by the alcohol-soaked chestnut leaves they are wrapped in to keep them moist. Some Banons are scented with savory giving them a faint aroma of the Provencal garrigue, the herb-covered hillsides of the south.</p>

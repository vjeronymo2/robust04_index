			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Congress gets ready to prescribe drugs price curbs: Pressures for change encompassed in President Clinton's plans for healthcare reform Congressional pressure for stricter curbs on prescription drug prices is building as detailed debate gets under way on the Clinton healthcare reform plan. Members of Congress are marshalling reports and statistics to show that pharmaceutical companies continue to charge more for their products in the US than in other countries, and that drug prices continue to rise faster than inflation. Last week, Senator David Pryor, a persistent critic of the pharmaceutical industry, produced a study by Democratic staff members of the Senate special committee on ageing, which he chairs, showing that although wholesale drug price rises slowed down last year, averaging only 3.1 per cent compared with 6.4 per cent in 1992, they still far outstripped the overall rate of inflation for manufactured goods. And Congressman Henry Waxman, chairman of the House of Representatives subcommittee on health and the environment, released a report by the General Accounting Office showing that the most commonly prescribed drugs cost 60 per cent more in the US than in the UK. The GAO report examined wholesale prices for 77 drugs sold by the same manufacturer in both countries, and found that only 11 were cheaper in the US, while 47 cost more than twice as much in the US as in the UK. While the most commonly prescribed drug in the study, Beecham's Amoxil antibiotic, cost 40 per cent less in the US, other top sellers such as Wyeth-Ayerst's Premarin, Burroughs Wellcome's Lanoxin and Upjohn's Xanax all cost well over twice as much in the US. 'Beyond any doubt, the US is substantially subsidising low drug prices in the rest of the world,' Mr Waxman said, urging examination of the British system for controlling drug prices. Pharmaceutical companies sprang to defend themselves with their own barrage of studies. The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association released a report by Mr Thomas McLaughlin of Harvard University which found only 'slight price variations' between the US, Canada, Germany and the UK, and warned of the difficulties involved in such comparisons. A separate study of prices for cardiovascular drugs conducted by Professor Patricia Danzon, a health economist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, found prices were slightly lower in the US than in Canada and Japan but higher than in most of Europe. Prof Danzon warned that looking at the top-selling brand-name drugs tended to bias international comparisons against the US, where such products are often more expensive, and that most studies had failed to take proper account of the availability of generic alternatives, as well as of rebates and discounts to bulk buyers. The Clinton health plan, which would require health insurance plans to cover prescription drugs, would also oblige pharmaceutical companies to offer a 17 per cent rebate to Medicare, the government-run system that provides health coverage to the elderly, with an additional rebate if their prices rise faster than the consumer price index. With healthcare reform legislation now starting to pick up speed in Congress, members who want even tougher controls on drug prices are likely to seek to add their own amendments to the bill. 'The train is about to leave the station and the train is healthcare reform. I want to get on that train,' said Senator Pryor.</p>

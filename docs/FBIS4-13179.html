			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Lebanon Hints at Severing Relations </F> With Iraq"]    [Excerpts] London-Beirut-Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT --  Yesterday the Lebanese Government officially requested that Iraq  lift the immunity of Iraqi diplomats Khalid Kahalaf and Muhammad  Kazim, who are accused of assassinating Iraqi oppositionist  Talib Suhayl in Beirut the day before yesterday evening. It  also turned down a request submitted by the Iraqi Embassy in  Beirut that the two detained diplomats be released, saying that  they are under "guard" for their own safety and investigation  requirements. [passage omitted]    Official Lebanese sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday  that, if the Lebanese Government receives a negative response to  its request that the immunity of the two detained diplomats be  lifted and that the third man accused of the crime be handed  over, it could decide to sever diplomatic relations with Baghdad.    The sources added that a decision would be made after  consultation with Charge D'Affaires Sa'd Zakhya, the only  Lebanese diplomat in Baghdad, who was summoned by the Lebanese  Foreign Ministry for "consultation." The Lebanese sources added  that, if Baghdad refuses to lift the immunity of the detained  culture and trade attaches, they would be declared persona non  grata and expelled from Lebanese territory.

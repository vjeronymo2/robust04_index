			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Services to Older Individuals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State set-aside program for older workers was incorporated into section 204(d) of the Act. Requirements for the older workers program are set forth in &sect;628.320 of the interim final rule. The Governor continues to be responsible for carrying out these programs pursuant to agreements with public agencies, PIC's, SDA's, non-profits or private businesses. The Amendments require that, in entering into these agreements, the Governor is to give priority to organizations which have a record of demonstrated effectiveness in serving older individuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the development of the final rule, the Older Americans Act was amended by Public Law 103&hyph;171 to revise the eligibility criteria as they pertain to older workers served in JTPA programs. It provides, as had been the case for the regular title II program (and as is reflected at &sect;628.605(e) of this rule), that older individuals participating in joint programs with sponsors under title V of the Older Americans Act who are eligible under title V are deemed to satisfy the requirements of section 203(a) of the Act. A new paragraph (d)(2) is added to &sect;628.320 to reflect this amendment. It is important to recognize that a purpose of the Older Americans Act Amendments is to enable Senior Community Service Employment Program participants who are in joint programs to participate in JTPA activities. In response to questions concerning the nature of an agreement for a joint program between JTPA and the title V program sponsor, the Department notes that, for purposes of both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;628.320(d)(2) and 628.605(e), the written agreement that sets forth the joint program should be structured so that both the JTPA and the title V program provide services to participants consistent with the objective of the participant and the resources of the participating program. For JTPA participants, services will be provided under the ISS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters were concerned that the inclusion of Social Security and Supplemental Security Income in the definition of ``family income'' severely limits the number of older individuals who are eligible for the program. This issue is addressed under the definition of ``family income'' in &sect;626.5 of the final rule. The revised definition clarifies the treatment of Social Security income and that Supplemental Security Income is not considered in the calculation of family income. No change is made in this section of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters recommended the removal of limitations on job search assistance in &sect;628.535 as they might apply to older workers. Job search assistance, including the application of the job search limitation restrictions as they apply to older workers, is covered in the discussion of the job search limitations under &sect;628.535 elsewhere in this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters recommended that the Department define ``equitable basis'' as it relates to fund availability for older worker services. The Department's view is that the definition of ``equitable basis'' will vary from State to State based upon local circumstances and, therefore, the Governor should determine the basis upon which funds will be distributed, taking into account the population of eligible older workers, their distribution throughout the State, and the availability of resources for this population. However, in considering the question of whether funds are distributed on an ``equitable basis'', the Department does not believe that all circumstances require that each SDA or area within the State receive funds under this set-aside. Each State is to develop some reasonable measure, including older individuals' share of the population or share of the labor force, in determining how these funds and services will be provided throughout the State. No change is made to the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters expressed concern that the performance standards for the older worker set-aside should be specifically tailored to the unique needs of this population. As noted earlier in the discussion of the performance standards section, the Department has convened a technical work group on the development of the new performance standards which includes representatives of older workers, and will take these and other comments under consideration in developing performance standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Capacity Building and Technical Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The JTPA has been amended to include capacity building and technical assistance as priorities at the national, State and local levels for JTPA and other related human service programs. Section 453 of the Act calls for the creation of a national Capacity Building and Information and Dissemination Network and a Replication Grant Program. State and local priorities are established through sections 202(c)(2)(A) and 262(c)(2)(A) of the Act, which make available up to 33 percent of the 5 percent incentive funds for capacity building and technical assistance activities. Section 121(a)(3) of the Act, requires that capacity building and technical assistance plans be included in the GCSSP. Greater emphasis is placed on general technical assistance activities for the development and training of State, SDA, and service provider staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The majority of comments received on the interim final regulations supported the use of incentive funds for capacity building and technical assistance activities and supported the need to develop the capacity of JTPA personnel at all levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

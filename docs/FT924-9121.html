			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Trade War Fears: British business upset by threat of trade war - John Major is being urged to use his influence to end the stalemate THE Confederation of British Industry reflected the widespread concern of UK companies and warned of serious repercussions for UK business of a full-scale trade war. A CBI spokesman said expansion of world trade was now a top priority for economies attempting to escape recession. A tariff war was 'the last thing we need', he added. The CBI particularly highlighted the threat to investment and employment from a collapse of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). It drew attention to the reported closeness of both sides in the negotiations and urged them to reach agreement 'before it is too late'. The British Chambers of Commerce said Mr John Major, the prime minister, should use his EC presidency to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of ministers. 'The breakdown in trade talks could prove to be one of the last nails in the coffin of business confidence. It is vital, therefore that John Major uses every influence to try to break the log-jam,' a spokesman said. The US is Britain's third largest export market, after Germany and France, worth more than Pounds 10bn annually. Britain is the highest overseas investor in the US, with accumulated assets of Pounds 140bn. The CBI also emphasised the inevitable knock-on impact of targeted punitive tariffs. While the first proposed tariffs were directed mainly at French products, the UK was also likely to suffer because of its involvement in shipping, insurance and packaging sectors. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders echoed CBI concerns: 'We want this solved as quickly as possible, because these situations can escalate out of control literally overnight,' said Mr Roger King, head of external affairs. 'We are watching the position very closely and we are still not sure that it is going to happen.' The first round of measures threatened by the US were aimed at French and German wine, said Mr King, but the motor industry feared tyres might be hit by later measures. Some big car producers in the UK - Ford and Vauxhall - are subsidiaries of American corporations, while Jaguar, the UK luxury car maker which exports a substantial part of its output to the US is also a subsidiary of Ford. 'It would be strange if the US tried to have an impact on its major subsidiaries in the UK motor industry by making their life difficult in this country,' said Mr King. The textile industry expressed hopes that it could escape punitive action. Mr Colin Purvis, secretary-general of the British Apparel and Textile Confederation, said: 'We deplore the fact that agriculture, which accounts for 10 per cent of world trade, has been allowed to hijack the Gatt talks.' He said textiles were not in the immediate firing line but if a trade war developed every sector of industry was at risk. Clothing and textiles accounts for about 5 per cent of world trade. Mr Camille Blum, director general of Comitextil, which lobbies for European textiles manufacturers in Brussels, said: 'The dangers are that when you begin a trade war, you do not know where it will finish.'</p>

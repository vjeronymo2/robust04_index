			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Mercury reduces overseas tariff Mercury Communications, the UK's second largest public telecommunications operator, yesterday made large cuts in international call prices for its largest users in reaction to intensifying competition. It said daytime telephone calls to north America would come down 55 per cent, to 20p from 44p a minute, for customers spending Pounds 35,000 or more a month. To major European destinations, the price will also be 20p a minute compared with 26p while calls to Hong Kong will be 55p a minute compared with the standard Mercury business rate of 78p. The moves reflect Mercury's need to improve its competitiveness over long-haul routes. Analysts said that Mercury's international prices were slightly cheaper than British Telecommunications, the largest operator, before yesterday's cuts, but that both were being undercut significantly by UK competitors such as Colt and US operators including Sprint. Mercury's profits slipped in the first half of the year, forcing a reorganisation, redundancies and abandoned services. Mr Duncan Lewis, newly-appointed chief executive, said the cuts were an example of Mercury's new approach to customers.</p>

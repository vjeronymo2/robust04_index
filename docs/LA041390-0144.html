			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> HIGH-RISES CALLED HOUSING SOLUTION  </P> <P> Orange County cities must allow more high-rise housing and more homes per acre  so that enough affordable housing can be provided for the area, panelists said  at a Thursday forum.  </P> <P> "Increasing density is one of the easiest answers because it doesn't cost any  extra money," said Rick Doremus, president of the Costa Mesa-based EPAC Housing  Corp.  </P> <P> According to National Assn. of Homebuilders President Ira C. Norris, cities  could encourage developers to provide more affordable housing by allowing more  high-density projects.  </P> <P> Alan Kreditor, executive director of USC's Lusk Center for Real Estate  Development, said lower developer fees could cut the cost of new homes by up to  50%.  </P> <P> Kreditor and other real estate leaders said Thursday that the lack of  affordable housing is a problem throughout Southern California, but is  particularly acute in Orange County, one of the nation's most expensive housing  markets.  </P> <P> The Lusk Center, part of USC's School of Urban and Regional Planning, annually  picks the current "hot" topic in real estate as the focus of its regular  forums, said Marilyn Ellis, a school spokeswoman.  </P> <P> "Affordable housing is a problem everyone is dealing with," Ellis said.  </P> <P> The forum, held at the Irvine Hilton, featured real estate and housing experts  from Los Angeles and Orange counties.

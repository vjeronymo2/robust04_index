			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Xiangwei] </F>   [Text] China is drawing up policies to lure foreign  multinational companies to set up their regional headquarters  there, according to a senior official with the Chinese Ministry  of Foreign Trade &amp; Economic Co-operation (Moftec).    Ma Xiuhong, deputy director general of the ministry's  foreign  investment administration, also said yesterday that the ministry  would allow foreign multinational companies to set up investment  vehicles to make direct investments in the country on a trial  basis. They would also be encouraged to invest in capital and  technology-intensive projects.    Analysts said last night that the new policies would pose a  serious challenge to Hong Kong and Singapore where foreign  companies currently base their regional headquarters to direct  their investment and trade in China. Although Ma did not give  any further details, analysts said that the new policies  signalled China's efforts to shift its focus from attracting  small and mid-size foreign companies to multinationals for their  deep pockets, advanced technologies, and management experience.    Ma said that last year foreign investors spent U.S.$ 27.5bn  (about HK$214.5bn), up 150 per cent over 1992. But that figure  is only one fifth of the more than U.S.$110bn total foreign  investment committed to China in 1993.    To date, China has approved 174,000 foreign-funded projects  with the contract value of foreign investment amounting to  U.S.$221.8bn, of which U.S.$61.8bn has already been invested.    Meanwhile, Zheng Silin, vice minister of Moftec, said that  China's foreign trade is estimated to reach U.S.$1,000bn in the  next seven years. Last year, foreign trade was U.S.$195.8bn, of  which imports accounted for U.S.$104bn.    Both Zheng and Ma made the remarks at a seminar, part of an  on-going trade and investment conference organized by Moftec and  the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. The event, which lasts  until Thursday, is the largest of its kind held in the territory.</p>

Boris Yeltsin and  Nursultan Nazarbayev Show the CIS Leaders How To Restore  Economic Ties on a New Basis"]    [Text] The Russian-Kazakhstan talks in the Kremlin began  with a one-on-one conversation between Boris Yeltsin and  Nursultan Nazarbayev. The presidents were then joined by the  two countries' state delegations, which include Premiers Viktor  Chernomyrdin and Sergey Tereschenko. A large package of  Russian-Kazakhstani agreements are expected to be signed as a  result of the talks.    It is planned that Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev  will sign a Treaty on Military Cooperation, a Treaty on the  Further Deepening of Economic Cooperation and Integration  Between Kazakhstan and Russia, a Treaty on the Basic Principles  for Resolving Questions Linked with the Civil and Legal Status  of Citizens of Kazakhstan Permanently Resident on Russian  Territory and of Citizens of Russia Permanently Resident on  Kazakhstan Territory, and an agreement between the two countries  on the basic principles and conditions governing the utilization  of the Baykonur space center. Around a score of documents  relating to military and technical cooperation, the peaceful  utilization of nuclear energy, and cooperation in the fields of  the economy, science, culture, and legal relations are expected  to be signed at head of government level. A total of 22  documents are scheduled to be signed as a result of the talks.    "The basis of our mutual relations is the treaty concluded  in  May 1992," Tair Mansurov, Kazakhstan ambassador extraordinary  and plenipotentiary to Russia, said in a ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI  interview. "We are confident that our president's visit to  Moscow will make it possible to add yet another fine page to the  history of our peoples' friendship. Our common border is very  nearly 6,000 km long, and 12 Russian and 6 Kazakhstani regions  are located along it."    The ambassador recalled Nursultan Nazarbayev's remark that  "the entire population of Kazakhstan is Russian-speaking,"  adding that the Kazakhstan leader regards relations with Russia  as a priority. As for the Baykonur problem, about which there  has been much argument recently, Tair Mansurov's view is that  the space center must be preserved as an enormous achievement of  scientific and technical thinking and it must operate in the  interests of Russia and Kazakhstan alike.    Economic cooperation, which must be developed and deepened,  remains the foundation of cooperation between the two countries.  As the ambassador said, one of the documents prepared for the  presidents' meeting relates precisely to economic relations.    On what basis can enterprises which used to be part of a  unified technological chain but, by a whim of fate, have found  themselves on adjacent territories, restore their severed ties?    Russian Government First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets is  absolutely confident that transnational financial and industrial  groups can and must become the new basis for this. In these  groups the interests of allied enterprises are not national or  -- even more so -- political but purely economic, since they are  all "interlinked" through common finances to the production of  the same finished output. The financial health of each  individual enterprise will be totally dependent on the  successful activity of the entire financial and industrial group  as a whole.    The formation of the first Russian-Kazakhstan transnational  financial and industrial group based on the "Omsknefteorgsintez"  production association and 14 allied enterprises is currently on  the agenda. It is typical that Kazakhstan's leaders were the  first to realize the necessity and expediency of such a step and  officially put a proposal to this effect to President Yeltsin.  It is perfectly possible that one of the practical results of  N. Nazarbayev's visit to Moscow will be precisely the signing of  a special intergovernmental agreement on this.    However, the concentration of enterprises from the two  countries around "Omsknefteorgsintez" is by no means the sole  opportunity for building mutually advantageous cooperation. In  O. Soskovets' view, joint work to modernize the Magnitogorsk  Metallurgical Combine could be particularly promising and  mutually advantageous.    This combine, which smelted around 20 percent of all Russian  steel and exported 3 million tonnes a year, was traditionally  geared to obtaining raw material from Kazakhstan. "What is the  point of us bringing in pellets from the Lebedinskiy Mining and  Enrichment Combine and spending 14,000-15,000 rubles [R] on  shipping something priced at R12,000 a tonne of when we have  appropriate Kazakh enterprises with empty order books right next  door? Such cooperation could benefit everybody," the first vice  premier believes.    Life itself is inexorably pushing our countries toward  cooperation. And if the leaders of Russia and Kazakhstan manage  to lay the political foundation for joint work, financial and  industrial groups could indeed become the locomotive which will  pull the two countries' economies out of crisis.</p>

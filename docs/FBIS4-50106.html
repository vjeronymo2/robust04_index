			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chen Yong and Wang Genbao: "Difficult Assignment </F> of Christopher's New Shuttle Tour"]    [Text] Damascus, May 15 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher started a visit to Syria this evening to  initiate a fresh round of shuttle diplomacy between Syria and  Israel aimed at expediting the Middle East peace process.    Syria attaches great importance to Christopher's visit and  President Hafiz al-Asad met with the U.S. secretary of state  immediately after his arrival.    According to diplomatic sources here, the U.S. official will  convey an Israeli reply to ideas and proposals raised by Syria  in connection with the Israeli peace proposals.    The Israeli proposals, the sources said, focus on an Israeli  troop withdrawal from the Golan Heights in three stages lasting  between six to eight years, security arrangements and the start  of a normalization of relations between the two countries.    The sources noted that though the Syrian and Israeli  positions are wide apart, exchanges by the two sides entered a  new phase to discuss substantive issues such as peace, security  arrangements and creation of a favorable atmosphere for resuming  bilateral peace negotiations in Washington.    Christopher will try to bridge the gap between the Syrian  and  Israeli positions and to encourage both sides to negotiate peace.    Syria is said to be insisting on a complete and immediate  Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights before discussing  issues of peace, normalization of relations and security  arrangements as demanded by Israel.    A Syrian official source said his country will renew its  demand for an Israeli commitment to complete withdrawal from the  Golan Heights, adding that Syria is not willing to enter into  either protracted talks or partial settlements because in that  way it will only prolong the duration of Israel's occupation.    The source disclosed that Israel proposes to devise a  strategy for security arrangements, preliminary steps toward  peace, formation of a joint committee and creation of contact  channels with Syria away from the bilateral Syrian-Israeli  negotiations.    In the meantime, political observers here say that  Christopher's difficult assignment may prompt him to travel back  to Damascus from Israel if Israel's response to Syrian demands  is encouraging.    Although Syria has repeatedly pledged commitment to  negotiate  peace with Israel, Damascus has recently made strong criticism  of the U.S. Administration for its listing of Syria as a country  supporting terrorism.    Syria believes that publication of the report was meant as a  means of twisting Syria into offering more concessions in the  peace talks with Israel.</p>

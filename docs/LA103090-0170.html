			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL NEWS STATION REDUCES NUMBER OF EDITORIAL EMPLOYEES  </P> <P> Six weeks after its premiere on local cable television, Orange County  Newschannel has dismissed about a dozen editorial workers -- more than 15% of  the 24-hour news station's staff.  </P> <P> Kenneth D. Tiven, OCN's vice president and general manager, said those  dismissed were free-lance journalists who knew "going in" that they were hired  for short stints of two months or less.  </P> <P> "We were using a whole series of free-lance people to get started," Tiven said.  "Many of them knew they were just there because we were not sure what we  needed. We felt it was better to be overstaffed at the start."  </P> <P> Tiven would not give a precise number for those dismissed or for those still  remaining. The reduction leaves OCN with fewer than 60 reporters, technicians  and advertising sales people.  </P> <P> When OCN was launched in mid-September, he said the news channel would be run  with a staff of about 70 workers.  </P></p>

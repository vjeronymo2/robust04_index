			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Battle in food retailers HECTIC trading swept through the food retailing sector as price war fever intensified. Four of the major players ended the day in the top five turnover listings, with Asda taking pole position after 31m shares were traded. Interim results from J. Sainsbury sparked the action as the company used the opportunity to announce an aggressive marketing campaign of cutting prices on 300 of its key brand products. Fears over a price war in the sector, which exploded last week when a US warehouse retailer won permission to open an outlet in the UK, were fuelled and selling cut back most stocks. Many analysts set about downgrading and Sainsbury ended 15 down at 385p, after 378p, with 12m shares dealt. Argyll Group lost 18 to 274p in volume of 16m, making it the day's second highest turnover stock. It was also the Footsie's biggest percentage faller with a 6.2 per cent loss. Tesco dipped 4 1/2 to 195p and Asda receded 2 1/4 to 50 1/4 . Kwik Save relinquished 18 to 620p. One analyst said that the market had been braced for shock waves after the Sainsbury announcement. 'It was a powerful competitive move and there is bound to be retaliation.' He predicted quite an amount of downside in the food retailing and said his downgradings were trimming food retailers by an average of Pounds 30m to Pounds 40m.</p>

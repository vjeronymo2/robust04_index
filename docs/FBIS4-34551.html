			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Voz Andes" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Conaie [Confederation of Indian Nationalities of  Ecuador] continues to paralyze the mountain provinces of the  mountain range. The shortage of basic staples is apparent there.  Conaie representative (Nina Pacari) said that her organization  has nothing to do with abuses and violence committed on the  streets. She maintains that paramilitary groups hired by the  regime, the Social Christian Party, and the Republican Unity  Party, burned peasant organization headquarters and killed  Indians.    [Begin (Pacari) recording, in progress] ...the entire  country, especially between the Andean region and Cotopaxi  Province, and the Amazonian areas of the Provinces of Pastaza  and Napo are completely paralyzed. The country's Indian and  peasant movement has intensified its actions to protest against  this agricultural law. We want to denounce repression in several  provinces, deaths and injuries, and, especially, attacks on the  headquarters of our provincial organizations.    We blame the national government for this because it is  behind the evil actions of paramilitary groups against our  companeros and leaders nationwide. We must point out that  paramilitary groups killed companero (Marcos Marabanda) in  Tungurahua Province, where a pickup truck fired indiscriminately  and sped away. Also, Radio Centro was fired on by paramilitary  groups that fled. [end recording]    Conaie will continue its actions until the regime repeals  the  agricultural law. (Pacari) pointed out that it is preferable for  the country to lose hundreds of millions of Sucres now as a  result of the paralysis than to lose the entire agricultural  sector, because of a law that brings absolutely no benefits for  Indians and peasants.</p>

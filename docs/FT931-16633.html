			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / France and Germany pledge support for embattled franc POLITICAL support for the embattled French franc strengthened yesterday when the French and German governments and central banks issued a joint statement repeating their determination to support the parity between their two currencies. Their communique went further than the previous joint announcement by the Bundesbank and the Bank of France, during the last heavy attack on the franc in September, saying they would 'pursue their close co-operation in order to ensure the proper function of the European exchange rate mechanism'. The French central bank also increased one of its two official lending rates to try to drive up the cost of speculating against the franc while not increasing the cost of business borrowing. The franc finished yesterday at FFr3.4140, half a centime up on its Monday night close and more than a centime above its ERM floor against the D-Mark, and went on to close in New York at 3.41175. Neither the Bank of France nor the Bundesbank openly intervened in the market. Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France, said last night on French television: 'Today we had no currency outflow at all. The market has understood the determination of the authorities.' Devaluation was 'completely excluded', he added. In Dublin, meanwhile, Mr Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister, gave his strongest hint yet that the defence of the punt might be abandoned if there was no overall realignment of the ERM in the coming weeks. 'I said I was prepared to hold the line until the end of the year. That has now passed. If the system does not correct itself . . . the pressures on industry are something that cannot be lived with indefinitely,' he said. Pressure on the punt eased in the Irish Republic earlier yesterday after high money market rates deterred speculation. Several analysts took the statement from the French and German governments as a sign the Bundesbank might consider a drop in interest rates in the next few months if needed to restore order to the ERM. In their last joint statement, the two central banks said only that they would work within ERM rules. In yesterday's announcement, they reiterated 'that the actual central rate of the two currencies is fully justified on the basis of their economic fundamentals'. Separately, Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, backed early independence for the Bank of France, hardening the consensus with the rightwing opposition for an autonomous central bank. The opposition, expected to win the parliamentary election at the end of March, intends to introduce plans shortly to grant independence to the bank. The Franco-German declaration came with a 2 percentage point rise in the rate at which the Bank of France lends short-term cash to commercial banks. The central bank temporarily suspended its 5-10 day repurchase rate, which was at 10 per cent, and replaced it with a 24-hour lending facility, at 12 per cent.

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: Intel and AT&amp;T in conferencing system deal The threat of a damaging standards war in personal video-conferencing similar to the VHS and Betamax battle which divided video recorder manufacturers receded yesterday when AT&amp;T and Intel said they were working together to build a compatible system. Personal video-conferencing, where participants can see both each other and work papers on their personal computer screens while holding a telephone conversation, has been hailed as the future of business communications. Intel, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer has developed a system which can be installed in a PC in conjunction with a miniature video camera to create a desk-top video conferencing system. AT&amp;T, the largest US telecommunications carrier has an obvious interest in increasing traffic on its network through advanced services, such as tele-conferencing. Mr John Petrillo, president of AT&amp;T business communications services said: 'This agreement will provide a technology base for making video and data calls with a PC as accessible and easy to use as calls with a telephone.' Conventional video-conferencing systems used by large companies cost Pounds 40,000 or more and are comparatively inflexible. Desk-top video costs only about Pounds 3,000 in addition to the cost of the PC. A concern has been that Intel's video-conferencing system, called Proshare, is not compatible with the accepted standard for large video-conferencing, called H320. The worry was that a industry-wide row over the two standards could slow progress. Proshare is cheaper than H320 but does not have all its facilities. Yesterday's agreement between AT&amp;T and Intel means that customers will get 'seamless integration between Intel's Proshare and AT&amp;T's network services', the groups said. The two companies will build a technology bridge between the two standards.</p>

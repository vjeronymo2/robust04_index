			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO BRIEF FOR SERRA  </P> <P> The recent article about Tony Serra, the defense attorney who smokes marijuana,  served time in federal prison and abandons cars rather than pay parking tickets  into the thousands of dollars, certainly adds new meaning to the term criminal  lawyer ("Counterculture's Warrior Lawyer" by Robert Chow, May 3).  </P> <P> This outstanding example of the California Bar was quoted as saying, "I'll try  any case that comes along. If you kill a cop, I'll pay to take the case." Serra  also "respects drug dealers because the heart of what they're trying to do is  better their condition. They're trying in their fashion the only way they have  of getting out of the ghetto."  </P> <P> Somehow, he overlooks those individuals of all colors and races who get an  education and take ordinary jobs nowhere near as lucrative as selling drugs. I  wonder if Serra's glib attitude would change if any of his five children became  addicted as the result of contact with a pusher liberated by their father's  efforts.  </P> <P> ROBERT S.

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nobody fooled Sir, Bravo for setting us all straight on the real motives behind James Elles's personal efforts as chairman of the Transatlantic Policy Network (Observer, February 18). How could he have fooled not only Messrs Strauss and Sutherland, but also the White House, half the cabinet, the US Congress, the European Commission, the European Parliament, Her Majesty's Government and European industry's principal representatives here in Brussels - not to mention two dozen of the world's leading corporations (European and American) - that he was really doing anything useful at all? And how silly to have believed there are politicians whose motives are any more high-minded than junketeering and re-election - or indeed that future relations between Europe and America should cause anybody any legitimate concern. It was high time to remind the naive that in these matters Englishmen certainly know best. So praise be to Observer for being so observant, and for saving us any need to continue our subscription to The Sun.

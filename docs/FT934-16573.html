			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Danish coalition likely to lose one-vote majority DENMARK'S four-party coalition government, led by Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Social Democratic party leader, yesterday appeared set to lose its one-vote majority in the Folketing (parliament). Mrs Inger Stilling Pedersen, of the coalition Christian People's party, said that unless the government agreed to pay mothers for staying at home to care for children, she would resign from her party and become an independent. Mr Rasmussen, whose government was formed in January, took the threat to his government calmly, saying that if Mrs Pedersen carried out her plan to become an independent he would carry on as head of a minority coalition. Mrs Pedersen's threat to the government followed the opening of a new session of the Folketing yesterday with a state-of-the-nation speech by the prime minister. Mr Rasmussen's coalition has had bad opinion poll ratings recently, causing friction among the coalition parties. In addition to the Social Democrats and the Christian People's party these comprise Radical Liberals and the Centre Democrats. The next election to the Folketing must be held at the latest in December next year. In his state-of-the-nation speech Mr Rasmussen said that the government's priorities were to fight unemployment, now running at just over 12 per cent, and to maintain and improve the welfare state. He promised improvements in the care of the elderly, in the health and hospital services and in child-care institutions. He also said there would be a substantial expansion in post-school educational opportunities. Denmark's current account surplus and its low inflation made such a programme possible, he said.</p>

			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / International Company News: UBS cautious on outlook UNION Bank of Switzerland, the country's largest bank, will find it very difficult to raise operating income next year, according to Mr Robert Studer, chief executive. In an interview, he said he was not pessimistic about the outlook for 1994, but he did not expect trading activity to be as buoyant as it has been this year. In the first half of 1993, UBS's net income jumped by 89 per cent to SFr1.29bn (Dollars 865m), achieving a 13 per cent return on equity, well above its medium-term target of 10 per cent, and Mr Studer said that the second half has remained very strong. The main contributor to the bank's profit growth this year has been trading income, which soared by 144 per cent to SFr1.55bn in the first half, thanks to very active bond and stock markets and frequent turmoil in the foreign exchange markets.</p>

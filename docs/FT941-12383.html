			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Beijing extends freeze on new capital projects China has extended its freeze on new capital spending projects until the end of this year as part of efforts to combat inflation and ensure key existing infrastructure projects are adequately funded. The state council, China's cabinet, announced at the weekend that 'no new fixed-asset investment projects' would be approved, with the aim of keeping a 'tight rein on the country's fixed-asset investments in 1994'. The decision effectively extends a ban on borrowing for new projects instituted last July under a 16-point programme designed to stabilise the rapid growth of the economy. The leadership has promised to lower growth to 9 per cent this year compared with 12.8 per cent last year, but it faces a delicate task. A western economist in Beijing said the state council's decision did not amount to an outright ban on new projects. Those that were self-funded or where funds were secured abroad would be allowed to proceed. The council statement made it clear that a target of the investment freeze was property development, including industrial zones. Last year's explosion of speculative investment in both was blamed for China's overheating problems. Fixed asset investment grew by 47 per cent in 1993 compared with 1992. This year's target is for 14 per cent growth to Yn131bn (Pounds 10bn) compared with last year's figure of Yn115bn. The state council is also calling for closer supervision of foreign investment to 'encourage investment in domestic infrastructure and basic industry'.</p>

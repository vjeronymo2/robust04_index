			<p>BFN     [Text] A delegation of European experts ended its official  visit to Algeria today. It will be conveying to the European  Council Algeria's strong wish to build partnership relations  that would bolster the existing cooperation between Algeria and  the European Union [EU] and open several opportunities for  exchanges awaiting the establishment of a free-trade zone, as is  the case with Morocco and Tunisia. Here are more details from  our reporter:    [Correspondent] The delegation of European experts today  ended its three-day tour in Algeria. The delegation held  several working sessions with senior Algerian officials, the  first of which took place yesterday at the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, where the delegation was received by Mohamed Salah  Dembri, the minister of foreign affairs, and held a meeting with  a delegation of Algerian experts led by the secretary general of  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Algerian delegation  included representatives of vital sectors: industry, energy,  trade, and agriculture. The meeting was aimed at reaching a  partnership agreement between Algeria and the EU in various  sectors prior to the establishment of a free-trade zone similar  to those that the EU currently has with Algeria's neighbors,  Tunisia and Morocco.    These talks, which are considered exploratory in nature,  were  followed yesterday evening by meetings that included the finance  minister, the minister of small- and medium-sized enterprises,  as well as the governor of the Algerian Central Bank. The head  of the delegation of European experts stressed that the EU gives  Algeria all opportunities on an equal basis with its neighbors  and the states of eastern Europe. He also said that the  partnership agreement that the two sides are working on would  allow for exchanges in various economic spheres.    It is to be recalled that this round of talks will be  followed by another round next autumn to finalize the  partnership agreement that Algeria is seeking with the EU.</p>

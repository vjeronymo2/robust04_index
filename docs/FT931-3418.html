			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Euroc profits decline to SKr129m as sales slide EUROC, the Swedish building materials group, saw 1992 profits after financial items fall to SKr129m (Dollars 16.9m) from SKr151m a year earlier, with efforts to cut costs and release capital largely offsetting a big downturn in the building market. The dividend is being maintained at SKr2 per share. Sales slumped to SKr9.5bn from SKr10.5bn, with a particularly severe decline in Sweden and Finland where sales were down 20 to 30 per cent. Operating income dropped to SKr542m from SKr740m. The group's performance was helped by a sharp reduction in net financial expense which fell to SKr396m from SKr593m, after a scaling down of operations in some markets. The group sold its stake in Valenciana, the Spanish cement and ready-mix company, incurring a SKr279m extraordinary loss, but it says the move will cut its annual financial costs by SKr150m. Euroc's cement operations improved earnings to SKr124m from SKr39m, but the building material activities saw profits fall to SKr84m from SKr204m. Losses within building materials distribution deepened to SKr29m from SKr14m. Euroc forecasts that it will remain in profit in 1993.</p>

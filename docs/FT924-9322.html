			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Italy voices support for EFA rescue effort ITALY yesterday added a further glimmer to hopes of saving the four-nation European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) project following signs of a slight shift in German attitudes earlier this week. Speaking at the 70th anniversary of the country's air academy, Mr Salvo Ando, defence minister, said he hoped the EFA partners - Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain - could reach a 'useful conclusion' by mid-December. Plans for the EFA were dealt a heavy blow in July when Germany, struggling to contain government spending, announced it was pulling out of the fighter's production phase. It wanted a cheaper aircraft reflecting changed defence needs following the end of the cold war. Mr Ando's comments are an attempt to help bridge the gap between British wishes to push ahead with the EFA and Bonn's inclination to pull out. 'Given the fact that the willingness exists among the four partners to meet each other half way on their problems, a positive conclusion must be within reach,' he said. Choosing his words carefully, the minister stressed that any project would have to reflect the need for lower costs. It would also have to take into account the changed circumstances of European air defence. The implication is that Italy, which badly needs to replace its ageing US-designed F104 fighters, favours the cheaper, lighter aircraft wanted by the Germans. The Italians are also keen not to see the collaborative project collapse owing to differences between the four partners. Mr Ando emphasised that it would be a grave pity not to go ahead given the large amount of money and time already put into the EFA project. Italy has so far paid out L1,600bn (Pounds 780m) for the research and development phases of the project. 'Our aim is not to waste the money already invested. . . . at the same time, it is extremely important for our country to get a modern and reliable fighter,' he said. 'Italy is making an effort to bring the EFA project into harbour, taking into account with our partners the changed security outlook which must inevitably be reflected in the characteristics of the fighter,' he said.</p>

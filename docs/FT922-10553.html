			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / World Trade News: Tariff row spoils Caribbean community spirit - Moves towards a common market have fuelled policy disputes on protectionism EFFORTS by the Caribbean Economic Community (Caricom) to create a common market in two years are being hampered by continuing uncertainty over the establishment of a customs union with the implementation of a common tariff on imports from third countries. The debate over the common tariff and the attacks which have been levelled at it illustrates the conundrum being faced by small, open economies seeking protection for nascent industries amid a global tendency towards deregulated trade. Caricom has argued that the common external tariff is needed to protect its members' economies while it creates the common market which would give it the strength to compete in the global marketplace. But the structure of the common tariff, and its likely effect on trade, has been attacked by the US and queried by institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. This, combined with the reluctance of four of Caricom's 13 members to implement the tariff regime, has forced a rethinking in the community of the need for the tariff as it is now structured. 'The relatively high level at which the tariff has been set has been drawn to our attention by the multilateral institutions,' said Mr Wendell Mottley, finance minister of Trinidad and Tobago. 'They say the tariff levels in other parts of the world are lower, and that Caricom is not moving fast enough to deal with this. I foresee some debate on this matter.' Caricom, which has a market of 5.5m people, is made up of 13 English-speaking countries of the region, including Belize in Central America, the Bahamas, and Guyana in South America. The Community was established in 1973 with the aim of strengthening the economies of its members through increased regional trade and a common approach in trade negotiations with third countries. All members, except the Bahamas which is not a signatory of the trading agreements, had said they will implement the common tariff. However, several countries have repeatedly missed target dates, saying they feared adverse effects on their economies. The common external tariff imposes low rates of duty on imports which do not compete with goods produced within the community, but sets high rates on any imports which are likely to injure domestic industry. Under the new tariff the highest rate of duty within the community will be 45 per cent and the lowest five per cent. This replaces a structure in which tariffs ranged from five per cent to 70 per cent. Rates differ where the imports are raw materials or finished products, and agricultural products will be given protection while inputs for agriculture will be subject to very low tariffs. The US, Caricom's main trading partner, is unhappy with the structure of the tariff, and has suggested changes which it says are in keeping with the trend towards the removal of barriers. Mr David Malpass, the US deputy assistant secretary of state, said the common tariff will reduce Caricom's trade competitiveness by protecting vulnerable industries. 'I am concerned that the current structure of the common tariff could keep the region from achieving the competitiveness and growth which it so badly needs and wants,' Mr Malpass said. 'The real crunch is the obvious tension between trying to protect vulnerable industries and sectors, and the need to liberalise to make these economies more efficient.' Caricom's progress towards trade liberalisation was lagging substantially behind that of other groups in Latin America, such as the Central American Common Market and the Andean Pact, which have undertaken to impose a common external tariff with a maximum level of 20 per cent in general, Mr Malpass said. The criticism was immediately rejected by Caricom technocrats. Mr Byron Blake, director of economics and industry at the Caricom secretariat, said US trade with Caricom had grown significantly from 1984, while there had been a decline in the exports of community members to the US. While Caricom's tariff regime appeared to be a 'real problem' for the US, he argued, it would neither reduce imports from the US nor impact negatively on regional competitiveness. 'Some Caricom members, such as those in eastern Caribbean, by and large have very low tariffs. 'Their exporters have not been able to compete in the extra-regional markets. So clearly there is not a question of tariffs which deals with our ability to compete.' The 45 per ceiling in the community's tariff affected only a few products, Mr Blake said. It is now clear, however, that the community will have to rethink the manner in which it will create the customs union which it says is fundamental to transforming itself into a common market. The nature of the likely alteration in the structure of the common tariff has been indicated by Mr Edwin Carrington, a former secretary general of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group, and who will take office as Caricom's secretary general in September. Rather than having a regime which demands the same tariff levels, he argued, it is more realistic to determine which goods are produced, or can be produced, in the community. 'We can then design a tariff which deals with these products, but which leaves member countries to impose differing duties on products which are not produced in the community,' he argued. 'The entire instrument needs to be revised. The IMF and the World Bank are pressuring us to remove barriers, and the world is moving in the direction of lower tariffs.' Business leaders, such as Mr Pat Thompson, executive director of the Caribbean Association of Industry and Commerce, believe the problem has to be resolved quickly. 'If is it not then we will not have a common market because it is not possible to have a common market which does not have a common external tariff.'</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Arts: Musical tilt at romantic fiction - Andrew St George has a diverting evening in Scarborough DURING the two and a half hours Love Off The Shelf is on stage at Scarborough, Yorkshire, the queen bee of romance fiction, Dame Barbara Cartland, will have added two dozen pages to her oeuvre. This musical at Stephen Joseph Theatre is directed by Alan Ayckbourn and is a thoroughly enjoyable tilt at the romantic fiction industry. The writers Roger Hall (book), AK Grant (lyrics) and Philip Norman (music) base their idea on the cliches lurking in publishers' tips on how to write romance novels. Everything becomes subject to parody, which is why Love Off The Shelf will never be a great musical, since the action is unsure where to take itself. But this makes a good diverting evening which amounts to an extended revue rather than the full musical works. The action meanders between City of Angels, The Singing Detective and Possession. Two tweedy academics are researching the dull, short life of a poet who wrote little and is known even less - the professional's dream project. But both are secretly writing romance novels to strict rules. Hers is a steamy Caribbean rhumba about the fortunes of one Clare Truelove and the 'sardonically sneering' Hamilton Squire. And his is a raunchy (the publishers call this 'Super Desire') Irish romp involving mega-novelist Sean O'Hara and secretary Kathleen: 'Oh, Mister O'Hara, I've read all your books'  -'Yes, but did you buy them?' The parallel interests evolve into happy endings, but leave the romance species looking pretty weak. The play peddles in types. The romance hero has been dark and mysterious ever since Byron put the 'roam' into Romantic with his infidelities; and the heroine supine since Jane Austen's action adventure Persuasion where eyes meet across the Octagon Room in Bath Spa and a young lady's flirtation at Lyme Regis ends in tears and concussion. But at Scarborough the action flirts with sex stereotypes: behind the chiselled features and black-flecked eyes of the hero is a sensitive man; and amidst the heroine's storm of electrical feelings and racing pulses is a shrewd, savvy woman. The songs are unmemorable, not because they are poor, but because they underachieve. Parodies like these push their targets to one side, but never out of sight; so the attention they get is always divided. But the acting and singing are energetic and witty (particularly Simon Day and Sara Markland), if overdone at times for such a small theatre. There is a strong chorus to open and close the second half, and a deft number from the researchers, 'What Can it Be Like?' . . . to be famous and feted. Ayckbourn's sure and vivid staging work with Sheila Carter's sharp choreography to bring the tunes to life and bring onto the small revolving stage a ski-run, a ship, a helicopter, a lighthouse, a cliff and a sequence of diminishing palm trees to represent the departing shore; as Sam Goldwyn used to say from ship to pier, 'Bon voyage.' The Stephen Joseph Theatre leaves its present site after its lease expires next season, and will move into Scarborough's former Odeon Cinema. Half the Pounds 4.35m needed has been raised; it should be supported. In repertory, Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough, Yorkshire (0723 370541) until November 20</p>

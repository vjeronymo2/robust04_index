			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: BA set to market some USAir internal flights 'as its own' BRITISH Airways plans to market certain flights to internal US destinations operated by USAir, in which it has invested Dollars 300m, 'as though those services were BA's own'. It will also put its own logo and signs over check-in facilities at airports from which these services depart. The UK-based carrier will make clear to customers that these 'code-share' flights - which will carry the airline designator code of both carriers - are being operated by USAir, the sixth-largest US carrier. These are some of the critical details of a proposed 'code-share' agreement between the two airlines, spelt out in a copious filing made late on Monday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Also in the filing are details of the revised investment agreement between the two companies. This reveals that USAir will seek to divest its US-UK routes as soon as possible, and that BA will apply to take over the Charlotte-London, Pittsburgh-London and Baltimore-London services, using USAir pilots and cabin crew. The aim is for the two companies to share profits from the routes but, if this is not feasible, BA will pay USAir up to Dollars 50m over a five-year period. The 'big three' US carriers - American, Delta and United - successfully utilised some of the 'small print' contained in an earlier SEC filing by BA to lobby against the British carrier's previous plan to invest Dollars 750m into USAir in return for a 44 per cent equity interest. BA has since revised that proposal, injecting Dollars 300m into USAir in return for securities which can convert into a 19.9 per cent voting interest in USAir. The new investment agreement allows BA to invest another Dollars 200m over the next three years, and a further Dollars 250m over the following five years. Yesterday, the big three US carriers were taking some comfort from comments made by the new transportation secretary, Mr Federico Pena, that the Clinton administration viewed issues arising from the 'interface' between US carriers and foreign markets as a 'very high priority' and was 'currently looking at the creation of a special group which will help us evaluate the status of the airline industry.'</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: High cost of legal monopoly Sir, If Lord Mackay is to consider the appropriateness of legal aid for the Maxwell brothers he should also consider the reason why otherwise very wealthy people cannot afford legal representation in Britain's courts ('Cheap ride on trial', August 30). The truth is barristers and solicitors have exploited their unique monopoly position to price everyone out of the market. Only government, with monopoly taxation powers, can provide the millions for fees. Ian and Kevin Maxwell are entitled to expect a fair trial and fair, reasonable and controllable legal costs. Under present conditions that is not possible, so legal aid must continue to pour into the bottomless pit of lawyers' earnings. This is now a serious political issue. How can it be that a single case and a mere handful of lawyers and their experts can mean financial wipe-out for most firms and practically all private individuals.

			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEEPING HEALTHY: TABLETS MAY BE ONE WAY TO COUNTERACT JET LAG  </P> <P> The Anti Jet Lag Formula is a vitamin-amino acid formulation that the  manufacturer claims can reduce the effects of jet lag. It contains two amino  acids -- tryptophane to help induce sleep, and tyrosine to promote better  performance during the day -- and vitamin B6 to help metabolize the  tryptophane. Tablets are to be taken over a 12-hour period after arrival at  your destination.  </P> <P> Does it work? The accompanying literature gives testimonials from known  personalities, but is weak on scientific facts to support claims. But  dietitians say the ingredients can't harm you. The Anti Jet Lag Formula is  available at drugstores, airports and from American Biosearch, 5820 Oberlin  Drive, Suite 202, San Diego, Calif. 92121. A two-day supply is $5.95; for 12  days, $24.95.  </P> <P> Check with your physician if you take blood pressure medication and plan to  travel to the tropics or to high-altitude destinations, says the Medical  Travelers' Advisory.  </P> <P> At high altitudes, getting sufficient oxygen depends on a more rapid heart  rate. However, some blood pressure medication -- beta blockers, for example --  interferes with your heart beating faster. Therefore, your dosage of medication  may have to be reduced before your trip.  </P> <P> Diuretics (water pills) can cause problems when you travel from winter  temperatures to the tropics. The combination of diuretics and increased  perspiration may cause dehydration. The situation is further complicated by  sports, exercise and, sometimes, the inability to get a low-salt diet.  </P> <P> Brightly colored, lead-glazed earthen pottery items brought back from Mexico,  China and other developing countries make attractive ornaments for your home.  But think twice before using them for holding food, says the University of  California, Berkeley, Wellness Letter.  </P> <P> The problem is that these items may not have been fired at sufficiently high  temperatures to bind the lead properly. As a result, foods, especially acidic  foods such as wine, orange and tomato juices, coffee, some sauces, pickles and  salad dressings can leach out the lead. Then when you eat the food, you absorb  the lead, which could cause lead poisoning.  </P> <P> Earthen pottery bought in Europe and Japan, where laws require that high  temperatures be used, is less likely to cause problems. But even there, buy  earthen jars from reputable dealers.  </P> <P> If you must smoke when visiting developing countries, take cigarettes with you.  The cigarettes you buy there may be more hazardous than those in this country.  </P> <P> According to the World Health Organization, the worst cigarettes are in  Indonesia. The average cigarette there contains about five times the tar and  three times the nicotine of the average cigarette in North America and Western  Europe. Other countries with particularly unhealthy cigarettes: Turkey and the  Philippines.  </P> <P> The best time to travel during pregnancy is the fourth through the sixth  months, when you have adjusted to the pregnancy but are not yet so bulky that  moving about is difficult. That's according to the booklet "Travel During  Pregnancy."  </P> <P> The safest seat belt during pregnancy is one with both shoulder and lap  restraints. Fasten the lap belt low across the hips, under the bulge of your  abdomen. Place a scarf or thin blanket between the belt and your body for  increased comfort.  </P> <P> Pregnant women take longer to adjust to jet lag, so allow a couple of days of  rest after flights.  </P> <P> For copies of the free booklet, write to the American College of Obstetricians  and Gynecologists, 600 Maryland Ave. SW, Suite 300, Washington, D.C.  20024-2588.  </P> <P> Never sleep during the descent of airplane flights. Sleep decreases swallowing  and swallowing helps you keep up with pressure changes during descent,  according to the leaflet "Ears, Altitude and Airplane Travel."  </P> <P> Use nasal sprays and decongestants after flights when ears do not unblock. If  ear discomfort continues for more than a day, see a physician. Prolonged  blockage in your ears can cause problems later.  </P> <P> The free leaflet has many other helpful facts.

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Exports boost for West Germany West Germany's economic recovery started with a surge of more than 2 per cent real growth in the first quarter after 12 months of sharp decline, the federal statistics office said yesterday. The rise was fuelled by strong exports and good weather for building, which are still helping to damp down unemployment, and a spurt in consumer spending. The result showed the economy was on the road to recovery, the office said, although analysts and industry warned the early pace was unlikely to be maintained. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, said in Paris that pan-German growth for the full year might now exceed his forecast of up to 1.5 per cent, although no dramatic decline in unemployment would occur. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development this week revised its 1994 German growth forecast from 0.8 per cent to 1.8 per cent. But Mr Peter Stihl, president of the DIHT trade and industry association, said the early improvement owed more to optimism than facts. He expected only a 1 per cent improvement for the year. His caution echoed warnings from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, that the mood was better than the real situation warranted. While good economic news may improve the government parties' electoral chances, employers and the central bank are eager to damp popular expectations of a rapid recovery which could generate renewed inflationary pressure. Such a development could prolong the pause in the bank's interest rate reduction programme, or even lead to rate rises, some economists fear. German-based observers said real cuts in disposable incomes were now choking off private demand, public spending was still restrained, and prospects for the rest of the year depended almost entirely on exports. GDP in the review period rose a real 2.1 per cent compared with the first three months of 1993, and was up a seasonally-adjusted 0.5 per cent on the last quarter of 1993. The figures were enhanced by special factors, but showed the first positive year-on-year change since the last quarter of 1993, the statistics office said. Mild weather contributed to 4.7 per cent growth in construction output, and the pre-Easter shopping rush, which fell in April last year, showed up in a 1.7 per cent rise in private consumption. Exports increased 5.4 per cent and imports rose 2.7 per cent, while public-sector demand remained 1.2 per cent below last year's level. The quarter had one more working day than last year, and after adjustment for that, real GDP was up 1.6 per cent on the year. The expansive trend was confirmed by the third consecutive monthly fall in unemployment in May, taking the headline rate in the west from 8.4 per cent to 8.1 per cent and from 16.2 per cent to 15.4 per cent in the east. Seasonally adjusted, numbers without work in the west rose 9,000. Federal employment officials now expected no more than 3.8m people out of work at the end of the year, against analysts' earlier forecasts of more than 4m. The labour market had not improved, but total registered vacancies rose 3 per cent in May; unfilled jobs in the manufacturing sector increased 13 per cent. they added.</p>

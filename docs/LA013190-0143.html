			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> ISRAEL LETS PALESTINIANS REMAIN  </P> <P> A day after the U.S. State Department expressed concern, Defense Minister  Yitzhak Rabin ordered a temporary halt to the expulsion of Palestinians living  in the occupied territories without residency permits, a practice that often  separates husbands and wives.  </P> <P> Today's announcement cited humanitarian reasons for halting the expulsions,  which have torn apart hundreds of families in the past year.  </P> <P> Palestinian activists claim the expulsions have been stepped up and are part of  a long-term strategy to force Palestinians out of the occupied West Bank and  Gaza Strip, where the Palestinian uprising against Israeli authority has  claimed hundreds of lives over the last 26 months.  </P></p>

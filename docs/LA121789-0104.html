			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POLITICAL VISION BEHIND COURT VOTE WELCOME  </P> <P> When the county Board of Supervisors decided last week that it made better  long-term sense to build North County courts in Vista instead of Escondido,  despite Escondido's more generous financial offer, board Chairwoman Susan  Golding commented that she wanted "to make one decision on this board that's  not a Band-Aid."  </P> <P> Indeed, it's a rare government decision these days that is not a Band-Aid --  sometimes for lack of vision or political will, but more often for financial  reasons.  </P> <P> So the courts vote was noteworthy.  </P> <P> But perhaps more extraordinary is that in the past 10 days, there have actually  been three instances of forward-looking action by local government officials.  </P> <P> On Monday, the San Diego City Council voted to establish a housing trust fund  to preserve and expand the amount of housing affordable to low-income  residents. At the same time, the council also voted to commit $54 million in  new taxes and fees to the fund. It was a bold move that could go a long way  toward meeting a pressing need in the city, although the nature and amount of  the taxes and fees should be carefully weighed along with proposals to fund  other infrastructure and public service needs before final decisions are made.  </P> <P> The third noteworthy move occurred Dec. 8 when San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor  urged the City Council to adopt a proposed managed-growth ballot initiative and  to strengthen the city's environmental protections.  </P> <P> With the recent election of council members Linda Bernhardt and John Hartley,  O'Connor apparently realized that the timing might be right to pass a tougher  growth-management ordinance. Instead of letting competing citizens measures go  on the ballot again, O'Connor encouraged the council to adopt a proposal by the  group Prevent Los Angelization Now!, a sequel to last year's Citizens for  Limited Growth.  </P> <P> The council should not adopt the measure without sufficient debate and  refinement, but the proposal has much to recommend it.  </P> <P> To be sure, three acts of leadership do not mean an end to Band-Aids. Politics  and the scarcity of public resources assure that.  </P> <P> But, if the electorate shows its support for such actions, it will be easier  for tomorrow's leaders to look beyond just tomorrow.  </P></p>

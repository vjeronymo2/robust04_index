			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (22): Glimmer of light from the business parks - Profile of Arlington Securities THINGS have not gone smoothly for Arlington Securities over the past couple of years. The barrage of bad publicity over difficulties faced by its holding company, British Aerospace, often turned a harsh light on the developer. There was speculation that it was bound to have suffered from the property slump and was a prime target for disposal. There is a grain of truth in such doubts. With town-centre rents tumbling, there was no way the company could have maintained the runaway success of the 1980s, when it pioneered out-of-town parks for big office users. But Barry Holmes has the perfect answer for critics. For the first time the business parks division's figures have been separated out from other operations, showing a Pounds 12.8m profit for the year to last December, says the marketing director. The group is also continuing to expand: 'We now have 12 operating parks and another seven in planning stages,' he adds - definitely not a picture of an operation wilting under pressure. It takes a bit more imagination nowadays to set up big relocators, such as the Pounds 96m sale-and-leaseback of almost 300,000 sq ft to Dana Corporation at Farnborough last year through a leveraged lease organised by Salomon Brothers for sale in the US. Having a big parent like BAe to back such deals is crucial, and another could soon be on the cards. But there is still a turnover of more modest schemes which helped shift a total of almost 400,000 sq ft in 1992. The rents are not what they were, of course, but Mr Holmes insists that he has never done a deal with more than six months of free occupation - unlike some city-centre lettings where income has been postponed for years by landlords desperate to get space filled. It helps when existing tenants do your selling for you. When Arlington set up a 'great debate' on relocation in Bristol last year, NatWest Insurance Services was happy to lecture on the advantages of moving out of the city centre to 50,000 sq ft of offices on Aztec West Business Park. Hoare-Lee, the engineering consultants who have been on the park for three years, went further than praise for the extra parking and better environment, prod- ucing hard figures to prove the benefits of relocation. 'At first they were worried about being separated from clients, but found that customers were delighted to come out and see them,' says Mr Holmes. After logging staff time, this proved a 5 per cent gain in productivity. As the recovery takes effect he expects more companies to look at relocation again. Business tends to be more concentrated among buildings in the 10,000 to 20,000 sq ft range nowadays but low interest rates make owner- occupation attractive, so site sales are likely to improve. Meanwhile, Arlington is continuing to put up a few speculative buildings on each park to ensure the widest range of choice.</p>

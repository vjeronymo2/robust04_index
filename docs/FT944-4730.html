			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Two-board system could tackle contracts Sir, The Cadbury committee was supposed to have taken a good look at corporate governance in the UK. But there still seems to be a good deal of free-floating anxiety on the part of shareholders, and especially institutional shareholders, about some issues, currently the length and nature of directors' contracts and the size of their salaries. This is another matter which could be handled much more effectively if we had a continental-style two-board system, to which Cadbury paid inadequate attention. The single board has few virtues and enables executive management to do what it wants. It is time that shareholders had a more effective voice, as the Germans discovered when they introduced their two-board system in the last century.

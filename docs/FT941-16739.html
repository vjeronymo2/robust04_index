			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Harrods boss moves to settle an old score: Robert Peston explains how Mohamed Fayed is making legal use of his deal with Tiny Rowland Mr Mohamed Fayed is enjoying the spoils of the peace that recently broke out between him and Mr Tiny Rowland, the joint chief executive of Lonrho with whom he had been battling since 1985 over his takeover of Harrods and the House of Fraser group of department stores. Since the entente was reached with Mr Rowland in October, he has received reams of documents from Lonrho. The writ he served yesterday, alleging breach of confidence against Mr Graham Jones, House of Fraser's former finance director, is the first tangible use he has made of them. In 1991, the Bank of England forced Mr Fayed and his two brothers to give up management control of Harrods Bank, a small profitable banking subsidiary of the department store. The Fayeds transferred all voting shares in the bank to an independent trustee, the Law Debenture Trust Corporation, though they retained an economic interest through ownership of the non-voting shares. Mr Fayed had long suspected that Mr Jones had supplied potentially damaging information on the store group to Lonrho, the Bank of England and the Commons treasury committee. However, it is understood that the Bank's action was prompted mainly by the conclusions of a report by Department of Trade and Industry inspectors, published in 1990. The report said that the Fayed brothers had dishonestly misrepresented their origins, wealth and business interests during the Pounds 615m bid for House of Fraser. None the less Mr Fayed was furious with Mr Jones. But he was unable to sue him until Lonrho handed over handwritten notes and typed memoranda purporting to show that Mr Jones gave it sensitive information and used this information to damage House of Fraser. Other documents show that Mr Jones received Pounds 555,418.07 in payments from the Lonrho group of companies between April 1990 and June 26 1991. Mr Fayed had dismissed Mr Jones in early 1990 after he discovered that a business the company had just bought, Modena Engineering, which held a Ferrari motor car franchise, had been making losses. He was angry with Mr Jones for not discovering the losses before the deal was completed. The letter terminating Mr Jones's employment at House of Fraser says that he should not disclose confidential information about the company to outsiders or use such information to harm it. The writ makes several allegations against Mr Jones: He is said to have supplied confidential information to Lonrho which it used in a damaging propaganda document, called 'A Financial Assessment of the Consolidated Personal and Commercial Interests of the Fayeds', published on September 5 1990 and sent to leading bankers and accountants in the City in an attempt to destabilise House of Fraser. He is alleged to have given Lonrho a copy of a draft letter he had written to the governor of the Bank of England, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, now Lord Kingsdown, saying that 'the Fayeds are men whose lack of probity and integrity is abundantly clear and it is inconceivable to me that they could be permitted to remain as holders of a banking licence'. He tried to discredit House of Fraser in conversations with a Bank of England official, Mr Peter Filmer, without disclosing to the Bank that he was being paid by Lonrho. He tried to persuade House of Fraser's lead bank, Midland, to withdraw banking facilities from the department store group, without disclosing he was being paid by Lonrho. He informed the Commons trade and industry committee, which was examining House of Fraser's ownership of Harrods Bank, that its banking facilities would be withdrawn in the following 18 months, without disclosing he was being paid by Lonrho. The writ says that at about the same time as Mr Jones gave Lonrho a copy of his letter to Mr Leigh-Pemberton, Lonrho paid Pounds 100,000 to Mr Jones's account at the Bank in Liechtenstein. A Lonrho memo, authorising the payment, says that payment was in return for 'his assistance with House of Fraser matters'. The memorandum continues: 'As far as possible it (the payment) should be made discreetly'. Mr Jones is also alleged to have provided Lonrho with a memo about the relationship between Mr Fayed and Lord McAlpine, who was then treasurer of the Conservative party. The memo says: 'Alastair McAlpine has attended several meetings with the Fayeds at Harrods and an unknown number at 60 Park Lane (where the Fayeds have offices) since he became treasurer of the Conservative party'. It continues: 'Mohamed Fayed . . . has said 'Alastair McAlpine is good man (sic). He help us, we help him'.' However, it says there is 'no evidence of any donation by the Fayeds to the Conservative party in the accounts of House of Fraser'. Lord McAlpine said yesterday: 'The Fayeds never gave me or the Conservative party any cash.'</p>

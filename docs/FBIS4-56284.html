			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Day to Day" newscast] </F>   [Text] Given that the Change '94 Alliance [of presidential  candidate Ruben Dario Carles] and presidential candidate Mireya  Moscoso de Gruber, of the Arnulfist Party, failed to reach an  agreement, the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] has announced in  Chiriqui Province that it will not support either ticket in the  8 May elections.    PDC presidential candidate Engineer Eduardo Vallarino  pointed  out that his political party had firm plans to renounce his  candidacy, however, a lack of understanding prevented it. The  candidate made this statement during a political campaign event  in western Panama:    [Begin Vallarino recording] This morning, we greeted and  exchanged views with members of the Arnulfist Party here in  Chiriqui. The talks that failed, however, were the ones we held  at my residence in the past few days. First, we invited the  Arnulfist alliance and then Carles' alliance to try to  reconcile, to unite them. Our position was that, if we managed  to get them to reach an agreement to establish a great civilist  alliance, we would support that civilist alliance. This was not  possible because neither candidate was willing to yield to the  other. In view of this, we simply had to put an end to our  efforts.    I repeat, in order to achieve this, we said we would be  willing to renounce our candidacy at a very high political cost  to our party. The unwillingness of the two candidates to  renounce their candidacies created a mathematical impossibility:  there can be no great alliance with two leaders. This  frustrated the talks.

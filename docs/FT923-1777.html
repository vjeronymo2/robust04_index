			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Mitterrand risks the path of direct democracy THE referendum has been an ambiguous and sometimes dangerous weapon for French presidents throughout the 34 years of the fifth republic. Few of them have been able to resist the temptation to appeal directly to the people, for a mixture of reasons: to enforce their own legitimacy, confound their political enemies or simply to get a firm decision on an important national issue. Yesterday's poll was the seventh referendum during the current French constitution and the second called by Mr Franc'ois Mitterrand. Technically, it was the least necessary of all of them. Mr Mitterrand would have been constitutionally entitled to leave it to parliament to ratify the Maastricht Treaty. Indeed, parliament did ratify the treaty last June. Several of the president's government ministers were horrified when he said he would seek a popular vote. They knew it could backfire and turn into a vote against the declining popularity of Mr Mitterrand and his party, rather than a rational decision on Europe. Mr Mitterrand's argument was that French ratification would be worthless without a public debate. Previous referendums have made the risks of direct democracy in France only too clear. Low turnouts have produced distorted results and it has sometimes proved difficult for the electorate to separate the question from the questioner. General de Gaulle is the classic example. He was master of the art, calling no fewer than five referendums. Most were on issues which already commanded public support and so appeared a safe way of bolstering his personal legitimacy. On each occasion, Gen de Gaulle warned the electorate that he would resign if there was a No vote, in contrast to Mr Mitterrand, who has kept his options open and begged voters not to use the referendum as a presidential plebiscite. In the end, Gen de Gaulle fell into his own trap and resigned after a 1969 vote on decentralisation and reform of the senate, the upper house of parliament. Mr Mitterrand has tried to avoid the same fate by asking the electorate to wait until elections next March to vote on the Socialists' record. Gen de Gaulle claimed that the referendum was the cleanest and most honest democratic practice possible, pointing to the 1789 declaration on the rights of man, which speaks of citizens' rights to take a personal part in the formation of laws. His critics argued that he used referendums partly to go over the head of parliament, an institution he never really respected. Since 1969, French presidents have been more or less keen to use referendums. Mr Georges Pompidou called a referendum only once, in 1972, to ratify the entry into the European Community of Britain, Ireland, Denmark and Norway. (Oslo later withdrew its application, as the result of another referendum which backfired famously.) Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing steered clear of referendums altogether during his presidency from 1974 to 1981. It was Mr Mitterrand who reintroduced the practice, with a poll in 1988 on a new statute for New Caledonia, a French overseas territory. Not surprisingly, this obscure question produced a bored response, with a turnout of barely 37 per cent. Perhaps it was a sign that the French electorate had started to lose the old feeling that every referendum was a vote for or against the president. Even so, polls taken during the Maastricht campaign indicate that last night's result will have been the outcome of a complex mixture of French feeling about Maastricht, about Europe generally and about Mr Mitterrand personally.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------              REFERENDUMS UNDER THE FIFTH REPUBLIC 1958-1988  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Date          Subject to vote                 Percent     Percent m                                             Yes vote  Absentions  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sept  1958    Adoption of Fifth Republic               consitution                       82.6       20.16 Jan   1961    Algerian self determination       74.99      26.24 April 1962    Evian accords                     90.81      24.66 Oct   1962    Election of French president               by universal suffrage             62.25      23.03 April 1969    Reform of regions and senate      47.59      19.87 April 1972    Enlargement of European               Community                         68.32      39.76 Nov   1988    Self determination for               New Caledonia                     80         63.10  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

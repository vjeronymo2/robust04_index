Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of the opposition movement  "Rukh", agreed with him saying "the presidential elections in  the Crimea should have been cancelled before they started".    Yuri Shukhevich, head of the ultra-right paramilitary  UNA-UNSO organization, went further saying the Crimean  developments were "Israeli intrigues".    Several west-Ukrainian politicians questioned by ITAR-TASS  on  the matter, joined in opinion that the results of the Crimean  elections are only the beginning of the federalization of  Ukraine.    Moreover, they predicted that following the Crimean example,  the next province to claim the sovereignity will be Galicia or  the Transcarpathian part of the Ukraine. Last year the attempts  to proclaim there an independent state were strangled by the  parliament.</p>

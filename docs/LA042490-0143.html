			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> WAXING RELIGIOUS: Not all the attractions developed by Allen Parkinson, founder  of Movieland Wax Museum who hopes to create a "Life of Christ" wax museum in  Anaheim (D1), have survived. . . . An earlier Buena Park creation, the Japanese  Village and Deer Park, went belly up (and antlers down) four years after  Parkinson and his partners sold the successful attraction to Six Flags Inc.  Before the park was sold again, in 1976, more than half the 320 deer died of  tuberculosis and a tiger mauled a guard. Mark I. Pinsky and David Reyes  </P></p>

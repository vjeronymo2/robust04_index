			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COOLING INFLATION MAY CURB INTEREST HIKES, BRADY SAYS  </P> <P> Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said today that inflation seems to be  cooling off and suggested there may be no reason to raise interest rates  further.  </P> <P> Although the White House and the Federal Reserve have sometimes squabbled in  recent months over the inflation threat, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated  Wednesday that he, too, wants to wait and see what impact the central bank's  recent credit tightening will have on the economy.  </P> <P> In a speech to the National Assn. of Manufacturers, Brady acknowledged  differences of opinion but said the Administration is as determined as the  Federal Reserve to curb inflation.  </P> <P> "It is possible to have different interpretations of the same economic  statistics and still share the same goal of fighting inflation," he said.  </P></p>

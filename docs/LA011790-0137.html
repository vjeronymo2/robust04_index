			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> U.S. OIL PRODUCTION DIPS IN '89  </P> <P> Domestic oil production in 1989 took the steepest yearly fall in history, and  petroleum imports rose to a 10-year high, the industry said today.  </P> <P> The American Petroleum Institute, the trade association of the major oil  companies, also said that while U.S. oil consumption increased only slightly,  imports rose to 46% of total supplies.  </P> <P> That was the second-highest level on record.  </P> <P> The figures confirm a continued decline of the domestic oil industry and are  expected to add heat to a debate in Congress this year over whether exploration  and production companies should get new tax breaks to stimulate drilling  activity.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has argued that declining U.S. oil production and  increasing reliance on foreign producers is undermining national energy  security.  </P></p>

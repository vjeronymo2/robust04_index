			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Aruba Opposition Wants to </F> Participate in Crisis Cabinet"]    [Excerpts] Rotterdam, 19 Apr -- A so-called "crisis  cabinet" may be formed in Aruba to adopt a number of emergency  measures in the financial and economic domain and organize new  elections. Yesterday [18 April], opposition leader H. Eman said  that he was prepared to look into the possibility of working  together with the MEP [People's Electoral Movement] of Prime  Minister N. Oduber.    On Sunday evening [17 April], Oduber let it be known that  his  second cabinet has fallen and that he now intended to lose no  time in exploring the possibility of forming a broad coalition  with AVP [Aruban People's Party] leader Eman. Oduber said that  he no longer had any confidence in his two small coalition  partners, the PPA [Aruban Patriotic Party] and ADN [National  Democratic Union], each of which had one seat in the parliament.  The second Oduber cabinet, which only had the support of 11 out  of 21 seats in parliament, lasted for approximately one year.  Together, the MEP and AVP have 18 seats.    In a telephone conversation with NRC HANDELSBLAD, Eman said  he was demanding early elections as a precondition for any  possible cooperation with Oduber. A broad coalition between the  two major parties that rode out the entire parliamentary session  until the elections in 1997 was, he considered, a "station we  have already passed." [passage omitted]    On Sunday, however, the cabinet crumbled. Differences of  opinion regarding financial and economic policy and especially a  severe round of cuts for the government were the cause.  Political observers in Oranjestad believe that the reason for  the cabinet crisis was a row about the dismissal of the director  of a housing association, aggravated by the subsequent  nomination to that position of a future son-in-law of ADN  Parliamentarian Charo Kelly.    If the social plan of his AVP is implemented for the main  part, then after early elections opposition leader Eman could  bear the responsibility of government together with the MEP.  The main thrust of the social plan involves the more honest  distribution of income in Aruba, "the richest country in the  Caribbean region." According to the plan, the payments made to  pensioners and the recipients of benefits had to be increased.  [passage omitted]    "If a provisional crisis cabinet is formed, then the AVP  will  prove flexible," said Eman, who is not demanding the premiership  although his party is slightly larger in terms of the number of  votes than that led by Oduber. "That will only become an issue  when the Aruban electorate has once again voted and we know how  the division of power looks," he said.    On Sunday evening [17 April], Oduber regretted that his  second cabinet had made such little progress with financial and  administrative reorganization. "The present coalition has never  known peace and stability; there has always been a lack of  cooperation." Previously, he had criticized the "patronage  policy" of the small parties, i.e., the appointment of friends  to governmental or semi-governmental posts. "We have made  mistakes and they must be rectified," he said in November, in an  interview with NRC HANDELSBLAD. "Too many officials have been  appointed and too much tax liability has been imposed in too  short a time."</p>

Posts and outposts periodically come under unprovoked fire from  Afghan territory.    In the last five days the border guards of the Pyandzh  border  detachment stopped three attempts of armed groups of mojahedin  of the Tajik opposition to break through the border from  Afghanistan. Fortunately, there have been no losses among the  Russian servicemen.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Price Waterhouse faces renewed action PRICE WATERHOUSE, the accountancy firm, faces the prospect of renewed legal action over its role as auditor to BCCI after demands from plaintiffs in a US precedent-setting lawsuit to re-try its case. Milberg Weiss, the law firm bringing the suit against 77 defendants including PW, lodged a document with the California central district court yesterday requesting 'vacation' of a ruling at the end of last month that its case should be dismissed. Judge Consuelo Marshall dismissed the case - believed to have cost PW more than Dollars 250,000 (Pounds 140,000) a month in legal fees - on April 30. That left the plaintiffs the option of appealing to a higher court. Milberg Weiss alleged yesterday that there was a conflict of interest by two of Judge Marshall's law clerks. It claimed that they had worked on the BCCI lawsuit after accepting employment from law firms representing key defendants in other BCCI actions. It says it initially notified the court of its concerns after Judge Marshall's preliminary ruling on the case at the end of March. The documents say the class action suit is being brought by a handful of plaintiffs on behalf of approximately 800,000 depositors who have lost in aggregate Dollars 8bn-Dollars 10bn.</p>

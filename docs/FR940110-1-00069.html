			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Calculation of AHP Subsidy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board is considering adopting rules on the calculation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP subsidies for subsidized advances and specifically requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments on the following proposals. Under consideration is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether AHP application approvals should commit to provide a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dollar amount of subsidy, or should commit to make a subsidized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advance at a specific interest rate. Another possibility is that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Bank can select on a case-by-case basis to do one or the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or both but the choice must be specified in its approval. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule could require the Bank's AHP implementation plan to describe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Bank's procedures in this area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board specifically requests comments as to whether an AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval should commit to provide a specific dollar amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidy for a subsidized advance. If interest rates rise after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the approval, should the interest rate on the subsidized advance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be increased so that the present value of the amount needed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidize the reduction in interest rate is equal to the subsidy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount originally approved? Should the applicant be given the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option of either reducing the principal amount of the loan and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> keeping the originally requested interest rate unchanged, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing the interest rate on the loan and keeping the principal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of the loan unchanged? If interest rates fall after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval, should the specific dollar amount of approved subsidy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stay the same, or be adjusted?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatively, if the AHP approval commits to make a subsidized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan at a specified interest rate, then a number of issues are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raised. First, should the amount of the subsidy to be charged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against the AHP fund be calculated at the time the application is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved, or at the time of disbursement. If the calculation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not done at the time the application is approved but is done at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time of funding and interest rates have fallen since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval, the amount of the subsidy provided to subsidize the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advance would decrease and the amount of subsidy charged against  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the AHP fund would decrease. If the calculation is done at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time of funding and interest rates have risen since the approval,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the amount of the subsidy provided to subsidize the advance would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase and the amount of subsidy charged against the AHP fund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would increase. If the increase in subsidy is permitted to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charged against the AHP fund, should there be any limits on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of increase in subsidy? If the amount that could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charged against the AHP fund could be increased without limit,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these charges could reduce the amount of funds available for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future cycles of AHP funding. One option would be to put an upper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit, for example a specified number of basis points, as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum amount by which additional AHP funds would be provided to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cover the interest rate increase. Another option would be to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approve the amount of the subsidy as well as the interest rate on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the advance at the time the advance is approved and permit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidy to be increased up to a specified amount. Another issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is whether funds from future AHP funding cycles should be used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pay for increased subsidies due to interest rate increases. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board specifically requests comments on these options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board is concerned about the calculation of subsidies where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-amortizing subsidized advances are used by members to fund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amortizing AHP loans from members to sponsors. Since principal is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repaid on a different schedule for amortizing loans than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-amortizing loans, the Banks must adjust their subsidy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation methodologies to ensure that they have properly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjusted for these differences. As AHP principal is repaid to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> member but not repaid to the Bank, the benefit of these subsidized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds may not be passed on to the ultimate borrower, as required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in section 10(j)(9)(E) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(E).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Without proper adjustment for differences in the cash flows for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amortizing loan and an interest-only advance, the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidy actually received by a project will be less than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount incurred by the Bank as an AHP expense. The Board  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically requests comments as to whether an amortizing advance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structure is required to assure that the subsidy amount incurred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Bank as an AHP expense matches the amount of the subsidy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actually received by a sponsor. In addition, the Board requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments as to whether there are alternative appropriate methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to deal with the discrepancy in the subsidy amounts where such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advances are used to fund amortizing loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Verification at Initial Disbursement of Subsidized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advances or Direct Subsidies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

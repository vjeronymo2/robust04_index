			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Kellogg faces second complaint UNITED Norwest Co-operatives has become the second retailer to report Kellogg, the breakfast cereal giant, to the Office of Fair Trading for cutting off its corn flake supplies. The move follows a similar complaint to the OFT last week from Shoprite, the Isle of Man-based discount retailer which has 40 stores in Scotland. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, tabled a Commons question to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, asking him to investigate the Shoprite/Kellogg dispute. United Norwest Co-operatives, one of the 10 biggest food retailers in Britain, gave away coupons offering 10p off a 500 gramme packet of corn flakes in a door-to-door leaflet promotion for its Discount Giant supermarkets. That defied a Kellogg letter to the grocery trade in January imposing on 500g packets a minimum price of 96p, since raised to Pounds 1.02. In retaliation Kellogg has stopped all cornflake supplies - of whatever packet size - to all the group's stores, including its Normid, Shopping Giant and Late Shop outlets, where the vouchers could not be used. Attempts to get alternative supplies from food wholesalers have failed. Mr Robert Cawley, United Norwest's buying controller, said yesterday: 'They have told us Kellogg will stop their supplies if they sell to us.' The Co-op, which before Christmas was selling 500g packets of cornflakes for as little as 80p, is alleging unfair trading and discrimination. Mr Cawley said several competitors had been honouring the Co-op's 10p-off-Kellogg's vouchers to win business, but Kellogg has not stopped their supplies. Evidence to the OFT includes till receipts from competitors showing that the discount had been applied to Kellogg's 500g cornflakes. Although Kellogg gets the same wholesale price, cheap cornflakes in the shops can distort competition with Kellogg's other cereals, especially when these are being promoted in national advertising. Kellogg said yesterday: 'It is unreasonable for retailers to use Kellogg's brands as loss-leaders in order to build their overall business. With immediate effect we will discontinue supplies to those retailers or wholesalers who sell below cost for the purpose of loss-leading.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Recently, (Misac), a former French minister, came  to Phnom Penh and went around asking about the so-called  successor to His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk.    (Misac)'s activity can be compared to a merchant getting  ready to buy a tiger's hide. This is France's policy and  preparation for Cambodia in line with its obsolete colonialist  system.    During this trip to sound out the opinion on this important  issue, (Misac) received answers from various sources as follows:    First opinion: The persons qualified to succeed his majesty  are members of the Duang Dynasty's Norodom and Sisowat lines,  such as His Royal Highness [HRH] Prince Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh, Norodom Chakkrapong, HRH Prince Kromluong Yuveakneat,  and Prince Norodom Sihamoni.    Second opinion: The Vietnamese communists and their puppets  want Norodom Chakkrapong to succeed His Majesty Norodom  Sihanouk. They have also put Chea Sim's name on the list to  succeed his majesty, saying that Chea Sim has been given a royal  title. He has ordered the masses and government officials to  use royal language when addressing him and to call his wife the  royal consort.    The people in Phnom Penh ridiculed traitor Chea Sim,  likening  him to the lizard with a golden ring. They asked, who asked  (Misac) to come to Phnom Penh to arrange an heir to His Majesty  King Norodom Sihanouk's throne -- the outstanding leader and  father of the nation, of national reconciliation, and of peace  -- who is respected and loved by the entire nation?    The Cambodian nation and people asked, who wanted this man  to  raise the question of reigning on the throne in the current  Cambodian situation when the nation and people are suffering  from great and most serious misery due to both national and  social problems and despite the fact that His Majesty King  Norodom Sihanouk still continues as the esteemed and beloved  outstanding leader of the nation and people?    The nation and people also expressed anger with the  Vietnamese communists and their puppets for trying to elevate  the traitorous clique, their out-and-out flunky to the throne in  Cambodia.    His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk has stated clearly that the  reigning king must have good quality and virtue and always be  concerned about the national and people's interests and the  national unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of  Cambodia. The entire Cambodian nation and people are in unity  with His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk. Therefore, France, the  Vietnamese communists, or any other foreigners have no right to  arrange any successor to the throne for serving them and  destroying the Cambodian nation and people.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (10): Count the cost, not the ozone - Acquisition Policies CARS CREATE more than their fair share of pollution, some environmentalists suggest, and they damage the ozone layer. In the UK about half the new cars sold are bought by companies. Yet environmental concerns are having very little impact on company car acquisition policies. Fleet managers are still primarily interested in finan- cial criteria when choosing cars for their fleets. For example, the 1992-93 survey of company car schemes by Company Secretary's Review magazine, published by Tolley, shows the cost of the car is by far the most important consideration when companies are deciding which cars to buy. The discount available, resale value and fuel consumption also rank highly in acquisition policies. Most car fleet decision-makers do not think the availability of a catalytic converter on a car makes it particularly desirable. They place it at the bottom of a list of desirable factors that the magazine put forward for consideration. However, another survey shows that environmental concerns are gradually penetrating the minds of decision-makers, even if reaction to these concerns is limited. According to Hertz Leasing's report, 'The Company Car in Context,' 51 per cent of those responsible for car acquisition policy agree that running a fleet contributes to the UK's environmental problems. But what are they doing about it? Hertz Leasing found that 79 per cent had considered using unleaded petrol, 47 per cent had evaluated specifying catalytic converters, 38 per cent had considered diesel engined cars, and 7 per cent had thought about using smaller engined cars in the fleet. Hertz says the most popular 'green' response - the use of unleaded petrol in fleet cars - was predictable as all new cars delivered in the UK have had to be able to run on unleaded fuel since 1989 and the price differential between leaded and unleaded fuel acts as a financial incentive for a switch to unleaded. The report also points out that this switch does not do too much for the environment because unleaded fuel emits about the same level of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons as its leaded equivalent. Hertz also suggests that 'it is likely the high statistic for catalytic converters is related to a tendency for more expensive, manager/director cars to have them fitted as standard equipment'. There was considerable resistance among fleet managers to the use of diesel, said to be a more efficient, cost-effective and less environmentally damaging fuel. However, they seemed 'highly predisposed' to using electric cars once these vehicles become a viable proposition and 70 per cent said they would consider adding them to their fleets. Of the companies surveyed, 23 per cent boldly told Hertz that environmental factors had not the slightest influence on their company car acquisition policies. However, a similar percentage said such factors had had a 'significant' influence. It was to be expected that UK companies would be more interested in saving money than saving the planet when acquiring cars, after all they have been struggling in the worst recession for 60 years and first things have to come first. Essentially, corporations have three choices available when buying cars: outright purchase or finance lease with in-house management; purchase or finance lease with outside management; and contract hire (operating lease) with lease company management. There seems to have been a substantial shift in sentiment at big companies away from outright purchase as the recession began to bite severely in 1990-91. The Monks Partnership remuneration consultancy group reported in its 1992 survey, 'Company Car Policy in the UK,' that, whereas the previous year companies reporting had bought 61 per cent of their cars by outright purchase, the latest statistics showed only 57 per cent were bought by this method. Monks reported: 'Contract hire and leasing have increased in popularity as a method of acquisition in larger companies, while there has been a return to outright purchase in smaller companies.' From the fleet manager's point of view, contract hire takes away nearly all the administrative problems associated with running a car fleet and permits clear and accurate budgeting. Of course, monthly rentals have to reflect the cost of providing this range of services, plus some profit for the contract hire company. However, contract hire companies running big national fleets can obtain huge discounts from the car makers and also buy their servicing and repair at only a fraction of the retail rates - benefits they can reflect in charges to clients. An alternative to contract hire has recently emerged: contract purchase. Here the customer continues to have the advantages of fixed costs associated with contract hire - a useful aid to accurate budgeting - but can also claim writing-down allowances. This method tends to be beneficial for more expensive cars - those costing Pounds 22,000 or more. Monks Partnership reckons that about 3 per cent of companies are now using contract purchase compared with 24 per cent using contract hire. Company Secretary's Review looks at the market in a slightly different way - at the number of cars covered by different types of acquisition methods. Its latest survey shows that contract hire and outright purchase account for 90 per cent of car acquisitions, shared about equally between the two methods. The magazine says that the main attraction cited for contract hire was that no capital outlay was required, 'with simplification in budgeting and administration also very important.' The magazine's study shows the vast majority of companies using contract hire have a full maintenance package.</p>

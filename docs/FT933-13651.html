			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Records: Hell-for-leather down the sax OF THE quick and the dead, Jackie McLean's alto sound comes out of the horn at you like a turbo-charged kazoo. A direct inheritor of the Charlie Parker bop tradition, McLean puts his unmistakeable music firmly into the listeners' ear and, like his friend and mentor, leaves it there until the recipient feels a little dizzy. Where other saxophonists turn their instrument inside out to realise their ideas, the McLean technique is to find a line and then proceed hell-for-leather down it in breakneck improvisation, relying on hairpin bends for excitement rather than harmonic humps. So it is with the new live recording, made in 1991 and appropriately titled The Jackie Mac Attack (Birdology 519 270 2). The appeal of any McLean band lies more in its insistency than its scope. They can and do turn a ballad, but the leader's tartness is put to best use in the driving originals which feature on this latest recordings. Appearing earlier this week at the Union Chapel in a sextet, son Rene and trombonist Steve Davis provided some angles to augment the linear acceleration of father's playing. The new record, however, with Hotep Idris Galeta (who shares the writing) at the keyboard, Nat Reeves on bass and Carl Allen in the traps, has McLean plaintively and hypnotically 'on' for most of its 55 minutes. Another speed freak saxophonist, Johnny Griffin, has a new disc Dance of Passion (Antilles 512 604-2) which sheds new, softer light on the tenor fireball. Catch Griffin live and you are likely to come away with your hair standing on end after a no holds barred hard bop session. These sides, however, add tuba, French horn and trombone to the standard piano quartet format, to produce an altogether more measured affair. The dance is slow and the passion smouldering. Set against a sturdy but agile brass section (notably Steve Turre's talking trombone), the Griffin tenor stretches out beautifully across original compositions tenderly arranged by pianist Michael Weiss. A blue interlude in The Way It Is allows close examination of Griff's technique while All Through The Night has a more familiar Griff blowing lightning changes. Don Pullen's new Ode To Life (Blue Note CDP 0777 7 89233 29) finds the usually explosive pianist in an uncharacteristically subdued mood. But this is a pianist who delights in every setting and the African-Brazilian Connection has Pullen's glissando spreading across samba syncopations, flamenco inflections and African dance. A dark hued work, the disc features a sad, rolling tribute to his sideman of many years, saxophonist George Adams who died last year. The track 'Ah George, We Hardly Knew Ya' employs altoist Carlos Ward's supple sound to moving effect. Notable among the reissues, which abound, is a swinging selection of late guitarist Grand Green's groovier works The Best of Grant Green (Blue Note 0777 789622 29) Prodigious though erratic in output until drugs finally stopped him, Green could swing with the fastest of them. This 75 minute compilation shows him at his funkiest and fittest. Another from the Blue Note stale that returns repeatedly to the turntable is a 11961 collaboration between radiant vocalist Nancy Wilson and sweet toned altoist, the late Cannonball Adderley (Capitol Jazz 0777 7 8120421). Joined by brother Nat on cornet, Joe Zawinul (piano), Sam Jones (bass) and Louis Hayes (drums) they create 42 minutes of condensed pleasure with a mixture of originals and standards.</p>

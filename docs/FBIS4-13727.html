			<p>BFN     [Text] As the government ordered a massive crackdown on  Arab nationals, a majority of them has reportedly crossed into  Afghanistan despite the authorities' claim that the border is  sealed.    An Arab national, when asked to explain his future line of  action said: "I am here as I pledged to the provincial  government that I would stay here and not cross into Afghanistan  but a majority of the Arabs have crossed the border and the  agencies could not arrest them".    It may be mentioned here that April 18 was the deadline  given  to the nationals of Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt by the federal  government. These nationals have appealed to the provincial and  federal governments to extend the date of their extradition but  the appeal was refused.    In this connection, a meeting was held at the Governor's  House which was also attended by the commissioner Afghan  refugees and the home secretary. The meeting decided to launch  a massive crackdown on the Arab nationals. The task was  assigned to the special branch but a senior branch official said  that he had not so far received any directives from any quarter.  He said that he was busy in a number of other assignments.    A provincial government official said that orders would  definitely be implemented by the federal government and no  extension in this regard would be possible. He said that 15  nationals of Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt had left Pakistan for  their respective countries. The Arabs who had got air tickets  or exit permits would be allowed to stay till tomorrow (Friday).  Protection would be provided to the family members of those  arrested under 14 foreign act. [sentence as published]    It is to be noted here that the present government had  thrice  given extension to the nationals of three countries. They had  been here ever since the start of Afghan war. The health and  construction work in Afghanistan was said be supervised by them.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Hi-Tec chiefs unwind US options FOUR EXECUTIVES at Hi-Tec, the sports shoe and leisure wear group, are being paid Pounds 2.5m in cash and shares to unwind their original options over the company's US business. Hi-Tec yesterday announced details of a complicated deal which it said would free the company to seek an efficient equity injection for its rapidly growing US business. The four executives - including main board director Mr Terry Mackness who joined the US operation in 1988 - have options over 13 per cent of Hi-Tec Sports USA. Mr Peter Butler, finance director, said that under the original agreement their stakes could not be diluted. This meant that the directors would have to be paid a proportion of any equity injection into the US business. 'We agreed with the management that they should exercise their options now,' Mr Butler said. The value of their stake at the option price is Dollars 1.6m, valuing the US business at Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.8m). However, the executives have agreed to sell back 8.5 per cent of the 13 per cent stake for Dollars 2.6m in cash and the issue of 1.4m shares in the parent company. They will receive Dollars 1.6m in cash, offsetting the cost of exercising the options. Three of the four executives will also receive a 3 per cent stake in the quoted parent as payment, while one US director has opted for a deferred cash sum of Dollars 1m. The executives will then be granted options over a further 6.5 per cent in the US business, exercisable in three years at a total cost of Dollars 3.6m. Mr Butler said this valued the US business at Dollars 44m. Hi-Tec's shares closed 2p lower at 60p, for a market value of Pounds 28m.</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                                  In an evident effort to strengthen Cairo's control over the  countryside--particularly in areas affected by Islamic militant  violence--the government has pushed through parliament  legislation abolishing the election of village leaders in favor  of their appointment by the Interior Ministry.  Supporters of the  change argued that many elected officials were unwilling to  cooperate with the Ministry in maintaining security in the  villages.  Roundly opposed by opposition officials and even by a  number of ruling party deputies, the move continues Cairo's  retreat in recent years from the democratization of local  government--a trend probably inspired in large part by the  current Islamic unrest.                                       END SUMMARY     Egypt's People's Assembly on 10 April approved a controversial  bill abolishing the current system for choosing the "'umdah," or  village mayor, and the assistant to the 'umdah known as "shaykh  al-balad" (Al-Ahram international edition, 11 April).  Under the  new law, the country's 3500 'umdahs and more than 20,000 shaykhs-  -posts filled by election in one form or another since 1957--will  be appointed by the Interior Ministry (See Note 1).  In a  statement later repeated by Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi,  Minister of State for People's Assembly and Consultative Council  Affairs Kamal al-Shadhili explained the change to the People's  Assembly by asserting that more than 3O percent of the 'umdah  posts have long been vacant "because the security situation is  not stable" enough for elections to be held or because of  disputes between village clans over election results (Al-Akhbar,  29 March, Al-Ahram international edition, 1 April).  In defending  the bill, Ahmad Abu-Zayd, representing the parliamentary majority  bloc of the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP), asserted that  the election system has "led to corruption of the administrative  process" (Al-Ahram international edition, 29 April)--presumably  because of the strong financial and political power concentrated  in the hands of some village families.     (Note 1) Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi has said that the  'umdahs will be appointed by the Ministry on the basis of  recommendations by several committees, probably comprising, inter  alia, security officials, judges, and officials from his  ministry, which will review nominations from each village (Al-  Ahram international edition, 1 April).     Reaction to "Terrorism"     Proponents mostly refrained from  directly referring to Islamic extremists when defending the bill,  but they clearly alluded to them.  For example:     --According to the daily paper of the liberal centrist Al-Wafd  party, Abu-Zayd asserted during the parliamentary debate that  "the importance of the law flows from the circumstances that the  country is currently undergoing" (Al-Wafd, 29 March).     --In a similar vein, Kamal Henri Badir, chairman of the  assembly's Defense and National Security Committee, reportedly  said he could find "no excuse for the uproar against this bill  because whoever is familiar with the country's interest knows  that security is the most important thing right now."  Implying  that 'umdahs often conspire with villagers to cover up terrorist  and other criminal activity, he lamented that "village gangs have  made it impossible for the elected 'umdah to inform [the security  authorities] of any abnormal activity among those who elected  him" (Al-Akhbar, 29 March).  According to Al-Ahram, Badir claimed  that even though the 'umdahs are a part of the central authority  and receive their instructions from the Interior Ministry," a  fear of losing votes has prompted them to "close their eyes to  the crimes that take place in the villages" (29 March).     --Interior Minister al-Alfi told Al-Ahram that the 'umdah is  responsible for "informing [the security authorities] promptly of  any strangers entering the village or living in it, and working  to prevent crime before it happens" (Al-Ahram international  edition, 1 April).  An article in Al-Ahram's international  edition said al-Alfi explained that the law "aims to tighten the  fist of the security [organs] over the villages and choke off the  sources of extremism and terrorism" (23 March).     --Muhammad Juwayli, a deputy of the ruling National Democratic  Party (NDP), asserted during the debate that opponents of the  bill are attempting to "outdo each other" in criticizing the  legislation as a "retreat from democracy" and are "ignoring  today's priority of confronting terrorism which threatens  everyone--the majority [party] and the opposition" (Al-Ahram  international edition, 29 March).     Opposition to the Bill     As Juwayli pointed out, opposition party leaders and others have  strongly protested that the bill is a retreat from democracy.  Nu'man Jum'ah, deputy head of the opposition al-Wafd party, was  cited as asking rhetorically why all deputies of the People's  Assembly should not be appointed for the same reasons used to  justify the bill on appointing 'umdahs (Al-Akhbar Al-Yawm, 13  March).  Even before the bill was submitted to the People's  Assembly, Muslim Brotherhood official Mukhtar Nuh, treasurer of  the Lawyers Syndicate, protested that the bill is part of a trend  in recent years to replace elections with appointments, citing a  February 1993 law that provides for the appointment of temporary  boards to govern professional syndicates that fail to draw a  third of their eligible voters to internal elections.     A number of NDP deputies have also expressed strong opposition to  the bill.  Following the bill's approval by the National Defense  and Security Committee, Al-Ahram's regular party politics page  claimed  that "a majority of NDP deputies" still opposed the bill  (Al-Ahram international edition, 16 March).  An Al-Wafd account  of the committee's debate on the bill reported that some NDP  representatives strongly attacked the bill.  One reportedly  accused the committee chairman of attempting to ram the  legislation through "dictatorially," leaving insufficient time  for review.  The deputy suggested sarcastically that the 'umdah  position should be renamed "Interior Ministry informer" (23  February).     Despite dissent among ruling party representatives, the People's  Assembly approved the bill on 1O April with only 26 of the body's  454 members voting no and one abstaining--underscoring the  government's determination to see the legislation enacted.  One  Al-Ahram commentator observed during the bill's passage through  the People's Assembly that "for the first time in a long period,  strict party discipline has returned to the majority deputies" so  as to allow for the "liberation" of the law on 'umdahs and  shaykhs by the parliament (Al-Ahram international edition, 29  March).     Retreat From Decentralization     The government's move to appoint 'umdahs and shaykhs marks  another step back from political decentralization and  liberalization, a retreat that began prior to the November 1992  local council elections.  Before those elections Cairo considered  but rejected a plan to make the local council electoral system  less biased in favor of the ruling NDP and give opposition and  independent candidates a fairer chance.  However, the government  ultimately changed its mind, evidently prompted in large part by  concern over the wave of Islamic violence that had begun the  previous spring (See Note 2).     (Note 2) See the Trends of 28 October 1992, pages 24-3O.     Implications     As with the 1992 decision on preserving the old local council  elections system, the recent move to appoint 'umdahs and shaykhs  appears largely a reaction to the current Islamic unrest.  The  parliament's debate of the issue underscores not only the  contentiousness of the new law but also the independence being  displayed by some NDP deputies since the last parliamentary  elections in 199O.  Opposition party officials, for their part,  will probably use the government's passage of this legislation to  question the government's good faith as the latter proceeds with  plans for a "national dialogue" of Egyptians representing diverse  political orientations, called for by President Mubarak last  November.

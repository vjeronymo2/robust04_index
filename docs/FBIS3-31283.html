			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jan Maria Rokita, Sejm deputy for the </F> Democratic Union and former chief of the Office of the Council  of Ministers, by Ryszard Rybus; place and date not given:  "Pawlak's Pyrrhic Victory; Conversation with Jan Maria Rokita"]    [Text] [Rybus] Does the recent coalition crisis and the  way it was resolved represent a stabilization of the governing  arrangement, or the beginning of its collapse?    [Rokita] It means neither. It is obvious that the governing  coalition's deep crisis, which is linked--this is my  impression--not to differences of opinions on substantive  issues, but rather to a struggle for power inside the cabinet,  neither strengthens nor stabilizes the government. On the  contrary, the crisis destabilizes and weakens the government, it  ruins its social reputation.    But on the other hand, I am not very eager to draw hasty  conclusions from the crisis or to say that the coalition is on  the verge of collapsing. The will of being in power is a strong  cementing factor for the coalition. For the Democratic Left  Alliance [SLD], and in particular for the old Polish United  Workers Party [PZPR] apparatus, being in power has an enormous  psychological significance because it means a kind of  compensation for the last four years. For the Polish Peasant  Party [PSL] in turn, being in power is a fulfillment of Waldemar  Pawlak's "immemorial" aspirations to be the head of government;  he will not give that up easily.    [Rybus] So you do not agree with the view that the unanimous  showing of who in the coalition is in charge, indirectly means  the coalition's stabilization since there are no longer two  equal partners who could argue over leadership?    [Rokita] The effects of the crisis undoubtedly mean a defeat  for Aleksander Kwasniewski. But they also represent Waldemar  Pawlak's Pyrrhic victory.    [Rybus] [No question published]    [Rokita] The price paid for the victory in the battle for  spheres of influence, was a decrease in public esteem, which has  very negative consequences for the prime minister.    Apart from that, my view is that one cannot really speak of  Prime Minister Pawlak's domination in the coalition since Marek  Borowski's departure as a result of the dispute (and  Kwasniewski's disavowal of him, including a brutal description)  also represents a success by the PZPR apparatus which had  clearly disliked Borowski. To a certain extent, the result of  the dispute we are talking about here also strengthens  Kwasniewski, but not as a leader of reformers within SLD, but as  a real leader of the apparatus, as a leader who wants to  implement the interests of the apparatus and for that goal, he  is willing to betray and abandon his political friends.    [Rybus] Regardless of different views on the manner in which  the prime minister resolved the conflict, it would be hard to  deny political efficiency to him and PSL. A party which gained  as many votes as the Democratic Union [UD] and the  Liberal-Democratic Congress [KLD]--but far fewer votes than the  SLD--is gradually acquiring an indivisible power.    [Rokita] I do not share that view. The crisis centered  around [former Deputy Finance Minister] Kawalec and [former  Finance Minister] Borowski, only shows a lack of the efficiency  of influence by so-called SLD reformers, which by the way was  easily predictable. But it does not mean a decline in influence  by the hard-line, postcommunist apparatus. Forcing the chief of  the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic and of SLD to get  rid of Borowski, over whose candidacy for the post of finance  minister he [Kwasniewski] had fought vigorously, is, like I  already said, Pawlak's Pyrrhic victory. It is also a real  victory by the PZPR-derived apparatus.    In my view, the conclusion regarding PSL's domination as a  result of the dispute we are talking about here, is completely  false.    [Rybus] So if the postcommunist apparatus is now gaining  victory within SLD, that means you uphold your argument you had  declared immediately after the elections, about UD's refusal to  take part in any coalition arrangements with SLD?    [Rokita] I have always said--and I do so now--that the  political logic set in motion during the election campaign will  force Kwasniewski to either lose ground in the party which will  finally "spit him out," or to take the leadership of a communist  apparatus.    To put it briefly: I have never believed--and I continue not  to believe--in the governing parties' ability to reform  themselves. That is why I have been and still am in favor of a  tough opposition by UD.    [Rybus] That explains your assessment of a famous statement  by [UD Deputy Chairman] Wladyslaw Frasyniuk ....    [Rokita] I think Frasyniuk's statement was a political  mistake. And that is not just how I feel, but it is also the  assessment of practically all of UD, including party Chairman  Mazowiecki, and chairman of the parliamentary club Geremek. The  mistake was made clear to Frasyniuk in harsh terms during party  meetings.    But is it also true that his intentions were distorted by  sensation-seeking media. Pay attention that Frasyniuk had not  made an appeal for UD to come to alliance with SLD, not today,  and not at any time in the future. On the contrary, he is the  kind of member of UD who is in favor of a strong opposition  stand toward SLD. But what he also thinks--and that is an  interesting view, even though I do not agree with it--is that  under a situation where Aleksander Kwasniewski and the PZPR  apparatus abandon leaders of the reform wing, there should be  someone to publicly speak of these people in kind terms. There  is no doubt that Borowski had played a positive role in Pawlak's  cabinet.    [Rybus] So, regarding UD's opposition nature, do you regard  it as necessary to maintain it until the end of this  parliament's term?    [Rokita] Yes, I do. To construct a government with UD's  participation, or with the participation of the club of a new  party which will be formed after unification with KLD--that is  not possible under the parliament which was elected on 19  September. What is possible, is a collapse of the governing  coalition and one could imagine some strange forms of a  government which would be openly antireform (even though I  regard them as not very likely), but I cannot imagine a  situation where UD, with this parliamentary composition, could  find partners for itself with whom to establish a majority  coalition. There are no such partners, nor will there ever be,  until the end of term of this parliament, which does not  necessarily mean that I think the term will last four years.  After the recent events, a four-year term seems less and less  likely, especially given that in the middle of the term we will  have presidential elections which always change the political  scene everywhere.</p>

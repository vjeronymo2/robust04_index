			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> We were disgusted to hear that CBS dropped "The Van Dyke Show" and "Annie  McGuire." First, they put them opposite stiff competition, then dumped them  because of low ratings. We had to tape them for viewing at a later date since  they were opposite our favorite shows. Why schedule shows in time slots where  they are bound to fail?  </P> <P> Ira Bowman, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Trade union membership down sharply in 1989 TRADE UNION membership fell in 1989 by the largest amount for several years, according to the latest independent figures, published today. The Certification Officer's annual report for 1990 shows an overall drop in membership of nearly 344,000 during 1989. That is greater than had previously been thought: the Trades Union Congress put the drop for the year at about 235,000 out of a total membership of about 8.4m. However, those figures take account only of TUC-affiliated unions. The Certification Officer puts total union membership at about 10m. Union membership has suffered principally because of the decline of traditional manufacturing industries and the growth of the non-unionised service sector.  The TUC said yesterday that it faced difficulties in keeping pace with changes in the labour market. The Certification Officer who has a statutory responsibility for supervising unions' political funds, membership figures and accounts also reported that the use of government funds for secret postal ballots doubled over the past year to pounds 2.6m : 85 unions applied for funding for 680 ballots, compared with 67 unions claiming for 483 ballots in 1989. Annual Report of the Certification Officer, 1990.  Available from 27 Wilton Street, London SW1X 7AZ. Free.</p>

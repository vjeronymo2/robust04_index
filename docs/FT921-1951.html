			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / The Long View: After victory, the battle IT CAN be tough going when you are rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic in the icy gale and the freezing rain. You barely have a chance to notice that there are icebergs looming ahead. Please forgive the overworked metaphor, but manifesto week in an election campaign is a time for cliche of expression rather than clarity of thought. The parties are promising to redouble efforts, end scandals, regenerate inner cities and grasp new opportunities. There is much talk of recovery and growth. But the anxious voter may wonder what the winning party will do if the unthinkable - but, alas, scarcely improbable - happens and the economy is holed below the waterline. It has happened before so often following closely-contested elections. After all, it is only when the economy is faltering that a change of government is likely to take place. The defending administration is forced to minimise its problems, and defer unpopular actions. In 1964 Labour under Harold Wilson arrived with a spectacular National Plan for 4 per cent economic growth and a promise to exploit the white heat of the technological revolution, but quickly ran into a series of balance of payments crises. In 1970 Edward Heath led the Conservatives back into power but was lured into an ultimately disastrous U-turn on public spending and corporatism by the recession of 1971, of which the Rolls-Royce bankruptcy was the highlight. Back in Downing Street in 1974, Wilson found the country in a state of acute financial and industrial crisis, afflicted by soaring prices, a sugar famine and the threat of the 'doomsday machine' as the corporate sector wilted under an unindexed tax system; he resigned after two years, leaving James Callaghan to call in the rescue troops of the IMF. As for Margaret Thatcher in 1979, promises to rejuvenate the overregulated economy were soon mostly buried, at least for the time being, amid a burst of 20 per cent-plus inflation and the worst recession since the war. It required Sir Geoffrey Howe's notorious Budget of 1981 to bring the borrowing and spending balance back under control. This week a nervous stock market has been adjusting to the idea that the Conservatives may well lose, even if Labour does not win outright. In the past investors have tended to fare badly when governments have changed. I am indebted to Nick Glydon of Kleinwort Benson for his book of election charts which shows that after three of the four general elections I have mentioned gilt-edged were lower in price six months later - by an average of 5 per cent. Equities also fell three times out of four, by 13 per cent on average. The exception in each case was 1970 when the stock market had already tumbled by 20 per cent in the four months before the poll. All the signs are that the incoming administration next month will walk straight into another mess. Norman Lamont's Budget last week was supposed to be the launching pad for the campaign but only succeeded in boring the public and scaring the financial markets. Labour's John Smith accepted the Treasury's assumptions in framing his shadow Budget this week, but will surely have some rethinking to do should he ever get into No. 11 and have a chance to inspect the 'books". All the main parties say they accept the discipline of the European exchange rate mechanism - there is not much choice for the voter here. True, the Tory Manifesto sneers that the ERM 'would merely expose the folly of Labour policies' but given the Conservative spending plans the same jibe might be turned against the Tories themselves. Nobody can promise lower interest rates until the Germans lead the way. And the problem is - as the Bundesbank warned this week - that German profligacy following reunification is threatening that country's financial stability. The big picture is that excessive German government spending is keeping interest rates high throughout the European currency bloc and undermining industrial competitiveness. In Britain the private sector has been especially vulnerable to these sky-high real interest rates, and the economy appears to be heading into the feared double dip, with news this week of an unexpectedly large dive in industrial production in January and a further rise of 40,000 in unemployment in February. A jump in public spending is the only available policy response, which would be all very well if these were temporary programmes, but if permanent spending levels are ratcheted up this must create the basis for an overstretching of the public finances at such time as the private sector begins to recover. There is no attractive route out of this difficulty. If the UK devalues within the ERM there will be some benefit to competitiveness but a blip in inflation will be generated and interest rates, if anything, would have to increase because sterling would have lost credibility in the eyes of the foreign exchange market. In order to bring interest rates substantially down sterling would have to be taken out of the ERM and the devaluation would be very large - probably 20 per cent against the DM. Some politicians are dabbling with the idea of setting up the Bank of England as an independent guardian of the currency so as to make the idea of floating the pound more acceptable; but the Bank might be guarding an open stable door. Is there any other way? Well, you could warn the public that a year or two of depressed economic conditions may easily lie ahead, and that although some short-term public spending projects might be considered, great restraint would be required in terms of pay levels. The public, in the meantime, should be very careful when buying assets such as houses, because values might well fall. But politicians do not get any thanks, let alone votes, for presenting this kind of negative message. They are there to work miracles, or at least to proclaim with all due modesty that miracles have happened. This time Labour does not have a National Plan but instead its manifesto boasts of a National Recovery Programme. I wonder if it will be able to handle icebergs.</p>

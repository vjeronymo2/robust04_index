			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party [DPP] is  incorporating `Taiwan independence' into its party program, and  moreover continues to conduct coordinated marches and  demonstrations. These new trends among `Taiwan independence'  elements are attracting the attention of the CPC, and high-level  CPC officals are taking strong positions. If the situation  gradually spins out of control, many people say that there is  the possibility that Beijing might ultimately use force to  resolve the `Taiwan independence' issue.    Unification of China has been the CPC's intent all along.  After 1949, for more than 20 years, the slogan `We must  definitely liberate Taiwan' was shouted; however, out of concern  for various factors such as the international situation,  military strength, weaponry, public cooperation, and economic  strength for support of a war, Beijing was continuously unable  to achieve this goal. After 1979, the CPC, using a posture of  peace to conduct the war of unification, did not again resurrect  the `Liberate Taiwan' slogan, but rather advocated `One Country,  Two Systems,' allowing the Kuomintang [KMT] to retain its army;  however, the CPC did not move toward renouncing the use of  military force against Taiwan. CPC senior statesmen all hope to  be able to see China unified during their lifetime, and it is  reported that Deng Xiaoping has ordered Jiang Zemin to pay  attention to `Taiwan independence' activities and not take them  lightly, so if `Taiwan independence' succeeds, it could become  an excuse for the CPC to use military force against Taiwan.  <H5>  CPC Military Capabilities Reorganized and Improved </H5>   In recent years, the PLA has undergone `reduction and  reorganization,' in which troop strength has been reduced  somewhat; however, due to the introduction and use of new types  of weapons, combat effectiveness has increased.    Development of the PLA Navy is what the leadership is  focusing on: Functionalizing nuclear submarines, mass production  and constant improvement of guided missile destroyers and  escorts, equipping of units with new anti-ship and ship-to-air  guided missiles, organizing and establishing a marine corps, and  construction of a research platform and military outpost far off  the mainland in the Spratly Islands. All of this reflects the  CPC's intention to completely develop its navy.  <H5>  New Trends in the PLA Navy, Army and Air Force </H5>   Units are already being equipped with 35-Series  conventionally powered torpedo submarines, the successor to the  33-Series submarine (a copy of the Soviet Romeo-class sub). This  submarine is slightly larger (2407 tons submerged displacement)  than the 33-Series, submerged speed is slightly faster (18  knots), and can possibly carry onboard Chinese-built Sturgeon-1  or -2 acoustic homing torpedoes.    The successor to the 051-Series (Luda-class) guided missle  destroyer has also been built and distributed to units. The new  destroyer's displacement is approximately 4,000 tons and it is  equipped with eight YJ-8 surface-to-surface guided missiles, a  point defense surface-to-air missile, shipboard artillery,  75-Series 12-tube 204 mm anti-submarine depth-charge launching  rocket gun, is equipped with a helicopter launch/recovery deck  and hangar, and may carry Z-9 helicopters.    The Navy air force possesses H-6D bombers that can carry  YJ-6  air-to-surface missiles and Q-5 attack planes that can launch  YJ-8 air-to-surface missiles.    Air Force equipment has also been updated, but it is said  that, overall, compared to Western nations, it lags 20 years  behind. After the sweeping changes in the Soviet Union, Russia  is already fulfilling the CPC's early 1991 order for the  purchase of Su-27 Flanker heavy-duty fighter aircraft. It is  reported that the CPC purchased, and as of early 1992, was  accepting delivery of, a total between 28 and 70 Su-27's.    The Army suffered a personnel cutback during the `reduce and  reorganize' campaign, but only a portion of those affected were  from important newly-fielded units, so the result was an  increase in efficiency; in addition, many units were equipped  with technologically advanced weapons. For example, the  79-Series main battle tank, the 85-II main battle tank which is  in the midst of production, the 501-Series (copy of the Soviet  BMP) infantry fighting vehicle, the 523-Series wheeled armored  personnel carrier, many new types of artillery, multiple rocket  launchers, and engineering equipment. In particular, the  establishment of an Army air corps, along with the rest has  greatly enhanced the mobility and combat effectiveness of the  ground forces.  <H3>  New Developments in the Combat Strength of Taiwan's Armed  Forces </H3>   This past year, Taiwan has concentrated on improving the  capability of the weapons and equipment of its armed forces. In  particular, on the Navy side, with the technological assistance  of the United States, Taiwan has already built its first  Perry-class improved model guided missile escort (known in  Taiwan as a `frigate'), purchased 16 Lafayette-class frigates  from France (only purchasing the hulls, with the Taiwanese  themselves outfitting the vessels with weaponry), purchased mine  sweepers from Germany, and in addition, with the recent  acquisition of Netherlands-built `Gailiang Qiyu' (Improved  Flagfish)-class submarines and `Yang' destroyers, the Taiwanese  Navy's ability to wage war on the seas has not decreased at all.  <H3>  Speculation Over the Chinese Communists' Use of Force  Against Taiwan </H3>   If the Chinese Communists really use force against Taiwan,  it  is estimated that they will first blockade Taiwan by sea and  air. Because the Russian military threat against the Chinese  Communists has been greatly lessened, most of the main body of  the Chinese navy can be withdrawn to execute the task of  blockading Taiwan. How will the United States react to this  possibility? This will attract much attention. Perhaps  diplomatically the U.S. Congress will impose political and  economic sanctions against the Chinese Communists. However, even  during the armed confrontations between the two sides of the  Taiwan Straits in the 1950s and 1960s, the United States did not  interfere by sending troops. It is estimated that today's United  States would not interfere either, by sending troops. Once the  Chinese Communists send troops, Taiwan can only fight against  the blockade single-handedly.  <H3>  Submarine Mines Are the Weapons That Cause Headaches to  Taiwan Military </H3>   If compared in the quality of weapons and the qualifications  of personnel, the navy and air force of Taiwan are in a slightly  advantageous position. In the area of anti-submarine warfare,  though the Chinese Communist navy has more than 100 submarines,  it is estimated that only about one half of them can be put into  use during the initial stage of fighting while the rest will  remain in a state of maintenance or refitting. Moreover, among  the usable submarines of the Chinese Communist navy, the Type 33  are the mainstay. This kind of submarine emits loud noise which  can be easily detected by the other side's anti-submarine sonar.  For some of the submarines, the original advantage of "surprise  attack" has been lost. Weapons used by Type 33 submarines are  torpedoes and mines. The torpedoes' range is 10,000 meters and  most of them are direct charge and do not have directional  guidance. The mines, however, are the weapons that cause  headaches to the other side, and can play a big role in  destroying the other side's shipping, and in blockading ports.  Taiwan's navy has only four submarines, namely the Sea Dragon,  Sea Tiger, Sea Lion, and Seal. But two of them are much improved  and they voyage quietly with little noise. In addition, they are  equipped with excellent sonar systems and guided torpedoes.  Their overall performance is far above the Type 33 submarines,  and also superior to the Type 35 submarines. However, it is  impossible for only two advanced submarines to cope with the  general situation. Before Perry and Lafayette destroyers can be  put into service, the Yang destroyer will have to  single-handedly shoulder the main naval tasks. Though the  destroyer has advanced weapons and equipment, it is too old, and  in anti-blockade confrontations it will have to deal with both  submarines and numerous warships on the sea. It will not have  the capability.  <H5>  The Chinese Communists' Fighting Force on the Sea </H5>   In the area of sea warfare, the Chinese Communists can  probably use 12 of their 20 destroyers (while at least two of  the rest will patrol the Spratly Islands, two will stay in the  Yellow Sea, and the other three Type 7 Anshan class will  undertake blockading tasks). Forces that will collaborate with  the destroyers will include all the forces of the East Sea  Fleet, some of the South Sea Fleet, and a convoy ship of the  North Sea Fleet. The total number may reach 20. The Chinese  Communists' destroyers and convoy ships have powerful sea  warfare capabilities. They are equipped with cruise missiles  including the Seagull I-A (HY-IJ on Type 51 ships, and Shangyou  I-A SY-IJ on Type 53 Jianghu class ships), and Seagull Attack 8  (YJ-8/C-801 on the Type 53H2 Huangshi frigate). Both the Seagull  I-A and the Shangyou I-A belong to the Soviet Minghe [phonetic]  missile type. They can easily be subject to intervention and  prone to being off-target, or even to being shot down. But  "Seagull Attack 8" is similar to the French "Flying Fish," and  is the kind of missile that flies over the water and is hard to  detect and stop. The warships of the Chinese Communists are very  likely to be deployed with Type 21 type Yellow Bee [Huang Feng]  missiles. The Chinese Communists possess more than 100 fast  attack craft, each equipped with 4 Shangyou missiles. But, due  to the short range of this type of ship, the Chinese Communists  may use warships to haul fast attack crafts out to the sea to  fight when the opportunity arises. This will reinforce the sea  combat capability of the Chinese Communists. On the other hand,  Taiwan's Yang destroyer group and Mountain convoy ship group  will have to face sufficient attacks from many types of  missiles, and damages suffered will certainly be enormous.  <H5>  Contending for Air Domination </H5>   The air force of the Chinese Communists lacks long range  capabilities and also lacks air refueling capabilities.  Therefore, it may not be able to effectively dominate Taiwan's  skies, the east coast in particular. So, the Chinese Communists  may use submarine mines to blockade Taiwan's east coast, and use  the air force to blockade the south, north, and west coasts. The  Chinese Communist fighter planes that can endure relatively long  flights are the J-8 I (only a few J-8 IIs are in service). But  their performance is not very good. In general, the quality of  Taiwan pilots is superior to that of the Chinese Communist air  force. Furthermore, Taiwan's F-5E fighters presently in service  have been developed with the Soviet Mig-21 as the enemy (while  the main force of the Chinese Communist fighters is still the  J-7, an imitation of the Mig-21, and the J-6, an imitation of  the Mig-19. However, the number of fighter planes of the Chinese  Communists is far greater than that of Taiwan. Moreover, the  production capability of the Chinese Communist aviation industry  is far greater than that of Taiwan. If an air war breaks out  between the two sides, even if the air force of the Chinese  Communists has to sacrifice three to four fighters to destroy  one of Taiwan's, by the time Taiwan has lost all of its air  force, the Chinese Communists will still have plenty that can be  used. At that time the planes of the Chinese Communists can even  join forces against warships and land troops. At that time  Taiwan will have no air force at all.  <H3>  Taiwan Relies on Imports for Raw Materials and Oil, It Is  Hard for Its Economic Lifeline To Survive Long-Term Blockading </H3>   The native land of Taiwan is short of resources. Most of its  raw materials for production and oil are imported. Its economic  lifeline also depends upon export trading. If Taiwan is to be  blockaded for some time, Taiwan's survival will be threatened,  and the military personnel and the ordinary people in Taiwan  will waver. Of course, it is extremely unfortunate if a civil  war breaks out in a country. In recent years, relations between  the two sides of the Taiwan Straits have been relaxed. There  have been frequent exchanges of commerce, investment, and  visits. If Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong can be united,  their actual strength and achievements will attract attention  world-wide. If a civil war breaks out again between the  Kuomintang and the Communists, it will be a big tragedy. The  idea of "Taiwan Independence" is absolutely unacceptable and  unfeasible. We hope that the Taiwan government will not be keen  on Taiwan independence and will resolutely deal with the  activities to split national territory by the Democratic  Progressive Party. We also hope that Beijing will cherish peace  as most important and let a situation continue in which peace  develops between the two sides.</p>

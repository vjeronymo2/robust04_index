			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / World Trade News: ABB in power parts venture with Russia ASEA BROWN BOVERI, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, is forming a joint venture with Saturn - a Russian company best known for producing the Sukhoi-27 jet's engines - to manufacture parts for power plants. The link is one of the most important so far between a western company and Russian industry. It is the first time a big western power equipment supplier has joined forces with a Russian defence company. The joint venture company, called ABB Uniturbo, is 80 per cent owned by ABB and 20 per cent by Saturn. It will be based at Saturn's plant near Moscow and initially employ 500 of its 4,000 workers. ABB said the venture would cover engineering, research and development, product development and manufacturing of components.</p>

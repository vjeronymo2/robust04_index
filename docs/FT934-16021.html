			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / The Tory Jungle Book The Conservative party conference has not been a total shambles - so far. There is still the little matter of the prime minister's speech this afternoon, but we have been trained to have low expectations of that. We are unlikely to be disappointed. If Mr John Major had his way the leader's speech would be billed as routine, not a matter of political life or death. As he is apt to remark, Lincoln's Gettysburgh address received poor early notices. Mr Major is painfully aware that he plays best in sitting-rooms; that he has not developed the knack of communicating from a remote platform to a large audience. Curiously, the same may be said of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the man got up by the press as the pretender. In private or talking informally to a small group Mr Clarke is excellent: persuasive, open, unafraid to take any direct question. Give him a speech to read and his best friends will tell you that he lacks the musical ear, the knowledge of when to pause and when to emphasise, that mark the orator. Unlike the prime minister, the chancellor usually knows what to say. 'Any enemy of John Major is an enemy of mine,' he told the conference yesterday. Afterwards, briefing the media, he reminded us of the prime minister's remark, recorded here last week, that he would go into the jungle with Mr Clarke and not be afraid to turn his back. Not to be outdone, the man who is safe in the jungle said that he, Clarke, would be unafraid to turn his back on Mr Major in the dark. The harsh truth is that when you have spent a week among the beasts of this particular jungle, you wonder that they do not all wear double-thick suits of armour. The affecting pair-bonding of the prime minister and his chancellor might offset some of the disunities that have marred the conference. The disparaging remarks about Mr Major attributed to Lady Thatcher have done the usual damage, but less than last time, which was less than the time before. Before too long there will be nothing left but a handbag in an empty hall. Conscious of their role as a TV studio audience, the assembled party workers in Blackpool have exerted themselves to persuade us that the Tories are united. The trick does not always work. Last year we witnessed a televised drama of a party in disarray, particularly when Lord Tebbitt led his anti-Maastricht rabble into the chamber and directly challenged the prime minister. This year every entrance of the prime minister, every reference to loyalty has been loudly applauded - only slightly less loudly, perhaps, than one speaker's attack on the media. Erecting a facade of unity is not the only purpose this year's conference is supposed to serve. Saving Mr Major's skin apart, the ambition has been to re-establish the Conservatives as the guarantors of law and order and the least-worst managers of the economy. On Wednesday Mr Michael Howard disregarded 14 years of Conservative failure to control crime and sought to appear tough without succumbing to the calls of one favoured speaker for flogging, hanging, castrating and permanently incarcerating criminals. His proposals, some of them sensible, ignore the social causes of crime, and do little to reassure us that fewer women will be raped, fewer houses will be burgled, or fewer cars robbed. They merely position the Tories in a political marketplace that has moved rightwards. The price may be the wrongful conviction of a few unfortunates on the grounds that they did not or could not answer questions on arrest, but that appears to be regarded as a small price to pay. Yesterday the chancellor sought to persuade the electorate that the hole the government is in is of foreign origin. 'The recession has affected the whole of the industrialised world,' he protested. His purpose was to prepare party and public opinion for a budget and public spending package that is likely to be less stringent than currently implied, while protecting the Conservative government from blame for getting the public finances into such a mess. He archly congratulated Lady Thatcher for her role in 1981, when tax increases were imposed in the name of sound money. The Tory tax bombshells due to rain down on us next year, including the highly unpopular value added tax on domestic fuel, were three times credited to his predecessor. In this way, blame for anything Mr Clarke may impose in November is minimised. The chancellor has amply demonstrated his skill at political discourse. We will be able to assess his skill at running the Treasury when he presents his budget and spending proposals in 53 days . Until then, write him down as the prime minister's best buddy. Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary of the treasury, could not be so designated. The mere mention of his name yesterday was greeted with foot-stamping applause. He is the Tom Cruise of the cabinet: absurdly young, and extremely dangerous. Although he did not address the main conference, he continues to build his constituency on the right of the party, while behaving perfectly properly as a loyal member of Mr Major's team. At a fringe meeting last night he attacked 'political correctness' and spoke up for the 'decent majority'. He appears to be a libertarian, although he does not wish the state to be neutral - he calls it amoral - in the signals sent out by its taxes, benefits and matrimonial laws. These should encourage family values, discipline and individual responsibility. Mr Portillo sees a market for right-wing ideology in the 1990s. Not so Mr Douglas Hurd, who will doubtless be long retired when the young Cruise reaches the pinnacle of his career. The foreign secretary said last night that 'we should not give the impression that we believe in permanent cultural revolution, in the style of Trotsky or Chairman Mao . . . We must show that we are not driven by ideology to question every function of the state . . .' Mr Hurd's words are closer than Mr Portillo's to the thoughts of the pragmatic Mr Major or one-nation Mr Clarke. The foreign secretary has the stature to resist the political correctness of the Tory right. Other speakers, even the Christian Democratic Mr David Hunt, have had to pepper their remarks with cheap anti-Europe shots. There have always been at least two kinds of Conservative, but establishing which is ascendant is better done out of office than in.</p>

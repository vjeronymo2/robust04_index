			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Grand Metropolitan GrandMet shareholders will doubtless be hoping that problems really do come in threes. Dollar weakness and the wide publicity given to its accounting techniques have already taken their toll; yesterday's further downward lurch, which means the company has lost more than a quarter of its value since early June, was prompted by a warning that pre-tax profits for the 12 months to September are unlikely to do better than match last year's Pounds 950m. The episode is a good illustration of the time-lag between general downgrades for economic growth and reduced expectations for individual company earnings. The major trading trouble-spot in this case looks to be GrandMet's Green Giant vegetable business in the US, whose canned and frozen brands are under margin pressure due to the cheaper food input costs obtained by own-label competitors. But weak demand is also having an impact on US food volumes generally, and has dashed hopes for a second half recovery in the Pearle eye care business. Beer volumes are down 10 per cent in south-east England. There does seem to be a danger, though, of overdoing the gloom. The forecast of an 8 per cent dividend increase is presumably a sign of this year's strong cash flow, while dollar woes should have a benign effect on the balance sheet. Relative to the market at least the stock should again start to perform.</p>

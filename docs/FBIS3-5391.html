The Liberal Democratic Party  [LDP] has decided not to cooperate in dealing with "higire"  bills [bills with a time limit] that need to be enacted by the  end of this fiscal year, including bills related to the  implementation of income and residential tax reduction.  Therefore, officials of government ministries and agencies,  such as Ministry of Finance [MOF], have come to show strong  concern over the possibility of great turmoil in the political  situation at the end of this month.    The alarm was sounded for MOF officials on the night of 3  March. While senior officials of other bureaus hurried home,  senior Tax Bureau officials, led by Bureau Director General  Tadashi Ogawa, continued with their discussions. The income tax  cut will start to be enforced by refunding withheld taxes when  summer bonuses are paid in June. Officials concerned had  started to lay the groundwork for enacting a bill of ad hoc  measures on the tax cuts by late March so that there would be  enough time to prepare for implementation. However, they were  ordered to "stop" doing so.    There are various special ad hoc measures on taxes that will  expire at the end of the fiscal year. At the end of March, the  Diet usually approves various "higire bills" aimed at keeping  those ad hoc measures effective. The Ministry of Home Affairs,  which will be forced to handle complicated paper work in  connection with the enforcement of the residential tax cut, as  well as the MOF, planned to work out an amendment to the Local  Taxes Act in a form of a "higire" bill.    However, the LDP decided on the evening of 4 March to  completely review all these "higire bills," the bills related to  the tax reduction in particular, which are usually enacted in a  short time.    With regard to the enforcement of tax cuts, there was a case  that bills related to "tax refunds" were enacted in early May  and the tax cut was enforced on 1 June in fiscal 1977. However,  local governments which actually handle the residential tax  processing strongly urge: "Bills should be enacted as soon as  possible, otherwise it will be difficult for us to handle the  paper work." Local bodies concerned, including the National  Governors Association, will probably start making appeals to  this end to the government and the ruling parties early next  week.    Several powerful LDP members, such as former Prime Minister  Yasuhiro Nakasone and former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe,  are saying repeatedly that "another election will be conducted  under the multi-seat constituency system." These remarks can be  taken as a strategy to force the Hosokawa administration to  dissolve the Diet at an early date. Depending on the results of  political maneuvering in which the "higire bills" are used as  "pawns," the possibility remains that the talk of "crisis" by  bureaucrats in Kasumigaseki may become reality.</p>

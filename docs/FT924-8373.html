			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Marshalls shows decline to Pounds 6.41m PRE-TAX PROFITS at Marshalls, the Halifax-based building materials group, slipped from Pounds 7.13m to Pounds 6.41m for the six months to September 30. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.25p on capital increased by the Pounds 20m rights issue concluded in the summer. The distribution is covered by earnings of 1.85p a share. That compared with earnings of 2.68p, restated to take account of the rights issue, at the corresponding stage last year. The share price was unchanged at 48p, compared with the rights issue price of 75p. Mr Simeon Marshall, director, said the results were creditable given that some two thirds of group sales of concrete, stone and clay products were to the depressed UK private commercial, industrial and residential markets. Turnover fell from Pounds 97.9m to Pounds 93.2m. Mr Marshall said the fall in profits would have been greater but for demand from local authorities for paving products which, although not increasing, had held up well. The cost of bad debts increased from Pounds 397,000 to Pounds 453,000, mostly due to higher credit insurance costs. The group was fully covered against bad debt risks, Mr Marshall said. Redundancy costs also increased, from Pounds 550,000 to Pounds 605,000. During the past 12 months the group has cut its workforce by about 6 per cent, equivalent to 150 jobs. The group said that the rights issue cash had been ear-marked for profitable acquisitions but these had proved harder to find than had been expected. A number of possibilities had been investigated and discussions were continuing in some cases. 'Capital expenditure is lower than forecast with the market downturn making it difficult to justify some of the expected investment,' said Mr Marshall. The rights issue proceeds, however, had enabled the group to further reduce net debt which, since the halfway stage last year, had fallen from Pounds 39.4m to Pounds 13.6m. Gearing was reduced from almost 40 per cent to less than 12 per cent. Interest charges as a result fell from Pounds 2.81m to Pounds 1.67m.</p>

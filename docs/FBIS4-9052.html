			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava April 19 (CTK) -- Former Slovak Economy  Minister Jan Ducky told CTK today that the Meciar government had  been considering interrupting the customs union with the Czech  Republic, but that he personally did not know of any final  decision having been reached.    The daily REPUBLIKA reported today that Premier Meciar had  decided to withdraw from the customs union agreement right at  the time he was recalled by parliament.    Ducky, who was also chairman of the Slovak Customs Office,  said in the CTK interview that his recalculation of last year's  custom's payments according to GATT regulations revealed that  "Slovakia lost roughly 400 million crowns (about 12 million  USD)" through the customs union.    But while Ducky does not think the loss of such a sum merits  the cancellation of the customs union, he still sees the  disadvantages of the current agreement outweighing its positive  aspects.    "Raw materials and semi-manufactured products flow from  Slovakia to Bohemia, which everywhere in the world are subject  to lower customs duties than are finished products, which come  to Slovakia from the Czech Republic," said Ducky.    Ducky also said that he had been a supporter of the customs  act at the time of its inception, but that he had thought it  would be adjusted eventually to satisfy both sides.    "The time has come to think economically. If the customs  union is not changed in basic ways, business circles will force  its termination," emphasied the ex-minister.    Ducky pointed to several instances when the "balance" of the  agreement has been disturbed by the Czech Government's  application of value added taxes.</p>

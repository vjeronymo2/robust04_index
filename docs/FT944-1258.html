			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Sanity on the roads The UK government's transport planners have belatedly acknowledged that new roads encourage people to travel more. But it would be the height of folly for ministers to follow their new-found wisdom with a thoughtless attack on the roads programme. Rather, the urgent priority is for the introduction of road pricing, so that motorists and businesses pay a true economic cost for their use of the road system. A report published this week by the standing advisory committee on trunk road assessment, a group of independent experts, concluded that road schemes should take into account 'induced traffic'. Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, has said he will accordingly reassess all 270 road schemes currently at planning stage. The report claims that, by neglecting induced traffic, transport officials have long over-estimated the economic benefits of new roads and road improvements. This is because new roads often serve simply to stimulate extra traffic. Since much of the trunk road network is already close to capacity, additional traffic leads immediately to increased congestion on existing roads. Anti-roads groups have seized on this acknowledgement of induced traffic as evidence that too many roads are being built. They see it as a signal that the roads programme should be drastically curtailed - and endlessly pray in aid the M25, more congested after every improvement. This is far too simplistic an approach. There can be no doubt that induced traffic is often desirable. Regions - even towns - often suffer from an inadequate road infrastructure. In principle, we should no more regret the upgrading of roads than any other improvement in communications networks. However, this is not an argument for expanding roads, regardless. On the contrary, transport policy is in a parlous state, because individuals and businesses are at the moment encouraged to make uneconomic choices in their use of transport infrastructure. This will continue until motorists are obliged to pay a price for the use of roads that reflects marginal social cost. The government is working on proposals to introduce electronic tolling on the motorways, which is unlikely, for technical reasons, to be possible before 1998. It cannot come a moment too soon. Motorway and city centre tolling could serve to price marginal journeys off the strategic roads network at peak periods, reducing the overall capacity needed and increasing the efficiency of its use. It would impose the discipline on road travel that applies to other modes of transport. In the process, it would almost certainly make public transport more attractive - particularly such common sense projects as rapid transport systems in congested urban areas. The government's announcement last week of approval for local authority transport spending revealed a small but potentially significant shift to measures to promote cycling, pedestrians and buses. Mr Mawhinney wishes to stimulate a public debate on transport policy. This is to be welcomed. Unfortunately, the transport debate is currently polarised between the anti-roads lobby and supporters of more road building. The debate needs to focus on allowing efficient choices, not on modes of transport considered desirable a priori. The defect of this report is that the issue it focuses on is a red herring. It should hardly need saying that additional roads induce extra traffic. That is what transport infrastructure is for. If the UK is to have a sensible debate, it cannot start from here.</p>

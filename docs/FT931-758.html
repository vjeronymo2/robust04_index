			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Medina Holidays ceases trading MEDINA Holidays, a London-based tour operator ceased trading yesterday. The company was bonded with the Civil Aviation Authority, so all 800 clients who had booked holidays will get their money back. The company specialised in holidays to Greece and traded as Medina Holidays, Greek Express, Beachcomber Holidays and Corfu Holiday Centre. No-one is abroad with the company at the moment.</p>

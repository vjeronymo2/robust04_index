			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Construction Contracts: Stockton-on-Tees scheme HIGGS &amp; HILL DEVEL OPMENTS has been appointed by Stockton-on-Tees City Challenge Board to undertake a Pounds 30m town centre development (pictured above). The project will be undertaken as a partnership between Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council, Stockton's City Challenge and Higgs &amp; Hill. Higgs &amp; Hill Developments will be responsible for submitting detailed planning proposals and arranging funding. Construction will be undertaken by Higgs &amp; Hill Northern. The development will transform the town centre, creating shopping malls, a bus station and parking for over 1,000 cars. It will be carried out in two phases with a target completion date of spring 1997. Phase 1 will provide a multi-storey car park, bus station, a 35,000 sq ft food store, shops, a pedestrianised mall and a town square. The second phase will create a second pedestrianised mall with glazed canopies, retail stores and 20 shop units. A total of 100,000 sq ft of retail space will be developed. Substantial preparatory work, including diverting the town's inner relief road to eliminate busy road crossings for shoppers will be carried out with City Challenge funds. Negotiations on property acquisition will begin immediately and some buildings have already been jointly bought.</p>

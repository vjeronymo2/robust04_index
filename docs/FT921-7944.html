			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Arts: Today's Television If British, European and world champion Wilf O'Reilly doesn't win the gold medal in the 1000m short track speed skating final in the Winter Olympics today it won't be for lack of interest among the broadcasters. The poor old BBC have had so few British contestants to follow that they have gone wild over Wilf. David Coleman will be describing his efforts in Olympics Today on BBC2 (6.00) and again in Olympics 92 on BBC1 (11.25). Happily Red Dwarf returns for a fifth series (9.00 BBC2). This is not necessarily the most intellectually stimulating comedy ever written but it does have several advantages: instead of being set in suburbia it is set in a space ship, and instead of being middle-aged it is youthful. Having one character who is a hologram and another who is a robot definitely extends the comedy potential. One of America's most popular middlebrow soaps also returns: LA Law continues to mix the legal, social and sexual lives of its characters into a steaming brew (9.00 ITV). Channel 4 comes to the end of its series about The Germans (9.00) while BBC2 continues its series about the Spanish: Fire In The Blood (9.30).</p>

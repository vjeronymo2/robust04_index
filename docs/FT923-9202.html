			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Mozambique peace talks show signs of progress NEGOTIATORS attempting to bring peace to Mozambique after 16 years of civil war, saw signs of a possible breakthrough yesterday when President Joaquim Chissano and Afonso Dhlakama, head of the Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo), shook hands, Reuter reports from Rome. Mediators now hope they can get the two sides to agree a timetable for a ceasefire. The two leaders were due to follow up yesterday's talks with another round of meetings, again expected to include Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe and Mr 'Tiny' Rowland, chief executive of the British minerals and farming conglomerate Lonrho. Formal negotiations on ending civil war in the drought-stricken country opened a few hours after private talks continued through the night.</p>

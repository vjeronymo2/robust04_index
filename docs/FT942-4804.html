			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Perkins clinches Pounds 660m deal FG Wilson Engineering, the Northern Ireland manufacturer of diesel electrical generating sets, has signed an agreement worth more than Pounds 660m to buy diesel engines from Perkins for the next 10 years, it was announced yesterday. The deal is one of a series of long-term contracts which Perkins has signed with big customers. They include Caterpillar, the construction equipment group, Volvo Penta, the marine engine company, Hanomag, the plant manufacturer, and most recently Massey Ferguson, the tractor maker. The new agreement makes Wilson, Europe's largest generating set manufacturer, one of the biggest of Perkins's 600 customers. The engines will power 80 per cent to 90 per cent of Wilson's generating sets, of which it produces 17,000 a year. Mr Tom Wilson, managing director of the privately owned company, said the agreement was 'a consolidation of several strands of deals which existed in the past'. It embraces joint product development, the scheduling of sales and 'just-in-time' delivery. By signing a long-term contract, Wilson and Perkins are following a trend most clearly seen in the automotive and aerospace sectors where makers have been seeking stability and co-operation with a smaller number of suppliers. About 90 per cent of Wilson's output, all manufactured in Northern Ireland, is exported. In the year to last August, it had sales of Pounds 141m and made after-tax profits of Pounds 13m. Its biggest single market is China. Perkins will manufacture the engines at its Peterborough and Shrewsbury plants and ship them to Wilson's expanding factory at Larne. Wilson has more than 900 employees in Northern Ireland, making it one of the largest engineering groups in the province.</p>

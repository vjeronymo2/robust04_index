			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Italy's crisis deepens as key figures face probe: Corruption investigation draws in more leaders THE ever-widening investigation into corruption in Italy yesterday claimed three more leading figures in the political and business worlds, deepening the crisis over bribes and illegal financing of political parties. Mr Giorgio La Malfa resigned as leader of the small Republican party, and Mr Giampiero Pesenti, a top industrialist whose group includes Italcementi, the country's largest cement company, was granted bail pending charges. The three cases, although unrelated, combined to overshadow yesterday's no-confidence debate in parliament. The Amato government emerged from the debate with the full support of the four coalition parties, heading off what this week threatened to be a major crisis. However, shortly after the vote the lira came under renewed pressure when Moody's, the US credit agency, said it was considering cutting Italy's credit rating from its present Aa3. Mr La Malfa resigned from the Republican leadership yesterday immediately after he had been notified he was under investigation for alleged illicit financing of the party. The allegations relate to some L50m (Pounds 22,800) received by the party from the Lombardy industrialists' association, money derived from professional training courses funded by the European Community. Mr Pesenti, who voluntarily presented himself to Milan magistrates, was granted bail pending charges of alleged corruption and illicit funding of political parties. He is alleged to have paid L7bn each to the Christian Democrats and Socialists concerning power industry contracts. Mr La Malfa is the second party leader to be directly affected. Two weeks ago, Mr Bettino Craxi was forced to step down from the leadership of the Socialist party, having received no fewer than 11 warrants advising him he was under investigation for alleged corruption. Although Mr La Malfa, aged 53, is likely to be asked to stay on as leader of Republicans, his image has been badly damaged. He has promoted the Republicans, who won 4.5 per cent of the vote last April, as 'the party of honest people'. But the threat of losing one of the most dynamic members of the younger generation of Italian politicians yesterday underlined the way in which the corruption scandals are eroding Italy's political class. The business class is being equally damaged. The charges against Mr Pesenti, who is on the board of the most eminent Italian business groups including Fiat and Mediobanca, follow the arrest on Monday of Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial officer. Mr Mattioli was still being detained yesterday in a Milan jail on charges allegedly relating to pay-outs on a metro contract. Near Rome yesterday, the body of Mr Sergio Castellari, a former director at the ministry for state shareholdings, was found. Police said he had committed suicide. Mr Castellari had been wanted for questioning over the alleged inflated price paid by ENI, the state oil concern, to Ferruzzi Montedison for the latter's 40 per cent stake in the chemical group, Enimont. This was the seventh suicide connected to corruption investigations since last June. Mr Lorrenzo Necci, the head of the state railways, was last night also warned he was under investigation. Mr Necci was served notice of investigation for his role in the Enimont deal, being at the time the group's president. With so many leading figures now implicated, moves were afoot to find ways to prevent the investigation getting out of hand. 'Honest party' trips up, Page 2 Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

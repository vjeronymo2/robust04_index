			<p>BFN     [Text] Manila, May 21 (XINHUA) -- President Fidel Ramos  today reiterated the Philippine Government's support for the  continued grant by the United States of most-favored-nation  (MFN) status to China without attached conditions.    U.S. President Bill Clinton has to decide whether to renew  one more year China's MFN status by June 3 this year.    In reiterating his support for the MFN status of China,  President Ramos said that a healthy relationship between China  and the U.S., particularly in the area of trade, is good for the  peace, stability and progress of the Asia-Pacific region.    He said linking politics to trade can only lead to both  sides  losing out, adding that grant of MFN status should also not be  selective or qualified since this could be a source of more  friction.    He stressed that the trade and economic issues should be  divorced from political concerns and that the grant of MFN  status should not subject to political conditionalities.</p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP WEEKEND;  </P> <P> THE 2 LIVE CREW: BANAL, WITLESS RAUNCH  </P> <P> Mix a little raunch with a bit of wit, as everybody from Cole Porter to Prince  has done at some point, and you've got a formula for pop that's lively, and  maybe even healthily, artfully shocking.  </P> <P> Take away the wit, and turn the raunch into drooling pornography, and you've  got the formula for the banal, embarrassing exercise that The 2 Live Crew  perpetrated Saturday night at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim. Imagine a bunch  of smirking, priapic frat boys throwing a party where the entertainment is  grainy stag films and the brainless bump and grind of nearly naked female  hirelings. There you have it, except that this Miami-based crew substituted its  own cesspool rhymes for the nudie movies.  </P> <P> Some in the half-filled house stood with their arms folded, perhaps wondering  whether they should feel a little ashamed, while others slurped it up like  hooting refugees from Morton Downey Jr.'s studio audience.  </P> <P> The slimiest moves in this 45-minute excrescence were the transformation of  Manfred Mann's "Do Wah Diddy Diddy" and the Kinks' "All Day and All of the  Night" into dirty doggerel sing-alongs. The 2 Live Crew also treated its crowd  to a heaping side order of homophobia. And yes, it's always edifying to hear  women repeatedly referred to by that dehumanizing word, "bitch."  </P> <P> Crew leader Luther Campbell is nicknamed Luke Skyywalker, but Larry Flyynt  would be more appropriate. Like the Hustler magazine porn baron, Campbell knows  that there is big money in pandering to the baser instincts. The Two Live  Crew's first two albums went gold, and the current one, "As Nasty as They Wanna  Be," is in the Top 40.  </P> <P> The less said about this tax on the First Amendment, the better. Lenny Bruce  died for somebody's sins, but not these.  </P> <P> Second-billed EPMD (Erick and Parrish Making Dollars) is one of rap's biggest  dollar-makers right now with a No. 1 album on the black music chart, but its  ill-planned 30-minute set had no form or momentum, and it was further hampered  by the rappers' poor diction. The group managed flickers of interest -- most of  them having to do with a duo of hot hip-hop dancers who accompanied the stocky  New York rappers, Erick Sermon and Parrish Smith.  </P> <P> Breeze, a new rap singer from Los Angeles, didn't offer anything fresh in a  tepidly received set. Enjoyable dance routines were the highlights of brief  appearances by a couple of unheralded Los Angeles acts, Throw Down Twins and  Superb &amp; the Tribe.  </P></p>

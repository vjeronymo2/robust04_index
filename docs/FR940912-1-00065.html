			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS has elected to complete the status review for sea-run cutthroat trout last because existing scientific information regarding this species' life history and population status is extremely scarce. NMFS anticipates that valuable information for assessing the health of this species will be forthcoming from studies being conducted by the United States Forest Service and Oregon State University. However, due to the broad geographic scope of these studies (Alaska to northern California), it will probably be at least 1 year before information is compiled and evaluated in a manner that will facilitate NMFS' ESA determinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Listing Factors and Basis for Determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 4(a)(1) of the ESA, a species can be determined to be endangered or threatened for any of the following reasons: (1) Present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; (2) overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes; (3) disease or predation; (4) inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or (5) other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. Listing determinations are made solely on the best scientific and commercial data available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Biological Information Solicited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To ensure that the review is complete and is based on the best available scientific and commercial data, NMFS is soliciting information and comments concerning (1) whether or not any stock qualifies as a ``species'' under the ESA in accordance with NMFS' policy (56 FR 58612, November 20, 1991), and (2) whether or not any stock is endangered or threatened based on the above listing criteria. Specifically, NMFS is soliciting information on the petitioned stocks. In general, NMFS is soliciting information on pink, chum, sockeye, and chinook salmon and sea-run cutthroat trout in the following areas: Physical and biological features of freshwater habitat; life history patterns of juvenile and adult fish, including age structure and migration patterns; meristic, morphometric, and genetic studies; disease epizootiology; population abundance and trends in abundance over time; influence of historical and present hatchery fish releases on naturally spawning stocks; and separation of hatchery and natural salmon/trout escapement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To facilitate the compilation of existing information, NMFS will expand its Pacific Salmon Biological Technical Committees' (PSBTC) meetings in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California to include discussions of all species of Pacific salmon and anadromous trout. The PSBTCs will provide NMFS with access to experts having a working knowledge of salmonid populations and will ensure that an accurate and complete administrative record is developed for each species. All meetings will be open to the public; interested parties should contact NMFS (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) for information regarding locations and times of upcoming PSBTC meetings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, the determination to list a species is based solely on the basis of the best available scientific and commercial information regarding a species' status without reference to possible economic or other impacts of such a determination (50 CFR 424.11(b)). Due to the broad scope of the species status reviews identified in this action, NMFS will attempt to consider information submitted after the comment period (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> DATES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). However, information must be received no later than 60 days before the proposed scheduled completion date (except for coho salmon) given in this document to allow NMFS sufficient time to review the material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS is also requesting information on areas that may qualify as critical habitat for all stocks of pink, chum, sockeye, and chinook salmon and sea-run cutthroat trout in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California. Areas that include the physical and biological features essential to the recovery of the species should be identified. Areas outside the present distribution should also be identified if such areas are essential to the recovery of the species. Essential features should include, but are not limited to: (1) Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior; (2) food, water, air, light, minerals, or other nutritional or physiological requirements; (3) cover or shelter; (4) sites for breeding, reproduction, rearing of offspring; and generally, (5) habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of the historic geographical and ecological distributions of the species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For areas potentially qualifying as critical habitat, NMFS is requesting information describing (1) the activities that affect the area or could be affected by the designation, and (2) the economic costs and benefits of additional requirements of management measures likely to result from the designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The economic cost to be considered in the critical habitat designations under the ESA is the probable economic impact of the [critical habitat] designation upon proposed or ongoing activities (50 CFR 424.19). NMFS must consider the incremental costs specifically resulting from a critical habitat designation that are above the economic effects attributable to listing the species. Economic effects attributable to listing include actions resulting from section 7 consultations under the ESA to avoid jeopardy to the species and from the taking prohibitions under section 9 of the ESA. Comments concerning economic impacts should distinguish the costs of listing from the incremental costs that can be directly attributed to the designation of specific areas as critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data, information, and comments should include: (1) Supporting documentation such as maps, bibliographic references, or reprints of pertinent publications; and (2) the commentor's name, address, and association, institution, or business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> References  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Nehlsen  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> et al., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  1991.

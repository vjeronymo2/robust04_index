			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Indonesia's Evil Occupation in New Guinea Can't </F> Be Ignored"]    [Text] When, now and then, questions are asked about what  Indonesia is doing in East Timor, it is time to think again  about what Indonesia is really doing in the western part of New  Guinea it calls Irian Jaya. In East Timor, a Portuguese  territory it invaded, Indonesia admitted eventually and  reluctantly that its troops slaughtered about a hundred students  in the infamous Dili massacre. That was the last official  figure. Now stories are emerging of how other people wounded by  troops had their heads smashed in by soldiers, one by one, as  they lay in their own blood in hospital, or were systematically  poisoned. Still later reports, based on observations by western  journalists who risked their lives to learn what is really  happening in East Timor, suggest a scale of systematic murder of  the population. If the reports are accurate, it spells  genocide. If the scale of what the Indonesians are doing to the  East Timorese people is debatable, it obviously is on a scale  enough to mean death, torture, imprisonment, and terror for a  great number of people who would rather not live under corrupt  and dictatorial Indonesian rule.    And so to Western New Guinea. This is a former Dutch  territory which, we shan't tire of reminding our readers, was  handed shamefully to the Indonesians on a plate thanks to a sham  United Nations vote pressured for by the Americans at a time  when it was Washington's policy to do anything at all to curry  favor with anti- Communist Asian regimes.    The Melanesian people of Western New Guinea were never  allowed a scrap of "self determination"; their fate was  determined for them. Ever since, they have been the victims of  Indonesian colonialism. Many western New Guineas have been  jailed, tortured, and killed for seeking independence for their  country; many continued to be jailed, tortured, and killed.  Various organizations and people critical of Indonesia quote  various figures. These are suspect. But not suspect enough to  deny the truth of reports that show the Indonesian regime in  occupied western New Guinea to be oppressive.    In western New Guinea, the Indonesians are simply probably  doing a better job hiding their crimes there than they are in  East Timor. Recently, to their credit, the Americans have taken  note of what is happening in East Timor and are now limiting the  supplies of arms to the Indonesians. Not so the British, who  after being so indignant about the Falkland Islands, Kuwait, and  Bosnia have no qualms about selling jet warplanes to the  Indonesians, as they are happily doing so now.    The Indonesians regularly invade Papua New Guinea to kill  indigenous rebels who cross the border from the occupied western  half of the island. There is some evidence, which the Papua New  Guinea government appears to want to ignore, that Indonesian  troops recently killed a dozen or more Papua New Guinea  villagers.    Some of Indonesia's neighbors, and countries like Britain  who  want to sell it arms, make a great effort to whitewash the  Indonesians. Indonesia is a huge market of 200 million. This  is what attracts the British, Americans, French, the  Australians, and other exporting countries. It is a militarily  powerful, dictatorial, corrupt, aggressive, and expansionist  country, which is what frightens Australia and Papua New Guinea.  Indeed Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, at the time hot  on Kuwait too, described Indonesia as "no country is more  important to Australia". He heads a government with a policy  which wreaks of appeasement where the Indonesians are concerned.    Alas, there is very little that can be done about Indonesia  except to treat it with caution. It is too big and dangerous to  do otherwise. One small bloom in the desert is that some  Indonesians acknowledge their sins and that the seeds of  democracy and decency in their country are beginning to sprout.  Unfortunately, the growth rate of these delicate plants is  unlikely to be fast enough to be of any help to the East  Timorese or the west New Guineans. They are doomed to be  devoured by Indonesia. Australia, and Papua New Guinea's mental  agony is: could we one day be gobbled up too?</p>

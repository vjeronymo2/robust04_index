			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Past decisions regarding the pricing of Class II milk concluded that the basic Class II formula price and target differential of ten cents should not be changed. The most recent past decision concluded that the target differential of ten cents should be maintained because supply and demand conditions revealed that there were adequate reserves of Class III milk to meet Class II needs. That decision on the 43-day National Hearing of 1990 recognized that many in the industry believed that Class II prices should move in the same magnitude and direction as Class I. That decision and this hearing clearly reveal that Class I and Class II products are frequently processed together and marketed by handlers in common distribution channels. However, with a basic differential of ten cents, the decision on the 1990 43-day National Hearing continued the existing theory of coordinating the Class II price with the current month's Class III price because Class III products could be used as a source of ingredients for Class II products. In this regard, the need to coordinate the Class II price with the Class III price was the operative principle in the pricing of Class II milk. It was for these reasons that the updating product price formula (represented by the basic Class II formula price) was intended and retained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This decision makes a clear break from the past in that Class II milk pricing will function in a manner consistent with Class I pricing largely in recognition of the similarity of the distribution and marketing channels shared by milk used in both classes. The record testimony and evidence in this hearing support the conclusion that current Class II pricing results in prices that do not always move in the same direction and magnitude as Class I prices even though both products tend to move in the same marketing channels. Linking the Class II pricing method to that of Class I should better reflect and respond to market conditions as well as simplify the procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated in the brief by CMPC, the Class II price is driven largely by changes in the basic formula price_the M-W price. As this price changes through movements in the hard product price markets, so will the Class II price. Therefore, any change in the Class II price is due primarily to hard product market forces, and not due to the level of the differential which will not change from month-to-month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By establishing the Class II milk price at the second preceding month's M-W and adding a fixed differential, as with Class I prices, the intent of providing coordination with Class I prices is achieved. Additionally, a consistent and predictable relationship between Class I and Class II prices is also achieved. However, because of the need to retain advance pricing for orderly marketing, there may be times when the current month's Class III price will be greater than the Class II price. Inversely, it is also true, that there may be times when the Class II price is more than 30-cents greater than the current month's Class III price. Nevertheless, the intended target differential is maintained, as with Class I pricing, albeit with a lag as exists with Class I pricing. This is a reality that both producers and handlers must accept with the retention of advanced pricing and have accepted with regard to the Class I price for many years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The record on this hearing expressed concern for the substitution of NFDM for fresh producer milk used to make Class II products because the price relationship between the Class II price and, for most Federal orders, the Class III-A price, may provide the economic incentive to do so. In this regard, there was a call on one hand to have the Class II price be coordinated with the movement in Class I price and at the same time have the Class II price also be coordinated with lower-class prices. The impossibility of this is clear. In addition, both handlers and producers will know, in advance, the prices for both Class I and Class II milk at the same time. Delivery, procurement, and processing decisions can be made with surety of what prices will be. However, the Class III or Class III-A price will not be known until after the month has ended. It would seem that without knowing what the Class III or Class III-A price will be in advance, the argument that NFDM will substitute for producer milk is weakened. This is not to say that substitution will not occur, because the record reveals that it does. Substitution may occur if a handler predicts the future price relationship between the Class II price and Class III or Class III-A price, and predicts that the future relationship will provide the economic incentive for substitution. Economic prediction, in and of itself, is not a proper basis for determining the appropriate value the milk has in Class II uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

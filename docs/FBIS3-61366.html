			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleksandr Pobihay, DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA </F> special correspondent, under the "Foreign Assignment" rubric:  "Ukraine-Tunisia: Bridges Spanning Centuries"]    [Text] Before my departure to Tunisia, I had the following  dialogue with my three-year old grandson:    "Grandfather, where are you going?"    "To Africa."    "So will you see Barmaley [a fictional character in  children's poetry--a savage who lived in Africa]?"    I did not venture to dispute this assumption. After all, it  is known that the standard of awareness is equal to the standard  of being informed. For my Sashok, Africa, according to Korney  Chukovskiy, is so far associated with Aybolit and a gang of  pirates, and for a representative of the older generation--at  the very most, with the Days of Solidarity with the countries of  the black continent which until recently were held at the  highest state level.    As is known, it is not easy to debunk established  stereotypes, even now that the "information boom" has overcome  us. It has been said: Those who want, hear. Consequently, at the  very least, a desire is needed. The wish to give the myths their  due and to evaluate present-day realities does not develop until  later.  <H5>  "And the City Was Called Carthage...." </H5>   For members of the first official delegation of Ukraine, the  words of Guy de Maupassant--"In Tunisia, you find out for your  yourself what history is"--materialized by way of unforgettable  personal impressions, which confirmed the old truth: Seeing is  believing....    The imperishable linkage of times is traced here through  ancient monuments and traditions, folk customs and names. The  palace residence of President of Tunisia Zine El Abidine Ben  Ali, where he held negotiations with L. Kravchuk, has the  official name of "Carthage," which is derived from the  city-state of Carthage founded 3,000 years ago on the North  African coast of the Mediterranean Sea. This is also the name of  a hall in the national gallery--the Bardo museum, which stands  beside the Chamber of Deputies (the Tunisian parliament) and in  which the most unique and the largest collection of ancient  mosaics in the world is kept. In particular, its exhibits  include the only depiction of Virgil, the author of the Aeneid,  surrounded by mythical goddesses.    In that hall, I could not help recalling the lines from the  Aeneid by I. Kotlyarevskyy, which I remembered from the time  back in school:    "Dido lived in the city,/ and the city was named  Carthage...."    To be sure, it is not known for certain where the  "Ukrainized" Aeneas made landfall together with his company.  However, as one of my colleagues joked, it is not ruled out that  this happened at an old fort in the city of Hamamet, which our  delegation visited.    We did not meet there the modern descendants of the  "energetic fellow"; however, the hosts in this resort town  clearly could not complain about a shortage of visitors.  Everything suggested that the favorable Mediterranean climate  and the high standard of the local "recreation industry" lure  there numerous tourists from all continents. As we learned  later, every year almost 4 million people visit Tunisia, whose  coastal zone stretches over 1,500 kilometers. They are the ones  who "contribute" the lion's share of revenues to the state  treasury.  <H5>  Thirty-Seven Years and Two Years </H5>   It is best to learn about a so-far unknown country and its  people through analogies and contrasts: On this point, they are  the same as we are, and on that point, we are not similar. First  of all, Ukraine and Tunisia share a similar historical lot, the  main landmarks of which lie in the centuries of struggle for  national liberation and the assertion of their own statehood.  The Republic of Tunisia was proclaimed independent 37 years ago,  and Ukraine--two years ago.    Just as in our country, the parliament and the president  will  be up for election next year. However, the political and  economic situation in Tunisia gives no grounds for conclusions  concerning possible radical changes. Existing government  structures have been fruitfully cooperating with the  constructive opposition, the emergence of which they themselves  facilitated with a view to the democratization of society. If  nothing else, the fact that the ban on the Communist Party,  which for a long time had been operating illegally, was lifted  in Tunisia testifies to this.    Evident favorable changes also occurred in the economy.  Thanks to them and a balanced foreign policy, Tunisia is playing  a leading role in cooperation between the states of northern  Africa and southern Europe, and is respected in the Arab world  and among the countries of the Maghreb. The headquarters of the  Palestinian Liberation Organization is located here.    In evaluating the results of his official visit to Tunisia  at  a press conference, L. Kravchuk stressed that Ukraine views  relations with that country as one of the priority directions in  its African policy. This is facilitated by the proximity of  Tunisia to our borders, its economic potential, and the place it  occupies in the Mediterranean region, at a juncture of European,  African, and Asian routes.    As we ascertained during the trip, the establishment of  strong ties to the Republic of Tunisia has not only geopolitical  but also promising economic significance for Ukraine. This is  especially important at present, when our country is looking for  partners in extensive, long-range cooperation.    Experts believe that Ukraine may deliver to Tunisia products  of the metallurgical industry, machine and instrument building,  shipbuilding, and farm machinery. We were told that Ukrainian  specialists in the field of water management construction have  been working there fruitfully for a long time, and have already  built many facilities. However, at the same time we also learned  that for almost 30 years, they have been doing all this work  within the framework of agreements between the former USSR and  Tunisia. Therefore, the funds that they have earned so far have  gone, in particular, to Russia and to maintain its embassy.    V. Khorev, chairman of the State Committee of Ukraine for  Water Management, said: "The situation is now changing  fundamentally. We have concluded an agreement on cooperation in  this sector and established a program for joint work until the  year 2010."    Minister of Transportation O. Klympush signed, with his  Tunisian opposite number, a government-to-government agreement  on air transportation, which envisions the opening of air  flights between the capitals of our countries, and also  specifies flight rights through Tunisia to the countries of  Africa and South America.    The business circles of the two countries also came to an  understanding, reaching an agreement on cooperation between the  Union of Entrepreneurs and Merchants of Tunisia and the Chamber  of Commerce and Industry of Ukraine. Its chairman, O.  Mykhaylychenko, informed journalists that an exhibition of  Tunisian goods will be held in Kiev as early as March of next  year.    Minister of Foreign Economic Relations of Ukraine A.  Slepichev stressed: "Tunisia is one of the few partners of ours  with which we have a positive balance of trade. Over nine  months, exports from Ukraine exceeded imports from this country  by almost $19 million. It is also noteworthy that the commercial  and economic agreement between our countries envisions  most-favored-nation treatment in partnership relations and the  defense of investors of the two parties, and establishes forms  of settlements both in freely convertible currencies and other  forms of payment."  <H5>  The Goal Dictates Deadlines </H5>   The great scope of industrial and civilian construction is  one of the characteristic features of Tunisia. For example, a  new city that is called here a "21st-century city" is being  built in the vicinity of its capital, at the location of the  drained lake Buhayrat. Although it does not have all that many  new buildings, one tends to believe that it will be built on  time.    We also ascertained this during a visit to a new  pharmaceutical plant in Tunis, which operates and continues to  develop. The goal--to provide all necessary drugs for the  country--dictates construction deadlines.    There are things for us to learn from the Tunisians. Having  rid themselves of economic dependence upon other countries, they  do not sever mutually advantageous relations with them. It is  precisely on the principle of such mutual interest that a  textile combine in the city of Sousse operates. State-of-the-art  equipment for it was delivered from many European countries, and  cotton is delivered from various regions of Asia and Africa.  Such examples are many. Therefore, the standard of living of  Tunisians is much higher than in other African states. On the  average, the income of each resident of the country comes to  $1,600 a year. This is not a great deal, but, as the saying  goes, there are other indicators, too.    As they build a new country in Tunisia, Tunisians, by all  signs, are well aware that they will not do without assistance  from other states; hence the desire to cooperate with Ukraine.  For example, at present more than 200 students from Tunisia  study at our colleges. One of them, Qah La'wi Majid, a graduate  of the Kiev Institute of Foreign Languages, accompanied us as a  representative of the Tunisian Information Agency for  international relations. He returned to the motherland two years  ago with his wife, our fellow Ukrainian Olena Ustymenko. Their  lot has been happier than that of the mythical Aeneas and the  goddess Dido who founded Carthage. On the eve of our departure,  Majid told us that an addition to his family is expected soon....    Good luck to them, young representatives of the two friendly  peoples who have embarked on the path of independence and  cooperation.    FROM THE EDITORIAL OFFICE: We take this opportunity to  express our profound gratitude for the hospitality and  assistance given to journalists from Ukraine during their travel  in the country by the staff of the Tunisian Information Agency  for international relations. We hope that the experience of  Tunisia, in particular of the Ministry of Information of that  country in providing state support for the national press, will  also become a subject of study and be borrowed by Ukraine.</p>

Washington is also fostering UN sanctions against North  Korea. The aim of all these efforts is to force Pyongyang to  allow an inspection of its nuclear program installations.    The International Atomic Energy Agency inspected all but two  of those nuclear installations between 1 and 5 March. Now in its  report it is trying to force the opening of the plants not  visited to verification, although the North Korean Government  has rejected the U.S. military threats as being harmful to its  national sovereignty.    President William Clinton is sponsoring punitive measures  against North Korea through the UN Security Council such as by  cutting financial, grain, or fuel supplies. Meanwhile, military  pressure against Pyongyang continues.</p>

At the present day the Lithuanian construction workers have  already prepared a complex of five multiapartment blocks for  handing over and are completing the assembly of another four  buildings. Not only has the implementation of the plan helped  Lithuania to resolve some economic problems and created some new  jobs, it has also had a considerable impact on the timing and  pace of the Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia and Estonia.  Army Gen. Pavel Grachev, the Russian defense minister, and  Audrius Butkevicius, former Lithuanian minister of national  defense, are rightly considered the founding fathers of the  Selma-Baltflot project. Unfortunately, during his trip the  Russian defense minister was unable to visit the Selma  construction site. "The fact is," Army Gen. Pavel Grachev told  journalists, "that someone in the Lithuanian leadership (I do  not know who at the moment) has conceived the idea of preventing  a meeting between the Russian defense minister and Vladas  Laurikavicius, president of the Selma company."    On the eve of the meeting with the Russian defense minister  in Kaliningrad, the Selma president was arrested by the  Lithuanian special services and taken to Vilnius, where he has  been placed in a detention cell.    "This fact will not help Russo-Lithuanian relations," Army  Gen. Pavel Grachev told journalists. "Selma had faith in us and  still does, it worked essentially on credit using its own  resources. The Selma president was told that I was bringing a  directive from the Russian Government outlining the terms on  which we would settle our debts. I brought them a barter deal  -- for oil. I have this directive in my briefcase but I cannot  give it to the association's president or thank him for his  work...."    Here is the opinion of Povilas Astasiavicius, vice president  of the Selma company.    "Certain forces in Lithuania do not like what we are doing,"  he said. "Recently the Lithuanian press has waged an unbridled  campaign accusing us of a variety of sins: They say that we are  not building anything but are just getting rich. But you can  see the homes that we have built, you can see the people who  have already been given apartments in those blocks.... This  whole campaign is being fuelled primarily by Mr. Piatkiavicius,  a deputy in the Seimas...."    However, I find this particular maneuver by certain  political  forces in Lithuania all the more incomprehensible because Mr.  Piatkiavicius was the leader of the first official Lithuanian  parliamentary delegation to visit this construction site in the  summer of last year. It was he, when opening the rally  dedicated to the completion of the assembly of the first  building, who spoke a lot about the need to develop good  neighborly relations between Lithuania and Russia and promised  comprehensive support for the Selma-Baltflot project.    But now he holds the opposite view.... Last Sunday I met  with Audrius Butkevicius, Lithuania's former national defense  minister, and asked him to comment on what has happened.    "My apartment was also searched," Butkevicius said. "They  were looking for explosives, which is really ridiculous. They  also wanted to plant some documents on me which were nothing to  do with me. Here, too, I express solidarity with Pavel  Sergeyevich Grachev: The arrest of Laurikavicius is an act of  provocation. A political provocation! And I very much regret  that the Lithuanian side is to blame for this."</p>

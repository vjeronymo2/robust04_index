			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Profit-taking and weak data weigh on Dow Wall Street PROFIT-TAKING and weak leading economic indicators took their toll on share prices yesterday as US stock markets ended a difficult week on a negative note, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 21.47 at 3,223.39. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 2.82 at 408.81, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks finished 1.16 weaker at 620.21. Turnover on the New York Stock Exchange was 199m shares, and declines outpaced rises by 927 to 734. Although investors received an early lift from strong gains in overseas equities markets, the news of a 0.3 per cent decline in leading economic indicators for December set the tone for the rest of the morning. The decline was the fifth consecutive month the index has shown virtually no change - an indication, said analysts, that the economy was unlikely to recover before mid-year. There was further bad news in the shape of a 6.6 per cent drop in December new home sales, and a fall in the January Chicago purchasers index. The continued weak state of the economy, and the apparent unwillingness of the Federal Reserve to contemplate further interest rate cuts, have proved a disincentive to invest in stocks this week, and yesterday profit-taking again forced stocks into retreat. Although most defence stocks were hurt by Wednesday's news of planned defence spending reductions, Raytheon bucked the trend, rising Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 85 1/2 after the company won a Dollars 167m contract to supply electronic countermeasure pods to the US Air Force. Polaroid stood out with a gain of Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 28 1/2 as more than 1m shares changed hands in the wake of the company's fourth-quarter profit of Dollars 1.16 a share, well up on the 90 cents a share earned at the same stage a year ago. Airline stocks were in the limelight after TWA filed for the protection of Chapter 11 bankruptcy, with AMR, parent of American Airlines, falling Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 70 3/4 , UAL recouping early losses to end Dollars 1/4 higher at Dollars 144 3/4 , USAir holding steady at Dollars 16 3/8 and Delta falling Dollars 2 to Dollars 67. Aetna slumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 41 1/2 amid rising concern about the insurer's exposure to the troubled real estate market, especially in the south west. The company also announced yesterday that it would be taking a Dollars 55m charge in the fourth-quarter to cover its withdrawal from the Massachusetts auto insurance market. On the over-the-counter market, Autodesk plummeted Dollars 6 1/4 to Dollars 28 1/4 after it warned that fourth quarter net income would come in between 30 cents and 35 cents a share, well below last year's figures and a long way from market estimates. Canada TORONTO stocks closed mixed in moderate trading. The TSE-300 fell 9.68 points to close at 3596.12. Volume was 24,721,000 shares, down from 30,861,000 shares, and trading value fell to CDollars 296.7m from CDollars 349m. Cameco fell CDollars  3/4 to CDollars 15 1/2 . The company said one of its major shareholders, a Canadian government-owned company, will sell 5,990,724 special warrants of Cameco for CDollars 14.60 a warrant. Montreal-based Canadian Pacific Forest Products fell CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 25 1/2 after posting a fourth-quarter loss from continuing operations of CDollars 464.4m, including a charge of CDollars 368.1m.</p>

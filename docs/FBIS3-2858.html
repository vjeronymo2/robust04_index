Comrade Deng Xiaoping's earnest  exhortation to the people of Shanghai, in particular, has become  one of the key topics of discussion among Shanghai's deputies to  the National People's Congress during their deliberation of the  government work report. Comrade Xiaoping made seven inspection  trips to Shanghai to provide guidance over its work, devoting  great energies to Shanghai's reform, opening up, and economic  development. While spending this year's Spring Festival in  Shanghai, Comrade Xiaoping said: "Shanghai has carried out its  work very well; it has a unique quality and style. Shanghai is  fully capable of moving at a faster pace." Deputy Huang Ju,  mayor of Shanghai, was exultant when he told the reporter about  this statement. In his words, "Shanghai's more than 14 million  people were greatly inspired and felt more keenly their  unprecedented historical responsibilities."    The pressures were never as great before; however, when  these  pressures are converted into a motive force, the results will be  unprecedented. Deputy Huang Ju told the reporter excitedly: On  the basis of market regulation, quality, and efficiency,  Shanghai's total output of goods and services increased 14.9  percent last year, reaching 151 billion yuan and pulling ahead  of the rest of the nation. Local financial revenue rose by as  much as 30 percent, topping 24 billion yuan and outstripping,  for the first time, the increase in the total output of goods  and services. [passage omitted]    Deputy Wu Bangguo, Shanghai Municipal Party Committee  secretary, told the reporter: "This year is decisive for  Shanghai's goal of achieving significant changes in three years'  time. The burden is heavy and the road is long." This remark  can be described as an embodiment of the Shanghai people's  common aspirations. "Shanghai is now full of opportunities and  enjoys geographical advantages and public support. What is  important is to work in a down-to-earth manner. Only by  exerting maximum efforts to make maximum contributions can we  justify the expectations of the party Central Committee and the  State Council, the full support of people across the country,  and Comrade Xiaoping's earnest and great trust."</p>

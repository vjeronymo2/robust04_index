			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS FOR HONG KONG IMMIGRANTS;  </P> <P> CHINESE FIND A HOME IN VANCOUVER  </P> <P> The view from the peak tram is stunning as you look out over the busy harbor,  the business district is bristling with new office buildings, and expensive new  homes and condominiums can be seen cropping up across the bay in the area known  as the British Properties. A young Chinese couple holding hands shares the tram  ride back down the mountain.  </P> <P> A pleasant evening in Hong Kong? No, this is Vancouver, British Columbia, on  the west coast of Canada. The tram ride is to the top of Grouse Mountain, not  Victoria Peak, and the young couple is more than likely a pair of recent  immigrants from Hong Kong.  </P> <P> An estimated 12,000 to 15,000 Hong Kong Chinese immigrated to Canada in 1988,  and growing numbers are expected every year until 1997. That's when the British  Crown Colony of Hong Kong reverts to mainland Chinese rule, ending the  99-year-lease agreement between China and Britain.  </P> <P> The coming change of government has caused many Hong Kong Chinese to take a  serious look at their future and opt for a new life in the West rather than  live in Hong Kong under the communists. They question the workability of  Chinese senior leader Deng Xiaoping's proposed "One Country, Two Systems,"  principle of government.  </P> <P> Under this system, Hong Kong would be allowed to continue as a center of free  enterprise; to be a conduit for international funds coming into China. In  essence, a capitalist system within a communist government.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Easy Money  </P> <P> Hong Kong has always been an easy place to make money, and in fact, since World  War II, has emerged as the third largest financial center in the world (there  are no minimum wage laws or unemployment insurance, no sales tax or import  duties).  </P> <P> It is estimated that there are 500 to 1,000 extremely wealthy families in Hong  Kong, families who control hundreds of millions of dollars in United States  figures. There is also a growing middle class.  </P> <P> But the designation "middle class" has a different meaning in Hong Kong than it  does in North America. These are families with a net worth of $5 million to $15  million, and they number in the tens of thousands.  </P> <P> It is these middle-class Chinese families who are most anxious to move their  fortunes out of Hong Kong before the communists move in. Owning property in  Canada has become an important form of insurance for them.  </P> <P> If you are from Hong Kong, and you want that kind of insurance, Andrea Eng is  the person to see. She is a native of Vancouver from a Chinese family, a former  Miss Canada, and a highly successful real estate broker. She sold close to $200  million worth of Vancouver property in 1988 alone, mostly to Hong Kong  investors, and nearly all for cash.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pay With Cash  </P> <P> "Traditionally, yes, they buy all cash," Eng says. "We don't even question  where their money comes from." She points out that with a maximum tax rate in  Hong Kong of 15% to 17%, it's not difficult to figure out how much cash her  buyers can accumulate.  </P> <P> According to Eng, as important as the accumulation of wealth may seem, Chinese  value their families as more important. Business is seen not as an end in  itself, but as a means of maintaining family stability. And it is that concern  for family that has prompted the recent rash of Hong Kong Chinese emigration.  But why Canada, and why Vancouver in particular?  </P> <P> For Danny Gaw, a recent Hong Kong immigrant who started a multimillion-dollar  food service business, Vancouver offers a better life style.  </P> <P> "The people, we find, are quite friendly," says Gaw, "and it's quite accepted  here for different races to work harmoniously together." He also cites the  availability of fresh produce and seafood as further reasons to settle in  Vancouver. "We love to eat," he adds with a grin.  </P> <P> Vancouver Mayor Gordon Campbell points out that aside from the physical  similarities between the two cities, there is a strong cultural link. "We have  a large proportion of our community who are already Canadians from a Chinese  background," he says, "and we've encouraged them to build on their traditions  and to contribute to our city."  </P> <P> </P> <P> $2 Billion in Real Estate  </P> <P> All these obvious amenities are not lost on Hong Kong investors, who have  pumped upward of $2 billion into the greater Vancouver real estate market since  1970 -- about $500 million per year. A case in point is the recent sale of the  entire Vancouver Expo 86 site, 205 acres of prime downtown waterfront property,  to Li Ka-shing, a wealthy Hong Kong investor who paid $320 million for the  land.  </P> <P> Li already has family living in Vancouver. His Concord Pacific Development Co.  plans to develop the site as condominium housing. The site, ironically, abuts  the existing Chinatown district of Vancouver.  </P> <P> Back in her office, Eng points to a map of downtown Vancouver where she has  colored in Hong Kong investments. As she reads off the names, one quickly  realizes that these properties are not just grocery stores and apartment  buildings.  </P> <P> "The New World Group of Hong Kong bought this," she points to the Holiday Inn,  Harborside, "and on either side of the Holiday Inn are two major office towers  overlooking the waterfront, the Coopers &amp; Lybrand Building and the Thorn,  Ernst &amp; Whinney Building, both owned by offshore Chinese."  </P> <P> She then points to Robson Street, Vancouver's prime retail area. "You can see  that the bulk of the activity is owned by Chinese, in fact probably 80% of the  whole block."  </P> <P> That's a big change from 100 years ago, when the first Chinese came to  Vancouver to help build railroads and work in the mines. In contrast, it is now  the educated and the wealthy who are leaving Hong Kong. They have the means,  and they don't trust the central government in Beijing to administrate the  island colony effectively.  </P> <P> So for a Hong Kong family with the means to emigrate, Vancouver looks inviting.  There is the underlying familiarity of British colonial influence, the tram  ride to the top of Grouse Mountain, a busy harbor complete with annual dragon  boat races, and a well-established Chinese community offering all the  accustomed goods and services.  </P> <P> Although city officials play down the label, for thousands of Hong Kong Chinese  looking for a secure future, Vancouver is indeed a new Hong Kong.  </P></p>

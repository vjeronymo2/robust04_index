			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [First installment of an interview with Nobuo Ishihara, </F> deputy chief cabinet secretary, by local correspondent Yutaka  Asahina; place and date not given; first paragraph is MAINICHI  SHIMBUN introduction]    [Text] With the collapse of the "1955 structure", the  bureaucrats of Kasumigaseki [a district in Tokyo where various  government offices are located] who had been leading postwar  Japan, working closely with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP],  are also facing "change". Nobuo Ishihara, deputy chief cabinet  secretary (in charge of administrative affairs), who stands at  the top of the bureaucracy, remained in office through the  change in political regimes and has supported the prime  minister's office during the turbulent year. While, on one  hand, the bureaucrats' leadership is supposed to have been  strengthened under the new government, they feel they are facing  a serious situation where Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]  Representative Secretary Ichiro Ozawa proposed his plan to  revise the National Diet Law, and the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry was shaken by the personnel change taking  place. I interviewed the deputy chief cabinet secretary to look  back at the year 1993, and to let him talk about the politics,  the bureaucrats, and the tasks of Kasumigaseki [the  bureaucracy]. (Note: At the conference of the coalition parties'  representatives held on 12 October, Ozawa proposed his  "fundamental plan to revise the National Diet Law" as follows:  (1) The present system under which the bureaucrats are required  to make explanations at the Diet on behalf of the government  shall be abolished and politicians will make the explanations;  (2) Two or three parliamentary vice ministers shall be assigned  to each ministry as vice ministers and; (3) several Diet members  shall be assigned to each ministry as parliamentary councilors.  Repulsion against this plan spread among the bureaucrats as it  means that the initiative in making policies is to be  transferred from bureaucrats to politicians).    [Asahina] What is your impression, as an insider, about the  change in political regime?    [Ishihara] Personally, I felt I should resign, but I was  strongly requested [to remain in the post] by Prime Minister  (Morihiro) Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary (Masayoshi)  Takemura who are intimate friends of mine. As I felt it was a  civil servant's duty to help the new government make a smooth  start, I decided, after consulting with (Kiichi) Miyazawa, then  prime minister, and (Masaharu) Gotoda, then vice prime minister,  to stay. I think I should hand over my post to someone after the  new government makes steady headway. An adequate time for me to  resign may be when the political reform bills are approved.  While there is a saying that a samurai is not supposed to serve  two lords, I have served five lords. This is a rather  exceptional case, and my philosophy as a government official  makes me feel very uncomfortable. Fortunately, however, there  was not much difference in the key policies of the new  government as it succeeded the fundamental national policies  without modification, and my conscience did not feel much guilt.    [Asahina] Can the same thing be said about the rice issue?    [Ishihara] I think the decision would have been almost the  same no matter who was prime minister. It would have been  impossible for our country alone to indignantly leave the  conference. The situation was literally the same when Japan  withdrew from the League of Nations in the past. We are not  allowed to withdraw from international cooperation.    [Asahina] What about the policymaking procedures?    [Ishihara] There has been considerable change in that  respect. Under the LDP government, the party decided key  policies, which, in most cases, were accepted by the government.  Under the new government, it seems that policies are being made  with both sides acting on equal grounds, or, through  consultation between the coalition parties and the government.    [Asahina] Is such a procedure creating a bureaucrat-dominant  structure?    [Ishihara] It is true that each ministry is beginning to  gain confidence. They try to frame a policy with the  responsibility of presenting it to the coalition parties for  discussion, and, as a general trend, the policy adopted  considerably reflects the original idea.    [Asahina] What about intervention by the Zoku-giin [Diet  members having strong influence on particular ministries and  agencies]?    [Ishihara] It has decreased. While government officials are  transferred in two or three years, Zoku-giin remain in their  post for many years and, therefore, are very familiar with the  internal affairs of the particular ministries. Though their  existence has its merits, it also has its demerits, as it tends  to create collusive relations with business circles.    [Asahina] Is there no resistance to the deregulation  proposed by the Hosokawa government?    [Ishihara] Although I do not think the proposal is really  welcomed by all ministries and agencies, they have become very  cooperative. When I asked all the ministries and agencies to  report the items to be removed, I was thinking there would be  about 20 or 30 items at best. However, they have come up with  as many as 94 items. Very drastic deregulations were also  included in the reports. In the past, even if we tried to  persuade government officials, they were unable to persuade the  Zoku-giin and, in many cases, they used to refuse the proposal  saying: "The party will not approve." The atmosphere has  changed to some extent.    [Asahina] How about decentralization?    [Ishihara] The prime minister and the chief cabinet  secretary are totally in favor of decentralization. Ozawa is  also in favor of decentralization. Although each ministry has  its own opinion concerning the individual proposals, and while  certain ministries directly opposed decentralization for the  reason that "even if the authority is transferred to local  governments, they are not able to fully exercise it", they  recently tend to refrain from expressing their opposition. It  seems that the necessary conditions to rapidly accelerate  decentralization in the future are being prepared.    [Asahina] What is your opinion on Ozawa's plan?    [Ishihara] Ozawa's plan is creating serious shock and  anxiety among all the ministries and agencies. Leading  officials, in particular, are taking the plan seriously. It is  an established procedure that Diet members hold discussions at  the national Diet, and not government officials. However, the  leading officials are afraid that if politicians are assigned to  the respective bureaus of the ministries and agencies to take  part in framing policies as parliamentary councilors, the  administration's neutrality might be hurt since making policy  and executing policy are like two sides of a coin.    [Asahina] Is that all?    [Ishihara] Elite bureaucrats devote their every spare moment  working for low pay because they find their lives worth living  in that they can realize their ideals by consistently playing a  role from the time they frame the policies until they are put  into practice. They are afraid that, under the Ozawa plan, the  officials may be degraded as subordinate workers. As we see in  the case of the United States, the officials of bureau  director-class and above have to leave their posts when the  President leaves his office and, therefore, they can not take  part in making important policies. Under such circumstances, it  is not possible to secure capable persons. In the United  States, all the important posts such as bureau directors are  being occupied by lawyers and other persons. All the ministries  are feeling serious anxiety over the possibility that the most  important portion of the administrative work, which, in Japan,  is being performed by the bureaucrats as lifetime work, might be  transferred to politicians.  <H3>  It Is Difficult To Comment on the "Controversial Personnel  Affair" in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry </H3>   [Asahina] Is it not considered democratic for politicians  elected by the people to have more power than officials?    [Ishihara] In the prewar days when party politics were  flourishing with Minseito and Seiyukai competing with one  another for political power, it was said that even the chief of  a police station was transferred when a political regime  changed. After the war, as it is impossible for government  workers to devote themselves without anxiety, to their duties  under such a system, the existing public service system was  established. In both a good and bad sense, a proper order in  the respective ministries and agencies has been established.  Persons who are capable of performing their duties efficiently,  and who are good at managing their followers, are expected to  become leading officials in due course. Certain officials are  afraid that the most important portion of the existing system as  I have just explained might be changed if politicians are  assigned to the respective bureaus giving a strong influence of  the political power to the personnel affairs.    [Asahina] Is it that they are afraid the minister of  international trade and industry may press a bureau director to  resign?    [Ishihara] Well, I think the incident that took place at the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry is a problem of a  different nature. I find it quite difficult to comment on the  problem. To me, it is a personnel administration problem within  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and it does not  seem proper to discuss the matter, as a whole, as a cabinet  problem.... [ellipses as printed].    [Asahina] Should promoting an officer who is to run for an  election be strictly criticized?    [Ishihara] It is quite hard for me to comment as I am not  familiar with the facts. Yet, I do not think the treatment of  personnel at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  was very unfair. Although I think the ministry must have  followed a reasonable procedure, I do not have any concrete  knowledge of the situation. I can not comment as a member of  the prime minister's office as doing so would create  considerable influence.</p>

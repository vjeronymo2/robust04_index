			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Baby Bells challenge 'one-man regulation': Martin Dickson on the US phone companies' legal battle for new markets It is one of the quirks of the American political system that for the past decade the most powerful individual in the nation's fast-changing telecommunications industry has been a 71-year-old judge of the US district court in Washington. Likened to a 'one-man regulatory commission', Judge Harold Greene has sweeping powers to determine what businesses America's seven 'Baby Bell' local telephone companies may enter and how they may conduct themselves. This week the judge's fiefdom came under attack when four of the Baby Bells  -Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, Nynex and Southwestern Bell - filed a motion asking him to give up his control over them. In particular, they want him to lift a ban, imposed because they are local monopolies, which prevents them from competing in the lucrative long-distance telecommunications market and the manufacturing of communications equipment. If he refuses, as seems likely, the phone companies may fight the case all the way to the Supreme Court. The outcome could be important in determining the shape of the industry, which is going through immense structural change as technological and regulatory barriers crumble. But the case could also be overtaken by events. In a separate process, Congress is working on legislation to establish a new framework for the industry, which would eliminate Judge Greene's powers. A bill passed last week by the House of Representatives, and favoured by the Baby Bells, would allow them to enter the long-distance market relatively quickly. However, the Baby Bells are bitterly opposed to another version of the bill, due to come before the Senate commerce committee this month, which would keep them out of some long-distance services until they face 'actual and demonstrable' competition in their local phone businesses, which could take years. Some observers suggest that the Baby Bells have only started the court battle to put pressure on Congress to pass the House bill, or to prepare another line of attack if they do not get their way on Capitol Hill. Whatever the case, Judge Greene's current role is largely the result of Congress's failure to enact comprehensive telecommunications reform over the past decade as it has been battered by lobbies for and against the Baby Bells. The judge has filled the consequent legislative vacuum. Judge Greene became involved in telecommunications policy on his first day on the federal bench in 1978. He was handed what was to become the largest anti-trust case in American history - US versus American Telephone &amp; Telegraph - in which the Justice Department accused AT&amp;T of monopolistic practices. Judge Greene oversaw the so-called Modified Final Judgment (MFJ) which settled the case. AT&amp;T agreed to spin off its local telecommunications companies into seven separate businesses - the Baby Bells. AT&amp;T retained its long-distance and manufacturing operations, but faced greater competition. The Baby Bells were barred from long distance, telecommunications equipment manufacturing and information services, for fear they would use their financial muscle to quash competitors. Judge Greene was left with responsibility for overseeing implementation of the MFJ, along with his roster of regular court cases. The Baby Bells have two big complaints. First, they must seek waivers from him to be allowed to enter new businesses, or to carry out some aspects of existing ones, and his court does not have the capacity to handle these requests speedily. Waivers have taken five years or more to be approved. He also has power over certain aspects of AT&amp;T's business and his long review of the company's Dollars 12.6bn (Pounds 8.2bn) bid for McCaw Cellular Communications has been one obstacle to consummation of that deal, announced nearly a year ago. Second, Judge Greene has been resolutely opposed to the Baby Bells entering big new markets - despite a remarkable about-face in 1987 by the Justice Department, which said that changes wrought by the AT&amp;T break-up meant it was now acceptable for the seven to operate in the equipment and information services business. In 1991 the US Court of Appeals ordered the judge to remove his information services ban, though he went down fighting, arguing that it did not make sense to turn a key ingredient of the information society over to 'corporations who not so long ago were involved in major violations of anti-trust laws'. The Baby Bells argue that Judge Greene's remaining powers should be removed because the telecommunications industry has changed so much since the MFJ was agreed: they now face a measure of local competition from upstart rivals trying to cream off business, while their entry into long-distance will shake up what has become an 'oligopoly' dominated by three rivals - AT&amp;T, MCI Communications and Sprint. Their opponents, which include the long-distance carriers, consumer groups and local rivals, insist that nothing has really changed and the Babies are still monopolies, responsible for 98 per cent of local telecommunications traffic. This, in a nutshell, is the conflict which Congress is trying to resolve as it weighs the most comprehensive change in telecommunications legislation since 1934. It could still end in gridlock, keeping Judge Greene's hands on the levers of power for a considerable time yet.</p>

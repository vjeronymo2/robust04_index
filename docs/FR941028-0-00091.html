			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the proposed regulation, the remedial actions against a non-complying State could have included grant reduction or termination under 30 CFR 735.21 or 30 CFR 886.18 and the substitution of Federal enforcement or other action pursuant to 30 CFR 733.12(b). Such remedial actions would not have been used where the State's actions were mandated by court order or where the State had not knowingly failed to comply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter representing environmental advocacy groups expressed concern that proposed &sect;843.24 did not expressly provide that citizens could petition OSM to take enforcement action where they had reason to believe that violations of the sections subject to &sect;843.24 exist. OSM recognizes commenter's concern about citizen participation and has addressed that issue in some detail above in this preamble in the section captioned ``Citizen Participation.'' The analysis in that section of the preamble is generally applicable to proposed &sect;843.24. For reasons similar to those expressed in that section of the preamble, OSM must reject commenter's proposal to explicitly modify the proposed rule at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Until these matters are addressed directly by further proposal of the agency, citizens could, however, assert their rights in a number of ways in accordance with the provisions of proposed &sect;843.24. With respect to specific permits under paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;843.24, concerned citizens could assert their complaints within the context of 30 CFR 842.11, 842.12, 842.15, and 843.21. With respect to more global remedies such as the reduction of State grants or the termination or the substitution of Federal enforcement provided by paragraph (c) of proposed &sect; 843.24, OSM could accept and review information submitted by citizens with a view to determining whether such remedies were appropriate under the circumstances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter also took issue with the provision of paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;843.24 in that such provision would have provided that OSM take action under the provisions of 30 CFR 843.21 if OSM had reason to believe that a State had issued a permit improvidently within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.20. The commenter questioned the legality of 30 CFR 773.20 and 843.21 and asserted that these improvidently issued permit rules violated SMCRA. OSM disagrees with commenter's criticisms. OSM considers these rules to be legal. OSM incorporates by reference the arguments that the Department has made defending such rules in briefs filed in the case of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Wildlife Federation  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lujan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , No. 88&hyph;3117 (D.D.C.), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lujan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , No. 81&hyph;2134 (D.D.C.). As indicated previously, copies of these briefs are being placed in the Administrative Record of this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter representing State regulatory authorities questioned the provision of paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;843.24 which stated that a State regulatory authority would be excused from a failure to comply with the State program equivalents of the AVS-related regulations if such non-compliance was the result of a ``mandatory injunction.'' The commenter asked for clarification of this term. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed regulation, a mandatory injunction would be an order to a regulatory authority by a court with jurisdiction over which the regulatory authority has no control. Such an order would have the effect of ordering or otherwise preventing the regulatory authority from complying with the provisions of the regulations cited in paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;843.24. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter representing a State regulatory authority indicated approval of the requirement contained in paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;843.24 that a State's failure to comply with proposed &sect;&sect;773.22, 773.23, 773.24, 773.26, and 843.23 be a ``knowing'' failure, before sanctions could be imposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM agrees with commenter and has retained the ``knowing'' standard in paragraph (c) of the final rule adopted as described below. The determination of what constitutes a State's ``knowing'' behavior would be made based upon a full consideration of the facts. In substance, the issue would be whether the State knew or had reason to know that its actions constituted a failure to comply with the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM has determined to adopt the proposed rule, with certain modifications, as final rule &sect;843.24. The final rule and the rationale behind such modifications are now described. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, in paragraph (a) of the proposed rule, a reference to proposed &sect;773.26 has been deleted from among the list of regulations with which a State must comply to avoid action by OSM. As discussed previously, proposed &sect;773.26 has been renumbered and adopted as final &sect;773.25. Accordingly, a reference to &sect;773.25 has been substituted in paragraph (a) of final &sect;843.24. A similar substitution has also been made in paragraph (c) of the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

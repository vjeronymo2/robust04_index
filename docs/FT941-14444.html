			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Greycoat shows interim loss but recovery starts Greycoat yesterday announced further pre-tax losses at the interim stage, but operating profit exceeded interest payments as it continued its recovery from the verge of receivership. The management also announced the end of its programme of property disposals. In addition, it revealed that Mr Geoffrey Wilson will step down as chairman at the end of the financial year, while Mr Brian Myerson and Mr Julian Treger, the two men who formulated the company's rescue package, will join as non-executive directors. The management of Greycoat - one of the more aggressive property investors of the 1980's, which almost collapsed from a combination of rising debt costs and falling asset values - said it was now in a position to start looking at financing for future property developments. The company announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 43.5m (Pounds 44m), but this included Pounds 5.2m in reorganisation costs, Pounds 25.2m on losses from the sale of properties, and Pounds 7.4m from the redemption of the company's zero coupon bonds, all of which were part of the restructuring. Mr Richard Guignard, managing director, finance, was confident of a modest profit in the second half of the year. The company intends to eliminate its profit and loss account deficit of Pounds 149.1m, as part of the proposals detailed in its restructuring document. It will apply for court permission to cancel Pounds 105.7m standing to the credit of the share premium account and a further Pounds 47.1m of deferred shares, arising from the restructuring. Mr Wilson said in an official statement: 'We have an established record of successful commercial property development.' Turnover amounted to Pounds 20.4m (Pounds 23.9m) primarily from gross rental income, and this figure should see a gradual increase with the phasing out of rent free periods on a portion of its portfolio. Losses per share were 49.5p (52.8p). There is no dividend.</p>

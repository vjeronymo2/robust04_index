			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Schroders to help Italian bank fight bid ITALY's first hostile takeover bid in the normally placid banking sector has created an unexpected opportunity for Schroders, the UK merchant bank. The bank has been appointed by the board of Banco di San Geminiano e San Prospero, which is one of Italy's most successful regional banks. It wants Schroders to mount a rapid defence against an unwanted takeover bid by Banca Popolare di Verona, another sizeable regional institution. The takeover offer, which is for only 30 per cent of the Modena-based Banco di San Geminiano's share capital, 'seriously undervalues' the stock and goes against the grain of Italy's new takeover laws, according to one banker involved. The new takeover rules permit bidders to make partial offers for an acquisition target's capital. However, they also require the raider to offer small shareholders the same price as that being paid to those holding larger stakes. Some bankers are claiming that Banca Popolare di Verona has exploited a loophole in the new takeover legislation so it can offer a price lower than that being paid to big shareholders. Banco di San Geminiano is an attractive prize at a time of consolidation among Italy's medium-sized regional banks. Net profits amounted to L60bn (Dollars 36m) last year, while total assets were about L9,500bn. Its market capitalisation is about L1,500bn. Like many regional banks in northern and central Italy, it has a healthy loan book and an attractive deposit base. Modena, home of some of Italy's best-known specialist engineering companies, is one of the country's most affluent cities. In spite of Banco di San Geminiano's attempts to launch a spirited defence, prospects for a higher offer - or the arrival of a 'white knight' to make a counter bid - are compromised by the tight deadline for the current deal. The offer by Banca Popolare di Verona, which claims to have already won approval from shareholders owning 17 per cent of its target's stock, closes at the end of this month.</p>

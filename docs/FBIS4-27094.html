			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan yesterday  hailed President Bill Clinton's renewal of China's Most Favoured  Nation trading status and the end of linking trade and human  rights as a move that would lead to better understanding of  Thailand.    "Every country has its own position on short and long term  interests," Mr Surin said.    "We have a burden of proximity. We stand to face  repercussions from neighbours in terms of refugees, narcotics or  weapons.    "Western countries, wherever they are, have the luxury of  distance," he said.    "They can make pronouncements without having to consider the  repercussions."    Clinton's decision came under pressure from U.S. businessmen  who did not want to be excluded from participation in China's  economic development, Mr Surin said.    Fierce competition for trade and investment demanded a  broadening of outlook, a balanced consideration of principles  ideals and realities, he claimed.    Differences of views between countries of the East and West  on questions of human rights, democracy and the environment are  "complex" and "delicate".    Clinton's decision would serve as a good example and help  the  U.S. and other countries in the West to understand Thailand, he  said.</p>

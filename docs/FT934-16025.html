			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Rejecting the benchmark Sir, Barry Riley is topical and accurate ('The time has come to cut Japan down to size', October 6) in reflecting the frustration felt by many managers of international equity portfolios with the high and fluctuating proportion of the total international market capitalisation that Japan represents, particularly when investing outside the US. However, pension fund trustees have heard this before and I believe they are shy of letting managers blame the benchmark for their performance. The reason trustees are frustrated with managers' frustration is that they know two things about Japan which they find hard to reconcile. First, its valuation basis, by any measure, has altered radically in recent years (from boom to bust would probably sum up most images of its recent stock market history). Second, with few exceptions, managers appear not to have altered their exposure to Japan significantly during this period. This observation is supported by the evidence of performance measurement universes on both sides of the Atlantic. The absence of dynamic responses to changing country valuations is a form of 'closet indexing'. Because the majority of returns in an international equity portfolio are explained by country decisions (regressions of randomly constructed portfolios since 1980 show over 80 per cent of portfolio variance is explained by country exposure), trustees may wonder whether they are paying an active fee for the wrong type of activity. It is easy to exaggerate the effects of country concentration in an international portfolio. For instance, for a US-based international investor (for whom the Japanese decision is dominant) with as much as 20 per cent in non-US markets, the effect of holding the index with nothing in Japan compared with a full index weight would have been to reduce the volatility (standard deviation of annual returns) of the entire portfolio since 1973 by 0.1 per cent. Compared with the lost opportunities from genuinely active management of the country exposure based on a sensible and consistent valuation discipline, excuses about the benchmark should cut no ice with trustees. Their best solution to the problem of assessing the short-term performance of managers lies in trying to understand what managers have done with their opportunities, a process in which the long-term benchmark should make only a small contribution.

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Another large fall for sterling STERLING plunged nearly 5 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday after the Bundesbank failed to cut rates as many dealers had expected, writes James Blitz. Yesterday was the day the market has been waiting for all week, with the Bundesbank council meeting and the September non-farm payroll figure in the US. In the end, neither event yielded great changes. The Bundesbank did not cut rates, but made more accommodating noises on policy. The headline payroll figure was down 57,000, far less than had been expected, but the underlying gloom over the US economy remained. The net result was to leave the dollar weak in the afternoon, pushing it down to a close of DM1.4085 from a previous DM1.4255. In the European exchange rate mechanism, the unrelieved pressure of German interest rates forced down the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo, while the Irish punt was again reported to have touched its ERM floor. In this turbulent European sea, sterling stands out as the one major currency which is not anchored by an exchange rate discipline, an economic policy or a steady government. It was besieged by the wildest rumours yesterday, including the idea that Moody's rating agency was about to down-grade the UK's foreign debt. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corporation, said that the pound had come under pressure from short-term interbank dealing rather than the off-loading of bonds and currency by big institutional investors. That would probably explain why the currency sprang back to DM2.44 in post-European trading from a low of DM2.4260. It closed in London at DM2.4300, 11.5 pfennigs down on the week. But Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corporation said that sterling's fall was 'disturbing.' Neither the size of the fall, nor the speed, had been anticipated. 'There were simply no buyers for the currency at any price during the afternoon,' he said. At the end of another turbulent week in the markets, much uncertainty remains. Mr O'Neill is bearish about the dollar and believes that it could easily go below the historic low of DM1.3860. 'The payroll figure was regarded as good, because people had expected so much worse,' he said. 'But the weak US economy and political uncertainty in the US will push the dollar down.' The Bundesbank President's comment that interest rates will remain steady for the 'time being' hangs over the Spanish peseta. Yesterday the Spanish government raised its intervention rate by 1 per cent as the peseta fell to a close of 71.32 against the D-Mark, very near its ERM floor of 72.62.</p>

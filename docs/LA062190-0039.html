			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEPUTIES OK SERVICE LIMITS IN DRUG UNITS;  </P> <P> SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT: TWO UNIONS AGREE TO A PLAN THAT WOULD RESTRICT OFFICERS  TO 5-YEAR STINTS ON NARCOTICS DUTY. THE REFORM, DESIGNED TO LIMIT MISCONDUCT,  COMES IN THE WAKE OF A MONEY-SKIMMING SCANDAL.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and two unions have tentatively  agreed to limit deputies to five-year stints as narcotics investigators in the  first administrative reform after suspensions of 26 narcotics officers in a  money-skimming scandal.  </P> <P> The agreement between the Sheriff's Department and two union groups  representing more than 7,000 officers must be ratified by the Board of  Supervisors. The matter has not yet been scheduled.  </P> <P> "I think the longer an individual is in a unit with certain kinds of  temptations, it does to some extent increase the possibility of misconduct,"  Assistant Sheriff Jerry Harper said this week in explaining the five-year time  limit.  </P> <P> Seven of the 10 narcotics officers indicted in March on federal charges related  to the alleged theft of $1.4 million in drug money had served with the  department for more than 14 years. Records indicate that at least half of those  indicted would have been transferred out of narcotics units had the five-year  "sunset" rule been in effect.  </P> <P> Other reforms proposed by Sheriff Sherman Block -- including financial  disclosure for some employees -- remain under negotiation with the unions.  </P> <P> Harper said that, besides reducing the potential for misconduct, the five-year  limit would also permit more sheriff's deputies to serve on the narcotics  teams.  </P> <P> The tentative agreement would also limit officers to five years of service in  the sheriff's vice and special investigations units. A seven-year limit would  be imposed on members of the special weapons teams.  </P> <P> The rule would apply only to new members of all the units. At the end of  special assignments, officers would have to leave the units for five or seven  years before another tour of duty.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Police Department has no limit on service for narcotics  officers. Vice detectives serve a maximum of 18 months, and internal affairs  investigators are limited to two-year terms.  </P> <P> Leaders of the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs and the Professional Peace  Officers Assn., which represents sergeants and lieutenants, said they supported  the time limits as a means of promoting movement within the department.  </P> <P> "Management felt that the longer you stayed in an assignment the more chance of  something (negative) occurring," said Art Reddy, president of the Professional  Peace Officers Assn. "We do not feel that way at all. But we think that it will  probably afford more people an opportunity to work special assignments."  </P> <P> Shortly after the March indictments, Block also said he intended to institute a  policy of financial disclosure for some members of the department. Although he  would not identify the assignments that would require financial reviews, they  reportedly include narcotics investigators, department officials said.  </P> <P> The indicted deputies allegedly lived beyond their means, using drug money to  buy boats, vacation homes or other costly items.  </P> <P> Union and Sheriff's Department officials declined to discuss the financial  disclosure issue, but a source familiar with the employees' position said the  department wants full financial reports on some employees and their spouses.  </P> <P> Deputies are particularly distressed by the suggestion that spouses might be  forced to disclose personal financial information, the source said.  </P> <P> Richard Shinee, an attorney for the deputies union, declined to comment on the  financial disclosure proposal. But Shinee said that officers he represents in  the West Covina Police Department vehemently opposed a similar proposal. "They  were very upset, because they saw no valid reason for it," he said.  </P> <P> Officers in the Philadelphia Police Department also fought against financial  disclosure, in 1986, but a federal appellate court ruled that officers applying  for sensitive positions could be required to disclose financial data such as  debts, loans, income sources and a host of other information.  </P> <P> Assistant Sheriff Harper said the department will limit its reforms to the  "sunset" rules and financial disclosure. He said that unlike some other major  departments, the Sheriff's Department will not ask potential narcotics officers  to submit to special psychological tests.  </P> <P> In the Chicago Police Department, officers must submit to a battery of  psychological tests and interviews before serving on narcotics teams. The  screening is designed to eliminate officers who are unstable, antisocial or  prone to alcohol abuse or theft, said Ed Wodnicki, the department's deputy  superintendent.  </P> <P> Harper said the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department gets enough information on its  employees by reviewing their job histories.  </P></p>

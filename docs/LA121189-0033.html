			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOUSMAN GOES TO HEART OF THE MATTER WITH SENIOR TENNIS TITLE  </P> <P> Please forgive Leland Housman for an occasional concentration lapse or an extra  long break between changeovers. It's not that Housman has a flippant attitude  toward tennis, it's just that he has more important things on his mind.  </P> <P> You see, Housman is a prominent heart surgeon in San Diego County and every now  and then tennis takes a back seat to saving someone's life.  </P> <P> But Sunday, the beepers kept quiet long enough for Housman to put away Jack  Metalsky, 6-2, 6-3, in the final of the Senior Grand Prix Tennis Tournament at  the Rancho Bernardo Inn.  </P> <P> Housman, competing in the men's 45 division, used powerful serves and forehands  to put away Metalsky in just under two hours.  </P> <P> "My biggest problem is concentration, but today it was there," Housman said.  </P> <P> Friday, though, was a different story.  </P> <P> Housman performed quadruple-bypass surgery at 7 a.m., played the quarterfinal  match at noon and was back at Mercy Hospital, where he is the chief of cardiac  surgery. That afternoon he performed a double bypass.  </P> <P> You can understand if Housman feels a little alienated from the tennis crowd  sometimes.  </P> <P> "I'm doing all that, while everybody else is checking into the hotel and  waiting to see when their next match is being played," he said.  </P> <P> Somehow, Housman kept his body and mind in shape enough to win seven  tournaments this year, which earned him the No. 1 seeding in the Senior Grand  Prix tournament. Housman's only loss this year came in the La Jolla tournament  to Bob Duessler.  </P> <P> "This was by far the toughest tournament of the year," said Housman, who  reached the final here in '87 and the semifinals in '88. "There are no slouches  in this thing. You're competing against the best in Southern California, not  just in San Diego."  </P> <P> Although he abandoned the sport he played in high school and college -- at the  University of Texas El Paso -- for 15 years, Housman is now able to play almost  every day.  </P> <P> "I've got a tennis court at my house and I'm just five minutes from the  hospital," he said. "Tennis is my out. It's the only way I can relax and get my  exercise at the same time."  </P> <P> Housman said he would never compare the gratification of winning a tennis match  to completing heart surgery, but he did say the two are not independent of each  other.  </P> <P> "The cross-discipline is very important," Housman said. "The only difference  is, (tennis) is just a game."  </P> <P> And when Housman loses a game, what is his philosophy?  </P> <P> "I go by what Boris Becker said after he lost at Wimbledon this year: 'Nobody  got hurt, nobody died, I just lost a tennis match.' "  </P> <P> In other finals, Richard Raverby of Encinitas defeated Bob Robles of Mission  Viejo, 6-3, 6-3, to win the men's 35s and Christine Putnam of Escondido  outlasted Debbie McCormick of Huntington Beach, 5-7, 6-1, 7-6, to win the  women's 35s.  </P></p>

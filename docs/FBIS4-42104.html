			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "President Rugova Meets Foreign </F> Minister Godal" -- issued by the Democratic League of Kosova]    [Text] The president of the Republic of Kosova, Dr.  Ibrahim Rugova, was received today in Oslo by the Norwegian  foreign minister, Bjorn Tore Godal.    In a long and cordial meeting, Dr. Rugova briefed the  Norwegian foreign minister on the situation in Kosova,  describing it as very tense and dangerous due to total  discrimination and unabated violence exercised by the Serbian  regime since the military and police occupation in 1989. The  Kosova problem requires an urgent solution and concrete and  comprehensive involvement of the international community,  President Rugova said. He also said that the solution should be  sought in the direction of implementation of the right to  self-determination of the Kosova people. The people of Kosova  has declared itself for an independent and [words indistinct]  and repeated his call for a temporary international civil  protectorate in Kosova. He called on the Norwegian Government  to help in reaching a solution to the Kosova issue within a  global approach for the solution of the former Yugoslav crisis.  Without a just solution of the Kosova question, no lasting  peace in the Balkans is possible, Dr. Rugova said.    The Norwegian foreign minister, Godal, said he was honoured  to meet Dr. Rugova and that his country admired the peaceful  policy of the Kosova people and that it had understanding for  their demands. Mr. Godal praised the readiness of the Albanian  side to solve the problem through dialogue. We are concerned  for the situation in Kosova and we would like to see a solution  as soon as possible, he added.</p>

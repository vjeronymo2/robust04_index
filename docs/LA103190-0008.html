			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT'S MORALITY GOT TO DO WITH POLITICS?;  </P> <P> GOVERNOR: GOVERNMENT DECISIONS PROFOUNDLY AFFECT HUMAN LIFE, SO WE NEED INSIGHT  INTO THE CANDIDATES' REASONING.  </P> <P> A coalition of Jewish, Protestant and Catholic religious organizations  concerned about the budget crisis in California recently wrote to the  Democratic and Republican gubernatorial candidates. It expressed three goals  and a hope. The goals were: obtain views on budgetary issues for voters to  consider; reintroduce explicit discussion of moral issues as an element of the  campaign, and allow voters to evaluate candidates on their views of moral  issues besetting society and government.  </P> <P> Although religious institutions should not interfere with people's political  judgment, it is their function to remind us that political judgments have moral  consequences. The coalition's letter stated: "Explicit consideration of the  moral implications of governmental decision has all but vanished from the  political scene. All major governmental decisions profoundly affect human life.  They, therefore, have significant moral implications" and should be discussed.  </P> <P> Six questions sought specific answers from the candidates on budget  development. And the following principles were suggested to guide elected  leadership in resolving budget dilemmas. The candidates were asked whether the  principles are correct or not.  </P> <P>  -- The sole justification for the existence of government is the common good  of all its citizens.  </P> <P>  -- Possession of life entitles everyone to the means necessary to live. The  state must use its powers equitably to ensure that basic needs of each person  are met.  </P> <P>  -- Basic human needs cannot be sacrificed to achieve budgetary balance.  </P> <P>  -- Solving budget problems by failing to protect the human person is cruel,  myopic and not truly cost-effective.  </P> <P>  -- Budget decisions should support family solidarity.  </P> <P>  -- Taxation should be used to create new jobs.  </P> <P>  -- The use of regressive forms of taxation (sales tax and user fees) to effect  solvency is inequitable.  </P> <P>  -- The justice of a system of taxation must look to both the total tax burden  shouldered by a person or a particular segment of society, and the quality and  quantity of public services these taxes generate benefitting that person or  segment and the rest of society as well.  </P> <P>  -- This generation should pay taxes adequate to meet the responsibilities of  state government today. Future generations should not be shackled with the cost  of meeting today's needs as well as their own.  </P> <P> Interestingly, neither candidate commented on any of the principles as  requested. They were not asked to agree with the principles. Good men and women  differ on the moral answers they hold. Each needed only an intelligent  foundation morally justifying her or his answer.  </P> <P> Douglas and Lincoln in their historic debates did not simply weigh the  economics and politics of slavery. The tenor of their times forced them to  address slavery and other issues in their total, human context. Public  relations and media experts did not dictate avoiding sticky questions that  might cost votes. A solid moral foundation for the view held had to be made.  Their audience required strength in that fundamentally important, explicit  measure of leadership. Lack of this strength could cost as many votes as the  practical answers they espoused.  </P> <P> Having a solid moral foundation for one's approach to governance is not  required of today's candidate. Spectacular moral issues -- abortion, the death  penalty and crime -- are addressed. However, the consequences to human life of  countless other decisions of elected leadership are avoided to "sell the  sizzle, not the steak."  </P> <P> The religious coalition scored a clean hit on its first purpose: illuminating  the issues for the voters. The questions and responses have been reported by  the press. The group struck out on its second purpose: sparking discussion of  moral concerns about budget decisions. The glimmer of moral values veiled in  their answers allows some insight into the candidates, so the success of the  third goal must be decided by the voters.  </P> <P> The saddest failure, however, was the hope expressed in the coalition's letter.  "It is our hope that you . . . communicate . . . the depth and resolve of your  own conviction . . . (that) you will assist our state . . . by refocusing  voters on the affairs of government as their serious moral responsibility . . .  it extends to you the opportunity to reassume the exacting capacity of moral  leadership . . . so critically needed by our society today." Neither candidate  seized the opportunity to allow insight into the forces driving and guiding  them. Neither clearly seized the challenge of moral leadership explicitly  offered.  </P> <P> Thomas Jefferson, penning the Declaration of Independence -- thus, his death  sentence for treason -- felt that "a decent respect for the opinion of mankind"  dictated proclamation of reasons morally justifying the action. That political  and personal fearlessness created a mantle of moral leadership that forged a  nation and moved the world. Mikhail Gorbachev, Nelson Mandela and Vaclav Havel  exemplify that courage and its consequences, mass media notwithstanding. Safety  and election may be secured by moral silence. Genuine human progress and  greatness cannot. What might happen in California if one of our candidates  listened to Jefferson and his co-conspirators rather than Madison Avenue?  </P></p>

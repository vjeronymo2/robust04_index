			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 10 TASS -- The preliminary results of the  first stage of the poaching-control operation which ended on  Tuesday, points to a sharp drop in fish poaching and theft of  other marine wealth in Russian Far Eastern waters.    Nikolay Kudinov, commander of naval forces of Russian Border  Troops, told ITAR-TASS today that Far Eastern sea borders are  securely protected. "The great power will not put up with  violations of international norms and rules any more," he  stressed.    In the admiral's opinion, the operation will be also  successful on the subsequent stages as well. "It is too early  to sum up the final results, but one thing is clear: The  operation will help protect Russia's national interests,"  Kudinov underlined.    The admiral expressed opinion that part of funds earned from  anti-poaching activities should be channelled for the needs of  units participating in the operation.</p>

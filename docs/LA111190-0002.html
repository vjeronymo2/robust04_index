			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> To the producers of China Beach:  </P> <P> What have you done to my favorite Emmy-winning series this season? You have  taken us backward and forward in time, confused us with unfocused plots and  changed the characters so that they don't resemble those we've grown to know  and love.  </P> <P> You have turned the series into a farsical caricature of itself that is both  overacted and underdirected. I, for one will no longer be staying home to watch  my once favorite show. Change is good, camouflage is unforgivable.  </P> <P> Susan McDonald, Studio City  </P></p>

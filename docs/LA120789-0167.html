The group  said want-ad volume was rising in 69% of the newspapers, compared to 55% in  September and 35% in August, 1988, but down from 84% a year ago. The board's  help-wanted ad index rose to 150 from 148 in September, but was down sharply  from 161 a year ago. "The data on want-ad volume suggests that while the labor  market is cooling off we are not on the verge of a recession," Conference Board  economist Ken Goldstein said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AZTEC NOTEBOOK / CURT HOLBREICH;  </P> <P> CABLE NETWORK CANCELS 2 SDSU GAMES  </P> <P> The San Diego Cable Sports Network has canceled the remaining two games of its  three-game, pay-per-view package of San Diego State home football games because  of a lack of subscriber interest.  </P> <P> The decision was made in conjunction with SDSU after the network and school  lost money on the home opener against UCLA, said Marty Youngman, network  manager.  </P> <P> "If you can't do it with UCLA, we figured it was best not to continue,"  Youngman said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The cancellation means the network will not show the Oct. 21 game against  Pacific and the Nov. 11 game against Wyoming from San Diego Jack Murphy  Stadium.  </P> <P> Youngman characterized the loss as "slight" but declined to give a dollar  amount or say how many subscribers signed up for the UCLA game.  </P> <P> The three-game package was priced at $29.95. Individual games could be viewed  for $12.95.  </P> <P> Coach Al Luginbill is concerned enough about his football team's rash of  penalties that he called the Western Athletic Conference office to discuss the  problem.  </P> <P> Luginbill said he spoke with the conference supervisor of officials, John  Adams, after the Aztecs were penalized 13 times for 135 yards in a 38-27  victory at Utah Saturday.  </P> <P> In four games, the Aztecs have been penalized nearly twice as often as their  opponents -- 38 times for 335 yards to 22 for 158 yards.  </P> <P> "We need some input from (Adams) because we're trying to get better in that  area and not making any progress," Luginbill said. "I am concerned. I don't  know if it is because of San Diego State's past history or what."  </P> <P> Luginbill said a team's reputation and style of play might influence officials'  calls.  </P> <P> "The Air Force Academy is a disciplined, military-style football team,"  Luginbill said. "(Officials) come in there (expecting) they are not going to  have penalties. That is their thought process."  </P> <P> Adams could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Air Force is the least penalized team in the conference with 144 for 1,199  yards. This season, the Falcons have a conference-low 22 penalties in five  games for 161 yards.  </P> <P> The Aztecs, after being the most penalized team in the conference two years ago  with 109 for 908 yards, were eighth in the nine-team league last year with 75  for 673 yards.  </P> <P> This year, four teams have been penalized more than the Aztecs, led by Brigham  Young with 47 for 459 yards.  </P> <P> It is the Cougars who are the most penalized team over the past three seasons  with 244 for 2,246 yards. The Aztecs are third with 222 for 1,916 yards.  </P> <P> Aztec Notes  </P> <P> Defensive end Todd Coomes (back, neck strain) and receiver Dennis Arey  (hamstring) are doubtful for Saturday's game at Hawaii, trainer Brian Barry  said. Tight end Mitch Burton has a possible hernia; his status is uncertain.  </P></p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Money Markets: More bullish mood THERE was a more bullish mood about German interest rate cuts in European cash and futures markets yesterday after the Bundesbank reduced the interest rate on its 3-day Treasury bills, writes James Blitz. The Bundesbank brought down the rate on these bills by 90 basis points to 7.5 per cent. Some dealers were very surprised by the extent of the move, and saw it as another clear example that the German authorities were prepared to ease policy aggressively. According to Mr Jonathan Hoffman, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in London, the international market does not tend to focus on the T-Bill rate because of the predominance of the discount and Lombard rates. However, he says that the 3-day T-Bill rate can form the effective floor for call money - or the overnight rate of lending - because the Bundesbank uses the bills to mop up excess liquidity in the money system. Mr Hoffman believes that commercial banks may have been unwilling to bring German call money lower in recent days because they could borrow T-bills from the Bundesbank at 8.40 per cent. Others, however, saw the change in the Treasury bill rate as a technical move which did little more than bring these instruments into line with the recently-reduced Discount rate. One analyst said the 3-day German Treasury Bill market provided only a limited amount of D-Mark liquidity, in any case. In any event, the move had a positive effect on rates in the German cash market. Call money came down to 8.45 per cent from 8.52 per cent on Wednesday night. However, 3-month money was more or less unchanged at about 7.91 per cent. The move had a positive effect on short-dated Euromark futures. The June contract was at one stage 10 basis points above its previous closing level, at 92.95, although it later fell back to close at 92.93. At this level, the market is looking for 84 basis points off 3-month money by June. Rates in the sterling market were unchanged. Three-month money closed at 6 1/16 per cent. The June short sterling contract was squeezed up to 94.20 following the Germen Treasury Bill move but later fell back to 94.15. A small shortage of Pounds 500m forecast by the Bank of England was easily removed.</p>

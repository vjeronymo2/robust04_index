			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Markets: Palladium puts on a show - Commodities The price of palladium has doubled in the past 12 months to a five-year peak. The metal is a key material in multi-layer ceramic capacitors for which demand is booming because they are used in a wide variety of electronic equipment such as mobile telephones and personal computers. So analysts and traders will be looking for clues about where the palladium price is likely to go next when Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum group metals marketing group, presents its interim review tomorrow. In its annual review in May, JM pointed out that Russia, the biggest palladium producer, was likely to feed the market with extra metal whenever the price increased substantially and therefore palladium would remain relatively stable in a range between Dollars 125 and Dollars 145 a troy ounce. The price has been above Dollars 160 recently but the strength of the yen against the US dollar has made palladium look relatively cheap to the Japanese who produce most of the world's multi-layer capacitors. While it might have second thoughts about palladium, JM seems unlikely to change its platinum price forecast which has proven to be very accurate so far. In May JM suggested platinum, used mainly in catalysts, would range between Dollars 380 and Dollars 430 an ounce and was likely to average Dollars 400 in 1994. Other events this week include Metal Bulletin's China Metals Conference in Beijing, starting on Wednesday, while the World Gold Council on Tuesday will release in London its latest gold demand trends report. On Thursday RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, will give a briefing to the UK Association of Mining Analysts. In Brussels, meanwhile, a two-day meeting of European Union agriculture ministers commences today. The ministers are expected to give guidelines to the European Commission on its powers to implement agricultural changes to respect the new Gatt world trade accord.</p>

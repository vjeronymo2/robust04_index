			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Redoute scents victory after first Empire closing date REDOUTE CATALOGUE, the French mail order retailer, had virtually won control of Empire Stores Group by the first closing date of its 125p per share bid on Wednesday. The offer values Empire at Pounds 49m. Redoute, part of the La Redoute retail group, owned or had valid acceptances from 47.9 per cent of Empire's share capital and was waiting for 'valid cover' on another 4.7 per cent of the group, which would take it to 52.6 per cent. The remaining 4.7 per cent includes 4.4 per cent which Redoute acquired on Wednesday, including the purchase of one large institution's holding. Redoute is likely to declare the bid unconditional when it receives the further valid acceptances, but could wait until the next closing date on May 8. Gecos, the Italian food retail group, has yet to decide which way to take its 24.2 per cent holding in Empire. It could remain as a minority shareholder in Empire. Redoute cannot make a better offer to Gecos than it has to other shareholders. Gecos has said it would clarify its position by May 1. Empire shares remained at 126p yesterday, just above the offer price. The European Commission said yesterday that the merger was 'compatible with the common market'. Approval from the competition authorities in Brussels had been expected.</p>

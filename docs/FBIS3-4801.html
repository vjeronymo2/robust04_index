"Japan understands that it was done based on Resolution  816,"  which was passed in October 1992, Takemura said of the shooting  down by U.S. F-16 fighters of four military aircraft in central  Bosnia.    The chief cabinet secretary reiterated Japan's hope for the  former Yugoslavia to achieve peace.    The F-16s under the command of the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization (NATO) shot down the planes that allegedly violated  the U.N. no-fly zone over Bosnia.    It was the first time that NATO warplanes have fired on  alleged violators since the no-fly zone was declared.</p>

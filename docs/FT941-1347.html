			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Optimism lifts P&amp;O shares The share price of The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company rose 27p to 695p yesterday, as the shipping, transport and property group revealed a recovery in earnings, and an optimistic outlook. Pre-tax profit was Pounds 523.7m, against Pounds 270.4m, boosted by Pounds 278.5m profits from investment sales. Lord Sterling, chairman, said the businesses had performed well across the board since the start of the year. 'For the first time, it may be that we will find ourselves firing on all cylinders at the same time.' Turnover rose 4 per cent to Pounds 5.75bn, but excluding discontinued operations, such as the sale of Sutcliffe Catering, the figure increased 12 per cent to Pounds 5.59bn. Operating profit after interest, but before a Pounds 15m provision, rose 25 per cent to Pounds 260.2m, outlining the improvement in underlying businesses. Bovis Homes, the UK housebuilder, rebounded into a Pounds 8.2m profit, from a Pounds 26.6m loss, because of a 46 per cent increase in unit sales. Bovis Construction Group also returned to profitability with a Pounds 10.3m contribution, and its worldwide order book rose 32 per cent to Pounds 4.5bn. Investment properties contributed Pounds 104.9m (Pounds 90.9m), but the development business lost Pounds 17.6m from write-downs. P&amp;O announced a Pounds 15m provision for restructuring its ferries business before the Channel tunnel opening. However, the cruise and ferries operations saw profits rise 10 per cent to Pounds 168.5m. The container division increased profits marginally, because of rising cargo volumes and stable costs, but bulk shipping continued to suffer from recession. The combined division fell slightly to Pounds 31.1m. P&amp;O Australia had a record year with a 20 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 30.4m, helping to push the contribution from Asia Pacific to 17 per cent of group sales. Gearing has been cut from 84 per cent to 53 per cent, due to asset sales, and the company is close to covering interest costs - Pounds 125m (Pounds 130m) in 1993 - with investment property income. The dividend is maintained at 30.5p, with a final dividend of 6.5p. This was not quite covered by recurrent net profits, and analysts do not expect an increase in 1994. Earnings per share were 68.5p (32.3p). Ferries, Page 26</p>

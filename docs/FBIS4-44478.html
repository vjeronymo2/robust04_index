			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: There Exists Quality Problems Worthy of Note in </F> Importing Fertilizer--Liaoning Provincial Commodity Inspection  Bureau Makes Suggestions to Relevant Sectors]    [Text] According to information obtained from the Liaoning  Provincial Bureau of Commidity Inspections, it is known that  last year a total of six kinds of fertilizer was imported into  the province through the port of Dalian in 32 batches, weighing  a total of 726,100 tons, worth $123,176,100. Checked against  standards specified by the bureau for imported chemical  fertilizer, these shipments posed the following quality control  problems:    The first problem was the large proportion of shipments not  meeting standards. In 1993, of a total of 32 batches of chemical  fertilizer weighing a total of 726,100 tons, five batches  weighing a total of 165,369 tons, worth $29,536,800, were found  not to meet standards. On the basis of weight, 22.77 percent of  the imported chemical fertilizer was substandard.    Second was a serious problem with shipment batches. For  example, the fertilizer imported through Dalian from the United  States was chiefly ammonium phosphate in 125 batches weighing a  total of 611,020 tons. After inspection by the Liaoning  Provincial Bureau of Commercial Inspection, three batches,  weighing a total of 110,518 tons, which comprised 18.9 percent  of the total weight, were found to be substandard. The nitrogen  content of one batch was only 17.76 percent (contract  requirement was 18 percent). In another two batches, the  moisture content exceeded that of contract specifications. At  the same time, two batches of a triple calcium phosphate mix,  imported from the United Kingdom and weighing a total of 54,851  tons, worth a total of $10,411,700, were also found to be  substandard after checking by the Bureau of Commercial  Inspection. In one batch, the amount of free acids was found to  exceed specifications, and in another batch, the granular size  also did not meet requirements -- a 100 percent noncompliance.  On the shipments described above that did not meet contract  specifications, the Liaoning Bureau of Commercial Inspection  issued certificates of noncompliance, so that the parties  concerned may seek compensation from their foreign suppliers.    With respect to the problem of quality in chemical  fertilizers imported through the port of Dalian last year,  related offices in the Liaoning Provincial Bureau of Commercial  Inspection has the following suggestions:    1. All agencies dealing with poor quality fertilizers  imported from abroad must seek compensation from their foreign  suppliers on the basis of the signed certificate issued by the  Bureau of Commercial Inspection attesting to the problem, so  they can recover their economic losses and protect the state's  well-being.    2. In the future, in accordance with state regulations and  international custom, all units engaged in importing chemical  fertilizers must state in detail in the formal contract they  sign with their foreign suppliers, the type of chemical  fertilizer ordered, its requirements for product composition,  quality, weight, and packaging, a statement for payment for  damages, a penalty clause, and a disagreement clause. Otherwise,  if the contract is unclear and not comprehensive, once the  fertilizer imported is found not to meet specifications, there  is no way to seek compensation from the foreign supplier. This  may even cause the state undeserved economic loss.    3. All units engaged in importing chemical fertilizers must  check for substandard products according to contract  specifications, so that timely action can be taken--what batches  to reject, what batches to negotiate for a lower price, what  batches need to be replaced, and what batches call for  compensation.    4. User households everywhere that purchase imported  fertilizer should check for the certificate or stamp of approval  given by the Bureau of Commercial Inspection on the product. It  is quite possible that all products without the stamp or  certificate of approval may be imitations. Users must be on the  alert for being deceived.    5. After the imported chemical fertilizer has been received,  all receiving units must petition the Bureau of Commercial  Inspection for certification that the product meets  specifications before it can be sold for subsequent use. If the  inspection is not made in time, and a quality problem is later  found, it may be impossible to recover damages because the time  limit has expired. What is worse may be the great economic loss  suffered by the user.</p>

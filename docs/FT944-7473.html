			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Birkby to float vehicle hire side Birkby, the business property managers and hire purchase group, yesterday announced the flotation of its vehicle hire division to fund further expansion. The company, which established a national profile in March with the Pounds 58.7m purchase of In Shops, plans to extend its chain of business units across the UK. The group's gearing reached 77 per cent by September 30, up from 41 per cent on March 31. It expects to be ungeared after the Hill Hire flotation. The shares closed down 5p at 233p yesterday. Birkby intends to float Hill Hire, its commercial vehicle hire company, by a placing with institutional investors, which is expected to value the company at more than Pounds 26m. Mr Bill Cran, chief executive, said Birkby would retain a 40 per cent stake. 'We are beginning to restrict the growth of Hill Hire, simply because we are not a truck rental operation and that is not a core activity,' he said. 'We want to put our resources into space management.' Hill Hire carries a heavy debt burden, as is typical in vehicle hire. Birkby acquired Hill Hire in July 1993 to add heavy commercial vehicles to its existing light vehicles hire business. The division reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.76m on sales of Pounds 10.5m in the year to March 31. Average utilisation rates stand at 72 per cent on light vehicles and 84 per cent on heavy vehicles. For the six months to September 30, Birkby reported a seven-fold rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.13m (Pounds 581,000). Turnover expanded from Pounds 5.24m to Pounds 32.2m, including a full contribution from In Shops and its discount retailer Job Lot. The figures were also lifted by a contribution from I-MEX, the manager of commercial and light industrial units, which was acquired in August. Occupancy rates in the group's 38 workspace centres range from 94 per cent at the Birkby sites to 65 per cent at the I-MEX sites. Retail occupancy stands at 82 per cent in the group's 65 centres. Earnings were 8.2p (6.6p). The interim dividend goes up to 2p (1.2p).</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / 'Religious war' threatens to erupt in Philippines poll: God is fast becoming an important factor in the election RELIGION is fast becoming an important factor in the Philippine election campaign with Cardinal Jaime Sin, influential leader of the Roman Catholic archdiocese of Manila entering the political fray. The cardinal sent out a pastoral letter on Easter Sunday urging his flock to reject 'oppressors and plunderers' standing in next Monday's election. Among the seven candidates for president are a number who were associated with the autocratic government of Mr Ferdinand Marcos, deposed in a 1986 popular uprising, whom the cardinal had supported. He followed his Easter call with sharper exhortations against voting for certain candidates. Although he has not so far identified those he is opposing by name, it is widely believed that the prelate has been referring mainly to Mr Marcos's once-powerful widow, Imelda, and the business tycoon Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, the best known of Mr Marcos's so-called cronies who were granted vast privileges when he was in power. The cardinal's more recent harangues have included the non-Roman Catholics among the candidates: Mr Fidel Ramos, former defence secretary who is being supported by President Corazon Aquino, and Mr Jovito Salonga, former Senate president. Cardinal Sin's plunge into the political arena was preceded by speculation that the Iglesia ni Cristo, a home-grown Christian sect, was planning to back the candidacy of Mr Cojuangco, support that was formally declared last weekend by Bishop Erano Manalo, the INC supreme minister. Some political analysts are wondering whether these events are not leading to a 'religious war' at the polling centres. Also, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines, has apparently not been united behind Cardinal Sin's moves. A small number of bishops in the southern Philippines has openly criticised his 'meddling' in politics. About 85 per cent of the 62m Philippine population are Roman Catholics. The INC, on the other hand, is estimated to have about 1m-1.5m voters, a number which could be significant if the election is close. Some of Cardinal Sin's critics have questioned his imposing moral guidelines on his people while his church continues to receive donations raised from the gambling casinos operated by the government. It is also a question whether the influence the church is becoming used to wielding will not make it difficult soon to contain its leaders to the pulpit. Among the presidential candidates, Mr Ramon Mitra, speaker of the House of Representatives, has been the only one not affected by the cardinal's tirades. Indeed, in an interview with a local newspaper last February Cardinal Sin said his 'personal choice' was Mr Mitra, a man who epitomises for many the traditional politicians, disparagingly called trapos (old rags), who buy constituents' loyalty with measured largesse. So what has Mr Ramos, the administration candidate, done to deserve the treatment he has been receiving from Cardinal Sin? In the view of some, as head of the now-defunct Philippine Constabulary, widely viewed as the most unruly sector of the military during the Marcos regime, Mr Ramos is seen as responsible for human rights violations, including against Catholic priests. Catholic lay leaders say it was the Mitra party's firm stance against artificial birth control that swayed the cardinal's support. The INC, which staunchly supported the Marcos administration, , has also been directly influencing government policies. Last July, for instance, it threatened to hold a mammoth rally on Manila's streets if the Aquino government did not reduce fuel prices. A compromise was worked out for the government by Mr Mitra, and the INC dropped its plan after fuel prices were reduced, but at rates much lower than those demanded by the sect. Next week's election will be closely watched not only for the contest among the seven candidates but among the interested religious leaders.</p>

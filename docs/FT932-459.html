			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Cuts in sick pay considered by employers NEARLY one in five companies are considering cuts in pay for employees who are off work because of sickness, according to a survey of personnel managers in 500 organisations published today. The survey, conducted by the magazine Personnel Today, found that banking, finance and public-sector organisations are most likely to be considering cutting sick-pay schemes, with 26 per cent in those sectors saying that they might reduce benefits within the next two years. A Confederation of British Industry study earlier this year concluded that UK employers lost Pounds 13bn a year through sickness absence. It found that a full-time manual worker takes an average of 10 days' sick leave a year and non-manual workers take five to six days. The Institute of Personnel Management said yesterday that larger companies typically paid up to six months' salary to employees who were certified as long-term sick, with more generous schemes paying for a year's absence from work. However, rather than considering cutting these long-term schemes, many employers were examining ways of controlling the number of short-term absences within their companies, said the institute. Some organisations were setting targets of, for example, eight days or less sick leave a year for individuals, and were then docking pay on a sliding scale for time taken off beyond that point. The magazine's survey found that 9 per cent of organisations had already made cuts in sick-pay schemes, most of them in the public sector. Some local authorities, in particular, have suffered from high rates of absenteeism and the Audit Commission has recently focused on the ways local government can tighten up on the amount of sick leave taken by workers. The magazine reports that 'company sick pay did look to be under threat earlier this year when two major employers announced plans to slash schemes. Electrical goods manufacturer Hoover introduced two-year contracts with no sick-pay entitlement. High-street bank Barclays planned to cut the length of sick pay for most staff but eventually restricted the cuts to new staff.'</p>

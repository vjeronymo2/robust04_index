			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Union negotiators to present final pay offer from Vauxhall UNION negotiators will present a final pay offer from Vauxhall to their 9,000 manual members at the company, but without recommending it, after lengthy negotiations ended early last night, Robert Taylor writes. The company said it was proposing a two-year deal with a 2.5 per cent increase for everyone this November and a further 3 per cent in November 1994. Vauxhall also said it will pay out a further 1 per cent next September to all manual workers with a further 1 per cent on top of that at the same time if, by next July, the retail prices index has climbed to 4 per cent or more. This is an improvement on an earlier proposal to increase the basic rate by 2.1 per cent this year and a further 2.6 per cent in November 1994. The unions wanted a substantial offer in a one-year deal to take account of profitability and improvements in productivity. Negotiators have threatened a strike ballot if Vauxhall did not increase its offer.</p>

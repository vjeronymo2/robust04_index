			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (10): Snakes and ladders - The civil engineers' dilemma ASHRAF GHONIMA, who heads the Cairo office of Bechtel, the big US contractor, sums up the paradoxical nature of the construction sector in Egypt in two sentences. 'We have been here 10 years and in the last three years we have been doing extremely well,' he says. 'Egypt is a very good prospect.' But a little later he adds emphatically: 'We avoid anything here that is Government funded.' This may seem puzzling, given that Government contracts account for the vast majority of the local construction business - which a senior Egyptian contractor estimates is worth around EL5bn a year (Dollars 1.5 bn) - and the Government has a bad record on contract planning, management and payment. But there is a ready explanation. A big chunk of the work commissioned by the Government is infrastructural - typically in water and sewerage, power plants, transport and telecommunications - and is heavily dependent on foreign financing. About one third of the annual US economic assistance to Egypt of Dollars 815m - all of it in grant form  - goes to infrastructure projects. There are also military construction contracts supported by US military aid. Other sources of foreign finance range from other bilateral aid programmes - such as the backing for the Cairo Wastewater Project from the British Overseas Development Authority - to multilateral agencies such as the World Bank, the Africa Development Bank and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development. The assured source of funds and standards of project management that come with these large injections of foreign aid have made Egypt a fertile ground for many foreign contractors in recent years, as well as the mostly publicly-owned local operators. Big projects have included the US-British dominated Cairo wastewater scheme, said to be the biggest sewage construction project in the world, the French-built, Cofas-financed first phase of the Cairo Metro and a series of power station contracts. Such projects have not been without financing problems. The Cairo wastewater project has suffered serious delays because of funding disputes with the authorities. A similar project for Alexandria has also been delayed. But the outlook for a continued high level of foreign financing has been bolstered by Egypt's winning stance in the Gulf crisis and its recent economic reform agreements with the International Monetary Fund and Paris Club creditors. A recently launched Dollars 1bn project to build a 1,200 megawatt power station at Kurimat won more than Dollars 850m in foreign financing, including a Dollars 200m grant from the US Agency for International Development and a Dollars 325m loan from the Africa Development Bank. Other big schemes which the Government intends to go ahead with over the next few years include a Dollars 500m-Dollars 750m extension of the Cairo Metro, a Dollars 1bn expansion of the Suez canal and a third terminal at Cairo international airport. Opportunities in the private sector are much fewer and less certain. A big twin-tower office complex on the east bank of the Nile in Cairo built by Britain's Higgs and Hill for a Gulf investor has never been filled, standing as a grim testament to the risks of investing in the commercial sector. But contractors say there are investors moving in to the important tourism sector in which the Government is keen to encourage private participation. As Mr Ghonima indicated, however, foreign contractors and the handful of small private sector Egyptian builders are extremely wary of domestically-funded projects, such as the Government's favoured New Cities project. Any cursory inspection of the country's dismal public offices and houses shows why. The quality is appalling. Contractors say what money is spent is badly managed and, worse, the Government frequently does not pay for work completed. Mr Ismail Osman, a director of Arab Contractors (Osman Ahmed Osman and Co), the country's biggest builder, cheerfully admits that the Government owes his company EL1bn. The state-owned banks provide the safety net, but the company's interest charges are huge - EL123m in 1989-1990, or some 12 per cent of turnover. Criticism tends to focus on the individual ministries involved in a particular area, some of which have worse reputations than others. Mr Cherine Scandar, President of Sodeco, a private Egyptian company, cites a series of on-again, off-again moves to build new cement plants in which a French company initially awarded a contract was strung along for more than a year before the project was cancelled. 'It's a mess. The Government is not able to control the awarding and follow-up of contracts,' says Mr Scandar. Mr Ghonima, however, sees conditions improving. The big state-owned contractors are high on the list for privatisation, the early planning of which Bechtel is involved in with Coopers and Lybrand. Local industry is keen to improve its management and production skills, he says, noting that the presence of international contractors has had a 'trickle down' effect. For example, he says, the quality and range of locally-made building materials has much improved in recent years. Government attitudes have also changed, says Mr Ghonima, with a much greater emphasis on quality and less emphasis on taking the cheapest option. But, again, even the layman knows that when it comes to construction quality, Egypt is playing off a very low base indeed.</p>

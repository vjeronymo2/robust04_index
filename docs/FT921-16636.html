			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Nigeria seeks debt relief to ease reforms PRESIDENT Ibrahim Babangida yesterday appealed for concessional treatment of Nigeria's Dollars 33.4bn (Pounds 18.3bn) external debt, warning that heavy service payments were jeopardising the country's economic reform programme. His request is likely to receive a cool response from creditors until Nigeria meets performance targets set under an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which was signed a year ago and runs out in April. Although discussions are continuing, Nigeria failed to pass a mid-term review of the SDR319m (Pounds 242.5m) stand-by facility. A recent Fund report was highly critical of several aspects of government management, notably an over-expansionary fiscal policy and heavy reliance on domestic bank borrowing. Without IMF endorsement, Nigeria will be unable to extend debt rescheduling deals reached with government and commercial bank creditors. President Babangida, speaking in the new capital of Abuja, was outlining the country's 1992 budget in the course of a new year address calling for 'financial discipline' and announcing plans to cut the number of ministries from 25 to 16. The president, who said debt service payments due this year totalled Dollars 5.6bn, forecast export earnings of Dollars 9bn, of which Dollars 7.4bn would come from oil exports averaging 1.38m barrels per day at Dollars 21 per barrel. Government expenditure this year was put at 27.6bn naira, a 30 per cent cut on 1991 spending. The president warned that Nigeria's structural adjustment programme, under way since 1986, could not succeed if the country remained a net exporter of capital: 'It is therefore obvious that Nigeria requires substantial debt relief through outright debt reduction.' Presenting what will be his last budget if the handover to civilian rule in October this year takes place as scheduled, the country's military leader called for 'far more concessional debt relief, with the Toronto or the Trinidad terms as minimum.' Nigeria's external debt had grown from Dollars 20.06bn in 1985 to Dollars 33.36bn at the end of October 1991. The government would continue to peg debt service payments at 30 per cent of export earnings, although this level would be difficult to sustain, the president continued. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, has indicated that he would support Nigeria's claim for debt relief under Trinidad terms, but the IMF hurdle will have to be cleared. The terms apply to the world's poorest countries and provide for the write-off of two-thirds of export credit debt. Nigeria claims eligibility, pointing out that per capita income has fallen from about Dollars 1,000 in 1980 to under Dollars 300 in 1990, the result of substantial devaluations and falling oil exports. But British officials stress that terms require an economic reform programme which has IMF endorsement. The proposals were launched by Mr Major, then chancellor of the exchequer, in Trinidad in September 1990. At last October's Commonwealth conference in Harare, Mr Major announced that Britain was prepared to implement the terms unilaterally.</p>

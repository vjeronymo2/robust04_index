			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The following appointments have been made in the  high command of the National People's Army by President Liamine  Zeroual. [passage omitted]    It is worth indicating that these changes have not affected  the command of the National Gendarmerie, the Navy, and the Air  Defense, since Brigadier Generals Abbes Benghezaiel, Chaabane  Ghodbane, and Aouadi Achour remain, respectively, in their posts  as commanders of these forces.</p>

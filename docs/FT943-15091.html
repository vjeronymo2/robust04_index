			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Germany urges harmonisation of EU tax system Germany, keen to forge ahead with plans that would bring order to Europe's multilayered tax system, yesterday started a debate on the vexed question of taxes on savings and the introduction of a final, definitive system of VAT. But at the first economic and finance ministers' meeting to be chaired by the Germans it became clear Commission proposals for harmonising taxes on savings - withholding tax - are unlikely to make much progress under the new presidency because of fierce opposition from Luxembourg and the UK. In spite of this, the Germans have identified the need for a common tax on savings to be deducted at source as a priority for its presidency. Because of high withholding taxes Germany, along with Belgium, is prone to heavy flights of capital. At yesterday's meeting, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, reminded his counterparts that when capital movements were deregulated six years ago, member states were conscious of the need to rule out distortions of competition and tax avoidance because of the differing tax systems on capital income. But Luxembourg, which does not levy taxes on savings held by non-residents in the country, is particularly opposed to the proposal, arguing that an EU-wide withholding tax would lead to capital flight from Europe to other OECD countries where there were no, or lower, taxes on savings. Yesterday Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, the Luxembourg finance minister, said a withholding tax would only be acceptable if it was levied in all OECD countries, otherwise Luxembourg had only a 'staunch no' to say to the proposal. The UK too is opposed to a Brussels-inspired common withholding tax. It argues that there should be a free market in taxes. 'Any European system would drive business out of Europe to New York and Tokyo. Therefore a common withholding tax at source would be ineffective,' said a UK spokesman. On VAT, the battles mostly lie ahead. The commission is to present a report by the end of the year on meeting the conditions for a switch to a definitive system of VAT, in which the tax is levied in the country of origin. Under the current system, VAT is currently paid in the country of consumption. Germany in particular supports a rapid transition to a country-of-origin based system, which they believe would be much simpler to administer.</p>

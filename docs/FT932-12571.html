Mr Heseltine was speaking at the opening of Honda's Pounds 300m car assembly plant at Swindon, Wiltshire. The UK had attracted more than 40 per cent of all Japanese inward investment into the European Community, and Japanese investment in car manufacturing in Britain had 'had a major influence on the revival' of that industry, he said. Honda, the only one of the three Japanese carmakers in the UK not to recognise a trade union, defended its policy, saying workers had a 37-hour week and retirement at 60.</p>

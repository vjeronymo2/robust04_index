			<p>BFN     [Text] Wiesbaden/Bonn -- Nearly one year after the  unsuccessful antiterrorism operation in Bad Kleinen, Interior  Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union [CDU]) has  initiated the announced restructuring of the Federal Office of  Criminal Investigation [BKA]. Ministry Spokesman Michael  Griesbeck told DPA in Bonn today that, as an initial step,  Kanther familiarized three new BKA main department heads with  their future tasks yesterday. It is not yet clear when the  newly created hierarchical level, which is to be controlled by  the BKA president and vice president, will start its work.    According to information from security circles, Rudolf  Atzbach, the old head of the BKA Central Administration  Department, is to take over the planned Administration and Data  Processing Main Department, according to Kanther's wishes.  Leopold Schuster, the head of the Fight Against Drugs and  Investigation Department, will lead the whole sphere of  investigations and the records department. BKA department head  Manfred Klink will be responsible for the Terrorism and  Protection of the State Main Department, which will be based in  Meckenheim near Bonn in the future.    Kanther's reform plans met with skepticism and rejection  among the police trade union [GdP]. The new level of hierarchy  that is to be introduced among the BKA president, the vice  president, and the old department heads is in contradiction with  all modern findings concerning control and organization,  stressed Arno Falk, chairman of the GdP group in the BKA. The  appointment of the new main department heads is the "wrong  consequence from Bad Kleinen."    In fact, the GdP sees the need and the opportunity for  restructuring the criminal office in Wiesbaden. Yet it rejects  "rash and incompetent decisions, characterized by political  opportunism." Falk called on the Bundestag officials  responsible for domestic policy and the budget not to accept the  plans for the BKA reform.    The Bundestag group of the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union]  wanted to adopt the planned amendment to the BKA law that was  proposed by the interior minister before the summer recess. The  accusation, leveled by opposition members and the GdP, that, as  a result of the introduction of a new level of hierarchy,  Kanther wants to "deprive BKA President Hans Ludwig Zachert of  his power," has repeatedly been rejected by the interior  minister.    During the bloody operation against the Red Army Faction  [RAF] at the Bad Kleinen railway station in Mecklenburg Western  Pomerania, police officer Michael Newrzella and suspected RAF  terrorist Wolfgang Grams were killed in late June 1993.  Suspected RAF member Birgit Hogefeld was arrested without being  injured. The slip-ups during the police operation, for which  the BKA, among others, was held responsible, led to the  resignation of Interior Minister Rudolf Seiters (CDU) and  Federal Public Prosecutor Alexander von Stahl.</p>

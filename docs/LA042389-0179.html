			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE OFFICER'S FIRING UPHELD  </P> <P> The Torrance Civil Service Commission has upheld the dismissal of Timothy  Thornton, the police officer fired last year for allegedly lying about the  accidental shooting of an unarmed man.  </P> <P> Thornton is expected to appeal the decision to the City Council.  </P> <P> Details of the three-day Civil Service Commission hearing, which ended last  week, are not available because Thornton's hearing was closed to the public and  to the press. In the past, disciplinary hearings concerning all city employees  have been held in public.  </P> <P> Thornton's firing stemmed from the shooting last May 9 of construction worker  Patrick Coyle by Officer Timothy Pappas.  </P> <P> Pappas accidentally shot Coyle and then lied to superiors to make it appear  that Coyle provoked the shooting when he moved suddenly on his motorcycle,  according to court papers filed in a related criminal case.  </P> <P> Thornton and Officer Mark Holden, who arrived just before the shooting, joined  in the lie to protect Pappas, the district attorney has charged. Holden and  Pappas face a preliminary hearing on criminal conspiracy charges May 11 in Los  Angeles Municipal Court.  </P> <P> Thornton is expected to receive a grant of immunity in exchange for testifying  against the other two, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher Darden.  </P> <P> All three officers were fired by the Torrance Police Department after Thornton  revealed the alleged cover-up.  </P></p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Oman warned: cut spending or face economic upheaval: World Bank spells out harsh realities The financial policies being pursued by Oman, whose political and economic stability is vital for the west's oil supplies coming from the Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz, are unsustainable, the World Bank warns in a recent study. Many of Oman's underlying structural economic weaknesses are shared by its neighbours and partners in the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC): Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE. While the last three, which hold 40 per cent of the world's known oil reserves, are not faced with the same immediate and critical choices as Oman, thanks to their larger 'cushion' of capital derived from their far greater oil reserves, all six share the same type of hereditary and autocratic monarchical government systems. Instability in one could quickly spread to one or more of the others. The bank is particularly severe on the scale of Oman's repeated budget deficits, current expenditure trends and the decline in investment, all of which feature - sometimes to a chronic extent - in the other five GCC countries. If these and other problems are not corrected, and the reforms proposed ignored, Oman is heading for a 'a major economic and social upheaval' as the oil and gas era comes to an end and Omanis are 'forced to give up accustomed standards of consumption'. Researched by a team of five in January and February 1993, the 224-page report was completed at the end of last May and subsequently made public 'in accordance with the World Bank's policy on disclosure'. The report amounts to a swingeing indictment of the Omani government's management of the economy, particularly over the last 10 years, when many key ministers have held the same jobs. The bank's analysis also represents a comprehensive rebuke to officials at all levels who have developed the 'plausible and positive platitude' almost to a fine art form, even when confronted with unpleasant realities. 'Oman's oil and gas wealth, being depletable, is analogous to a large inheritance . . . Oman, like most neighbouring oil and gas producers, is currently spending an excessive proportion of the proceeds of extraction on current consumption. In other words it is consuming its capital at a rapid rate,' the bank says. The main problems identified by the bank include: A persistent top-heavy government role in the economy; State budgets over-stretched by bloated recurrent expenditures, notably on defence and internal security (among the highest in the world with an average 33 per cent of budget expenditure for the last 14 years and now 23 per cent of GDP), and civil service salaries; Persistent and rising government-encouraged public consumption trends and a lack of domestic public savings; The lack of a consistent foreign and domestic investment strategy for when oil reserves taper off; An overvalued real exchange rate in relation to what would be consistent with higher (and more desirable) national savings rates; Failure of efforts to diversify into manufacturing and other non-oil industries because of current public expenditure/savings policies; Misuse of the state's reserve and contingency funds; Lack of appropriate tax structure and rates and realistic charges for public services; Ill-conceived notions about the role and cost of expatriate labour, and the consequent market distortions caused by government efforts to force private sector companies to employ nationals at uneconomic rates; Failure to alert Omanis to the reality of the country's fiscal position, to the inadequate rate of saving, and to their own unrealistic consumption and employment expectations; Bureaucratic inertia and lack of financial discipline by ministers over their own budget allocations; The absence of healthy competition in the private sector caused by entrenched monopolistic habits in the public and private sectors; Out-of-date and cumbersome legal frameworks; Lack of a self-sustaining private sector and an investment framework to attract foreign capital; Lack of a role for private banks in medium- and long-term financing; Too great an emphasis on higher education at the expense of primary and secondary schooling; Need for more entrepreneurial, competitive and less 'rent-seeking' (cash income for no effort and minimal risk) attitudes among nationals. For each of the main problem areas, the bank sets out two sets of scenarios: a 'base case', assuming neither big changes in government policies nor unforeseen external shocks; and a 'reform case', where the bank's detailed proposals to reverse the deficit trend are acted on. Some of the assumptions under the reform scenario could be faulted for being too optimistic, but even the most optimistic 'base case' models give cause for gloom. Observers say the growing incidence of some of these structural economic weaknesses, and the concomitant political risks which the governments of Oman and Saudi Arabia were courting by ignoring them, had a lot to do with protests which led to arrests of extremists last summer. Although oil prices have recovered from the lows of 1986 and 1988, they have remained, apart from a brief period during the latest Gulf war, below Dollars 18 a barrel, the bank points out. 'Even now, the (Omani) government has made only a partial expenditure adjustment to the stagnation in its oil revenues. In consequence, its financial position has deteriorated and continues to do so.' This, the report says, 'is apparent in an almost unbroken string of deficits since 1981 (an annual average deficit of Dollars 871m or 23.4 per cent annually over budget revenue during the 11-year period); declining contributions to the State General Reserve Fund (SGRF); a substantial rise in external debt; increased recourse to borrowing from the domestic private sector; a massive, recent accumulation of negative changes in the government's accounts; and the virtual disappearance of net government financial reserves. The deficits have been the result of an exceptionally high level of defence and national security expenditures, coupled with continued strong growth in civil recurrent expenditures. The use of the SGRF as an oil revenue stabilisation fund has pre-empted its potential as a vehicle for long-term public savings and investment. World Bank Report No 12199-OM.

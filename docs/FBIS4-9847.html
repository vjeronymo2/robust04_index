			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 31 Mar (EFE) -- Peruvian Justice Minister  Fernando Vega Santa Gadea described as "inconsistent" a report  by a commission of international jurists led by U.S. attorney  Robert Goldman that criticizes the Peruvian administration of  justice.    On 24 March Goldman informed Minister Vega that on 31 March  he was going to release the report on "the administration of  justice in Peru," which was prepared by the Goldman Commission  after a three-day visit to Peru in 1993.    In a letter to Goldman disseminated today, Vega denies  Goldman's contention that the Goldman report has been released  "at the request of the Peruvian Government."    Vega states that in the face of repeated requests by the  U.S.  Government "it was agreed" to allow a team of jurists led by  Goldman to visit Peru to learn about the Peruvian administration  of justice.    Vega adds that he has not asked the Goldman Commission for  any report and that the U.S. Embassy in Lima has noted that the  commission of jurists "has received this task from the State  Department."    These remarks, Vega says, should not be construed as a  refusal by the Peruvian Government to have U.S. jurists come to  Peru to learn about its justice system. He adds: "Yet, to  accept an analysis which criticizes the current legal system,  and which contains warnings and drastic recommendations that  should be applied immediately is an altogether different thing."    In his letter, Vega states that spending three days  analyzing  the Peruvian legal reality causes the report to be "so  superficial that most of its conclusions and recommendations are  only based on prejudgements and legal inconsistencies."    Vega adds that the report has overlooked the progress made  in  November 1993 in making the Peruvian antiterrorist laws more  flexible and states that the "reformulation" of the conclusions  to convert them into simple "suggestions" reflects "the low  degree of seriousness with which the original report was  conceived."    Vega "categorically" denies Goldman's allegation that he had  informed him that the commission was going to prepare a report  on the administration of justice in Peru.</p>

			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / South-east expected to lag in upturn THE south-east of England will lag behind most of the rest of the nation in a slow economic recovery this year, according to National Westminster Bank. The region is expected to show below-average growth of less than 0.6 per cent, while Wales and the north will grow by up to 1.1 per cent, Mr David Kern, the bank's chief economist, writes in the February issue of its Economic and Financial Outlook. Growth for the UK as a whole this year will be 0.9 per cent, but unemployment will continue to rise, reaching 3.35m by the end of this year, an increase of 13 per cent over the year. Unemployment in the south-east will grow by 18 per cent by the end of the year. The jobless rate in the south-east in December was 10.1 per cent, and the rate nationally was 10.5 per cent in January. The bank expects interest rates to fall a further 1 percentage point soon. As a consequence, headline inflation will fall to a low of 1.8 per cent in May. The headline figure was 2.6 per cent this month. Underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest rates, will drop to 3.5 per cent over the next few months from 3.7 per cent this month. But inflation will rise and increase pressure to raise interest rates towards the end of the year. As a result, underlying inflation will be 4.8 per cent next year.</p>

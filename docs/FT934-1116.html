			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Unilever ice cream empire grows Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, is set to become France's largest ice cream producer by taking control of Ortiz-Miko, a family-run frozen foods manufacturer, in a deal valued at Pounds 220m. The move will give Unilever about a third of the French ice cream market and strengthen it in the food service business. France is the only large European country in which Unilever, the world's biggest ice cream maker, is not market leader. The deal will put it ahead of Nestle, of Switzerland, which has about a quarter of the French market. Ortiz-Miko has about 18 per cent of the French market, where its main brand is Miko. It also has ice cream businesses in Germany and Belgium with combined annual sales of more than FFr600m (Pounds 68m). The company is particularly strong in 'impulse' ice creams, sold through small retail outlets, which are the fastest growing part of the market. It complements Unilever's French ice cream business, which mainly sells bulk packs to supermarkets. The deal entails Unilever buying 75 per cent of Safral, a family-owned holding company which owns 85 per cent of Ortiz-Miko. Unilever plans a public offer, to be launched by Rothschild et Cie, for the remaining 15 per cent of Ortiz-Miko shares, which are quoted on the Paris stock exchange. Vivagel, Ortiz-Miko's consumer frozen foods business, will be sold to BSN, France's biggest food manufacturer, for FFr350m. Ortiz-Miko has 6,000 employees and had sales last year of FFr5.3bn. About FFr700m of that was accounted for by Vivagel. Unilever will keep Ortiz-Miko's distribution network and its foods service division, which sells more than FFr2bn of frozen foods annually to institutional and restaurant customers. Recession, fierce competition in the French grocery business and heavy investments in a new ice cream plant and in marketing have depressed Ortiz-Miko's recent financial performance. Last year, net profit fell to FFr12.7m from FFr53.5m in 1991. The deal, in which BSN played an important behind-the-scenes role, will be a disappointment to Nestle. The Swiss group has also been expanding in ice cream and last year worked closely with BSN to take over Perrier, France's biggest mineral water producer. Unilever earlier this year formed a joint venture with BSN to make and market products worldwide combining ice cream and yoghurt, of which the French company is the world's largest manufacturer. The takeover of Ortiz-Miko will require approval by the Brussels competition authorities, which are investigating allegations that Unilever has restricted competition in ice cream by excluding rival brands from the freezer cabinets it supplies to retailers. The Ortiz family, which founded Ortiz-Miko in 1921, will retain 25 per cent of Safral. The Unilever deal excludes Safral's interests in smoked salmon, vegetables, fish and Spanish ice cream and frozen foods. Lex, Page 14</p>

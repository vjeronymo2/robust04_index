The interview was conducted by  Margaret Sheno. Its text is as follows:    The Leader: Are you coming from America or from Egypt    Margaret: I was not able to come directly to Libya. I  arrived in Cairo and hired a car with an Egyptian chauffeur. I  traveled to Tubruq and Banghazi then to here. I crossed half of  Libya to you. I crossed the world.    The Leader: We are sorry for the troubles caused by your  government.    Margaret: Is this a fact?    The Leader: Certainly.    Margaret: Can you explain the style of this tent design? Are  the colours of a special significance?    The Leader: That means the stars for the transparency of the  sky and the sun. The yellow colour is for the desert.    Margaret: In a certain phase of this interview I will talk  about politics but as we have met in the desert I want to thank  you and I am sorry for not being able to speak your language.  Can we start now by politics. What does this all mean? The  desert we are close to your birth-place? Is it not so. The  desert is one of my ways of understanding who you are when you  tell me something I can understand it better [as received].  Don't you believe me? Tell me about your origins. You are a  man of military training and you have written the Green Book so  what does the desert mean to you?    The Leader: Firstly I am not a military man    Margaret: You are a military man.    The Leader: Since I was a student at the secondary school I  started establishing the popular revolutionary movement and I  created revolutionary cells.    Margaret: At the secondary school. Amongst the students?    The Leader: Yes, students and non-students. We joined the  army in order that some of us pass through the army and use it  for the revolution. I was not recruited as a professional  soldier. I hate the military and I consider the military as a  fascist organization. The military has destroyed the world it is  the tool of invaders and tyrants which used it to cross the  borders and injure the others and ruin the world. When I see  the military badges I hate it because it reminds me of the  badges of Mussolini and Hitler and then my theory calls for the  abolition of armies as it calls also for the abolition of  parties, parliaments, classes and governments.    Margaret: When did you start thinking about the revolution?    The Leader: Since I was 17 years old. Between [passage  indistinct] the Libyans but in 1951 Libya was not like that.    The Leader: I started establishing the revolution since 1959    Margaret: Why 1959?    The Leader: That was the start of reason with me. It is then  I knew that the third world was colonized and it is then I knew  there was western colonization.    Margaret: Was that in 1959?    The Leader: Yes. At that time I was aware of it.    Margaret: What was the western power? Was there the king?    The Leader: In 1969 there were five American military bases  in the Libyan territory. There were British bases, in fact  armies, present here and there was the Italian settler  colonization.    Margaret: An Italian settler presence in 1969?    The Leader: Yes.    Margaret: Then according to you in 1969 even with the  presence of the king or others Libya did not belong to Libya.    The Leader: Certainly.    Margaret: What about 'Abd-al-Nasir? Does he mean something  to  you?    The Leader: He is one of the heroes of liberation in the  world.    Margaret: In what way?    The Leader: Because he is a defender of freedom. The freedom  of nations. It means that the nations lost an international  defender. The cause of freedom lost by the death of  'Abd-al-Nasir.    Margaret: The military has destroyed the world and created  chaos as you said. But when you came to power for the first  time you built the army with Soviet weapons, you went to the  south to Chad.    The Leader: That was in the beginning, but now it is over.  It change [as received]. The army is abolished now and it is  replaced by the armed people.    Margaret: The armed people means the people with weapons.    The Leader: No, it is the armed [word indistinct] now  onwards.    Margaret: You are saying that and you are smiling.    The Leader: There is no state in the world that I did not  survive its presidents and kings with the exception of Morocco  and Jordan.    Margaret: And Syria.    The Leader: In Syria I survived three presidents since 1969.    Margaret: Is that true but [Hafiz] al-Asad is a president  for  life as I know. What do you feel when you see the departure of  these people?    The Leader: I feel the intensity of my international  experience.    Margaret: Did you learn from these people?    The Leader: Certainly.    Margaret: What? Perhaps I am wrong but I mean the good  things?    The Leader: I know that. We call it the good lessons.    Margaret: What did you learn from American presidents?    The Leader: I knew what is America. America is not a  nationality like other nationalities. Not like India or China  or [words indistinct]. America is all the nations. All of us.  We have made America and we are still making it. Even my sons  if they go to America and stay there for ten years they will  [words indistinct].    Margaret: Did your sons go to the United States?    The Leader: No. They have got the desire to go but if  America allows them.    Margaret: Why do they have the desire to go?    The Leader: The elder son wishes to be the son in law of the  American president.    Margaret: You are kidding.    The Leader: No.    Margaret: What daughter of the president, [words indistinct]  Clinton I don't [words indistinct] don't like Arabs.    Margaret: I do not believe your son will marry the daughter  of the American president. I do not believe it. Perhaps your  son got [word indistinct] better expression. Do you speak  seriously?    The Leader: Yes, I speak seriously. We have got a number of  Libyan sons and they [word indistinct] Americans and offer  sevices for the American people which they consider their people  and they consider America as their second home. Some of them  were educated there and remain there you have to thank us. We  have highly prominent experts and scientists present with you.  You have to thank the Libyan people .    Margaret: Thank you.    The Leader: Thank the Libyan people which is a small nation  and even so they contributed to the making of America.    Margaret: You always have a feeling and the awareness  regarding the size of your country and you always hold  comparisions between countries as big and small.    The Leader: In respect of human beings we do not know of one  big and one small. All the sons of Adam are equal -- it is you  who know the big and small and the iron and wood. Iron and  wood. With weapons. With wealth these are your scales for the  big and small that is the American complex. You always [words  indistinct] the people as big [word indistinct]    Margaret: Let us forget the question of your son and  marriage. Do they have a different feeling towards America?    The Leader: We differentiate between America and the  imperilaist policy.    Margaret: Can you describe that to me. This will help me in  explaining this issue to American readers. What are the  American policies that you see?    The Leader: The ruining of other nations' economies.    Margaret: What nations?    The Leader: All other nations especially the third world is  still colonized and is not independent yet.    Margaret: Even Egypt?    The Leader: All of us. The third world will enter the phase  of liberation. There will be no presence for the west in the  third world, no tourist, no relation, no company, no investment  and no trade.    Margaret: And you support that. I thought you were a friend  of President Mubarak. Is he aware that he is colonized?    The Leader: Even Libya is not independent yet. The battle  for independence did not begin yet.    Margaret: All these western countries pump your oil. Why are  you not grateful for them?    The Leader: They need the oil and if we want to punish them  we will stop the oil from them.    Margaret: No.    The Leader: We might do it.    Margaret: What will you do for cash and resources?    The Leader: We are not in need of cash. We need  independence.    Margaret: Why - I don't think so, especially oil. I have  seen scores of Mercedes outside.    The Leader: This is colonization.    Margaret: You brought it.    The Leader: We should have manufactured it here or else we  drop it. This is the first step we have to take. We will not  import goods from the west. And then [words indistinct] the  force of the east will be sufficient rather than the west.    Margaret: What is this force?    The Leader: China, India, Malysia and Indonesia.    Margaret: Do you have any relationship with this issue. Is  it friendship or treaties?    The Leader: We will shift to these countries so as to  deprive  the west from the billions they used to enjoy from our countries.    Margaret: Who do you mean?    The Translator: The west.    The Leader: We will buy the goods from the Asian countries  we  will open our markets for them. We will [passage indistinct]</p>

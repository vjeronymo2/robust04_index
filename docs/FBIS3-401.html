He was addressing  a public session of the assembly after it met in committee  during the course of the morning.    Dr Hartzenberg said AVF Gen Constand Viljoen's decision to  register the organisation on Friday night for the election was  "good," but the assembly had considered all the benefits and  drawbacks on Saturday and decided not participate in the  election -- unless its demands were met by the government and  the African National Congress.    The AVF was not prepared to subject its nation to a  communist  government. The only way left for the Afrikaner to achieve a  peaceful solution was to stand up and state his demands. The  nation should be pointed in the right direction and mobilised to  achieve freedom and self-determination.    Dr Hartzenberg said the Freedom Alliance [FA] members were  free to each make their own decision as to whether to  participate in the poll or not. Different decisions would not  affect the FA's unity, he said.    Dr Hartzenberg's announcement was applauded by rightwing  supporters who attended the open session of the assembly's  meeting in the Dutch Reformed Church synodal centre. All the  leading rightwing figures, including the Mulder brothers,  Afrikaner Weersstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement]  leader Eugene Terreblanche and Gen Viljoen, were present.</p>

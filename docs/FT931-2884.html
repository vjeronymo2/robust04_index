			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Aga records profits up by 3% AGA, the Swedish industrial gas group, saw profits after financial items rise 3 per cent in 1992 to SKr1.48bn (Dollars 189m), and predicted a further improvement in its performance this year. The dividend is being increased to SKr9 per share from SKr8.50. Turnover fell to SKr11.9bn from SKr12.7bn, despite improved sales from both its core gas operations and Frigoscandia, its cold storage and food processing business. The drop reflected the group's 1992 merger of its Uddeholm energy unit, which contributed SKr1.37bn to 1991 sales, with Swedish power group Gullspangs Kraft. Aga has 34 per cent of the capital of the merged group, which it reports as an associate company. Group operating income fell to SKr1.29bn from SKr1.46bn in 1991 when the group's energy operations made a SKr118m contribution. However, financial income amounted to SKr188m, compared with SKr27m in costs last year. Despite recession in many markets, and particularly in the Nordic countries, gas sales rose 5 per cent to SKr8.97bn and operating income was up 2 per cent at SKr1.16bn. Frigoscandia saw sales climb 3 per cent to SKr2.91bn, but operating income dropped 35 per cent to SKr130m. This reflected fierce competition and reduced margins within the group's food process systems unit. The group's confidence for 1993 is based on its rationalisation programme, the weakness of the Swedish krona, and the development of new areas of application for its products.</p>

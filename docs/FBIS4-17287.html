			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Irina Savvateyeva: "Bankruptcy Surgery May Be the </F> Way to Help a Sick National Economy"]    [Text] On Tuesday Boris Yeltsin sent a letter about the  problem of nonpayments not only, as it happens, to Viktor  Chernomyrdin, but also to Ivan Rybkin, Vladimir Shumeyko, and  Viktor Gerashchenko. While drawing attention to the urgency of  the problem of nonpayments, the president stressed at the same  time that the highly delicate problem of bankruptcy, which the  authorities are showing no signs of tackling, had to be resolved  more rapidly.    But the choice of the epistolary mode raises some questions.  Aleksandr Livshits, head of the president's group of experts,  talking about it in an interview for IZVESTIYA, said that a  letter, unlike an edict, has no directive force, and it does not  prescribe measures that have to be implemented. Yeltsin was  merely expounding his own view of an urgent problem, setting it  out, as it were, for the Federal Assembly, government, and  Central Bank to view.    So the mode chosen by the president suggests that Boris  Nikolayevich is granting the addressees the right not only to  tackle a very acute issue independently, but also to take  responsibility for its solution.    It should be noted in this connection that the head of the  group of experts categorically rejected the statement ascribed  to him by ITAR-TASS that, by sending the letter, "Boris Yeltsin  is assuming full responsibility for the second step of the  reforms, including the need to rid the Russian economy of those  production facilities with no future."    "Of course, the president did not have anything of the sort  in mind."    Indeed, the document itself is devoted, apparently, not so  much to the problem of bankruptcy as to actual nonpayments.  According to Livshits, the letter maps out various ways of  resolving this problem, including the bankruptcy procedure. And  each addressee is being recommended tasks that fall within his  sphere of responsibilities.    The president has taken into account, Livshits stressed, all  the proposals from various departments on resolving the  nonpayments problem. Including the Finance Ministry's scheme  for the return of state debts, which are often the cause of  nonpayments (see IZVESTIYA 31 March 1994 for more detail), and a  proposal on implementing bankruptcy procedure, put forward by  the Federal Administration for Insolvency Cases and the  Economics Ministry...    Unfortunately, IZVESTIYA journalists were unable to get a  look at the text of the letter in order to be able to provide  more details. The two-hour search for the document was  unsuccessful.    The unflappable president's press service duty officer said:  "It is an unofficial document and we do not have it..." Either  the addressees' press services, offices, and general deparments  had no idea of the letter or they were being kept out of it, as  was the Duma apparatus: "Rybkin has the letter. What were we  supposed to do, show it to everyone?!"    Yet, actually, it would not have hurt to "show the document  to everyone." Of course, I am addressing this notion not to a  petty official in the Duma general department, but to senior  staffers of B. Yeltsin's apparatus.    The heads of the Federal Assembly, government, and Central  Bank will have a great deal of work to do implementing the  proposals set down in the president's letter. Not only will  they have to adopt special decrees, but they will also have to  amend current legislation.    But the existence of the letter by no means signifies that  amendments and decrees will be adopted immediately. The  president has merely expressed his view on an urgent problem,  thus indicating possible ways of cooperating with the  legislative authority. Whether this cooperation comes about is  not dependent on him alone.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The AL-AHRAM AL-MASA'I correspondent has learned  that the Egyptian security organs will contact U.S. authorities  through Interpol to deport Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, the mufti  of the al- Jihad Organization in Egypt, following the ruling of  the Higher State Security Court-Emergency yesterday sentencing  him to seven years at hard labor. [see previous Terrorism Report]    A security source said that the necessary measures will be  taken to deport the defendant on the basis of the court's  ruling. He added that there is coordination with the concerned  authorities in the United States because of the absence of an  extradition treaty between the two countries. The security  source also stressed to the paper's correspondent 'Adil  al-Suruji that countries take into consideration bilateral  relations and the principle of equal treatment in such important  cases.

They are now experimenting with establishing foreign-funded  shareholding companies, using the BOT (build-operate-transfer)  mode in infrastructure projects and establishing foreign-funded  trust and investment and foreign investment companies.    China has so far approved establishment of 170,000  foreign-funded enterprises, of which about half have gone into  operation, and used 60 billion U.S. dollars in foreign  investment.    Now the Chinese have begun to think deeply over how to use  foreign investment more efficiently and push ahead the opening  up program to a higher level while opening wider.    This new tendency can find expression in discussions among  deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) on the  government work report at the current NPC session.    China began to open to the outside world in the late 1970s  and since then five special economic zones have been established  in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou and Xiamen cities and Hainan  Province.    Shenzhen Mayor Li Youwei and Xiamen Mayor Hong Yongshi  maintained that under the new situation, special economic zones  should pay due attention to readjusting the foreign investment  structure and develop new and high-tech industries.    In the future, while continuing serving as showcases for  absorbing foreign investment, technology and management  expertise, special economic zones should fully play an exemplary  role to other areas in establishing a socialist market economy,  boosting economic growth by relying on science and technology  and exercising economic management according to law, Hong  Yongshi said.    As a step to open wider to the outside world, China  successively opened 14 coastal cities, cities along the Chang  Jiang River and borders and inland provincial capital cities,  and Pudong New Development Area in Shanghai.    Since then an all-round opening up pattern has taken shape  in  China.    Under such a situation, opening wider not only means opening  more fields for foreign investment and opening domestic markets,  but also means priority of preferences will be shifted to  industries instead of to certain regions.    NPC deputies from economically under-developed central and  western areas made a strong call for opening their areas wider  to the outside world, saying this is a major measure to narrow,  step by step, the gap between economically developed eastern  areas and western areas.    Wang Youjie, secretary of Luohe city party committee in  Henan  Province, called for pushing ahead with opening in various  fields in central and western areas, while deputies from Inner  Mongolia Autonomous Region and Shaanxi Province suggested such  areas attract foreign investment to develop agricultural and  animal husbandry, communications and energy and exploit their  abundant resources.    What the deputies suggested coincides with policies the  Chinese Government is preparing to institute. These policies  are explained by Chinese Premier Li Peng and State Planning  Commission Minister Chen Jinhua in their reports to the current  NPC session.    Another Chinese senior leader further explained that to  encourage central and western areas to use foreign investment  and encourage flow of foreign investment into infrastructure and  basic industries are the "same thing in essence."    During a group discussion with NPC deputies from Gansu  Province, Hu Jintao, member of the Political Bureau Standing  Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee,  emphasized the significance of opening to the development of  central and western areas, saying that opening wide can promote  development.    State-owned large and medium-sized enterprises afflicted  with  difficulties have been a difficult problem for the Chinese for  years. Jin Zhezhu, vice-governor of Jilin Province, an old  industrial base, and an NPC deputy, pointed out that to actively  use foreign investment for technical renovation for enterprises  is an important approach to raise efficiency of state-owned  enterprises.    To make sure that the opening program moves towards a higher  level, many deputies said, efforts should be made to perfect  relevant laws and regulations and more attention be paid to  assimilation of imported advanced foreign technology while  improving investment environment.    Chen Bingzhen, professor of Qinghua University, maintained  that in importing foreign technology, the old practice of  importing by different channels, redundant, blind and disorderly  import of overseas technology and equipment and import of  isolated parts should be abandoned.    Deputies expressed their belief that along with the opening  moving towards a higher level, China will expand its scale of  using foreign investment, technology and advanced management  expertise, and will be more mature and efficient in this regard.  China's economy will converge with the world economy in a  faster pace.</p>

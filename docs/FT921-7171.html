			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Economics: View on world slowdown awaited THE DEGREE to which the world economy faces a slowdown this year will be indicated in a rash of economic figures published over the next few days. One of the highlights for statistical aficionados will be the revised figures on Friday for growth of US gross domestic product in the final quarter of last year, measured on an annual basis. Financial markets are looking for a figure of around 0.7 per cent, indicating that the much-flagged US recovery may be under way. Meanwhile, the apparent slowdown in the Japanese economy has provided shivers of apprehension to onlookers who have become accustomed to Japan acting as an engine of world expansion. Analysts believe Japanese industrial production in January, to be announced on Wednesday, will have shown virtually no change on the month before, signifying a difficult period ahead for the economy. In the UK, the only economic indicator of note will be released on Thursday, when the government publishes details of last month's current account deficit. This is expected to be slightly higher than December's figure of Pounds 688m. Other data from France, Germany and Italy are likely to indicate the poor conditions for growth that are apparent in these nations, adding to the shroud which hangs over the world economic outlook. Highlights of the week are as follows. The figures in brackets are forecasts, provided by MMS, a business information company.

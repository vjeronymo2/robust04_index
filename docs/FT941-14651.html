			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: TAP restructure gains approval The Lisbon government has approved a restructuring plan for TAP-Air Portugal, the state-owned airline. The strategy involves injecting Es180bn (Dollars 1bn) into the debt-ridden company, reducing the workforce by 2,400 people and seeking a foreign partner. The approval of the plan ends months of speculation over the future of the airline. Mr Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral, minister for public works, transport and communications, said: 'The agreement is bad news for many competitors who predicted TAP would be forced to close down.' The state will absorb part of TAP's debt by injecting Es180bn into the company in four tranches over the next four years. TAP's accumulated debt reached Es124.4bn in 1993 and operating losses rose to Es35bn, the worst result in the company's history. Under the plan, TAP is forecast to return to profits in 1996, with a forecast net profit Es300m, growing to Es12.7bn in 1997. From 1997, when TAP's debt is forecast to have fallen to Es114.5bn, the company's earnings should be sufficient to cover its own debt liabilities, according to Mr Ferreira do Amaral. The airline's staff level of 9,500 people will be cut to 7,110 by 1997. This implies the loss of 800 jobs in 1994 compared with forecasts that the company would dismiss 2,000 workers this year. TAP will abolish all of its flights to North America except to New York and will drop flights on 15 or 16 secondary routes in Europe.</p>

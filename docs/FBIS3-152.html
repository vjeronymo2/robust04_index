The discussions of specific  principles and modalities of national reconciliation are still  at an edge. The parties have not yet reached an agreement  because of two issues, which we do not know because of news  blackout. What we know is that the document under discussion  has 16 points and an agreement has already been reached on 14  points. According to a source, the parties have yet to reach  agreement on fundamental issues for national reconciliation.  Other reports say agreements have already been reached on  issues, such as administrative decentralization and the  participation of the National Union for the Total Independence  of Angola [UNITA] in the country's administration.</p>

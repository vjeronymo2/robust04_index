			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Four Polish banks plan merger The consolidation of Poland's fragmented banking sector moved forward yesterday when four state-owned banks signed a letter of intent to merge their operations. The four, the Bank Zachodni in Wroclaw, the Bank Depozytowo Kredytowy in Lublin, the Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy in Lodz and the Pomorski Bank Kredytowy in Szczecin, have established a committee to report on the issue by the end of next month. The move comes after state sector banks were told by the government to find partners as part of the privatisation process. It leaves Bank Gdanski as the only bank of the nine hived off from the central bank in 1989 without a merger deal in sight. The four banks are among Poland's 10 largest banks. The merger would give them a capital base worth 8,175.5bn zlotys (Dollars 362m), making them the second largest bank in the country. Their combined balance sheet at the end of June was worth 112,313bn zlotys and amounted to 11 per cent of the banking system. At the weekend, the Bank Zachodni, acting in its own right, purchased the small private Market Bank in Poznan for 6.1bn zlotys. Mr Krzysztof Kalicki, deputy finance minister responsible for the banking sector, yesterday said the Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy (PBH) in Krakow would be sold through the Warsaw stock exchange on January 14. He said one more bank would be privatised during the year in a process which is to run until 1997.</p>

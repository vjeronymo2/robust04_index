			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Management abstracts Danger - 'entrepreneurs' at work. Business Executive (UK), Jul/Aug 90 (3 pages) Mounts an attack on the 'immense amount of waste and petty fraud endemic within the British economy. Ranges widely, from copier/phone abuse via private businesses run from employed positions to those who maximise tax-free expenses, freebies, and subsidised travel ('academics are particular experts'). Then speculates that the condition isn't confined to Britain - to suggest so would be racial discrimination. ***** Fighting white-collar crime. K Ellis &amp; S Pitt in Business Executive (UK), Jul/Aug 90 (3 pages) Warns of the increase in white-collar crime (theft, computer fraud, bribery and espionage) and draws attention to the services of consultants and the availability of insurance. Suggests that consultants and insurers should get together to convince their target market of what is needed. ***** Champions of change. J M Howell &amp; C A Higgins in Business Quarterly (Canada), Spring 90 (6 pages) Outlines the significant contribution that champions make to the innovative process by taking creative ideas, which they may or may not have generated themselves, and bringing them to life; examines their personality characteristics - such as self-confidence and willingness to take risks - and leadership qualities. Discusses three processes by which champions generally operate, defined as the renegade, the rational, and the participative; looks at how champions may be fostered in organisations. ***** Evaluating investments in information technology. S L Huff in Business Quarterly (Canada), Spring 90 (4 pages) Discusses how the assessment of pay-off from IT investments can be considered at the macroeconomic, business unit, functional, and individual levels; stresses that while it might not be necessary to translate intangible benefits into quantitative terms, they cannot be omitted from the equations if the analysis is to be meaningful.

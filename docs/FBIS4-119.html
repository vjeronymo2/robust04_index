			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban April 1 SAPA -- Senior police and army  officers met in Durban on Friday [1 April] morning to begin  planning security operations in Natal/kwaZulu under the  emergency regulations. South African Defence Force [SADF]  spokesman Col Frans Verfuss said the South African Police,  kwaZulu Police and SADF were represented at the 10am meeting.    "They're meeting to discuss the emergency regulations and to  do joint planning," he said.    The role of the kwaZulu Police [KZP] was on the agenda, he  said. This follows a statement by African National Congress  President Nelson Mandela on Thursday that the KZP would be  confined to barracks and certain laws in kwaZulu would be  suspended under the emergency regulations. "The KZP is going to  be confined to barracks and it will perform such duties as  permitted by the defence force," said Mr Mandela.    "The effect is to suspend all legislation in the area in  which the emergency applies. The effect is that there will be no  kwaZulu minister of police," he added.    Col Verfuss said three companies of soldiers -- about 500 in  total -- would be deployed in natal at the weekend, in addition  to existing troops. He declined to indicate current troop  strengths in Natal.    Col Verfuss said reports of troops "streaming" into the  region were unfounded. There had also not been a mass call-up in  Natal.    "Natal command has called up people for the period April 15  to May 15 for elections," he said, adding that the chief of the  South African Army had also called up reserves, but it was not  clear yet where they would be deployed.    "The situation will decide where troops are deployed. At  this  stage tensions are high and there are pockets of violence; it's  not widespread."    Townships around Durban appeared quiet on Friday morning,  with no immediate reports of overnight violence.</p>

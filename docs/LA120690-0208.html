			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NURSE TO START HOME FOR KIDS WITH AIDS;  </P> <P> HEALTH: CITY WILL SELL GRAFFITI-COVERED DUPLEX TO A WOMAN WHO RUNS SIMILAR  FACILITY FOR ADULTS.  </P> <P> The City Council last week agreed to sell a 53-year-old nurse a  graffiti-covered duplex that she wants to turn into a home for children with  AIDS.  </P> <P> The city built the duplex with federal funds for low-income residents. But  after prospective buyers inspected the building and its crime-infested block on  Cerritos Avenue, only Yvonne Henderson made a bid.  </P> <P> Henderson told council she hopes to open the home to five children by this  winter. She plans to purchase the $140,000 duplex with donations and wages she  earns as a nurse. Henderson said she is working on an application for a state  license to open the foster home.  </P> <P> She runs another home, called Ebony Haus, where 10 men and women with AIDS  live. Most of them are minorities and poor.  </P> <P> Henderson sees a growing need for homes for children with AIDS. "These are the  innocent little lives," Henderson said.  </P> <P> Henderson, who is a grandmother, said she will find one aspect of the project  for children particularly difficult. "It will be hard to watch the children  go," she said. "But I tell myself, I can't play God. All I can do is try to  make the children more comfortable."  </P> <P> More help is sorely needed, according to local doctors, social workers and AIDS  activists. Currently, only one group foster home for children with AIDS  operates in Los Angeles County. And Long Beach hospitals report a small but  growing number of newborns infected with the AIDS virus.  </P> <P> At least four infected babies were born to drug-addicted mothers at St. Mary  Medical Center this year, according to Dr. Roger Takla, director of  neonatology. They were sent to foster families. Previously, hospital staff only  read about such cases, in cities such as New York. "It's everywhere now, even  Long Beach," Takla said.  </P> <P> A nurse with the city's biggest pediatric AIDS treatment program reports an  "explosion" in the number of patients she sees. "In the last three months,  we've picked up six babies, and that's just a small piece of what's to come,"  said Linda Siemers, coordinator of Memorial Miller Children's Pediatric HIV  program.  </P> <P> The program's caseload has grown from a couple of children a few years ago to  about 35 now, Siemers said. Half of them live with foster families.  </P> <P> Dr. Audra Deveikis, head of the program at Miller, said that in the past, most  pediatric victims were hemophiliacs who contracted the disease through  transfusions of tainted blood. But the vast majority of recent cases have  contracted AIDS from their mothers, who are drug addicts or who have sexual  partners who are addicts or bisexual.  </P> <P> These women are often so sick that they can't take care of themselves, let  alone their children. Some mothers of pediatric AIDS victims are already dead.  </P> <P> Some foster families are afraid to take on AIDS children. Many of the newest  babies are minority children. They have enormous medical needs and are almost  sure to die.  </P> <P> One county social worker, who asked not to be identified, estimated that seven  of 10 potential foster families reject her when she calls around trying to  place an AIDS baby.  </P> <P> "Nobody really wants these kids," Siemers said. "We need a lot more foster  homes. Anything that improve their life while they are in this terminal illness  is worth whatever it costs."  </P></p>

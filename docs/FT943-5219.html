			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: Emerging markets regain lost ground - International Investors are slowly returning to the secondary market for emerging country debt - one of the most volatile of all fixed income markets. Earlier this year, amid turmoil in international bond markets, investors dumped so-called 'Brady bonds' - paper issued to restructure medium-term public sector debt to foreign commercial banks - and other emerging market debt instruments. The market remained in the doldrums for much of the spring and summer but last month, following the stabilisation of US long bond rates and positive political news in both Mexico and Brazil, prices began to recover. Analysts and traders say the market could now regain more lost ground. 'The worst appears to be over. One big proviso is that US long-term interest rates remain stable,' says Peter West, economic adviser to West Merchant Bank in London. West Merchant's secondary debt market index - based on the prices of 13 emerging countries' debt - shows a decline of some 25 per cent between the end of last year and late April. More recently though, the index has recovered, rising by nearly 9 per cent between July 25 and August 22. Two factors in particular have helped. First, US Treasury bonds have stabilised. Investors measure the yields of Brady and other traded debt against that of the US long bond and the sharp decline in prices following the rise in US short-term interest rates triggered this year's decline. The more recent flat trend in long-term US rates - with yields around 7.5 per cent for some weeks - has helped confidence and has allowed investors to focus more on a number of positive political developments in Latin America. Second, the apparently 'clean' victory last month of Ernesto Zedillo, the candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party in Mexico's presidential election, has reassured foreign investors in a country which has issued a quarter of all Latin Brady bonds. At the same time improving prospects for Brazil - which accounts for 37 per cent of all Latin American Brady bonds issued - has had a big impact. The fall in inflation following the introduction in July of the 'real' plan, has helped Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the plan's architect and former finance minister, surge ahead in the opinion polls, ahead of October's elections. Mr West is particularly impressed by the commitment of Mr Cardoso to thorough-going fiscal reform, which he believes could help consolidate the country's recovery. The rise in Brazilian 'Bradys' has led the rally, with the price of par bonds rising by 10.9 per cent and C Bonds up by 22.3 per cent in the month between July 25 and August 22. There are some indications that the rally in prices has eased in the last two weeks. In particular, Venezuelan debt prices have fallen sharply in the last few days. Some analysts suggest that the good news on the Brazilian and Mexican political scene has now been fully discounted in prices. 'We think that in the near term Mexican and Brazilian Brady bonds are technically unlikely to rally from here,' says Mr Paul Luke, head of emerging markets research at Morgan Grenfell. However in general there are grounds for optimism about future prospects, Mr Luke and others point out. Following this year's fall in prices, there is now a much greater difference between the yields of different Brady bonds. The gap in 'spreads' between the cheapest bonds, those issued by Nigeria, and the most expensive paper, from Mexico, is now more than three times greater than it was eight months ago. 'You don't have the spread compression,' says Mr Luke. 'Investors are being paid more for taking the big risks.' In addition some Brady bonds, those issued at a discount to face value and paying variable rates should benefit from the rise in interest rates. Also despite the fall in prices, liquidity has improved following growth in trading volume. Trading volume in emerging market debt reached almost Dollars 2,000bn in 1993, more than twice the volume recorded in the previous year, according to a survey by the Emerging Markets Traders Association. The completion this year of Brady deals for both Brazil and Bulgaria and the imminent prospect of an agreement for Poland has increased the supply of paper. 'The market is basically broadening,' says Mr Rodzianko of Chemical Bank in New York, who is chairman of the association. Buyers have been coming back to the market, with some recovery of interest among US institutional investors and mutual funds. Mr Rodzianko says there has been growth in local interest, especially in Brazil, where investment banks and other institutions have been active recently. 'Brazil is going to be unstoppable. There is a high upside potential,' he says. Mr Luke is optimistic on prospects for Bulgaria and Poland and also says Peru and Panama could be close to Brady deals. 'You need good fundamentals or low prices or a combination of both. In many cases here you have good fundamental stories where assets are cheap. You can't keep a good market down.'</p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Treasury may act over savings: Building societies blame government for heavy outflow of deposits BUILDING SOCIETIES are step-ping up pressure on the government to make National Savings products less competitive after suffering their second biggest monthly outflow of deposits ever in June. In response to warnings by societies that competition from National Savings could force them to push up both their savings and mortgage rates, the Treasury said it was considering whether to cut the rate offered on its highly successful First Option Bond, launched two weeks ago. A Treasury official said: 'The rates are under continuous review in the light of market developments and we could not speculate on if and when rates might change.' The Building Societies Association will announce on Wednesday that Pounds 315m flowed out of their savings accounts last month. Leading building societies blamed the government's campaign to attract funds into National Savings investments. 'If we have to go on competing with the (National Savings) rates that are out there, mortgage interest rates are going to have to go up,' said Mr David O'Brien, chief executive of National &amp; Provincial building society, the seventh largest. He said his society would decide whether to increase its mortgage rate in 'the next 10 days'. On Friday, the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth biggest society, raised its home loans rate from 10.75 per cent to 10.99 per cent. The Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth biggest society, will decide in the next two days whether to follow suit. The Treasury said yesterday it had no plans to withdraw its popular new First Options Bond, despite the threat posed by it to mortgage rates. It attracted Pounds 112m during the nine days since it became available on July 7, an unusually high amount for any new savings product. The bond competes directly with building societies by offering a one-year investment with basic rate tax deducted. Its current gross interest rate, of 10.34 per cent, is superior to any directly comparable building society product. National Savings said yesterday that in June, before the First Option Bond launch, its products attracted Pounds 218m of net new investment - Pounds 131m lower than the figures for May but significantly better than the previous June. Since the beginning of the year, National Savings has been promoting its products heavily. Mr Mark Boleat, chairman of the Building Societies Association, said: 'The government is well aware of the nature of the problem.' But he pointed out that the government was under great pressure to fund its borrowing requirement. A withdrawal of the bond - or any change in the interest rate to make it less attractive - would cause difficulties to the government, he said. Mr Mike Blackburn, chief executive of Leeds Permanent, said: 'Mortgage lenders are in for a further difficult period'. He warned that a continuing recession in the housing market would lead to the collapse of construction companies. Halifax, the biggest provider of mortgages in the UK, said: 'We do not want to do anything which would cause difficulty for the housing market, and at the moment we have no immediate intention of raising mortgage rates.' Only once has the outflow of deposits from building societies been greater. That was in September 1986, when savers withdrew funds to invest in the TSB flotation.

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Ad men plan the selling of Europe THE European Commission yesterday was trying to distance itself from a report due out today, which suggests it should centralise information about the EC, in order to make it 'come alive, for the public'. Brussels commissioned the report from 'outside experts' - mainly from public relations and advertising companies - last November. Its own efforts to make badly needed improvements in informing EC citizens about what 'Europe' does have meanwhile been held in abeyance. Senior officials directly involved in the exercise have received the report with undisguised dismay - and Euro-expletives. They are, above all, angered at the patronising tone and political insensitivity of its recommendations, at a time when ratification of the Maastricht treaty still hangs on approval by Danish voters and the British parliament. The report, which is simply advisory, recommends the Commission should immediately establish a centralised 'office of communications' to 'ensure that the EC speaks with one voice'. It would be involved in securing 'binding agreements' after every main decision about 'the message to communicate and the means for its communication'. This is probably the most inflammatory ingredient in a cocktail of ideas, some of which border on mysticism, and others of which are sub-Orwellian. Promoting the Maastricht treaty, the report says, is to try to sell the wrong product. The EC should be 'positioned' as 'a branded product', to promote the idea of 'togetherness', with symbols which, for instance, would make the Commission appear 'sympathetic, warm and caring'. To this end, it recommends a 'Europe '99' programme for 'the third millennium', with 'mystical connotations'; a June 1994 summit to explain 'a better tomorrow'; batteries of public relations experts advising on presentation; orchestrated national pro-EC campaigns; Euro-wide political parties; Euro-sports teams; and discounted advertising prices for Euro-propaganda campaigns. To get away from the dry, boring text of Maastricht, it proposes the slogan: European Union; Together to promote Progress and Prosperity, Protection and Peace; Together for Europe to the Benefit of Us All. Though the report is interspersed with sensible ideas, like more frequent press and conferences by commissioners and national ministers to explain their actions, or pamphlets and advertising to explain opportunities opened by 'Europe', the judgment in Brussels is uniformly negative. 'They are trying to sell the Community like corn flakes,' said one official. Another, credited with being an effective exponent of EC policy, said 'it makes me want to weep'. A senior official newly appointed to clean up the EC's image said 'they are telling us to do things we will certainly refuse to do. We need to provide information and make sure people can participate and explain their hopes in the debate. That is something we knew already, it's common sense; this is not.' The report is due to be presented today by the chairman of the committee which prepared it, Mr Willy de Clercq, the senior Belgian politician and MEP. However, a spokesman for Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, made clear yesterday that the report 'is not the Commission's view'. At today's meeting, several commissioners, especially those from Denmark and Britain, are expected to demand that this is made abundantly clear. Editorial comment, Page 17</p>

Starikevich: "Belarus: Back Into the USSR"] </F>   [Text] The five-year mandate of republic authorities  is expiring. Everyone in a leadership position wants to catch  the next train, including those who are responsible for the  Belarusian train finding itself on a siding.  <H3>  Maneuvers of the Communist Party of Belarusia after August  1991 </H3>   The political landscape characteristic of 1990 - 1991 has  actually been preserved in Belarusia. Most of the power belongs  to a formation which is frequently called a party of the Council  of Ministers. That is not quite correct inasmuch as it is really  an officially totally unsanctioned association consisting of the  former communist nomenklatura which retained positions in the  republic leadership. The Council of Ministers here appears as  one of the components, nothing more.    The events of August 1991 forced the Communist Party into a  castling move by transferring the main levers of power to the  government. It is important to note that at that time the  parliament and the government were merely appendages of the  Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belarusia. The  Central Committee ceased to exist and was replaced by the  Council of Ministers. Naturally, government leaders immediately  announced their resignation from the party. Thus an impression  was created that the Communist Party has been removed from  power. That allowed some to assume key roles and others to  temporarily move into the shadows, while retaining power en  masse.    At present the Council of Ministers in essence is the sole  active branch of power in the republic. The government lobby in  parliament has a sufficient number of votes in order to control  the situation. Its backbone consists of the "Belarus" group of  deputies which formed in the fall of 1991 on the basis of the  communist faction. Its members prefer not to advertise their  pro-communist views. The faction of the People's Movement of  Belarusia (NDB), which unified the "Soyuz" deputy group, the  factions of veterans and the party of communists of Belarusia,  that was formed in November 1993, is an ally of "Belarus." Most  of its members were elected from public organizations (veteran  and invalid societies). NDB does not conceal its pro-communist  orientation and is distinguished by particular aggressiveness  directed against practically any kind of a democratic  transformation.    Democratic organizations are represented in parliament by  the  Belarusian People's Front faction. Its activities are tinged by  rigid anti-communist and anti-imperialist views. The opposition  is from time to time joined by those with centrist viewpoints  from the Party of National Consent and the Belarusian  Social-Democratic Hromada. But even together at best they are  capable of only blocking the adopted decisions (particularly  those requiring a constitutional majority). In regular elections  those holding centrist positions will more than likely have to  be content with an insignificant number of mandates while the  main harvest will be reaped by communists and the Belarusian  People's Front.    But who knows when the elections will take place meanwhile  it  is necessary to live today. After the resignation of Stanislav  Shushkevich a situation formed where all of the key posts and  structures came under control of the former nomenklatura,  including the powerful ministries, which was so fervently  desired for so long by the government. The piquancy of the  situation is that it is still uncertain whether Shushkevich's  resignation did more good than harm for the government. The  former speaker was so well suited for the role of the main  culprit responsible for all the troubles. It appears that in  getting rid of him the nomenklatura was guided not by logic but  by social instincts. As a result of that the government lost its  screen and became a candidate for the job of the one responsible  for everything.    At the same time benefits derived from the resignation of  the  speaker are very doubtful. Yes, now the Council of Ministers and  Supreme Council are under full control of the former  nomenklatura, and the fist, which consists of the government,  the parliament, and the communists, appears sufficiently  powerful. According to all the signs, however, this wonderful  association can expect a thrashing in the very near future. New  head of the parliament Mechaslav Grib, who formerly did not lay  any claim to independence and certainly not to a position of  leadership, now, it seems, considers himself a figure at the  very least as powerful as Kebich. He is starting to put together  his team. It is true, his first forays among the people (in  drugstores and at kolkhoz meetings) were such tortured affairs,  done very clumsily.    The communists also might feel themselves unsatisfied. All  they have gotten out of this government up to now was several  positions of secondary importance in executive power structures.  At the same time it is not clear with whom the Council of  Ministers officials will be entering the forthcoming elections  since they no longer have their own party and its successor, the  party of communists of Belarusia, has a sufficiently stable  electorate, approximately the same one which is being claimed by  the government. It is not precluded that the communists will not  wish to share votes and on the eve of the elections will attempt  to sink everyone they can, both the parliament and the  government.    Kebich's positions, however, are not as strong as many  believe. If the erected framework for the unification of  monetary systems collapses, it is rather doubtful that the  premier will be able to get out from under its ruins. A lot of  those will immediately be found who are willing to demonstrate  for Kebich the difference between the status of a first  secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of  Belarusia and a head of government. At the same time the  question regarding the premier will sooner or later still appear  on the agenda even in case the unification does take place.  There is no doubt that Kebich will attempt to utilize such a  success in order to conduct presidential elections in its light  and occupy the heights unattainable for his opponents. But would  such a variant suit his present allies? They will have ample  opportunity in order to outmaneuver Kebich. After all a decision  has not even been adopted yet concerning introduction of the  post of president in the republic of Belarus.  <H5>  A Government Without a Program </H5>   The phenomenon of the Belarusian government consists of the  fact that in four years of its existence it is yet to carry out  any transformations particularly since it never had anything  even remotely resembling an economic program. Having received a  relatively prosperous republic, compared to its neighbor, it  systematically brought it to near collapse and is now lamenting  over a broken trough. All attempts by the Council of Ministers  to inject itself into the economic sphere, as a rule, ended in  disgraceful failures. The introduction of single-use coupons may  serve as an example of that. Since then that is how they exist:  the government on its own and the economy on its own as well.  The culprit in all of this, of course, is the former chairman of  the Supreme Council, but a month has already passed since his  departure without any noticeable changes, even microscopic ones.    The reasons for such a state of affairs are seen in the fact  that following the disintegration of the USSR a kind of power  vacuum formed in the republic. Until then members of the local  nomenklatura elite felt quite comfortable in the role of  deputies of Moscow. Their main privilege was the possibility of  not having to think since that was taken care of in the capital  city. In the fall of 1991 the executives faced the need to make  decisions. They had the power, but what to do with it was  incomprehensible.    Perhaps that problem could have been resolved but the  Communist Party had met its demise somewhat earlier. The former  nomenklatura lost a powerful structure which made it possible to  govern the state. At the same time it is genetically incapable  of adapting to the new conditions.    Today Belarusian leadership is not a master of the  situation,  but a hostage of the situation which has formed and which it is  powerless to change. Unfortunately this period of disintegration  could continue for a very long time. In the meanwhile the  communist doctrine, which has failed everywhere in the world,  remains as the guiding star of Belarusian nomenklatura. Many of  its representatives see a return to the past as the solution. It  is not by accident that the "Belarus" group and the communist  organizations favor the denunciation of Belovezh agreements.  Having failed the test in reorganization of the economy, the  government is attempting to rectify the situation once again  shifting its problems to the shoulders of someone else. This  time to the shoulders of Russia. At their noisy meetings the  loyal Leninists repeatedly declared that they regard the  republic as a springboard for revenge on the scale of the Soviet  Union. Therefore if Russia agrees to carry the load of  Belarusian economic problems, it will acquire a rather difficult  ideological burden as well.</p>

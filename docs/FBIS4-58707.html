			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special to the JORDAN TIMES" by Natasha Bukhari] </F>   [Text] Amman--Palestinians are suspicious of agreements on  paper and are anticipating the actual implementation of the  historic accord on self-rule of Gaza and Jericho, according to  Salih Ra'fat, a member of the Palestine Central Council.    "Palestinians are suspicious of the new Cairo agreement,  especially with the Israeli occupation forces' closure of the  city of Jerusalem and the military constraints Israelis are  exercising on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip," Mr.  Ra'fat told the JORDAN TIMES on Wednesday [4 May].    PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq  Rabin Wednesday signed the agreement on self-rule in Gaza and  Jericho in Cairo. The agreement, which was under negotiation  for the last six months, will clear the way for the first  Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian areas it seized in the  1967 war.    Palestinians are divided in the way they look at the peace  talks. There are those who fully support the talks and back the  negotiators. Then there are those who back the principle of  peace but want a tougher stand in negotiations. And last there  are those who oppose the principle of making peace with Israel  altogether.    Ibrahim Qub'ah, also a member of th Palestine Central  Council, told the JORDAN TIMES that he saw the signing of the  Cairo agreement as a coup which is bound to shock and confuse  the Palestinians no matter how prepared they though they wee.  "While Nayif Hawatimah says that Wednesday was a black day in  the history of the Palestinian people, I consider it to be a  milestone that marks the beginning of the ushering in of an  independent Palestinian entity," said Mr. Qub'ah.    Nayif Hawatimah, the leader of the Democratic Front for the  Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), and George Habash, the leader of  the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) lead a  10-faction coalition that includes the Islamic Resistance  Movement, Hamas. The coalition operates from Damascus, and has  followers in the occupied territories.    Mr. Qub'ah urged Mr. Hawatimah to show courage and stop  talkinig about nothing but the "humiliating submission of the  PLO."    Mr. Ra'fat, a member of the DFLP faction that supports the  peace talks accused Palestinian negotiators of submitting to  humiliating conditions in the Cairo agreement which, he said,  contradicts the clauses of the Oslo agreement. He said that  while the Oslo agreement gave Israelis the right to secure order  only within Israeli settlements, the Cairo agreement sitpulates  that Israeli forces will continue to operate in Jericho and the  Gaza Strip.    Ibrahim Abu 'Ayyash, also a member of the Palestine Central  Council, urged all Palestinians to join forces to make  successful the implementation of the Cairo agreement, which, he  said, fell short of addressing major issues. Mr. Abu 'Ayyash  added that one cannot but fear the consequences of the autonomy  accord as it failed to attain major achievements.    "While we are signing peace agreements, Israelis are  establishing more settlements in different areas of the occupied  territories, and that is very worrying," Mr. Abu 'Ayyash said.    Mr. Ra'fat, however, said that he hoped for the  establishment of a "real" Palestinian authority in the West Bank  and Gaza Strip in order to reclaim Jerusalem and end all forms  of Israeli occupation.    Mr. Qub'ah criticized the Palestinian negotiators for what  he called their failure to coordinate with the Jordanian  government where the peace talks are concerned.    "Palestinians and Jordanians are one body, and this lack of  coordination will reflect negatively on the future Palestinian  entity if the situation is not corrected," Mr. Qub'ah said.</p>

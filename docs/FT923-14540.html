			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Consumers slow debt repayments REPAYMENT OF debts is slowing although people remain wary about taking on new credit, according to government figures released yesterday. The Central Statistical Office said that in the three months to May people repaid a seasonally adjusted Pounds 146m on credit agreements with building societies and finance houses and on credit cards that are part of the Mastercard and Visa systems. This was the smallest three-monthly total since the June-August period last year - the last time there was a net injection into the economy of this type of credit. It may provide an early sign that consumers are becoming more willing to spend rather than to save. Consumer spending, which accounts for two thirds of UK output, has been depressed in recent months. This has been a big factor inhibiting a recovery. In May, a net Pounds 19m was repaid on credit agreements covered in the CSO series - which does not include mortgages and bank loans. It was the ninth net monthly repayment for this type of credit in the 10 months to May, confirming individuals' preoccupation with repaying debts that occurred in the 1980s. However, the May repayment was the smallest monthly figure since February, when people took on Pounds 13m of new credit. In March and April, the repayments came to Pounds 71m and Pounds 56m respectively. In the three months to February, the net repayment was Pounds 246m, while in the previous three months consumers repaid a total of Pounds 200m. In May, people borrowed Pounds 94m on Visa cards and Mastercards, up from Pounds 83m in April. The Pounds 94m was the largest amount of extra borrowing recorded on these cards since the Pounds 129m net credit extended in July last year. However, the extra borrowing on cards in May was offset by a Pounds 109m repayment on credit agreements with finance houses. The amount of new credit advanced to consumers in May - an indicator of retail activity in the credit business - was Pounds 3.77bn compared with Pounds 4.11bn in April. The total amount of consumer credit outstanding as categorised in the CSO series was Pounds 30bn at the end of May. At the end of last year the figure was Pounds 30.2bn and at the end of 1990 Pounds 29.8bn. Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at the London office of Salomon Brothers, the US investment house, said that the figures suggested that the level of repayments on credit 'may be stabilising'. However, there was little in the statistics to support theories about anything other than a weak upturn. Separately, the CSO said that businesses took on new credit from finance houses worth a net Pounds 27m in May, little changed from the Pounds 24m in April. Between March and May, this type of credit handed out to businesses increased by Pounds 50m compared with Pounds 31m in the three months previously. The longer leading index of economic indicators compiled by the Central Statistical Office increased from 104.4 in April to 104.8 in May, suggesting an upturn later this year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister-designate Gabriel Lewis </F> Galindo by Luz Maria Noli at the TVN Network studios in Panama  City; date not given; from the "Dialogue" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Lewis] Thank you very much for inviting me. I am  very grateful to be here with you.    [Noli] Sir, what will be the foreign ministry's main goal?    [Lewis] Well, Luz Maria, the main goal is to contribute to  Perez Balladares' number one priority, which is to improve the  living conditions of Panamanians through the creation of  well-paid jobs. To contribute to this, we plan to create a new  Panamanian diplomacy, which besides addressing bilateral issues  with other governments, will also be an instrument to promote  our country. I believe the diplomatic corps has been ill-used.  I believe the diplomatic corps should have important functions  in promoting investments in our country and promoting the sale  of our products. I also believe it is a priority task to secure  scholarships for Panamanians.    Here we are always under the impression that our  geographical  position is our country's greatest asset. I do not share that  opinion. The greatest asset of any country is the education of  its people. We have to radically improve the Panamanian  educational level. I do not foresee shirt-making plants here.  I think we must prepare ourselves for the 21st Century so  Panamanians will have skills, through education, to be able to  have jobs requiring technological knowledge.    [Noli] You are aware that during the seventies, Panama  conducted a diplomatic offensive that put this country's name on  the map. How is your diplomatic offensive going to differ from  that of the seventies based on your projections for the foreign  ministry today?    [Lewis] Dr. Balladares believes as I do, that diplomacy  should be conducted on a one-on-one basis, the same way that  General Omar Torrijos carried it out during the seventies.  Proof of this is that on Friday, President Perez Balladares;  Jose Luis Sossa, Perez Balladares' national security adviser;  and I were in Costa Rica. In Costa Rica, we discussed issues of  great importance to the two nations. We are going to establish  joint policies on how to fight drug-trafficking, on border  disputes, and on a range of issues that cannot be solved through  diplomatic notes. They must be solved, as the late Gen.  Torrijos used to say, between the pitcher and the catcher. That  is what I propose to do in cooperation with Dr. Perez  Balladares. Tomorrow, the three of us leave for Santa Fe de  Bogota to discuss with President Cesar Gaviria and his team  steps for cooperation in many areas. One of them is  drug-trafficking, which is one of Dr. Perez Balladares'  priorities. In this way, we can try to change Panama's bad  image abroad.    [Noli] You have mentioned our two neighboring countries. As  I recall, in the seventies there was a saying that we should  have an extraordinary relationship with those countries next to  which we sleep. And I remember that at that time, Costa Rican  President Daniel Oduber, if I am not mistaken, said that  whatever Panama says, Costa Rica will follow. Do you hope  relations with our neighbors will maintain the same excellent  status of that time?    [Lewis] Well, of course. Without having yet taken possession  of the foreign ministry, I have already spoken a number of times  with Costa Rican President Jose Figueres, with whom I have a  great friendship dating back to his father's time.    [Noli] Also, at that time there was a relationship with  another country -- the United States of America. It was a  relationship of friendship and partnership, and you were a  protagonist of that relationship at a time when you could enter  the White House practically unannounced, something which was  very difficult for other ambassadors to do.    [Lewis] Luz, I am going to tell you something. Being a  nobody, I lunched with President Reagan while he was president,  and recently I was in the White House having lunch with some  very important officials. I did not see President Clinton, who  was at a news conference. But I can tell you that I have  maintained the ties I made with important people in the United  States when I was ambassador in 1977, and that my circle of  friends in Washington has increased. They feel great respect  for me and I for them. Consequently, in this atmosphere of  mutual respect and dignity, I believe I can be of service to my  country.    As a matter of fact, I was already retired because every  cloud has a silver lining. When Noriega exiled me in 1989 --  and I spent three years in exile -- my sons took charge of all  the family businesses. When I returned in 1990 [year as heard],  I found that my children had done a better job than I had. So I  was unemployed and I retired to a life of resting and reading.    Truthfully, when Dr. Perez Balladares invited me to join him  -- he being a president elected by the Panamanian people with a  tried and proven interest in creating a national reconciliation  government -- my conscience would not permit me to reject his  offer. I believe what President Kennedy said on one occasion:  Ask not what your country can do for you, but ask what you can  do for your country. That is why I am here today. And I have  great confidence Dr. Perez Balladares will move forward. He has  the best intentions to make our country morally and economically  sound.    [Noli] Tell me something. Let us talk about a partnership  and  friendship with the United States. How are you going to  accomplish that?    [Lewis] I think the relationship between Panama and the  United States should be conducted very closely between our  foreign ministry and the U.S. Embassy, and our embassy in  Washington has to play a very important role. In the United  States, there are different power centers. The legislative  branch is a great power in the United States. That is a real  democracy. One has to make contact on a personal basis and I am  certain that the person proposed by Dr. Perez Balladares as  ambassador in Washington will be able to fully carry out all  these activities.    I think our relationship with the United States needs  serious  attention. This has to be done with great professionalism, with  much dignity, and with mutual respect. The United States is our  friend, and we should perceive it as our friend. Today, it is  the most powerful nation in the world and we should capitalize  on the very special relationship we have with the nation. I do  not in any way believe that the relationship with the United  States should be conducted through blocs. We must speak with  the United States as equals, with respect, but within a  relationship beneficial to our interests. We cannot view the  United States from a regional point of view.    [Noli] Does that mean that when we talk with the United  States it will not be through the Central American bloc or any  other bloc? Are we are going to talk as partners?    [Lewis] Talking with the United States through a regional  bloc would mean losing our special relationship with the United  States versus the rest of the countries.    [Noli] Tell me something about speaking with partners and  friends. How does that fit in with a certain part of the  population that feels that the U.S. bases should remain here for  economic reasons?    [Lewis] Look we, and when I say we I mean the group that  supported Gen. Torrijos, were determined to let future  generations decide the relationship between the United States  and Panama whichever way they believed was in the best interests  of Panama. I remember that after the signing of the treaties at  the OAS, Gen. Torrijos, who was my guest at the embassy, told me  something that is still very clear in my mind. He said:  Gabriel, we have fulfilled our mission. We have removed the  ill-fated perpetuity clause from the treaties with the United  States, and now a new generation will have to decide if it is in  Panama's best interest to have the U.S. stay in the country  after the year 2000. That is the prerogative of the new  generation.    I never expected, however, to be involved in the decision of  the next generation. That makes me the oldest among the  youngest.    [Noli] Don Gabriel, from 1970 until 1994 -- there are 24  years in there, if my math is correct, right? -- the world has  suffered dramatic changes in this period. For example, the  Soviet Union is no longer the Soviet Union, the Berlin wall does  not exist, and there is a situation in East European countries  that is totally different from the Yugoslavia of Josip Broz  Tito. To try to achieve a diplomatic offensive in this changing  world and occupy the position we once held, will that not leave  us a bit out of sync with the present?    [Lewis] We are pressed for time, but the capacity of the  Panamanian people is great. If we can assemble an adequate team  and do things properly, I think that within six months of  President Perez Balladares' inauguration, we should be able to  change our image.    This will require shock treatment. It cannot be done slowly.  The change has to be dramatic. We have to do heroic things to  gain the confidence of foreign investors and foreign powers. We  have to make sure they are fully aware, first of all, that we  can operate the Panama Canal efficiently. We have to get rid of  Panama's bad name in terms of drugs. We have to do this in  earnest, not just with lip service or by simply saying we want  to change. We have to do it with actions.    Listen, this has been a family slogan since the first Lewis  arrived here at the beginning of the 19th Century: Deeds, not  words. Therefore, I propose to uphold the family motto and to do  precisely this. I firmly believe that Dr. Perez Balladares,  more than anyone else, is interested in getting this done.    We have to do it quickly, through conversations with the  U.S.  Government, the Colombian Government, and the Costa Rican  Government, which are, for obvious reasons, the countries most  involved with us in terms of drug trafficking. As soon as we  begin to take positive steps and have the necessary ties to make  the international media perceive our country differently, things  will change quickly.    Can you imagine, the other day a French banker came to see  me  and said, man, I feel sorry for the Panamanian people. In  Paris, I heard on television that there had been honest  elections in Panama. That is great, but the report added that  Panama is a country whose economy depends, to a large extent, on  drug trafficking.    There is no one to refute this. If we do not assemble a good  team made up of highly professional people, and if we do not do  it quickly -- because, as I say, these things have to be changed  with shock treatment -- we cannot accomplish this on a long-term  basis. I believe that if Dr. Perez Balladares' government does  indeed internalize what I am proposing, I think we will change  our image quickly.    Nevertheless, Luz, I cannot go out and say that this lady is  a virgin, and then have it proven that she lives in a brothel.  The internal and external image have to be one and the same. I  hope we can achieve this, because Dr. Perez Balladares has great  leadership abilities.    He has the support of the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary  Party], the largest political party in the country, which I  think is convinced that structural changes are needed to improve  the condition of all Panamanians. The world is headed toward  the globalization of markets, toward a number of ecological  changes, and toward the improvement of its inhabitants through  education.    Just take the case of Costa Rica. While we are dealing with  all these issues, Costa Rica has been advancing, has been taking  advantage of the situation. Costa Rica has embassies that are  always looking for business prospects. They have attracted an  enormous amount of foreign investments. The last time I was  there, I learned that Costa Ricans estimate they have $100  million in investments for reforestation. The production of  energy has become a problem for the ozone layer. When  electricity is generated, certain gases are released into the  atmosphere and one method of fighting this is to make the world  green again. The investment in reforestation in the United  States is tax deductible, and Costa Rica has skillfully managed  to make investments in reforestation in Costa Rica also tax  deductible. Consequently, many investors from affected  companies have moved to Costa Rica with pleasure because of the  peaceful atmosphere and the democracy that reigns in that  country, a democracy that we have just recently acquired. So we  are on the right path.    [Noli] Mr. Lewis, you are an entrepreneur. You are a  businessman. Now you are going to be the foreign minister. How  are you going to reconcile being a businessman in the private  sector and suddenly being a government official in such a  delicate position as the foreign minister?    [Lewis] Luz, first of all I want to say that I am going to  organize a group of talented people about me. It is the same as  when you are going to establish a new business. A large part of  the success of a new business is the people with whom you  surround yourself. This is one of the reasons I have always  organized businesses by surrounding myself with specialists. I  asked Dr. Omar Jaen to be my deputy minister because he is very  talented, very well educated, and very respected by the  diplomatic corps. He will attend to all those things in which I  am ignorant but in which he has an overabundance of knowledge.  I have also asked Dr. Jaen to begin a specialized study of the  characteristics of each embassy, what is required, an outline of  the type of ambassador that should be assigned there. I do not  want ambassadors assigned because they are so-and-so's uncle,  brother, or son, but people who can represent Panama in the  exterior as it should be represented.    I was very ashamed the other day when a very prestigious  diplomat of a friendly country, who came to observe the  elections, talked at length with me, and told me that his  foreign office was very upset with Panama. I asked him why. He  said because of the quality of ambassadors we send them.    Our ambassadors are very poorly paid. They are people who  wind up in all kinds of activities, all the way from drug  trafficking to the illegal sale of cars. These people ruin our  country's image. I do not agree that our embassies should be  only for people with large resources. Of course, there are some  rich people who are very well qualified, but there are also  people who are not well off but who can represent Panama with  pride. I do not want to reinvent the wheel. Around the world,  there are diplomats from every country and you do not hear a  scandal about them -- that they smuggled cigarettes into the  country, that they were involved in drug trafficking, or that  they falsify and sell passports -- for the simple reason that  those countries pay their foreign representatives salaries in  keeping with the economic situation of each one of them. And  this practice is generalized.    We are one of the few countries in which the ambassador to a  certain country, if he is the president's friend or the foreign  minister's friend, will try to get extra money from another fund  or from an autonomous institution. That has to be stopped. I  was talking with a Panamanian career diplomat who told me that  what is important is to reorganize this ministry so that things  are done as they are done in other countries. There is a report  which the World Bank updates every three months, and another  from the IMF which indicates the cost of living in every  country. Those in charge of forwarding the salaries and  representational expenses to the embassies and diplomats abroad  abide by these reports automatically. If the cost of living goes  up in Buenos Aires or goes down in Tegucigalpa or Tokyo, the  salaries go hand in hand with these changes. You cannot send an  ambassador to a certain country and have his salary be  insufficient to cover his rent.    [Noli] What you are saying is that the people who will  represent the country do not necessarily have to be career  diplomats. You are also talking about a complete reorganization  of the Foreign Ministry and of the salary allotments for each  post. Is that what you are saying?    [Lewis] I believe we need a general reorganization. To  accomplish that I need the president's support, which of course  I already have, and I also need support from the legislative  branch. When it is time to discuss the Foreign Ministry, they  must understand that we need to include the element of floating  costs, which is something we have never seen here. If we do  not, we will continue to have a unrespected diplomatic corps. I  need them out there as vehicles for promotion of our country.  That is why I want to look at the kind of image our ambassadors  will need to project to each country. I do not want to send  someone just because his wife cannot stand him or because he has  no way of paying for his son's university, in which case the  Human Resource Education and Training Institute should offer him  a grant or a scholarship.    We say we are a privileged nation, thanks to our  geographical  position. Our geographical position means nothing if we do not  have the right people. Let us prepare them. That is why I want  to bring scholarships from abroad. Take Singapore, for example.  They have the same population as we do and they are one of the  richest nations in the world today. It has nothing to do with  geographical position, that is absurd. It is because of its  people's capability. This was only possible over time, mind you,  as this could never be achieved overnight. I may not even  witness it here, but you will, because you are quite young.    [Noli] [Laughing] How diplomatic you are!    [Lewis] Just think. The government of Singapore will pay all  the expenses of anyone who is admitted to one of the top ten  U.S. universities; MIT, Harvard, Stanford, or the like. The  person agrees to return to Singapore and work for the government  or private enterprise. The individual becomes a capital  investment for Singapore. Frankly speaking, after a few years  we could go out into the world and sell Pananamian capability,  then all kinds of enterprises will set up shop here.    [Noli] You spoke about the embassies and the kind of  ambassadors we want. Rumor has it that Jorge Illueca will be at  the United Nations; Ricardo Alberto Arias will be in Washington;  Aristides Royo in Paris; Aquilino Boyd in London; and I believe  the last person to be mentioned for the embassy in Spain was a  woman. Is this in accordance with what you are saying now?    [Lewis] Let me be a little indiscrete with Mr. Perez  Balladares. Mr. Perez Balladares and I select all of those  names, except for Spain, but because of diplomatic protocol we  should not make any announcements until we receive the approval  from the host countries. The only one I have officially  announced is Jorge Illueca. Any one of the people you listed  could be confirmed as ambassador. They are all prominent  citizens and we can feel proud about the work they will do. I  am sure all of them clearly understand what Mr. Perez Balladares  wants. We have to improve the quality of life for Panamanians  and to do so we must attract foreign investment. He said so in  Rambala again yesterday.    [Noli] You know something? Panama is known for being a  country of convenience. A short while ago, in the previous  segment of the program, you told me that in six months we could  change this country of convenience image. How will you do this  in so short a time?    [Lewis] I do not think I can do what you mention about  Panama  as a country of convenience. I mean the image of a country  involved in drug trafficking, a country with a corrupt  government. The country of convenience concept originated in  1936, when Dr. Harmodio Arias decreed that ships from other  countries could be registered in Panama to lower their costs.  That is much more complex and I have not even thought about it.  I am not thinking about Paris or Tokyo newscasts doing us harm.  What I want is to portray Panama as a safe country for  investment.    The most important thing is to have a democratically elected  government. This is a priority requirement. If this is  present, I am sure that Perez Balladares' team will quickly  improve the Panamanian people's condition. But we need  everyone's cooperation. One other thing, and this includes  you, too. In a country trying to attract foreign investment,  such as Costa Rica, there are agreements among all political  forces. When it comes to attracting foreign capital, the  government and the opposition will work in harmony. Some things  must be accomplished by the government and the opposition  working together. I think Mrs. Mireya de Gruber will be the  opposition leader here. At some time, President Perez  Balladares will have to sit down with her and say to her: We  need this strategy to improve the Panamanian people's condition,  but we need your cooperation. This is what civilized countries  do. Let us not throw rocks at one another because it will be  the sons and grandchildren of Balladares and Mrs. Mireya who  will be hurt. We must move Panama forward. It is easy,  provided we work together.    [Noli] Tell me something, Mr. Gabriel. How will you  implement this strategy you have outlined, considering that PRD  is the government's political basis and, during the last years  of what Juan Materno Vasquez describes as the ancienne regime,  you were one of the most articulate opponents of the government  led by Noriega?    [Lewis] Very simple, Luz. As in every other party, in the  PRD there are very good people and there are useless people, who  have not distinguished themselves in any of the ways I have  mentioned to you. The majority of the PRD people, nevertheless,  agree with this criterion. I have talked with many of them.  Remember, I worked closely with Gen. Torrijos and I am well  acquainted with the PRD people, some of whom are very good. The  bad thing is that the military had taken over the PRD and had  taken the party prisoner, so to speak. I think those who most  benefited from Noriega's ouster were the PRD members who are now  free to lead a party independently. Previously, however, the PRD  people were under the military's authority. For instance, one  colonel might say: This is the policy. The PRD people are full  of pride and self-esteem. Now they feel free, most of them at  least.    [Noli] Tell me something. Has a true effort been made during  the Endara administration toward Panama's integration with  Central America? To what extent will this new relationship that  you intend to establish affect what has been done so far?    [Lewis] Fortunately, as far as I know, the pledges made by  the Endara government had to do with political and cultural  agreements only. There is no agreement with Central America for  economic integration. I say fortunately because, should we  enter an economic market with Central America, we would be at a  disadvantage. We would have to equate tariffs on all products  with those established by the other Central American countries.  Unlike the other Central American countries, we have a hard  currency, the U.S. dollar. No industry would be established  here. All of them would move to Tegucigalpa or San Salvador,  where labor cost are far lower than in our capital.  Consequently, the social cost of our incorporation into Central  America would be similar to incorporating into NAFTA for the  benefits that would be provided by a truly large market. We  would have to pay a high social price and no additional jobs  would be created in Panama.    [Noli] Pardon me for interrupting, Mr. Gabriel. I am under  the impression that the new approach of industrialized countries  is as a bloc. For instance, NAFTA is made up of the United  States, Mexico, and Canada.    [Lewis] I can tell you a story. Guillermo Chapman, the new  planning minister, has always had a dream. Panama is very  fortunate for his having accepted the appointment because he has  devoted his life to studying everything related to improving the  Panamanian people's standard of living. Dr. Chapman visited me  several times while I was in exile. One of the main topics we  discussed was Panama's incorporation into the U.S. market.  NAFTA had not yet come into being. After the invasion took  place, Dr. Chapman and I discussed in depth the possibility of  proposing to the United States the signing of a free trade  agreement with Panama as part of a compensation. NAFTA had not  been created. Can you imagine what would have happened had we  incorporated ourselves into that market as part of the  compensation? That would have been quite a different story.  Panamanians would enjoy stable jobs and better living  conditions. And there was a good climate for this proposal. We  requested the current government file a request with President  Bush, who would address the Congress to ask for compensation for  Panama. But Congress never responded to our request. This was  very frustrating for Dr. Chapman and I.    I am sure, however, that, if we act with the new diplomacy  that I intend to use.... [pauses] I have come to this ministry,  not to get acquainted with people, but precisely because I know  people. Since I am convinced of the value of interpersonal  relations, I would like Panama to have an opportunity to advance  this idea, but not as part of a bloc because the reasons for  including Panama in it are not valid. On the one hand, we do  not have their type of economy. On the other, we do not have  special relations with one of the partners, the United States.    But I would like Panama to have a rapprochement with  Mexico. Mexico is our big brother. Mexico has implemented  radical economic changes, and it constitutes a good example for  us to follow. I am confident that the Mexicans, with whom we  had very strained relations until recently, will soon become our  big brothers again. Hopefully, Mexico and the United States  will help us make a serious attempt to establish formal  relations with Canada. We have virtually no relations with  Canada since this country has no consulate or embassy in Panama,  and all procedures must be conducted through Costa Rica.  Establishing high-level relations with Canada would be one of  our priorities.    We are outlining the path -- as if we were managing a  business -- we will follow to attain success. Dr. Chapman will  play a leading role regarding the economy. I will be one of his  instruments abroad to ensure the success of this endeavor. You  are going to like the way we are going to work because the media  and public relations element play a significant role in this  entire project. We must have the support of all Panamanians,  including the opposition, the government, the media, the people,  everybody, to get Panama out of this mess.    [Noli] Central American integration will not take place  until  the EEC decides to allocate the funds assigned to specific  geographic areas. The funds have been earmarked for a specific  geographic area called Central America, which implies that we  could be part of that bloc. If we are not in the bloc, how will  relations with the EEC be managed?    [Lewis] The cost of joining that group and receiving those  EEC funds, which are not that substantial either, is high  because it deprives us of our capacity to negotiate directly  with the United States. We must seek to preserve our bilateral  relations with the United States rather than join any bloc. We  should not join a regional bloc only because of the money  Europeans will be giving out. The United States may like Panama  very much, but if they can unload us by our joining a regional  bloc, I believe they would be most happy to do it. I would feel  the same way if I were in charge of U.S. foreign policy. What  we must do is avoid that situation. This does not mean we want  to offend any Central American nation, they understand us  perfectly. I have talked to former Central American presidents  such as Daniel Oduber, who is a dear friend of mine. They are  truly aware that our situation and that our economy is different  from their economies.    [Noli] How will you tackle our relations with the Far East,  namely Japan, especially now that Japan's situation vis-a-vis  the United States has changed to such an extent that President  Clinton is doing everything within his power to make  U.S.-Japanese relations as harmonious and convenient for his  nation as possible?    [Lewis] I repeat, we are very lucky. I have traveled to  Japan on many occasions; I have very good friends in Japan. The  Japanese know that Panama cannot be treated as part of a bloc  because Panama has a canal. Japanese trade depends heavily on  the transit of vessels through the canal. We must capitalize on  this. Japan is a difficult country to deal with, but there are  specialists. We must specialize people. As I said, we must  define the profile of each delegation we send to a particular  country. The ambassador that we will send to Japan cannot have  the same characteristics as the one who has to deal with the  British. We must specialize. We must take into account the  idiosyncrasies of each people.    Moreover, I expect PRC traffic through the canal to increase  in the early 21st century. We must begin to establish the  necessary links with them. The Chinese are building what is  thought will become one of the world's largest merchant marines.  We must update ourselves. We must look ahead, we must plan  what we will be doing in the year 2010, as serious countries  would.    The other day, Luz Maria, I visited a learning center in the  United States that is drafting a plan on how medicines will be  sold in the year 2010 and the pilot for this plan cost $150  million. The world knows that the clock does not stop.  Everything stopped here, absolutely everything. The  self-esteem of Panamanians dropped. I do not like this at all.  We must raise our self-esteem. We must accomplish this by  telling the people that we will overcome our problems if we all  work together.    The first step was taken last week when Mr. (Harold  Bernstein) of Petroterminales visited Panama, and in the company  of Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares, they announced investments of  over $100 million. This is the most important foreign investment  in the past 10 years.    [Noli] But tell me something, to do all those things we need  money. High self-esteem and jobs are obtained with money, but  it seems that there is a connection there. What will you do to  achieve this harmony?    [Lewis] When I started to work, I did not have money for  gasoline for my car. I did not steal one real [five centesimos]  from anyone, but I managed to provide a comfortable life for my  family. Luz Maria, improving Panama's image will help local  commerce because people will not come to Panama if they feel  that their safety is jeopardized. No one wants to come to  Panama or get established in Panama due to the links to drug  trafficking.    Commerce and the Colon Free Zone will benefit if we manage  to  clean the country's image. I mean the honest ones in the Free  Zone because we must get rid of the bad ones. I am sure that if  we appeal to them, we will be able to raise a certain amount of  money, say 1 or 2 million [not further specified] or whatever is  required to move forward and sell [words indistinct]. Our plan  seeks to build a new Panama within five years. We want to  ensure that we will have many things established along our  coastlines come the year 1999, when we will have to takeover the  canal. We need to open up to the world.    President Carter, with whom I have a very great personal  friendship, and who heads the Carter Research Center, told me  the other day: I am quite fascinated by these elections. I have  not seen cleaner elections than Panama's.    I would be willing to establish a team of people to invite  to  a seminar, figures from around the world who have business with  the canal, to let them see the birth of a new Panama, that we  have allies, that there are people who love us.    [Noli] Dear viewers, this was a conversation with the man  who  will lead the foreign policy of the Republic of Panama beginning  on 1 September.</p>

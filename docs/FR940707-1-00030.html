			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule would expound upon the significant facilities and services requirements governing ``55 or over housing'' currently set forth in &sect;100.304(b)(1). A new &sect;100.305 would be added and would address the requirements for ``facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons.'' A new &sect;100.306 would be added and would address the requirement that such facilities and services be ``significant.'' In addition to adding these two new sections, the substance of existing &sect;100.304(b)(2) would be located in the new &sect;100.310. Existing subsections &sect;&sect;100.304(c)(1) and 100.304(d) and 100.304(e) would provide the substance of new &sect;100.315, and existing &sect;100.304(c)(2) would be redesignated as new &sect;100.316.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In developing this proposed regulation, the Department desires to provide as much certainty as possible regarding the determination that housing qualifies as housing for older persons. It has sought to structure the regulation to allow both housing providers and protected classes alike to ascertain with confidence whether a community qualifies under the Fair Housing Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, it is the Department's view that a single, precise, mathematical-like standard that fully implements the Act is not possible, nor may it be equitable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result, the Department has concluded that a flexible standard is necessary in order to reflect regional variations in services and facilities that distinguish housing for older persons from other similar housing, as well variations determined by the geography of the site or by the differences in the nature or cost of the housing in question. To do otherwise could unnecessarily restrict housing opportunities for older persons by holding all housing to a single arbitrary standard that was not intended by the framers of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Services common to older persons in one region of the country are often not commonly provided or expected in another where weather, for example, or terrain make them unnecessary or undesirable. Similarly, facilities expected as the norm at large, single family older community developments may not be expected at small, mobile home parks with limited acreage, or at large, multi-story, multi-family condominium complexes. And services or facilities common or needed in urban communities near transportation may differ substantially from those appropriate to rural locations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Department recognizes that housing for older persons is not limited to the affluent. Therefore, the Department is concerned lest a single standard that offers certainty would not be sufficiently flexible to accommodate housing for low and moderate income older persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In structuring the proposed rule which follows, the Department has sought to identify as many as possible of the factors and considerations which are germane to capture the differences required by housing for older persons, thus making it possible for wide varieties of communities to qualify who meet the statutory requirements of the Act. In addition, through the publication of the appendix and the illustrative examples it contains, the Department has sought to provide further guidance to assist in the application of the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Department specifically requests detailed comment on how the proposed standards can be modified to provide greater certainty and precision while still providing the flexibility necessary to accommodate the other factors essential to carry out the Act. To allow for this, the Department has extended the comment period to 90 days and will provide for a public hearing process, described elsewhere in the preamble, to receive public comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As is the case with other exemptions to civil rights statutes and other exemptions under the Fair Housing Act (the Act), the exemption to the Act's requirements provided by the ``housing for older persons'' exemption will be interpreted narrowly. A narrow construction of this exemption is intended to give full force and effect to the protection against familial status discrimination afforded by the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The burden of demonstrating that the ``older persons'' exemption applies rests on the party asserting the exemption. Part of that party's burden in establishing qualification for the exemption requires affirmatively demonstrating through credible and objective evidence that the requirements for the exemption exist as of the date of an alleged violation of the Act or at any time that the exemption is asserted as a basis for allowing a practice that would otherwise be prohibited as discriminatory on the basis of familial status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes that the Fair Housing Act imposes a strict burden upon a person claiming the exemption to provide credible and objective evidence showing that the facilities and services offered by the housing provider were designed, constructed or adapted to meet the particularized needs of older persons. In order to be considered as sufficient to qualify a housing facility for the exemption, the evidence must show that the housing in question is clearly distinguished from the bulk of other housing (except for other older persons' housing) in a particular area, by the existence of those facilities and services which set the housing facility apart as housing intended for and operated as housing for older persons. Absent such evidence, the familial status prohibitions of the Act will apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is no indication in the Act or in its legislative history that Congress intended that only the most expensive housing with the most expansive and expensive facilities and services, should qualify for the exemption. Housing in all affordable categories may offer the types of facilities and services for older persons which make that housing unique for the class of persons who can afford that housing. This determination is made by contrasting the housing being offered as housing for older persons to comparable housing not claiming the exemption and evaluating the significance of the facilities and services being offered to meet the requirements of the exemption (See &sect;100.306(c)(l); Comparable housing is of similar type, size and cost of lease or purchase.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

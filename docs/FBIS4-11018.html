			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Constitutional Reform is a Sham"] </F>   [Text] What the Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN)  and its allies in the National Assembly are carrying out is not  a partial reform of the Constitution. Spokesmen for the  pro-Sandinist parliamentary alliance have said that the draft of  the constitutional reform consists of approximately 150  articles, and that in fact amounts to a new constitution, even  though they shamelessly call it a partial reform.    The FSLN and its allies do not want the people to exercise  their fundamental right to express their true opinion of the  change in the constitutional order, or to elect delegates to a  constitutional convention to draft the new basic law of the  Republic. What we have here, without a doubt, is a pact between  leaders who pay a lot of lip service to the people and  democracy, but who ostensibly serve only their personal and  group interests.    Moreover, by drafting a new constitution disguised as a  partial reform, carried out without consulting the electorate  and without constituent authority, the FSLN and its associates  will make formal changes to ensure that little or no real change  occurs. In other words, they will take away power from an  executive branch that is subject to influence, and give it to a  legislative branch that is controlled by the Sandinists. And  they will expand the government coalition, now called a  "governability compact," simply putting old wine in new bottles.    It is clear that neither partial constitutional reform nor  the drafting of a new constitution would automatically resolve  the deep, pervasive crisis that has gripped Nicaragua. There is  a profound and substantial difference between the two, however:  Partial reform crafted by a National Assembly controlled by the  FSLN will inevitably be oriented toward protecting the  Sandinists' substantial interests, which means leaving the  principal causes of the crisis untouched.    In contrast, a Constitutional Convention elected by the  people would give us a new constitution that would be the ideal  legal and political instrument to eradicate totalitarianism,  restructure the branches of government, and create a true system  of law, justice, and liberty, which is what the country needs to  rise up from the prostration in which the pro-Sandinists have  placed it and where they intend to keep it with their  constitutional reform.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Owen foresees Moslem state: Mediator warns of new EU sanctions over Bosnia Lord Owen, one of the two international mediators on the former Yugoslavia, forecast yesterday that the creation of a new independent Moslem state in Bosnia was inevitable and that the Serbian and Croat parts of Bosnia would eventually join their respective mother countries. Such a solution, he admitted ruefully in the annual Churchill lecture in London's Guildhall, was certainly one he did not favour originally in the abortive Vance-Owen plan, which called for a unitary Bosnian state divided into largely autonomous provinces. Lord Owen accused the US of having killed off that plan in May this year and thus destroying any hope of keeping Bosnia-Hercegovina together. However, he recognised that history might show that the emergence of an independent Moslem Bosnian republic was 'inherently more stable,' that the demilitarisation of Bosnia proposed in the Vance-Owen plan was unrealistic and that the Moslems' fight for their very survival required to find expression in the creation of their own country. Lord Owen's remarks were a clear indication of his belief that the union of the three republics which he and his fellow mediator Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg had proposed as a replacement for the Vance-Owen plan would be no more than a temporary solution. That plan was rejected by the Bosnian Moslem 'parliament' last September because the Moslems claimed it did not give them enough territory. European Union foreign ministers suggested earlier this week that the international community might be prepared progressively to suspend sanctions against Serbia if a political settlement could be reached giving the Bosnian Moslems an additional 3 to 4 per cent of territory. Such a possible solution will be discussed at a conference in Geneva starting next Monday, grouping EU foreign ministers, the leaders of the three warring parties in Bosnia and senior representatives from the US and Russia. Lord Owen warned the Bosnian Serb and Croat parties that, if they failed to compromise, the European Union would have to strengthen existing sanctions or start advocating new sanctions. At the same time he warned the Bosnian Moslems that, if they were not prepared to accept compromises, outside governments could reconsider their contribution to United Nations peace-keeping forces in Bosnia, which would then have to be withdrawn. 'The parties, tragically, then would be left to fight it out with no holds barred and the misery and mayhem of what was once Yugoslavia would continue.' Whatever political solution was chosen by the warring parties, certain key Bosnian Moslem demands had to be dealt with. A predominantly Moslem Bosnian republic had to have open access to a port on a navigable part of the Sava river in the north and to a sea port of its own on the navigable part of the river Neretva to the south. In addition, the Moslems would have to be given, 'as an important symbol', a tract of land on the Adriatic sea, and, as far as possible, natural and defendable boundaries. Lord Owen strongly supported the trial of Yugoslav war criminals by the international tribunal set up by the UN. 'I believe it is essential for the moral order of the 21st century that we re-emphasise over Yugoslavia the rejection in the Nuremberg trials of the belief that, in war, anything goes.'</p>

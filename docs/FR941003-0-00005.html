			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is also making a related amendment to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations at 7 CFR 273.12(c) for changes in medical expenses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are discovered from a source other than the household.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, those regulations require the State agency to act on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all changes in a household's circumstances, including those it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discovers from a source other than the household. Often times,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, the State agency must contact the household to verify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such unreported changes. Since the intent of section 1717 is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoid recurrent reporting and verification on the part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households receiving the medical expense deduction, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department is amending 7 CFR 273.12(c) to require that the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency act on those changes in medical expenses it learns of from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a source other than the household only if it can act without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contacting the household for further information or verification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The household will be informed about the changes in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the notice requirements at 7 CFR 273.13. Those changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> learned from a source other than the household which are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verified upon receipt and therefore necessitate contact with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household for verification purposes shall not be acted upon until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the household is recertified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule is effective and must be implemented no later than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1, 1994. For quality control purposes, any variances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting from the implementation of the rule shall be excluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from error analysis for 120 days from the required implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date, in accordance with 7 CFR 275.12(d)(2)(vii). The provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be implemented for all households that newly apply for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program benefits on or after the required implementation date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current caseload shall be converted to these provisions at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the household's request, at the time of recertification, or when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the case is next reviewed, whichever occurs first. The State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency must provide restored benefits to such households back to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the required implementation date or the date of application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whichever is later. If for any reason a State agency fails to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement on the required implementation date, restored benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be provided, if appropriate, back to the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation date or the date of application whichever is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> later.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR Part 272  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Alaska, Civil rights, Food stamps, Grant programs_social  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR Part 273  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Claims, Food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stamps, Fraud, Grant programs_social programs, Penalties,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Records, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Social  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Security.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

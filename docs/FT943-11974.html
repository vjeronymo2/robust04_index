			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of Tunisia (1): First steps taken to a place in the developed world - Tunisia, an oasis of calm and economic growth in spite of the political troubles that have affected neighbouring Algeria, hopes to retain its political stability under President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's leadership The Tunisian government appears confident that it is getting many things right, not least its vocabulary. To western ears, the language sounds reassuringly familiar. Words such as democracy, pluralism, privatisation, deregulation, modernisation and structural adjustment trip off the official tongue with a persistence which highlights the European-oriented ambitions of a nation increasingly less enthusiastic about being identified primarily as Arab and north African. But family and neighbours are hard to ignore, and Tunisia can do little about either. On one border looms the large, unstable bulk of Algeria; on the other the perverse, mercurial Libya of Col Muammar Gaddafi. Few of the words which Tunisia employs to identify itself can fairly be used with reference to either of its neighbours. As a result, and much to its irritation, Tunisia finds its external image blighted by geographical association. Domino theorists, fashionable in south-east Asia before the collapse of communism, are seeking to stoke similar fears about the surge of Islamic fundamentalism in the Middle East. The strong electoral showing of the fundamentalist parties in Algeria, and the country's subsequent descent into political anarchy after the government refused to accept the verdict of the electorate, must inevitably have implications for its neighbours. But, 15 years after the revolution in Iran, there is little evidence to support the view that Islamic fundamentalism is an exportable commodity, despite the best efforts of the government in Tehran. Rather, the phenomenon is being increasingly recognised as a response to the failure of individual governments to alleviate poverty and diminish huge disparities in the distribution of wealth. The lesson appears to have been well understood in Tunisia. President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, nearing seven years at the head of the Tunisian government, likes to describe his approach to ensuring continued political stability as 'multi-dimensional'. On the one hand, he is adamant that no political party based on religion will be permitted. Reports by international human rights organisations indicate that activists pursuing such aims are sometimes dealt with in ways that are scarcely compatible with the liberal image that Tunisia is seeking to foster. Police checkpoints on major roads at night underline the message that the government will not compromise on security. On the other hand, there is now a very modest representation of non-government parties in the national assembly following the March elections, and an apparent acceptance at the most senior level that this process will be extended as standards of education and economic development improve. However, the pace of democratic change will, at best, be exceedingly slow. President Ben Ali was himself re-elected with an improbable 99.9 per cent of the vote, and one of the two candidates who failed to secure sufficient nominations to run against him was later imprisoned for three months following an interview he gave to a Spanish newspaper. The Tunisian government's sensitivity to opposition and criticism may be understandable in the regional political context, but it sits less comfortably alongside the ambitions of a country which over the past decade has taken considerable strides in stabilising, restructuring and liberalising its economy. Tunisia now bears favourable comparison with much of Africa and the Middle East over the way it has managed the transition from a rigid state-controlled economy to one that is more and more export-oriented and in which the private sector plays a steadily increasing role. Ministers are concerned that Tunisia's achievements have been too little appreciated internationally and that too few countries, especially in western Europe, have yet identified it as a focus for investment and as a regional service centre. Their sales pitch can be persuasive. Tunisia is close to Europe, with some 75 per cent of its trade carried out with EU members. Barriers to trade have been progressively lowered and current EU negotiations have as their eventual target the conclusion of a free trade agreement. The population of 8.74m provides a modest domestic market, but Tunisia is also well placed to supply the larger African and eastern Mediterranean region. The implementation of the structural adjustment programme has since 1987 won plaudits from both the IMF and the World Bank, and contributed significantly to the resilience of the economy in overcoming the impact of drought and the Gulf war. Despite those negative factors, real growth has averaged 5 per cent a year since 1989, while the current account and budget deficits have been reduced last year to 4 per cent and 2.4 per cent of GDP respectively. Inflation is estimated to be running at a little over 3 per cent, and there has been continued success in reducing the percentage of export earnings needed to finance external debt. Meanwhile, reforms to the financial sector have produced greater banking flexibility, a simplified system for both direct and indirect taxation, a more coherent investment code, and the first steps towards the creation of diversified capital market. The challenge now for both the government and Tunisia's entrepreneurs is how best to exploit the improved institutional framework in order to give the country the export-led growth it needs to reduce an unemployment level of at least 15 per cent of the workforce, and satisfy new entrants to the labour market. The regional political environment urges caution, but the intensity of international competition for investment funds demands speed. Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the debate over privatisation. Given Tunisia's experience since independence, it is not surprising that there is no ready-made majority in favour of divestment. In some quarters free enterprise and capitalism are still too readily associated with colonialism. Additionally, the trade unions, which enjoy a political legitimacy unparalleled elsewhere in the Arab world, are wary of possible job losses, as indeed is the government. But without an official lead, the nation's biggest companies seem unlikely to accept the degree of transparency and dilution of ownership inherent in a stock exchange flotation. If the government is truly committed to creating a dynamic equities market that will serve to channel capital resources into more productive investment, it will sooner or later have to set a more emphatic example and bite the political bullet. However this, as with so many other issues, may be delayed until the government is convinced that the risk element has been reduced to a minimum and no threat is posed to what is broadly defined as 'national consensus'. Part of that process also involves wider social aims such as better health care and education, regional aid and the provision of a strengthened safety net to catch the most deprived members of society, including the 500,000 who have been identified as requiring official help. Labour laws are also in the process of being reformed, so as to provide for clearer definitions on terms of employment, dismissal and wage bargaining, in which the government will continue to play a key arbitration role. President Ben Ali, looking out from his office in Carthage over the magnificent sweep of the Mediterranean below, gives every impression of being satisfied with more than his immediate environment. He and his ministers believe they are well on the way to putting into place the structures which will enable Tunisia to claim, eventually, a place among developed nations. Their confidence will be more reassuring should Tunisia's neighbours ever come to think along similar lines.</p>

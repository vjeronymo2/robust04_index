			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special Report" for the JORDAN TIMES by Natasha Bukhari] </F>   [Text] Amman--Heads of the delegations of member states to  the 17th ministerial session of the U.N. Economic and Social  Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) Monday voted to relocate the  commission's headquarters from Amman to Beirut.    Informed sources told the JORDAN TIMES that the votes in  favour of the move to Lebanon were made by Saudi Arabia, the  United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Syria, Kuwait, Egypt and  Lebanon.    ESCWA headquarters was initially situated in Beirut, but was  moved to Baghdad after the outbreak of the Lebanese civil war.  It was then moved to Amman in the aftermath of the Iraqi  invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.    Iraq, voted alone to return the headquarters to Baghdad,  said  the sources.    Qatar voted to have the headquarters located in Doha, and  Oman abstained from the voting.    Votes in favour of maintaining the commission's headquarters  in Amman, according to sources, were cast by Yemen, Palestine  and Jordan.    Jordan sought to call for a postponement of the vote, but of  the seven votes needed to move to postponement, explained the  sources, only six were cast in favour. A yes vote for  postponement by Egypt would have tipped the balance for Jordan,  added the sources.    According to the sources, the committee which reported to  the  closed meeting expressed apprehensions and reservations about  moving the headquarters out of Jordan.    The move, sources said, is expected to take place in two  years.    Earlier, participants to the ESCWA ministerial session  discussed the restructuring and revitalisation of the United  Nations in the economic and social fields, revision of the  medium term plan for the period 1992-1997 and revision of the  programme of work and priorities for the biennium 1996-1997.    During discussions on the designation of sectoral focal  points of the commission's economic and social development  programme, participants agreed that a general coordination plan  between member states and their governments has to be structured.    "It is agreed that we need to establish bridges of  communications between the concerned parties" to make possible  the application of ESCWA programmes, said Minister of Planning  Ziyad Fariz who is heading the session.    Iraqi, Syrian, Egyptian and Qatari representatives stressed  the importance of making comprehensive research studies on the  exploitation of water in the region, saying that the issue of  water management is one of the most vital points in the regions'  economic relations.    Also on Monday's agenda was the financial status of the  commission's programmes.    ESCWA Chief Administration John Truman said the initial  appropriations for ESCWA's regular budget for the biennium  1992-1993 approved by the General Assebly amounted to $US  50,660,600. In 1993, he added, the commission estimated a  saving of $US 12,432,700 from this initial appropriation.    They include "a freeze on recruitment, restrictions on  travel  of staff on official business, restrictions on the hiring of  consultants, differences in post-adjustment for the professional  staff between Iraq and Jordan, and differences in General  Service salary scale between Iraq and Jordan."    The increasingly serious financial crisis faced by the  United  Nations in recent years is clearly reflected in the decreasing  amounts allocated to ESCWA by the major sources of  extrabudgetary funds, Mr. Truman said. The major sources of  extrabudgetary funds for the past four bienniums have been the  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations  Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Development Fund for  Women (UNIFEM), the government of the Netherlands and the  government of France.    Yet, contributions from these sources have steadily  declined.  In the biennium 1992-1993, these resources amount to $US  1,218,350.    The financial situation of the regular budget was also  addressed. Mr. Truman stressed the need for member states to  "pay their contributions as soon as possible," as the financial  situation is only manageable until August 1994.    The work of the 17th sesion, which addresses economic and  social development programmes for its 13 member states, will be  concluded today after delegations from the representative  countries adopt the report of the commission on the session.</p>

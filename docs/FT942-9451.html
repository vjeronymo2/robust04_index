			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Arts: Kunsten Festival des Arts - Alastair Macaulay welcomes an important new theatrical event Brussels, centre of the European Union, has a new international arts festival - the Belgian Kunsten Festival des Arts. Britain, the most notoriously Eurosceptical of EU nations, is not represented. The festival, which runs throughout May, has offerings from France, Germany, Italy, Holland, and Belgium; from China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Africa, and from the US, but nothing from Britain - which places it in the company of Luxembourg, Denmark, Austria, Spain, and Greece. What does this say about Britain's artistic standing in Europe? The emphasis of this first Belgian festival (others are likely to follow in later years) is on progressive theatre. The few dance offerings consist of modern dance (including a world premiere from Merce Cunningham, on May 18). No ballet, no opera, no Shakespeare. Is it not odd that Brussels, possibly the world's most bourgeois city, should house so new-wave a festival in no less than 17 auditoria? Odd to a Brit, maybe. But 'epater les bourgeois' has so long been a motto of much continental European art that one should hardly be surprised. Particularly in European theatre, tradition is seldom considered a virtue. Stanislas Nordey, the 28-year-old director of the Compagnie Nordey, has not only staged Pasolini's long play Pylade, he also prefaces it with Iannis Rissos's short soliloquy Chrysothemis. And he begins his show with the actors sitting at a table in front of the raised stage, facing us, like speakers on a panel. Both Pylade and Chrysothemis are rampantly revisionist. They focus on characters who in Greek literature were never more than also-rans: Pylades, the loyal friend of Orestes, and Chrysothemis, the timid sister of Orestes and Electra. Nordey has the soliloquy Chrysothemis spoken by another of the panel-speakers, but, as she develops her monologue, she rises through a series of statuesque positions, until her feet are planted on the table. Pylade, which follows, gradually opens up the whole stage area. This, an altogether more serious and political re-telling of legend, begins just where Aeschylus's Oresteia end. The court in which Athena has freed Orestes from the charges of the Furies was the beginning of rule by law rather than religion; and Orestes replaced tyranny with the first democracy. Here - echoing or pre-echoing post-revolutionary France and Russia - there is intense debate about the role of religion and the nature of government. Electra proves to be a nostalgic reactionary; Pylades is conservative enough to call for religion and a return to pre-civilised values. So far Pylade has been interesting but laboured. When Pylade takes his ideals into exile, the play remains highly symbolic, but becomes more fully a play; his journey reminds one at times of Shakespearian heroes - Henry VI, Hamlet, even Lear. And it is now that Nordey's direction starts to flower, and to reveal the physicality for which the advance blurb celebrates him. The actress playing the Furies has a marvellously incessant, restless, tread on the spot, while - caught in a blaze of side-lighting - she holds her arms in a single huge martial gesture and inflames Pylade with her rhetoric about removing the barriers between high and low. Just as memorable is the tall male Athena, a figure of justice who becomes more bizarre, indeed camp, with each appearance, until he/she is virtually unrecognisable. Nordey's production is a long epic - four and a half hours - but despite its frequent post-modern self-awareness it has a cumulative power, and becomes a serious exemplum of the Theatre de Parole championed by Pasolini ('Theatre of Dialectic'). The title role and most other parts are played with great dignity and humanity. In utter contrast, but also commenting ironically on the legacy of the past, is Murx .., from the Volksbuhne in Berlin, directed by the Swiss Christoph Marthaler. Eleven people sit in a huge dilapidated hall without communicating, like inmates in an institution. They have their fatuous routines - tea, cake, washing - and each person, though stunted in some way, is a highly individual character, pathetic and funny. The one routine that transforms them is singing; and their songs  - whether folk, popular, or national anthems - are all highly German. Singing, these disparate Germans suddenly co-operate, sometimes in elaborate harmony. They are so foolish as individuals that it seems to be sheer accident that, the more nationalist their music, the more harmonious they become. Marthaler paces all this so well that the central meaning of the piece - the disturbing power of nationalism and anthems to galvanise people who usually are silly incompetents - never clobbers you. Superb performances by all. These two are large productions, and have launched the festival impressively. There are other, much more intimate stagings. I will report later in May on further offerings of this festival. It is not only patriotism that makes me wish some British theatre was included. Yet, since three of the four events I watched in May 1-2 were so interesting, this Brit can only commend the festival's start and look forward to more. The Kunsten Festival des Arts, Brussels, continues until June 5</p>

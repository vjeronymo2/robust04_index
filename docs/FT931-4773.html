			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Blockbuster to take 8% holding in Spelling BLOCKBUSTER, the Florida-based video rental company which owns the Cityvision chain in the UK and has been expanding into music retailing, announced yesterday it was acquiring an 8.2 per cent stake in Spelling Entertainment Group. Spelling is an entertainment conglomerate built up by Mr Aaron Spelling, and includes a library of television series, feature films, TV movies, and mini-series. The stake that Blockbuster is buying was previously owned by Cincinnati financier Mr Carl Lindner's American Financial Corporation. In exchange for the 24.5m ordinary shares of Spelling that Blockbuster is acquiring, the Florida-based company will issue 7.6m shares of its own stock to American Financial, together with warrants to acquire a total of 2m Blockbuster shares at an exercise price of Dollars 25 a share. Mr Wayne Huizenga, chairman of Blockbuster, said the deal should help the company to become 'a major force in the distribution and production of filmed entertainment'. There has been much debate about the long-term prospects for Blockbuster's video rental business if new technologies allowed households to have multiple movie channels on demand via a TV set. Yesterday, Blockbuster shares gained Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 8 3/4 on the news, while Spelling, which is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, was unchanged at Dollars 6 7/8 .</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sinikka Siekkinen from Tallinn] </F>   [Text] As expected, the relations between Estonia and  Russia were a central topic in the talks during the first day of  President Martti Ahtisaari's visit. Ahtisaari spent most of his  time today in talks with Lennart Meri, his Estonian colleague.  According to the Estonian political leadership, some light can  be discerned in the talks with the Russians, to the extent that  Estonia believes it will be able to solve the problem of the  Russian soldiers with Russia bilaterally.    This optimism is a consequence of talks with Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev a few days ago and of the fact that  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin is due in  Estonia next week. According to Lennart Meri, it would now seem  that a mediator is not needed. Meri has also told this to  President Ahtisaari. Meri said that Ahtisaari had, however,  made a beautiful symbolic gesture by telling the Estonians that  he can always offer the negotiators premises, light, and food,  if they so wish. But according to Meri, Estonia will return to  the mediation task after the last day of August at the earliest,  if the troops of the former Soviet Army have not left Estonia by  then.    Ahtisaari's visit has taken place so far in a warm  atmosphere. An Estonian daily even wrote that a new Ahtisaari  era is beginning in Finnish-Estonian relations.</p>

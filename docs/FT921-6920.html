			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Futures lead new advance by shares A STOCK market now virt-ually becalmed ahead of the UK Budget on March 10, and the general election widely expected to follow within a month, was led higher by the futures market yesterday. Trading volume in shares was modest and the gain of 17.4 in the FT-SE Index was largely achieved in early deals when the March contract on the Footsie opened very strongly. Underlying optimism was sustained by expectations that a further  1/2 point cut in UK base rates will either precede or swiftly follow Budget day. The latest UK opinion polls favoured Mr Major's Conservative government, and there were new hints from political sources that April 9 has been chosen as election day. However, the first day of the new equity trading account made an unexciting start, with traders disinclined to adopt new strategies in a market which this week faces a heavy list of corporate trading statements, notably from the banking sector. Share prices opened lower behind unimpressive performances from equities in New York and Tokyo, and were also restrained by downward adjustments in a number of leading stocks to take account of dividend payments. The trend in equities was abruptly reversed when the stock index futures opened and the March contract on the Footsie showed a premium of around 38 points over the underlying cash market. The stock market moved ahead and, although there was little genuine investment activity, the Footsie broke through the 2,550 mark to gain 20.7 at 2,563.0. This level proved to be the best of the day, and the stock market merely trod water for the rest of the trading session. A somewhat uneven opening to the new session on Wall Street, which was 7.8 up on the Dow Industrial Average when London closed, gave little incentive to traders in the UK. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,559.7 for an advance on the day of 17.4 points. Seaq volume slipped lower, recording 440.5m shares traded compared with 569.5m on Friday. Traders, however, pointed out that the daily Seaq figures have proved a poor guide recently to underlying retail, or customer, business in equities. Friday's retail business was worth Pounds 1.3bn, the highest total for the month and comfortably inside the margin of profitability for the London-based securities firms. The banking and financial stocks, which are prominent in this week's list of corporate news, closed firmly. Sterling's continued improvement against the D-Mark buttressed confidence in prospects for reductions in UK base rates. Retail and consumer stocks, the immediate beneficiaries from lower interest rates, found buyers. There was some nervousness, however, ahead of the UK trade figures for January, which are due on Thursday. Analysts fear that the trade figures will be disappointing, Kleinwort Benson Securities suggesting an increase in the monthly current account deficit to around Pounds 450m. Nomura Research Institute warned that the trade figures, together with the unemployment data for last month, will draw attention to long term trends which may eventually undermine the sustainability of sterling's current rate within the European exchange rate mechanism.</p>

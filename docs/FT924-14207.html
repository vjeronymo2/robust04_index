			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Savimbi may drop threats of war HOPES were rising last night that Angola's mercurial rebel leader, Mr Jonas Savimbi, would back away from threats of resuming guerrilla war and agree to take part in a government of national unity following the country's first free elections. US assistant secretary of state Herman Cohen said Mr Savimbi was likely to emerge from isolation in his southern stronghold of Huambo to come to Luanda to accept President Jose Eduardo dos Santos' invitation of talks on a government of reconciliation. 'We feel that there is still time and still grounds for optimism,' said Mr Cohen. Earlier, Miss Margaret Anstee, the United Nations special envoy, visited Mr Savimbi, in the first meeting he has had with an international observer since last week's elections put President Dos Santos and his MPLA government well in the lead. Unita has alleged electoral fraud and threatened to return to guerrilla war. Miss Anstee said last night Mr Savimbi had said he would accept the poll result if an investigation demanded by Unita proved there had been no fraud. The critical question is whether Mr Savimbi is trying to exploit the fears of a return to civil war to force concessions from the government on a post-electoral set-up or whether he is unable to compromise and determined to go back to war. 'The problem is that none of us knows what Savimbi's bottom line is,' said a western diplomat. 'After all these years of external support he remains an enigma and nobody, not even Washington and Pretoria, has any leverage on him.' In the past week, Mr Savimbi has challenged the election results, withdrawn his generals from the newly unified army and retreated from Luanda to Huambo  -the politically symbolic southern city from which he launched his guerrilla struggle in 1975. If Mr Savimbi is merely playing a dangerous game of high-stakes brinkmanship, as seems more likely, it remains unclear what concessions he will accept. Given that he won 40 per cent of the national vote, observers say neither party can rule alone. Possible compromises, dubbed by a Portuguese minister as 'disappointment management', are being considered in Luanda, including a second round of presidential elections, a genuine power-sharing arrangement at national and provincial levels and the idea of a joint administration. A second round looks most likely to keep Mr Savimbi in the peace process but it is doubtful if he would win. However, nobody knows whether Mr Savimbi, after 30 years of bush warfare and internal propaganda, is psychologically able to accept anything less than the presidency. The second problem is convincing the government, and particularly the MPLA hardliners, to bend over backwards to make concessions after a democratic victory. Western observers say hopes for preventing a return to civil war rest on the fact that in the post-cold war era and after free elections Mr Savimbi can no longer expect the military and diplomatic support he received from Washington and Pretoria between 1975 and 1991. Referring to the possibility of renewed warfare, Mr Cohen said Unita knew 'this is an impossible procedure. There will be absolutely no support in the international community or internally for such an operation.'</p>

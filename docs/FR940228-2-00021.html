			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Physical Characteristics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Timken points out that forgings are similar in size and shape to finished cups and cones. However, Koyo argues that there are dramatic differences between forgings and finished cups and cones. Some forgings are split in two to form both the cup and the cone. In the manufacturing steps that take place during the turning process, between 24% and 30% of the steel is removed from a forging, resulting in a green machined ring with the specific dimensions and tolerance of the finished cup or cone, or inner and outer raceways.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Koyo argues further that the forged rings are most similar to steel tube rings, which undergo the same processes (green machining, heat treatment, polishing, and grinding) before becoming a finished TRB part. Koyo states that ``both rings cut from tube and forged rings are intermediate donut-shaped pieces of steel that are first produced from steel bar and later further processed into parts for bearings'' (Koyo's letter to the Department, November 22, 1993, p.4). Both parties agree that rings cut from tube are outside the scope of the order, as indicated by Koyo's statement to that effect on page 24 of its letter and Timken's reference to rings cut from tube as raw material (p.23).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, Timken points out that the forgings in question are a much more processed product than rings cut from tube steel. Forged rings have the approximate shapes of the cups and cones that they will be turned into. Indeed, forging gives them much of the definition that green machining would otherwise give. As a result, the forgings are effectively dedicated to use as TRB parts. Conversely, rings cut from tube steel bear little resemblance to cups or cones. Tube rings lose 50% to 75% of the weight of the ring during green machining, and can only be considered TRB parts after this process takes place. Given the advanced shape that forging gives the components, and the consequent reduction in green machining, the green machining process does not appear determinative in this case. Rather, it is the advanced physical characteristics of the component forgings that are definitive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department preliminarily determines that forged rings are more processed than rings from tube stock, and, as such, are physically distinct from rings cut from tube steel. While some final machining is necessary, the forging process used in this case effectively transforms the metal input into a product sufficiently advanced in state that it is essentially a TRB component. Consequently, an examination of physical characteristics indicates that forgings are included in the scope of the order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Channels of Trade  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The forgings at issue are either produced by Koyo or purchased from steel forgers and sold by Koyo to AKBMC, its related subsidiary. Forgings move through the same channel of trade as unfinished parts, namely, to bearings producers for incorporation into tapered roller or antifriction bearings. Therefore, the Department preliminarily determines that the channels of trade criterion indicates that forgings are within the scope of the order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Expectations of the Ultimate Purchaser  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The forgings in question are imported into the United States for use in the production of TRBs. Timken points out that these forgings have undergone initial processing which renders them dedicated to use in a limited range of part numbers. Timken notes that the bearings producers who purchase these forgings have no expected use other than the production of finished bearings. Koyo submits, however, that finding forgings to be within the scope of the order based on the expectation criterion is comparable to concluding that bearing grade steel is also within the scope, since it too is imported for use in production of TRBs and has almost no alternative uses. Koyo argues further that rings cut from tube steel, which are outside the scope, are also limited to use in a specific range of models.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

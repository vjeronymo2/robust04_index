			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Jia Zhaoquan (6328 2507 0356) and </F> XINHUA reporter Zhang Dongbo (1728 2639 3134)]    [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- At the All-Army  Telephone Conference on Agricultural and Sideline Production,  which opened today, Fu Quanyou, member of the Central Military  Commission [CMC] and director of the General Logistics  Department, demanded that all troops in the entire Army make  great efforts to develop agricultural and sideline production to  ensure the living standards of officers and men, enhance  cohesiveness among troops, and increase fighting capacity.    Fu Quanyou noted: Agricultural and sideline production of  the Army is a component part of the country's agriculture. The  Army's engaging in agricultural and sideline production plays an  important role in relieving the state's burden, supplementing  supplies to troops, improving officers' and men's lives, and  promoting military reform and building -- this is an important  matter benefiting the state, the Army, and the people. Over the  past years, all troops in the Army have conscientiously carried  out the directives of the CMC and the General Logistics  Department in increasing agricultural and sideline production  through hard work and have basically established a production  structure with military farms as the mainstay, brigade- and  regiment-run nonstaple food production bases and life service  centers as the central links, and part-time production of  companies as the foundation. The infrastructure has been  gradually improved and the application of science in farming and  livestock raising has been upgraded constantly; as a result, the  overall production capacity has remarkably increased and a good  trend for sustained and stable development has emerged. Last  year, the entire Army reaped a good harvest in agricultural and  sideline production, producing 650 million kg of grain; 225  million kg of meat, fish, poultry, and eggs; 600 million kg of  vegetables; and 700 million yuan in total profits. This has  effectively subsidized the lives of troops. Currently, commodity  prices on the market are rising rapidly; this has greatly  influenced the military life. Despite the fact that the CMC has  decided to readjust the standard of military food expenses under  the condition of a tight budget for military expenditure, there  is still a large gap between the food expenses and the actual  prices demanded by the market. To narrow this gap, it is  necessary to vigorously increase agricultural and sideline  production and increase the Army's self-supply capacity.    Fu Quanyou said: Vigorously increasing agricultural and  sideline production is the CMC's constant guiding ideology in  strengthening Army building, the basic demand for  comprehensively implementing the "Outline for Grass-Roots  Military Building," and an important measure for maintaining  military stability. As early as 1978, Comrade Deng Xiaoping  noted: "It is necessary to run Army's agricultural and sideline  production properly." Comrade Jiang Zemin also stressed: "The  Army's engaging in agricultural and sideline production is the  display of the Nanniwan spirit, which should be continued  persistently." All troops in the Army, particularly leading  cadres at all levels, must unify their thinking with the CMC's  decisions, adhere to the orientation of serving life with  production, and make subsidizing the lives of troops the  starting point and goal of expanding agricultural and sideline  production.    Fu Quanyou stressed: Party committees and leaders at all  levels must strengthen organization and leadership, place  agricultural and sideline production on an important position,  divide the work and assign special persons to take charge of the  work, and study and settle problems on a regular basis. Leaders  at all levels should use reform as the driving force, be  oriented by the troops' demand and the development in the  market, deepen reform, and intensify management to promote the  all-Army agricultural and sideline production to a new level.</p>

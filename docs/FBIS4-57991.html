			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Morning Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] Today the daily GRANMA, organ of the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, describes the message  delivered by U.S. President William Clinton on 20 May as  insulting.    Under the title of "Pharisaism," journalist Felix Pita  Astudillo recalls that today, 92 years after the United States  installed a government in Cuba, it still wants to maintain  annexationist ideas with the intention of annexing us, at any  cost, into its new world order.    After pointing out the crudeness of the message's content,  which seems more like an electoral diatribe directed at Miami  rather than at Cuba, Pita Astudillo notes that the Cuban people  are not interested in the freedom advocated by the United States  because it is inhuman and falls under the every-man-for-himself  philosophy.    The journalist notes that the wishes expressed by Clinton do  not take into account the right to life, work, education, food,  health, or housing in either Cuba or its neighboring Latin  American countries. There is no reference whatsoever to the  eradication of poverty, which requires well-balanced economic  development and a better distribution of wealth, and it simply  deals with age-old and worn-out references to individual civil  liberties with a vague mention of the state of law.    Pita Astudillo describes as cynical the argument in defense  of the blockade, which is aimed at making it impossible for the  Cuban people to attain prosperity and satisfy their basic needs  as well as making us surrender through hunger.    The GRANMA article notes that, in his message, President  Clinton claims Cuba and the United States have a long history of  cooperation and admiration. Pita Astudillo concedes that  although this history is indeed long, it is filled with  voraciousness and disdain toward the immoral dwarfs -- the term  the North Americans used to describe Cubans in the last century.    Finally, the journalist refers to the nerve it took to refer  to Jose Marti as someone whose ideas are consistent with  Clinton's policy, when it was precisely Marti who 105 years ago  wrote: Cuba has never been seen by the United States as anything  other than an savory possession whose only nuisance is its  people, whom they view as impetuous, lazy, and loathsome.</p>

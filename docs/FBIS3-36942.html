			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by analyst Eduard Sorokin; from the "News &amp; </F> Views" program]    [Text] The NATO countries have warned that unless Bosnian  Serbs move their hardware and tanks to at least 20 kms from  Sarajevo, the allied aircraft will have to resort to air strikes  on their positions. Our analyst Sorokin comments:    As for the world's reaction to the decision taken by the  North Atlantic Alliance, some countries support it to a certain  extent while others are against, for one Russia. Reports say  that President Yeltsin has spoken on the phone with a number of  Western politicians and told them that the planned measure was  pointless. Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has sent a letter to  the United Nations warning against serious consequences for  NATO's direct meddling into Bosnia's conflict. There are several  reasons for Russia's position, which may be grouped in a certain  way.    The first range of issues refers to the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. There is no evidence so far that it is the  Serbs who are responsible for the tragedy that took place in  Sarajevo last Saturday. Military experts find it difficult to  locate the place from which the fatal mortar blow was made  killing 68 people. As for the Serbs, they deny their  involvement in the crime and argue that the tragic outcome runs  counter to their interests. Such events could only play into  the hands of their rivals, the Bosnian Muslims. Therefore,  Moscow believes it is necessary to look into what happened  first. And the Russian leadership also believes the military  operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot be stopped by their  escalation, that is by resorting to NATO's air strikes.  Moreover, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has warned any  assault plane will be shot down and UN peacekeepers in former  Yugoslavia are jeopardized, though NATO has said that in case  they are attacked retaliatory strikes will follow immediately.  But in this case Serbia may interfere and the scope of military  operations will considerably expand.    On 28 June 1914, the heir to the Austrian throne Archduke  Franz Ferdinand was killed in Sarajevo and that sparked off  World War I. The tragedy in Sarajevo on 5 February 1994 could  prompt a chain reaction, the tragic outcome of which is  difficult to foresee.    Russia's negative attitude to the NATO ultimatum determines  another set of questions which have a direct bearing on the  internal situation in the country. One has to view the historic  past in this particular case; as a rule it is closely linked  with the present. With Russia it was a tradition to support the  Serbs, the ethnic Slav people who are Orthodox Christians.    After they suffered a defeat at the battle of Kosovo in  1389,  the Serbs came under the rule of the Ottoman empire but they  would not accept such a destiny. The Serb uprisings at the  beginning of the past century caused wide sympathy among the  Russians toward their Slav brothers. There were Russian  volunteers among these Serbian rebels. With Russia's active  support, Serbia became an autonomous principality in the year  1833, attaining its full independence at the 1878 Berlin  Congress. During the Balkan wars earlier this century, Russia  took the Serbian side once again, and in World War II the Soviet  Army liberated the Serbian territory from the German Fascists  together with the Yugoslav People's Army.    It goes without saying that the Russian leadership takes  into  account all these historic facts and circumstances. It is also  forced to account for the opinions of members of the State Duma,  the lower house of the Russian Parliament, which is clearly  dominated by the pro-Serbian majority. It is not Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy alone who counts in this case. He is trying to  stake on the Serbs in his own political interests. A political  settlement that will fully meet the Serbs' interests is actively  sought not only by Russia's political elite but wide sections of  the Russian public as well.    Generally speaking, Moscow is no less than others interested  in halting the Bosnian tragedy that has already lasted for two  years. But to attain this goal one needs to resort to different  policies which will break the deadlock of the problems that are  at issue. This is the standpoint Moscow shares. A force policy  by the NATO alliance can hardly help resolve this issue.</p>

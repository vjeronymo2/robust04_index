			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Paul Brown: "Environment `Failures' Condemned"] </F>   [Text] The Government's annual audit on the state of the  environment was condemned yesterday by opposition parties and  pressure groups for its broken promises and lack of progress.    However, John Gummer, the Environment Secretary, claimed  that  many targets had been met and more had been set. He believed  that environmental standards and the Government's move to  deregulate many activities in order to increase competitiveness  were compatible.    He listed his achievements as the ratification of the  Convention on Climate Change, which seeks to combat global  warming, extending pollution control to eight new industry  groups, including minerals and chemicals; strengthening the  Energy Efficiency Office; and setting reduction targets for  sulphur dioxide emissions to cut acid rain.    The report, issued eight months late, is the third  audit--begun with the 1990 white paper, This Common  Inheritance--and details the original promises made and action  taken since.    Chris Smith, shadow environment protection spokesman, said  the document displayed inaction and complacency. He said the  last three months had seen the Government deliberately destroy  the Energy Conservation Bill, conduct a review of the roads  programme that left almost all of it in place, and the  privatisation of British Rail.    Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat spokesman, pointed out  that the Government had abandoned contaminated land registers  and showed lack of long-term commitment to cut carbon emissions.  "The report is as much a catalogue of government environment  inaction as of action."    The 200-page document lists 652 promises although some of  the  main ones show little progress. They include:    --In previous years there were plans to bring forward new  air  quality targets by 1993. A discussion paper was issued this year  but there are no targets.    --Minimum construction standards were to be set in 1992 for  chemical and oil stores. This has been abandoned.    --Banning lead solder in water pipes, promised in 1992, is  still under consideration. Many parts of Britain have lead  levels in water well above World Health Organisation guidelines.    Andrew Lees, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth,  said: "This whole document is a testament to deregulatory acts  and puts back the cause of the environment. It is proof that  ideological blinkers do not deliver environmental protection."     -  Farmers are causing damage to Britain's prime nature  conservation sites, despite being paid &pound;7 million a year to  protect them, according to a report by the National Audit Office  published today.     A survey found that nearly one in five sites of special  scientific interest showed damage or deterioration between  annual visits. During spot checks in one area, the North-west,  six out of 10 sites had been damaged by inappropriate farming  practices.    The report also criticises English Nature, the quango  charged  with identifying and protecting the sites, for failure to  encourage and assist public access to national nature reserves.

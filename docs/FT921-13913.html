			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Lloyd's report leaves some Names still at a loss SO. What's in it for a Name? Lloyd's: A Route Forward, the report published by the Lloyd's Task Force on Wednesday, has quickly been hailed as the most radical overhaul for the Lloyd's insurance market in its 300-year history. But it is less clear that it will have any great impact for those unlucky enough already to be Names with loss-making syndicates. If you are already a Lloyd's Name - one of the wealthy individuals who provides capital backing for underwriters - or are considering becoming one, two questions are raised. Will the report help if you are already a Name? The proposals contain little comfort for Names facing heavy losses from past years. Tom Benyon, a campaigner for Names who are in financial difficulties, has already made his trenchant views known on this subject: 'It's done nothing to help the injured names, of which there are 6,000. Many of them are in great financial difficulties already, and it is going to get worse this year. Names who are suffering this year ain't seen nothing yet.' The most significant proposal for existing Names is the possible escape route from 'Open Years', or accounts which cannot be closed due to outstanding losses. The only problem is that the route should be at 'a price which fairly reflects their outstanding liabilities'. Unfortunately, an exit route which does this would still be very expensive. The main proposal on this front concerns CentreWrite, which was created in July last year and at present works as a reinsurance agency for Lloyd's syndicates. The Report suggests it should offer reinsurance for Names with open years instead. Names could pay a premium to CentreWrite, which would then bear liabilities for any further losses on the open years. This would be an advance on the present system of stop-loss insurance, under which premiums have often been criticised for being both high and inaccurately assessed. However, an accurately assessed premium to bear the risk of an open year will be expensive. 'If they can afford that they can probably afford the losses,' said Mike Voller, Lloyd's specialist with the accountant BDO Binder Hamlyn, which advises about 1,000 Names. 'I can't see an awful lot of people taking that out because of the level of premiums which is likely to be charged.' But Mark Farrer, chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents 9,500 Names, was more positive about the proposal. He said: 'I think the proposals for CentreWrite are going to be extremely useful for Names, because nobody at present is really prepared to assess the individual risk. I don't doubt that what is proposed is an excellent idea.' The proposal to allow open years - which are mostly burdened by pollution claims, which often take many years to come through - to remain open is bad news for existing Names who want to leave. While you are a member of a syndicate with an open year, you cannot walk away from being a Name, except by taking the expensive reinsurance route. This proposal could, therefore, have the effect of tying Names in, to keep supporting underwriters for the next few years. Will it make it more attractive to become a Name next year? Provided the report's recommendations on limiting liability come into force in time for January 1993, virtually everyone seems to agree the answer must be 'yes'. The high-level cap to limit excessive losses leaves the concept of unlimited liability intact, but only just. The proposal, which the Task Force hopes can be implemented in time for next January, is that losses will be limited to the total a Name puts forward in premiums for a year. The minimum level for this amount is Pounds 250,000. Thus, Names could not lose more than the money they originally made available to the underwriters. But the fund would be cumulative and cover losses over four consecutive years which together exceed the limit. Lloyd's is still working on the precise details as to how the scheme would be put into operation. The compensation would be paid by a compulsory levy on all Names equal to 0.25 per cent of their premium income limit. This limits the 'up-side' of a Lloyd's membership, but scarcely by a significant amount. Although you are still taking a big risk, if you put up Pounds 250,000, you are at least able to treat this as 'risk money'. That puts the potential downside of Lloyd's membership on a par with buying shares in a small company - you can lose all the money you put into the investment, but you cannot lose any more. Unlimited liability wold only remain if the fund could not meet the calls on Names, in circumstances which 'threatened the continued existence of the market'. Another change which would make Lloyd's much more friendly to new Names is to set up Members' Agents Pooling Arrangements (or Mapas). This has been likened to a unit trust. Members' agents would pool all the syndicate participations of the Names they represented, effectively giving a greater spread of risk. Given that last year's losses were heavily concentrated on a few unlucky Names in a few syndicates, this would be a big plus for Lloyd's novices. It might deter those insiders who profit at present from their knowledge of the different underwriters. Becoming a Lloyd's Name is still a decision which demands to be taken very seriously. It can only make sense if you are in the fortunate position of having Pounds 250,000 in free capital and are prepared to take the risk of losing all of it. If you decide to become a Name, Clive Scott-Hopkins, of Towry Law, says that for married couples where one partner has most or all of the wealth, it makes sense for the less wealthy partner to be given the Pounds 250,000 and then become the Name. This is a handy way to limit liability.</p>

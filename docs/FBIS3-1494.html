According to the Red Cross, more than 1,000 Cameroonians have  crossed the border to find refuge in a Chadian village.  Christophe Champain reports:    [Champain] There have been unprecedented clashes over the  last few days in several villages of the Logone et Chari  department in the extreme north of Cameroon, while the  Cameroonian Army has been trying for two months now to put an  end to the activities of the infamous roadblockers. According  to official sources contacted today in Kousseiri, it is  precisely the attack by roadblockers on the village of  (Kounzayakou) near the Logone river, on the border with Chad,  which led to this flare-up. Given the confusion in the region  at the moment, it is difficult to know precisely what happened  during the ensuing days. However, according to the prefect of  Kousseiri, the main town in the department, people erecting  roadblocks have invaded and looted several other villages in the  districts of (Klangwa) and Makari, close to the Chadian border.  The Cameroonian Army went to the scene three days ago in order  to try and restore order. However, the situation remains tense  in the zone where the clashes took place, and only the military  have access to it for the time being.</p>

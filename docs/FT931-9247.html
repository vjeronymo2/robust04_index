			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / The voice of Euro-gloom The European Community is once again in the throes of a crisis of Euro-pessimism. For this assertion, we have the word of no less a figure than Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. He told the European Parliament last week: 'The economy is in crisis, society is in crisis, democracy is foundering . . . The very idea of a united Europe is in peril.' Many people will be inclined to discount such a stark judgment as a histrionic excess of language. No one can deny that the recession is a source of considerable difficulty, for the Community as well as for the member states; there is no doubt that the EC is going through a period of considerable uncertainty in this twilight zone between the signature of Maastricht and its ratification. But is it really true to say that 'democracy is foundering?' Mr Delors has many powerful virtues. But he does have a tendency to react too emotionally to the ups and downs of public affairs, and he must surely be overstating the case. The Community's crisis has three facets, according to Mr Delors. First, unemployment is jeopardising the credibility of the EC's raison d'etre. Second, popular support for the Community can no longer be taken for granted; the voters used to accept Europe massively but passively, now they actively debate it. Third, the same debate is going on among the EC governments: 'Our 12 member states do not see eye to eye on the fundamental issue of where Europe should be going,' he said. These three factors obviously hang together. The EC has always developed quickly under the benign influence of economic growth, and stagnated in periods of recession: the last period of Euro-gloom lasted from the oil shock of the early 1970s to the recovery of the early 1980s. The programme for economic and monetary union (Emu) sprang out of the euphoria which accompanied the 1985 plan for the single market; but it must be vulnerable to popular condemnation if it is seen as a machine for low growth and high unemployment. And if voters are ambivalent about it, governments will be ambivalent too. Mr Delors' difficulty is that he can provide no reassurance for the doubters, because he can promise no solution for their problems. The president remains convinced that the EMU programme is still on the right lines; he insists there is no salvation in floating exchange rates; but he offers no remedy which will bring down, or even stabilise, unemployment. 'The spectre of unemployment hangs over everything we have achieved. Beginning with social protection systems and their financing, under-employment is at the root of much of the current malaise: social exclusion and poverty, the hopelessness of young people and the repercussions of this on education, the financial cost of unemployment,' he said. 'I do not claim to have the answer. Much depends on national policies.' These last 13 words pinpoint the dilemma, and indeed encapsulate his whole speech. Mr Delors is by far the most impressive Commission president in the history of the Community. He played a key role in the plan for the single market, as well as in the programme for Emu But it appears he has nothing more to say. His speech was advertised as the Commission's action programme for this year; but the overall impression is of a vacuum filled with hot air, if you'll forgive the mixed metaphor. This is not a reproach to Mr Delors; it is just a reflection of the real world. The idea that the Commission has a duty to lead is central to Community ideology, and Mr Delors has lived up to that duty better than any predecessor. But at this stage in the EC's history, the ball is in the court of the member governments. Only they can negotiate and perhaps alleviate the stresses of the recession; only they can navigate the treacherous waters between the EC and the voters. These trade-offs are all too transparent in the election platform of France's conservative parties, which are virtually certain of a sweeping victory in next month's election. They say unemployment is top priority but rigorously exclude any 'growth strategy' which would involve floating the franc or a large fiscal stimulus. On the contrary, they undertake to do whatever is necessary for monetary stability, including independence for the Banque de France, and they promise a new initiative for closer monetary co-operation with Germany. So much for the pro-Europeans. But they also have promises for the anti-Europeans, the xenophobes and the protectionists. They say they will reject both the EC-US farm trade agreement and last year's reform of the EC farm policy; they undertake to tighten up on law and order; and they promise new restrictions on immigration and on nationality law. But the most innovative aspect of their programme is the stress on more devolution: more decentralised education, more powers for the regions and the departements, more local experimentation, more local democracy. This is a striking departure from the traditional French model, of a centralised, universalist, Jacobin state. But it is the dual corollary of a developing EC: only the member states can mediate the politics of the transformation of Europe; but the transformation of Europe requires the transformation of the member states. Member states that prefer not to change will obviously prefer to stand aside from the transformation of Europe.</p>

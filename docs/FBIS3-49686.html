I am telling this as a person  knowledgeable of this plant's problems of "those days" (the  totalitarian rule), U.S. Ambassador to Bulgaria William  Montgomery told journalists after his visit to the Kozloduy  Power Plant. The specific improvements made in the power plant  guarantee the operation safety of the different power units, Mr.  Montgomery said. He also recalled the assistance the United  States have provided, including $240,000 extended by the U.S.  Agency for Trade and Development to help the research work and  equip with computers the plant's training centre, and the  support of the U.S. company Westinghouse. The plant is  expecting a donation of two fire engines.    Power Engineering Committee Chairman Nikita Shervashidze  stressed that the upgrading of the plant's operation safety was  accomplished due to "the free assistance of Western experts and  the support on the part of the United States." It is important  to prove that the Kozloduy plant is "not at all the most  hazardous power plant," Mr. Shervashidze went on to say. "With  the experience we have, we want to show the world that we have  no alternative abut use nuclear power, and that we can use  nuclear power sources in compliance with the international  safety requirements," Mr. Shervashidze said.    We are satisfied with the progress that has been made in  Kozloduy, World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) Chairman  Remi Carl told a BTA reporter after arriving in Sofia today.  Mr. Remi said that though not completely up to the Western  standards, the power plant has made a pronounced progress. Unit  1 and 2, switched off in 1992, have been markedly improved, Mr.  Carl said, voicing both WANO's opinion and that of French,  German and Belgian institutes.    In his capacity as vice chairman of the French Electricity  Company, Mr. Carl expressed readiness to provide funds for the  upgrading of Unit 5 and 6.    Tomorrow the French guest will visit the Kozloduy Power  Plant  and will meet with National Electricity Company officials to  discuss an agreement on the extending of funds for upgrading  Unit 5 and 6, and a wholesale 9-year programme for improvement  of the plant's operation safety.    Mr. Carl will also be received by Bulgarian Prime Minister  Lyuben Berov.</p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE: SACRED RUSSIAN CHORAL MUSIC. THE GLINKA CHOIR. IRINA ARKHIPOVA,  MEZZO-SOPRANO. MCA COMPACT DISC (AED 68004).  </P> <P> This is a live recording made in 1988 from the stage of Moscow's Bolshoi  Theater, in celebration of the millennium of Christianity in Russia. The choir  gives an expressive performance, but the high points of the hour-long concert  of 12 selections are the solos by the rich-voiced Arkhipova. Inadequate program  notes.

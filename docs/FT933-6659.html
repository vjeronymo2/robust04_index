			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / IBM taps into strength to play the power game: Big Blue is turning tables on its partner Intel by developing a clone microchip International Business Machines is turning the tables. Long the victim of 'cloners' of its mainframe computers, disk drives and personal computers, IBM is now turning predator - developing its own 'clone' of Intel's top-selling microprocessors; the 'brains' of personal computers. IBM is understood to be developing its own version of the Intel 'microcode' or internal software instructions that control the functions of a microprocessor. This would enable IBM to produce microprocessors that do not rely upon Intel technology. IBM is responding to a radical shift of power from computer manufacturers to semiconductor makers over the last decade. If it successfully reverses that through its new venture, IBM could regain some of its technological leadership. But the price could be high. IBM could damage its partnership with Intel which has created the global PC industry with sales of Dollars 70bn (Pounds 46.9bn) a year. For more than a decade, Intel has supplied microprocessors to manufacturers of 'IBM-compatible' personal computers. Now IBM is planning to produce and sell 'Intel-compatible' chips - devices that can run all of the thousands of software programs designed for Intel-based PCs. Some 10 years ago, Intel was on its uppers; struggling to keep pace with Japanese competitors and losing money in the process. IBM came to the rescue, like a beneficent giant, investing Dollars 400m in Intel to ensure that its chip supplier would survive. Today, Intel is the world's largest and most profitable semiconductor company and it is IBM that is in the red and painfully cutting its operations and workforce. Cloning Intel's microcode is a key step in IBM's plan to seize control of the core technology of its Dollars 10bn personal computer business, correcting what many industry analysts see as a serious mistake in the early days of the PC market that made IBM beholden to outside suppliers, in particular Intel and Microsoft, the software company. IBM appears determined to exert more control over both aspects of PC development. On the software side, it has already begun to draw away from Microsoft by, for example, offering its own version of DOS, the standard PC operating software. It is also developing a new generation of operating system, called Workplace which will have broader compatibility with other software. On the hardware side, IBM's 'cloning' effort is believed to be geared primarily towards ensuring that a new generation of microprocessors, called PowerPC, jointly developed by IBM with Motorola and Apple computer, can take advantage of the huge established base of PC software applications. With the addition of Intel-compatible microcode, PowerPC may be able to emulate an Intel microprocessor so fast that users would not know nor care what type of chip was inside their computers. This would greatly enhance the market prospects for PowerPC computers, including those planned by IBM and Apple, and also make PowerPC chips more competitive with Intel's microprocessors. The cloning effort could thus boost IBM's nascent efforts to become a big player in the semiconductor chip market. Until recently, IBM's huge chip plants in the US, Europe and Japan have produced devices only of use in IBM 's own computers. Now the company is actively seeking opportunities to sell chips to the outside world. Mr Louis Gerstner, IBM chairman and chief executive, recently identified semiconductor sales as strategic to the company's return to profit. The high-performance microprocessor market is one of the fastest growing and most lucrative segments of the semiconductor market. Intel is the runaway leader in the microprocessor field, with an estimated one-third share of the world market, according to Integrated Circuit Engineering, a US market research group. In the 32-bit high-performance sector Intel dominates with a 72 per cent share. In 1992, Intel's unit shipments of 32-bit microprocessors totalled about 20m, according to ICE estimates, while other competitors combined sold about 9m of this type of chips. It is expected to take IBM at least another year to complete development of its Intel 'clone' microcode. Starting from scratch, IBM's software developers must ensure that their work is not 'tainted' by the inclusion of any of Intel's technology that could could run them into legal problems. Yet IBM's unique relationship with Intel might encourage both companies to reach an accommodation. Already, Intel has licensed IBM to produce Intel-designed microprocessors for use in its own products. IBM is also offering circuit-boards incorporating its home-built Intel-designed chips to other PC makers. IBM has also demonstrated its ability to improve upon Intel's microprocessor designs. Earlier this month, it announced 'Blue Lightning' a speeded-up version of Intel's 486 microprocessor. Similarly, IBM has developed faster, and lower power versions of Intel's 386. After 10 years as allies, Intel and IBM appear to be heading towards direct competition, threatening a partnership that has dominated the PC market. The consequences of the changing relationship between the world's largest computer and semiconductor manufacturers are likely to touch every participant in the market.</p>

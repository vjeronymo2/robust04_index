The Asia-Pacific region contains the  world's fastest-growing and most dynamic economies. It is the  world's largest consumer market and the biggest U.S. goods and  services export market. Already over 40 percent of U.S. trade  is with the Asia- Pacific region. In 1992, U.S. transpacific  trade was U.S.$325 billion -- almost 50 percent more than its  trade with Western Europe and three times that with South  America. Over 2.3 million American jobs are related to the  annual U.S.$120 billion export to Asia. Because of its huge  growth potential, the Asia-Pacific region will be of increasing  economic significance to the future of the United States. It  will be a vast source of jobs, income, partnership, and growth  for the United States in the coming years.    In this context, the United States' active engagement in the  Asia-Pacific region is unavoidable. President Bill Clinton laid  out the Administration's blueprint for the Asia-Pacific policy  in two speeches during his first Asian tour. The basic goal is  to seek to build a New Pacific community.    The Clinton's version of the New Pacific Community features  three inseparable and intertwined pillars; prosperity based on  open and free markets; regional security based on preventive  diplomacy and the control of nuclear and other dangerous  weapons; and democracy in free and humane societies addressing  global issues.    In the economic area, President Clinton listed three  essentials for the New Pacific Community; a new relationship  between the United States and Japan; an open global and regional  economy; and commitment to democratic values.    President Clinton declared that the administration's first  international economic priority would be to create a new and  stronger partnership between the United States and Japan and  that the U.S. relationship with Japan would be the centerpiece  of U.S. policy toward the New Pacific Community. Japan is  America's most important ally and its second largest trading  partner. Producers in each of the two countries are consumers  for companies in the other. But the economic relationship  between the United States and Japan is not in balance. Unlike  its relations with all other wealthly developed nations, the  United States has a huge and persistent trade deficit with  Japan. It usually exceeds U.S.$40 billion, with a deficit in  manufacturing products in excess of U.S.$60 billion. Since the  two countries account for nearly 40 percent of the world's  output, the state of their economic relationship is extremely  important not only to themselves but also to the Asia-Pacific  region and the free trading system of the world. The failure to  reduce their chronic trade deficit has been threatening the  vital U.S.- Japan relationship. The Clinton administration  became aware of the fact that the previous trade agreements had  not worked because they lacked a commitment to tangible results,  and they provided no way to measure success. Therefore, the  administration began to focus on not trade by numbers but by  results coming from better rules of trade when it held trade  negotiations with the Japanese Government. After serious  negotiations, the United States and Japan finally reached an  agreement on the establishment of the U.S.-Japan framework for a  new economic partnership in July 1993. Under this framework,  the United States and Japan will negotiate a series of  agreements that will allow greater penetration into the Japanese  marketplace in specific areas and will include specific  timetables and objective criteria for measuring success.  President Clinton acclaimed this agreement as an important step  toward a more balanced trade relationship between the United  States and Japan.    The Clinton administration views an open regional and  global economy as the second building block of the New Pacific  community. That means that the United States will resist the  pressures to put up walls to protect specific markets; will work  to reduce regional trade barriers; and will head off regional  trade blocs. In this respect the U.S. Government has made  considerable success. On the global level, the international  trade talks were completed with the Uruguay Round in the end of  1993. The U.S. Government achieved what it had hoped for. This  breakthrough brought good news for the United States because it  means more jobs and new growth. On the regional level the  principle of openness of the regional and global economy is  accepted by most APEC leaders. At the unprecedented meetings of  APEC leaders in Seattle in late November, Clinton not only  affirmed U.S. continuous, active engagement in the region but  also revealed the U.S. belief that the benefits of trade  liberalization underlies U.S. commitment to the New Pacific  Community.    In the security area, the Clinton administration believes  there are four priorities for the security of the New Pacific  Community. First, a continued American military presents in this  region; second, stronger efforts to combat the proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction; third, new regional dialogues on  the full range of the common security challenges; and last,  support for democracy and open societies throughout this region.    President Clinton, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and  other U.S. officials made it very clear that the bedrock of  America's security role in the Asia-Pacific region must be a  continued military presence. The Clinton administration affirms  U.S. bilateral security treaties with five Asia-Pacific  countries: Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and  Thailand. These treaties serve the interests of the United  States. They enable U.S. armed force to maintain a substantial  presence. While the defense budget has been cut in European and  American domestic bases, the Clinton administration maintains  the U.S. force level in Asia. After the closure of the  Philippine bases, the United States has obtained increased  access for its forces throughout Southeast Asia to facilitate  the military presence there. All of these are signs that the  United States is going to stay on in the region.    To prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction, the  nuclear weapons in particular, and their means of delivery is  the second priority of the Clinton administration for the New  Pacific Community. In this respect, the United States has  serious concerns about the suspected development of nuclear  weapons on the Korean peninsula. It urges North Korea to  fulfill its full-scope obligations to the International Atomic  Energy Agency, including IAEA inspections of undeclared nuclear  sites and to reaffirm its commitment to the Nonproliferation  Treaty. The United States also pays close attention to the  transshipment of missiles and sophisticated technologies.    Perhaps no development is more noticeable than the new  emphasis in the Clinton administration on the regional security  dialogues. From the Clinton's administration's point of view,  the post-Cold War has produced a radical shift in the old  balance of power. The New Pacific Community must forge a new  regional balance that promotes stability. Unlike the Cold War  era and unlike Europe, it is not a group of blocs set against  each other or some common enemy. It will help to convey  intentions to each other, to erase misperceptions, and to start  building confidence. In this regard, the Association of  Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) post-ministerial conference is  regarded as a most promising forum. Clinton announced that the  United States will participate as a full partner in regional  security dialogues with the ASEAN and its associated members.  He also made it clear that the ASEAN post ministerial  conference is not the only framework in the Asia-Pacific region  and it is by no means a supplanter of America's alliances or  forward military presence in the region.    In conclusion, the Clinton administration's Asia-Pacific  policy is one important component of the American foreign policy  which is undergoing an adjustment. It aims to more actively  participate in the Asia-Pacific region where the United State  hopes to continue to play a dominant role while paying close  attention to the manner which it does so.</p>

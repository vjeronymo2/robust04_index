			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Tennis: Biff, bash, match - crisis - Tennis faces a power struggle. John Barrett considers the possible solutions ONE OF the basic rules of marketing is to heed the views of the customer. Whether you are selling soap in supermarkets or seats in sports stadia, the customer's satisfaction must be your first concern. So what do tennis fans think about the problem of service dominance in the men's game on fast surfaces? Here is one view: 'To see the real art of the game, one must watch it on relatively slow hard courts where the mere possession of a fast service and expert volleying technique rarely suffices to overcome a deficiency of ground stroke play.' Quite so. What, then, do spectators think should be done to curb the power of the server without changing the basic characteristics of the game? Here are two constructive suggestions from readers: 'Experiments have been carried out in France with a shortened service court. Could not the same effect be obtained by having a server's line drawn behind the baseline . . . this would have the added advantage of making it more difficult for the server to get to the net?' 'There are many who think the most effective answer to the present undue dominance of service power would be a softer ball.' Sensible proposals, you will probably think. It might surprise you to know that the above extracts are all from letters addressed to Lawn Tennis and Badminton magazine in 1958. Yes, even 34 years ago there was an awareness among keen tennis fans that power was threatening to diminish spectator enjoyment by reducing the number of rallies. Yet the 'villains' of 1958 - men like Wimbledon finalists Ashley Cooper and Neale Fraser of Australia, both strong serve-and-volleyers - were babes by comparison with the modern power brokers like Goran Ivanisevic, Boris Becker, Michael Stich and Richard Krajicek. Why? In a word, technology. The modern tennis racket has about as much in common with the old wooden-framed models (which were the game's only implements for more than 100 years) as Concorde does with the Tiger Moth. Instead of introducing a rule to retain wood as the only allowable material, as cricket and baseball did when threatened with aluminium bats, the International Tennis Federation simply sat still and watched while technology ran riot. With hindsight, they wish now that they had acted back in the 1960s when first the Spalding Smasher (as used by Pancho Gonzales to beat Charlie Pasarell in that epic Wimbledon Centre Court duel in 1969), and then the Wilson T2000 (which Ann Jones used to win her Wimbledon singles title the same year), started the avalanche. Technology has come a long way since then. Incorporating space-age materials and computer-generated aerodynamic design features, today's wide-bodied weapons - made of graphite and boron, Kevlar, titanium and ceramics - deliver up to 32 per cent more power than the old wooden frames. Laboratory tests show that a wooden racket swung at 62 mph by an averagely strong male would deliver a serve at 86 mph. Because of improved air-flow design, the same player could swing a modern wide-bodied frame at 78 mph and thump down his serve at 114 mph. Of course, today's super athletes are far stronger than average, and getting taller. In 1973, only four of the top 10 ranked men were over 6ft tall. By 1983, there were six; last year, nine. These giants regularly deliver their serves at up to 130 mph. At that speed, the reaction time for the receiver - from the moment the ball is struck to the moment it hits the court - is just 0.3 of a second. On a fast surface like grass or indoor carpet, there is no time to think. Instant reaction is the only hope. Furthermore, the 'sweet spot,' or effective hitting area, on today's oversize rackets is six times larger than on a wooden racket, so that the game really is easier to play than it used to be. Wonderful news, this, for the club enthusiast; but is the increased margin of error really necessary for the professional player who, by definition, should be able to middle the ball all the time - a point that Jimmy Connors is always making? All that we have done is to reduce the premium on skill. Average players have become good; good players have become great; and the truly great performer with touch and flair, like Ilie Nastase, has been killed off, unable to live at the pace set by today's young gladiators. On fast courts, therefore, the men's game has become one-dimensional. Two-stroke tennis has become a boring reality. In Stuttgart the other week, young Ivanisevic delivered 105 aces during his winning run, including 32 in the final against Stefan Edberg. It was not much of a spectacle for the poor spectator. And I do not have to remind you that the same unfortunate Edberg was beaten in last year's Wimbledon semi-final by Michael Stich's overpowering game without ever losing his own service. That was another of those one-dimensional matches with few rallies. It is not only a service problem. Those spectacular forehand and backhand winners from the likes of Andre Agassi are equally responsible for reducing the length of rallies. They would have been impossible to play with a wooden racket. The male players themselves are conscious of the need to take action before boredom turns away the fans or, perish the thought, encourages them to watch women's matches instead. For it is undeniably true that modern racket technology has improved the women's game by making it possible for them to serve better and hit early winners, so reducing the number of long, boring rallies. What, if anything, can be done? Some interesting suggestions emerged from the ATP forum I attended recently in Florida. There are two main options. You can either tinker with the rules or put limits on equipment - or effect a combination of both. To inhibit the server, the height of the net could be raised, the service court shortened, a server's line introduced behind the baseline, the foot fault rule re-introduced, or the server allowed only one serve. The problem here is that all changes to court dimensions or rules must be applied universally to men and women, amateurs and professionals. Changes to the rules governing equipment could include softer balls, slower court surfaces (not an option for grass), and less powerful rackets. Already at certain tournaments, including the US Open, men and women use different models of the same ball - there is a heavy-duty version for the men. More experiments will certainly be done on this option because the balls used today are harder and faster than they used to be. My own preferred solution would be to tackle racket performance. Although it is probably impracticable to return to the days of wooden rackets (no major manufacturer any longer produces them), it would be easy to define a head size near to the 78 square inches of the traditional wooden frame as well as insisting on a similar flex. It is the stiffness in the modern frame that is the basis of its power. A move in this direction would tackle the problem at its source, whereas tinkering with the rules deals only with the symptoms. I see no difficulty in legislating only for men. There are plenty of precedents in sport where men and women use equipment with different specifications so as to recognise differences in physique. A woman does not throw as heavy a discus, javelin or shot as the male athlete, nor are the hurdles she traverses as high. However, I can foresee a torrent of protest from players whose advantage would be reduced and from manufacturers whose whole marketing thrust has been built around the merits of power. Yet I would remind the players that, regardless of racket size or material, the bigger, stronger athletes have always been the best servers. That would still be true with smaller-headed frames of increased flex. But, crucially, the premium on skill would also be restored so that a future Nastase or McEnroe could once again emerge to pit his wits against the men of power. We might even see rallies again] That is what the paying public wants to see. The game will ignore that message at its peril.</p>

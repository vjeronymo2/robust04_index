Luis Becker, a member of the URGN's Political-Diplomatic  Commission, said the document's signing will mark a new phase in  the country's social and political life, where daily practice  will determine whether it is possible to reduce the gap between  the proposals on human rights and the devastating reality the  country has faced.    Becker did not give any details of the agreement, but he  described it as a positive step and a victory for the Guatemalan  people, as well as a victory for all sectors that have struggled  to maintain the values and principles of real democracy.</p>

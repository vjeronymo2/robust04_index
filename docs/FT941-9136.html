			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Tiphook offers Montague consolation Mr Robert Montague, the controversial founder of Tiphook, has been offered share options and a bonus scheme to continue working with the debt-laden UK transport leasing group as chief executive. The shares fell 9p to 58p yesterday after Tiphook revealed interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 180m and warned that its survival was dependent on the successful disposal of the group's largest asset. Tiphook, which has debts of Pounds 1.1bn, has agreed to sell its container business to Transamerica, the US financial services group, for a minimum of Pounds 690m. Mr Montague, 46, was on a base salary of Pounds 816,000 as executive chairman, but will receive only Pounds 200,000 in his new role. Partly to compensate for this drop, he will be granted options over 2m ordinary shares at an exercise price of 20p per share, and a further option over 500,000 shares at 65p per share. Mr Montague will also receive an annual bonus of 1 per cent of the group's pre-tax profits, subject to an agreed aggregate total of Pounds 250,000 during the next five years. To compensate for signing a five-year agreement not to compete with Transamerica in containers, he will be paid Pounds 250,000 after 18 months. Touche Ross, the group's accountants, did not audit the figures for the six months to October 31, which it said had been prepared on a 'going concern' basis, which was dependent on the completion of the sale to Transamerica. They added: 'In the event that the sale is not completed, there is substantial uncertainty as to the availability of future financing such as to allow the group to operate as a going concern. If such financing is not available, the group would be forced into either administration or receivership.' The pre-tax loss was principally caused by exceptional costs and writeoffs totalling Pounds 117m. The costs included Pounds 13.5m in professional and bankers' fees. When the Transamerica deal is completed, Tiphook's financial advisers will also receive a success fee of Pounds 11m. In the US, Tiphook bond prices rose after the market responded favourably to Tiphook's plan to use part of the sale proceeds to repurchase at par 40 per cent of the Dollars 700m in US bonds issued the group.

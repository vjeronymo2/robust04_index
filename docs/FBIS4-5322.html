He  will replace Tan Sri Jaffar Hussein, who has opted for early  retirement after taking responsibility for Bank Negara's massive  losses in (?forward) transactions in the foreign exchange market  in 1992 and 1993.    Encik Ahmad, 47, has been appointed for a three-year period.  Finance Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim announced this in a  statement today. Apppointed as managing director of Maybank  since 1 January 1991, the company under his stewardship has  emerged as the country's leading bank.

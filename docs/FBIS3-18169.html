			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Nikolaos Bellos] </F>   [Excerpt] Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos  said that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's letter containing  the government's political arguments for the measures against  Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] was  sent this afternoon to European Commission President Jacques  Delors through diplomatic channels. Pangalos added that the  memorandum with Greece's legal arguments will be submitted to  the commission when it is completed.    Referring to the possibility of legal proceedings against  Greece, the European Commission press spokesman clarified that  the Communal Treaty allows this procedure to be speeded up and  did not rule out that the court may ask for a temporary lifting  of the Greek measures.    Asked by Greek correspondents, Greek European Union [EU]  Commissioner Ioannis Palaiokrasas said the procedure of an  appeal against Greece may be avoided. He said: It is not right  to end up with such developments. Answering another question,  Palaiokrasas said the commission has procedures for court  appeals that are not time consuming.    Van Den Broek's spokesman today told reporters that Skopje  accused Greece of closing its borders even to humanitarian aid.  [passage omitted]</p>

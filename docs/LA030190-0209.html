			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLOCK SAYS HE'LL SEEK NEW TERM AS SHERIFF;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN: IN THE WAKE OF A DEPARTMENT SCANDAL, HE SAYS HE IS TAKING MEASURES TO  GUARD AGAINST FUTURE PROBLEMS.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, whose department has been rocked by  money-skimming allegations, said Wednesday that he has filed for reelection in  June and taken administrative steps to ensure that further scandals will not  occur.  </P> <P> Block, who has headed the nation's largest sheriff's department for more than  seven years, said he has instituted a policy of requiring financial disclosure  statements from some department officials. Although he would not identify the  assignments that would require financial reviews, they reportedly include  narcotics investigators, said several department officials and deputies.  </P> <P> Last week, 10 sheriff's officers -- including all nine members of an elite  anti-drug team and the wife of one deputy -- were indicted on a variety of  federal charges, including allegations of theft of $1.4 million in drug money,  filing false tax returns and money laundering.  </P> <P> Although there has been no suggestion that the indicted officers were drug  users, Block also said he has ordered top department officials -- including  himself -- to undergo random drug testing. Eventually, he would like all 8,000  officers tested.  </P> <P> At his monthly media briefing, Block said he is taking the steps in part to  help the department overcome the worst scandal in its history. "I honestly  believe that from this point on, the course of events will contribute to a  healing process," he said.  </P> <P> Block said that for the first time, he has ordered full financial disclosures  by department workers in some areas. "It would not have 'red-flagged' those  (indicted) at the time they entered the assignment," Block said. "But it  provides an opportunity to readily see any unusual or significant changes in  one's financial holdings."  </P> <P> Block said he has "turned 180 degrees" on drug testing and is now requiring the  testing as "a message to the community" that deputies are not involved in  drugs.  </P> <P> Richard Shinee, chief counsel for the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs,  confirmed that his 6,000-member organization -- which represents the largest  number of deputies -- is engaged in talks with sheriff's officials. But he  stressed that "there is absolutely no correlation between the alleged theft of  laundered money and the random drug testing."  </P> <P> Block, 65, who was appointed to the job in 1982 and later won two full terms in  office, defended his handling of the scandal and said he doubts that it will  affect his reelection chances.  </P> <P> The only other candidate for the nonpartisan office is Roland Biscailuz, 44, a  detective in the Lennox station and a 23-year veteran. He is a cousin of the  late Sheriff Eugene Biscailuz. The filing deadline is March 9.  </P></p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Council's video system cuts crime A VIDEO surveillance system set up by King's Lynn Borough Council, in Norfolk, has cut car crime in the town centre and may be extended to include local businesses. The system was installed earlier this year after the success of a pilot scheme on a council-owned industrial estate, where crime had been discouraging businesses from moving in. Thirty six cameras are now located in car parks, housing estates and leisure and shopping centres. They are linked by fibre optic cables to a central control room which is staffed 24 hours a day and which has a direct link to the police station. Running the system costs Pounds 200,000 year in staff, maintenance and leasing costs. This is partly funded by a 5p surcharge on carpark tickets and service charges for businesses in areas covered by the scheme. The council claims it is the UK's first multi-application surveillance system which can be used for management of council facilities as well as crime prevention and security. The council is now considering expanding the service to businesses in the town on a commercial basis. The low-light cameras can be targeted on a particular place if there are signs of suspicious activity, and all pictures are recorded. The system has cut vandalism and reduced car thefts from three a fortnight to three over the six-month period since it was introduced. Police attribute 53 arrests directly to the cameras, and the borough council says people are no longer reluctant to use carparks in shopping centres because of car crime. It says that any public worries over 'big brother' surveillance have been offset by the benefits of having increased security.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Reorganisation could mean double severance pay for authority workers Local authority workers who lose their jobs as a result of reorganisation could be paid more than double the amount of severance pay to which they would otherwise have been entitled, the Department of the Environment said yesterday, John Authers writes. The announcement added to fears that the new structure will be costly and that outgoing authorities preparing for abolition will take on heavy financial commitments. All the funds for these payments would come from local authorities' own resources, and not from central government or from pension funds. Under the proposals the maximum payment for employees under the age of 50 will be 66 weeks' pay, compared to a maximum payout in usual circumstances of 24 1/2 weeks, with 30 weeks for those over 50. The minimum payment will be at least 1 1/2 weeks' wages for each year of service, up to a maximum of 45 weeks. The equivalent existing entitlement is 22. The department will consult local authorities until July 13.</p>

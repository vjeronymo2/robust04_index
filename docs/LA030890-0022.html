			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WOUNDED WOMAN ARRESTED IN HUSBAND'S SLAYING IS FREED  </P> <P> A Simi Valley woman suspected in the shooting death of her husband was released  Wednesday because investigators said they were unsure how the man was killed.  </P> <P> Christopher Fortunato, 29, was found shot to death in the couple's home in the  1100 block of Hudson Court at 6 a.m. Tuesday.  </P> <P> Officers were called to the home by a neighbor after the victim's wife, Kari  Fortunato, 31, ran to the neighbor's home and asked them to call for help,  police said.  </P> <P> Sgt. Tony Harper said Kari Fortunato, who was covered with blood, was taken to  Simi Valley Adventist Hospital, where she was arrested on suspicion of slaying  her husband. At the hospital, it was determined that she had gunshot wounds in  both hands and on the top of her head.  </P> <P> She was reported in stable condition at the hospital Wednesday.  </P> <P> Police said the couple were arguing inside their house before the shooting.  Christopher Fortunato was found in a hallway, shot in the head. A handgun  believed to have been used in the shooting was found in the home.  </P> <P> After the shooting, Kari Fortunato declined on the advice of an attorney to  talk with investigators about what had happened, police said.  </P> <P> Because of her wounds, the lack of witnesses and other information about the  shooting, detectives on Wednesday decided not to seek a murder charge against  Kari Fortunato, Harper said. He declined to speculate whether Christopher  Fortunato could have been shot by his wife or if she may have been injured  while trying to prevent his suicide.  </P> <P> "We have not yet determined what happened," Harper said. "We don't know whether  we have a homicide or suicide. We still have more work to do on this."  </P></p>

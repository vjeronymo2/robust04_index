			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Balkans war alarms Bulgaria BULGARIA fears instability in the Balkans could be deepened by the Yugoslav conflict spilling over into neighbouring countries, President Zhelyu Zhelev said yesterday. 'There is a strong possibility that the conflict could spill over into Kosovo and Macedonia and from there into other parts of the volatile Balkan region. The tensions in Kosovo are such that one spark could set that area on fire,' he said. Mr Zhelev called on the west to intervene militarily to stop the fighting and warned that if the conflict spread to Macedonia it would be difficult to prevent the involvement of Bulgaria, which has been without a government since Prime Minister Philip Dimitrov lost a confidence vote last week. 'We could not possibly stop the influx of refugees and this would provoke Bulgarians living on the border, most of whom have relatives in Macedonia, to take arms and go to the rescue,' he said. A Bulgarian team left for Frankfurt last night to continue talks over repayment of the country's Dollars 10bn debt to 300 commercial banks led by Deutsche Bank. The resumption of partial interest payments in September opened the way for these negotiations which had been thrown into doubt by the government's resignation.</p>

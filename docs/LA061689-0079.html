			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: MEMPHIS GROUP FOUNDER SEES WORK AS CHILD'S PLAY  </P> <P> Ettore Sottsass, the godfather of Italian New Wave design, goes about creating  his brightly colored eccentric furniture, architecture and interiors like a  child at play.  </P> <P> "My deepest images are the ones I recall from kindergarten building blocks,"  the 72-year-old designer said. "From the regime of education, professional  training, technological method and brute necessity, my mind escapes to my play  blocks like a kid let out of school."  </P> <P> In 1980, Sottsass founded the influential Memphis Group, whose building-block  creations influenced Post-Modern design at every level. Using bold geometric  shapes, primary colors, vivid textures and a wide palette of materials, the  group created a wide range of radical designs, from European showrooms for  Fiorucci and Esprit to Olivetti typewriters and lighting for Knoll. Sottsass'  famous "Treetops" floor lamp, for example, has a perky yellow metal hat perched  on a long curve of peach-colored steel tubing that slides into a green  triangular boot at the base. It is, like all Sottsass designs, not just a  functional object but a personality in its own right.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Sottsass completed his first Los Angeles design -- the  Mayer-Schwarz gallery on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. The gallery's dramatic  doorway, made up of irregular folds and jagged angles of multicolored terrazzo,  leads into a space Sottsass described as "a metaphysical place." The gallery  interior is cool white, offering respite from the busy sidewalk beyond the  powerful doorway.  </P> <P> Sottsass also designed a pagoda in Malibu for art collector Max Palevsky, as  yet unbuilt. He currently is building houses for clients in Ridgeway, Colo.,  and Maui, Hawaii.  </P> <P> On his most recent visit to Los Angeles, Sottsass described the personal events  that led him to join with other "radical" Italian designers Aldo Cibic, Matteo  Thun and Marco Zanini and art historian Barbara Radice to form the influential  Memphis Group in Milan in 1981.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reaction to Modernism  </P> <P> "We were in reaction to the cerebral Modernism that ruled Italian -- and  European -- design in the decades after World War II. A narrow functionalism  dominated every field, from architecture to industrial design. Objects as large  as buildings or as small as lamps were locked into an often elegant but  generally sterile 'honesty' of use expressed in their purist shapes. Emotion  was eliminated as sentimental."  </P> <P> In an exhibition catalogue written in 1980, Sottsass shocked modernists with  the confession that he chose materials such as spongy paper from government  account books and mosaics of public conveniences that abandoned any  intellectual intent or expectation.  </P> <P> In halting but expressive English peppered with evocative phrases, Sottsass  explained that he offers no ideological system but rather a collage of  thoughts, which he calls a series of private gossips.  </P> <P> Though a resident of Milan, where he shares an apartment with Radice, Sottsass  considers himself a foreigner everywhere. "Milan is so moral and modernist in  its ethos, so obsessed with its design purity, that they scowl at my  frivolity," he said.  </P> <P> Thinking about this "foolish purity," Sottsass' ancient bloodhound eyes and  lugubrious mustache are lightened by a charming grin.  </P> <P> Sottsass' destiny began in Innsbruck, Austria, where his Italian father was an  architect. He graduated in architecture from the University of Turin in 1939,  "just in time for World War II." After six years of army service, Sottsass,  like the rest of his countrymen, found himself in a country devastated by  Mussolini's failed ambition to create a new Roman Empire.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Early Struggles  </P> <P> The young architect starved and struggled until the late 1950s, when Olivetti  commissioned him to design a computer housing system for its newly created  electronics division.  </P> <P> "For me the computer was a magic cabinet, a kind of electronic divinity that  had to be clothed in somber and systematic armor," he recalled. "I was still a  strict modernist, laboring at design as if it were a purely mental exercise."  </P> <P> Two very different streams of influence converged to begin Sottsass' conversion  to non-rational design. One was the deep impact made upon him by a 1961 visit  to a 1,000-year-old Indian temple with "paving stones polished by the wax of  millions of ancient candles and by the bare feet of marvelous dancing girls."  The other was '50s U.S. pop design with its freewheeling informality -- the  polar opposite of high-minded European purity.  </P> <P> These disparate emotional experiences were intensified by the political and  social upheavals of the '60s, in Europe and the United States. Sottsass met  radical poet Allen Ginsberg and several of the leaders of the 1968 Paris  student uprising.  </P> <P> "These people and events, joining the wellspring of my own feelings, led me to  reject the designer's role as a slave of the consumerist system," he said.  "There had to be a way in which everyday objects, whether mass-produced or not,  had to recover their sensorialita -- their emotive power as personalities in  their own right."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Withdrew 10 Years  </P> <P> The name Memphis, Sottsass explains, came about quite casually. "A bunch of us  were sitting around drinking and listening to Bob Dylan's 'Memphis Blues.' The  music was so soulful it made us weep into our wine."  </P> <P> To rethink his notions of design, Sottsass more or less withdrew from  professional activity for a period of 10 years, in favor of pure play. In 1972  he produced a series of fantasy architectural drawings titled "The Planet as  Festival."  </P> <P> The series, which became an icon of radical thinking in the '70s, illustrated  the myth of a society with only leisure time. Freed from work, citizens were  entertained in phallic temples by erotic experiences and other electronic  events.  </P> <P> This kind of sly and gnomic wit informed Sottsass' explorations in the '70s and  became integral to his '80s designs. The fanciful highway for ants and small TV  for butterflies led directly to his more practical bookcase for fallen books  and the quirky shapes, textures and striking color contrasts that give all his  objects a tremendous sense of personality.  </P> <P> Yet Sottsass does not see himself as an artist but as a designer. He vehemently  resists the notion that his designs, like art objects, belong in a gallery, a  trend that has become increasingly prevalent in the last decade.  </P> <P> "I consider all my works to be notes leading toward some unknown end," he said.  "They are not personal dreams bound by their own self-obsesssed logic, but  items meant to enhance the daily life of their owners and viewers. I prefer  them to be used with delight rather than contemplated in awe."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement on the situation in Gorazde by Alija Izetbegovic, </F> president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, to  Bosnia-Herzegovina radio and television on 16 April -- recorded]    [Text] As you know, this was the latest statement we made  prior to the news conference -- the attack continues. We have  just received a report that [word indistinct] is bombing. But  we have also received a report that an order has been issued to  the effect that air strikes should follow. Of course, we may  again ask ourselves whether this will be the same kind of strike  as we have seen hitherto. I am afraid that this is what is  going to take place.    As you can see, this agreement in the UN [words indistinct]  we are talking about one thing, they are talking about another  -- it is like that deaf telephone game -- we are talking about  eliminating Serb artillery and chetnik tanks and equipment,  while they are talking about one chetnik tank. They always talk  along the lines of there being only one tank, which they are  looking for and cannot find, and so on. Anyway, as far as I  know, there is an order to act.    What they are going to do, at the moment [words indistinct]  but what I can say to the people of Gorazde at this really  critical moment is this: I want to tell them that they are not  alone, that we have been working throughout all these days and  nights. Last night we adjourned our meeting at 0200. Today a  series of meetings...[pauses] We have involved the world in this  matter, at the moment the entire world is talking about Gorazde.  Whether this will bring about any success to this town [words  indistinct] I do not know yet. We talked to President Demirel,  Turkey's president, an hour ago. [passage indistinct] to save  the town.    What is the most important thing, though, is that we must  save ourselves in the first place. I would first call on the  citizens not to succumb to panic. It seems there are elements  of panic. Various reports, they are coming in every hour, every  two hours, [words indistinct]. My impression is that there is  panic in the town. There are cases of combat positions being  abandoned. We will find out whether this was justified or not.    We know that a huge force has been unleashed on Gorazde but  the town can and must hold out. We were in such a situation  here [word indistinct]. Two years later we started pushing them  slowly back. They can take the town with a great deal of  difficulty. If its defense is organized they cannot take the  town. They would have to pay dearly for each house.  Consequently, I would like to call on the people of Gorazde to  restore their courage [words indistinct]. Let them know that the  entire world supports them and, first of all, the whole of  Bosnia-Herzegovina supports them.</p>

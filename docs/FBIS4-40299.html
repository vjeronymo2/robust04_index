			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Within Framework of Legal Norms"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday the Russian State Duma deputies expressed  concern in connection with the edict published Tuesday by  President Boris Yeltsin on urgent measures in the struggle  against crime. At the suggestion of Deputy Viktor Pokhmelkin  from the "Russia's Choice" faction the chamber decided to  analyze the head of state's document at a plenary session,  having studied the edict beforehand in the relevant  parliamentary committees.    In Viktor Pokhmelkin's opinion the edict contains violations  of a number of legal norms. During the discussion of the motion  as to whether the question of the president's edict should be  put on the agenda, State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin stated that  this document "must be accompanied by the relevant changes and  additions to the criminal and criminal procedure codes" and by a  relevant State Duma decree.    At the same session the deputies voted to hold a meeting of  parliamentarians of Russia, Ukraine, and Belorussia [Belarus] on  the question of the Belovezhskaya agreement and its results.  The motion on this subject was submitted by Deputy Oleg Mironov  in the form of a decree supplementing the agenda.    A decision was also made to invite Russian Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev to the Duma on Friday to explain Russia's actions  in fulfilling its peacekeeping mission in Georgia and Abkhazia  and also Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to explain the  situation surrounding North Korea.</p>

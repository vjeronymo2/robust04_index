			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ACTION POSTPONED ON SHOPPING CENTER  </P> <P> After a two-hour debate, the City Council on Tuesday night agreed to postpone a  decision on a proposed 17-acre shopping center that some residents claim would  obstruct their ocean views.  </P> <P> The residents had appealed to the council to overturn Planning Commission  approval of the controversial project by Shea Business Properties.  </P> <P> Council members said the residents' appeal was valid but decided on a 3-0 vote  to take up the issue at the next council meeting, Nov. 6. Mayor Patricia C.  Bates abstained, citing a conflict of interest, and Councilman Larry A. Porter  was absent from the meeting.  </P> <P> The shopping center is proposed for the northwest corner of Camino del Avion  and Street of the Golden Lantern and would include a six-screen movie theater,  a restaurant and office space.  </P> <P> The project had been approved 3 to 2 by the Planning Commission in August.  </P> <P> Some 161 homeowners of the Bear Brand community had objected to the project,  saying it would hinder ocean views and increase traffic in their neighborhood.  </P> <P> Scores of residents crammed the council chambers Tuesday night to plead that  the project be scaled down.  </P> <P> Resident Don Jacobson said the root of the residents' resentment was the  1,600-seat theater.  </P> <P> "The theater has got to go," he said. "You're dealing with children who will be  sleeping at a time when the theater will be at its busiest."  </P> <P> Shea attorney Gregory W. Sanders said the residents presented "not one iota of  evidence" to support their appeal.  </P> <P> City Atty. Terry Dixon, however, disagreed. "I've practiced law too long not to  know that there is sufficient evidence to find grounds for an appeal," he said.  </P> <P> Before the meeting began resident Susan Penney delivered a notice of intent to  recall Councilman Paul M. Christiansen. The recall notice stated that  Christiansen has deceived the citizens and has not "been honestly acting to  protect their best interests."  </P> <P> Penney, who said she was acting independently, refused to be specific about her  reason for the recall attempt.  </P> <P> A recall drive was launched against the four other council members at the Oct.  2 meeting after the council decided to delay putting a controversial ridgeline  protection ordinance to a vote until another public hearing can be held.  </P> <P> Councilmen Porter and Thomas Wilson voted for the delay. Mayor Bates and  Councilman James F. Krembas abstained. Christiansen, the only member to vote  against the delay, was not served with the recall notice at that meeting.  </P> <P> However, after being served with a recall notice Tuesday night, Christiansen  said, "It looks like I'm part of the group again."  </P></p>

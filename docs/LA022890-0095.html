			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CANYONS VICTIMIZED BY ERRORS  </P> <P> College of the Canyons pitcher Lance Gibson knew he would be in for a challenge  against L. A. Harbor. The Seahawks' lineup features six starters from last  season's team, which finished third in the state and already had beaten Canyons  this season.  </P> <P> And while Gibson (1-2) rose to the challenge Tuesday, limiting Harbor to six  hits and three earned runs in eight innings, his teammates did not. The result  was a 9-3 Harbor win in a nonconference game at Canyons.  </P> <P> "Gibson really gave us fits," Harbor Coach Jim O'Brien said. "Our batters just  went to sleep against him. He pitched a great game.  </P> <P> "We were like a bunch of little rats scurrying around trying to find what we  could get."  </P> <P> In the ninth inning, Harbor found five unearned runs to break open a 4-3  contest.  </P> <P> "Our defense just fell apart," Canyons Coach Len Mohney said. "Gibson pitched a  good game. He had thrown 115 pitches and he was getting tired. We had to take  him out."  </P> <P> Harbor (18-3) sent 10 batters to the plate in the ninth. Jason Farrell, who  came on in relief of Gibson, gave up four runs in two-thirds of an inning and  Jeff Adams allowed another.  </P> <P> Farrell struck out Gus Mungaray to start the inning, and after that, things  fell apart. Shortstop Charlie Fowlks overthrew first on a routine ground ball,  which allowed Pat Liebsack to advance to second. Liebsack later scored on Mike  Berry's single.  </P> <P> The Hawks scored two more runs when right fielder Chris Vasquez dropped a fly  ball that would have ended the inning.  </P> <P> "We would have liked to have gone into the bottom of the ninth on our home  field down by only a run," Mohney said. "But we didn't give ourselves a chance  and just took ourselves out of the game."  </P> <P> Trailing, 4-3, in the eighth inning, Canyons (8-5) had an opportunity to tie  the score. Frank Aguirre hit a two-out pinch-hit single and Josh Bergara,  running in place of Aguirre, stole second. But Harbor's John Ingram struck out  Jason Stanley to end the inning.  </P> <P> Catcher J. R. Trujillo was three for four -- with a tie-breaking home run in  the fourth and a double -- to lead Canyons' 11-hit attack.  </P></p>

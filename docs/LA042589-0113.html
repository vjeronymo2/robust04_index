			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH KOREA POLICE DISPERSE PROTESTERS  </P> <P> South Korean riot police fired tear gas Monday to disperse thousands of workers  who took to the streets of the southeastern city of Masan after an  anti-government rally, witnesses said.  </P> <P> The protesters were among more than 10,000 workers who crowded a plaza in the  city to demand higher wages and an end to what they called government  repression of labor.  </P> <P> In nearby Changwon, about 2,000 strikers from consumer electronics giant  Goldstar, some of them rolling gasoline-filled drums, marched in the streets  but were dispersed by riot police firing tear gas.  </P> <P> Government officials say the export-led South Korean economy faces a crisis  because of labor disputes. Stoppages affected 322 companies in the first three  months of 1989, at a cost of $2.37 billion in lost production and $642 million  in exports, according to Trade Ministry figures.  </P></p>

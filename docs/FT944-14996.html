			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Blair's allies to get economic role in shadow cabinet changes Mr Tony Blair will today carry out an important reconstruction of the shadow cabinet with the aim of tightening his grip on Labour's economic strategy. After Labour MPs last night made three changes to the 18-strong shadow cabinet, the Labour leader was expected to put allies in all mainstream economic portfolios. Mr Gordon Brown will stay as shadow chancellor. Ms Harriet Harman will probably move to shadow Mr Michael Portillo in employment. Mr Donald Dewar is to stay at social security, with Mr Jack Cunningham possibly taking over at trade and industry. That would leave all economic portfolios in the hands of the party's modernising wing. Mr Cunningham's certain move from shadow foreign secretary would make room for Mr Robin Cook, the traditionalist who topped the poll for the second year running, to replace him. The main uncertainties after last night's result, which saw the election of a record five women, seemed to be over home affairs and education. Mr Jack Straw, currently shadow environment spokesman, was being tipped by some to take over as shadow home secretary, in spite of his surprisingly weak performance in the election. Mrs Margaret Beckett, the former deputy leader who was re-elected in second spot, would be a strong candidate for either post. Ms Mo Mowlam, shadow heritage secretary, is another possible contender to replace Mrs Ann Taylor in education. There was disappointment for Mr Blair in that younger allies - Mr Brian Wilson, Mr Alistair Darling and Mr Alun Michael - failed to be elected. They are expected to secure important jobs on Labour's front bench when Mr Blair reallocates the lower-ranking portfolios. The result, which saw only one MP - Mr Tom Clarke - leave the shadow cabinet, was being portrayed by the leadership as the consolidation of a strong team. As well as the return of Ms Harman and Mrs Beckett, the ballot saw the election of Mr Gavin Strang, MP for Edinburgh East and shadow agriculture spokesman. The results (in order of votes received): Mr Robin Cook, Mrs Margaret Beckett, Mr Gordon Brown, Mr Donald Dewar, Ms Harriet Harman, Mr Frank Dobson, Mr George Robertson, Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Mr Chris Smith, Mr Jack Cunningham, Mr Michael Meacher, Mr Ron Davies, Mr David Clark, Mr Jack Straw, Mr David Blunkett, Ms Joan Lestor, Mr Gavin Strang, Mrs Ann Taylor.

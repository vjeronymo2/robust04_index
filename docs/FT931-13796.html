			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Champion in telecoms joint venture CHAMPION Technology, the recently-listed telepaging group, has formed a joint venture with the privately-owned Harilela group which will be aimed at the Indian telecommunications market, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. The joint venture has a 47 per cent stake in New Delhi-based Weston Pagers. Weston is in the running for a national paging services licence from the Indian government, which has recently deregulated the telecommunications industry. Champion will supply equipment and technical and operational services to Weston. It will also make pagers in India. No details on shareholdings in the joint venture were provided. The group also said that it had signed agreements with Orbital Sciences of the US to provide low orbit satellite two-way communication services in China. It said that the system was low cost compared with high-orbit satellite systems. The group will be responsible for modifying the system to suit China's market demands, such as developing Chinese language communication services.</p>

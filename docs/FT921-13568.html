			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: Details of New York life insurer's rescue due today THE NEW York Insurance Department is due to set out its plans for Executive Life of New York later today. Speculation that Metropolitan Life will acquire a sizeable block of the life insurer's business is already rife. MetLife, the nation's second largest insurance group, declined to comment ahead of the insurance regulator's formal announcement. Shortly after the insurer was seized by the NY Insurance Department in April, a group of insurance companies, headed by MetLife, stepped forward to help manage the business and advise the department. At that stage, however, no formal offer to buy the operation was made. ELNY was the smaller of two operating units within the Los Angeles-based First Executive group. The larger unit, Executive Life of California, was also seized by regulators after its heavy junk bond exposure prompted a policyholder run. It has since been 'rescued' by a French consortium. ELNY, which has around 103,000 policyholders and certificate-holders, was always thought to be in better shape, and at the outset the insurance department's stated aim was to rehabilitate the business.</p>

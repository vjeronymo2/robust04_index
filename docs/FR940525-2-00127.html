			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed changes to the surveillance requirements for the control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rods at NA&hyph;1&amp;2 are consistent with the intent of GL 93&hyph;05, which is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improve safety, decrease equipment degradation, and reduce unnecessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden on personnel resources by reducing testing requirements that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marginal to safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, operation of North Anna Power Station in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed Technical Specifications changes will not:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to the surveillance frequency for control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rods does not increase the probability of an accident occurrence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Surveillance testing is a means of determining control rod  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operability and does not of itself contribute to control rod  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inoperability. Although reduced testing also implies a less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequent confirmation of mechanical operability, operational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience has established that the reduced testing does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decrease plant safety. Furthermore, reduced frequency testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduces the probability of an inadvertent operational transient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or misaligned control rod. There are other means available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., Individual Rod Position Indicators, flux distributions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anomalies) to detect a misaligned control rod.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reducing the frequency of surveillance testing will decrease the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possibility of finding an inoperable control rod. Industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience has shown that most inoperable (stuck) control rods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are identified during rod drop testing and unit startup after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refueling outages. Therefore, the NRC has determined that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduced frequency surveillance test during power is acceptable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine control rod operability (trippable).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The control rods will continue to be operated in the same manner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the surveillance testing and will be available to shutdown  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the reactor if a Reactor Protection System trip setpoint is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reached. The operability requirements, alignment and insertion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits for the control rods remain unchanged. Since the control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rods remain available (trippable) to perform their intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety function, testing of the control rods at the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduced frequency will not increase the consequences of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed reduced frequency testing of the control rods does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not change the way the Control Rod Drive System or the control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rods are operated. The reduced frequency of testing of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control rods does not alter the operation of the Control Rod  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Drive System or the control rods ability to perform their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended safety function. Therefore, the reduced frequency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing of the control rods does not generate any new accident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precursors. In fact, industry experience has shown that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance testing may result in inadvertent reactor trips,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dropped control rods, or unnecessary challenges to safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of accident than previously evaluated is not created by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed changes in surveillance frequency of the control rods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed reduced frequency testing of the control rods does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not change the control rod operability requirement or the way the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Control Rod Drive System is operated. NUREG&hyph;1366, concluded that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most stuck control rods are discovered during plant startup after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refueling or during control rod drop testing. Therefore, routine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance testing of the control rods at the proposed reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequency is considered adequate to identify inoperable (stuck)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control rods during operation. The reduced surveillance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements do not affect the margin of safety in that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operability requirements remained unchanged and the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety analysis, which assumes the most reactive control rod  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sticks out of the core during accident scenarios, remains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bounding. Therefore, no margins of safety are adversely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involves no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Alderman Library, Special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Collections Department, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22903&hyph;2498.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attorney for licensee:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Michael W.

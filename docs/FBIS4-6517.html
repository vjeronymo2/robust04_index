			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 20 (YONHAP) -- Full-fledged  negotiations are under way with Moscow on bringing to South  Korea those North Koreans who are roaming about Russia after  having escaped from Pyongyang-run logging camps in Siberia, but  the talks may have hit rough going. Repatriation is likely to  occur much later than Seoul first expected, as the task is more  difficult than generally anticipated here.    Chongwadae [presidential office] officials say it will be  difficult to bring the North Korean escapees into the country  before June because the government has yet to obtain correct  information on their whereabouts and personal histories.    This is a far cry from Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's  remarks that some of the loggers could arrive this month as the  government would complete repatriation formalities as soon as  possible. Han made the comments upon his arrival from Russia on  Monday.    But presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said Wednesday, "the  government does not yet know where these North Koreans are now  and what they are like. So it is unlikely that they will get to  Seoul before June, though the government is seeking to bring  them back as soon as possible."    Noting that while negotiations are under way with Russia  about when repatriation should occur, he said no timetable has  been agreed. This indicates that repatriation could take place  later than generally expected, depending on how the talks with  Moscow progress. He made it clear, however, that the United  Nations would not intercede in resettling the North Korea  defector-loggers, saying the issue would be settled only through  negotiations with Moscow.    The Foreign Ministry attributed Chu's remarks about a delay  in repatriating the loggers to the difficulties facing the  Korean Embassy in Moscow as it tackles the issue.    A ministry official said the embassy is having trouble  determining the loggers' exact whereabouts and personal  histories. There have been few reliable reports on them from the  Embassy in Moscow, he added.    Some 90 North Korean loggers have visited the Embassy in  Moscow and other South Korean diplomatic missions in former  Soviet Republics to ask for refuge in South Korea, but it is  difficult to maintain contact with them as they move from one  hideout to another for fear of capture by North Korean agents.    For those granted permanent residence in Russia, it takes  time to confirm whether they want to be repatriated to South  Korea. In particular, those with Russian wives generally do not  wish to come to South Korea. This being the case, working-level  officials from the Foreign Ministry were somewhat surprised when  Minister Han, upon arriving from Russia on Monday, told  reporters the North Korean loggers would come as early as this  month.    The government first sought to repatriate the North Korean  loggers with the help of Russia and the U.N. high commissioner  for refugees, but this policy has changed after Minister Han's  Moscow visit.    The change was prompted by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev's positive stance on the repatriation issue during his  meeting with Han, ministry officials observed.    The Foreign Ministry has instructed the Embassy in Moscow to  repatriate the loggers as soon as possible, raising speculation  that the government is dealing with the issue in light of  political considerations on domestic issues.    Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said the  Russian Government had requested, through Seoul's Embassy in  Moscow, that the South Korean media practice self-restraint in  reporting on the repatriation issue. The government is not  negotiating with Beijing on repatriating North Korean defectors  in China but is focusing on the issue of North Koreans in  Russia, he added.</p>

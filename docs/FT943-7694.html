			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Management: Hold your breath and take a break You've heard about the one-minute manager. How about the 30-second vacation? I'm not kidding. Though no student of Zen Buddhism (my wife, Kate, is), I do engage in the Zennish practice of 'following my breathing'. It might well be classified a near-miracle. Bugged by the direction of a contentious conversation? Trapped in a cab by slow-moving London traffic and already late for a meeting? Follow your breathing, for 30 seconds, a moment, or 10 or 20 minutes. By which I mean tuning into the basic process of breathing; you don't need to intone some esoteric mantra, just slowly, 'breathing in, two, three, four, breathing out, two, three, four'. I know there's more to it and I practise a number of variations. But, in short, it calls a complete halt to whatever silly, overwrought tension is building inside me. Doing it on the highway when I'm behind, say, three or four crawling vehicles, my speed automatically drops by 10 or 20 miles per hour - and my disposition returns to equilibrium, at times approaching passivity (no mean feat, for a classic Type A, argumentative personality, age 51). Although I've never read a single book on meditation, or taken a formal lesson, I was prepared by my relative passion for a special form of exercise  -speedwalking. (Or aerobic walking, powerwalking - all quiet kin of racewalking; my variety is 11 to 12 minutes per mile.) It started in a hotel room in Houston, Texas. Going over a telephone-message list from my office in California, I noted a call from a participant in one of our five-day seminars. 'You're a walking heart attack in the making,' the healthcare executive had said. 'Come to one of our facilities: take a stress test, on me.' (I pictured all sorts of doodads glued to my body, while I raced along a treadmill - with a physician clucking as he watched my ticker pound out of control.) I still haven't taken the complimentary test, but the next morning  -February 11 1989 - I went out for a self-styled 10-minute 'exercise walk'. I flailed away awkwardly. But I haven't stopped since. Although no racewalker (solo is my gig - no exceptions), I've become obsessed. As of this writing, I haven't missed a day in the last 20 months. If the hardish evidence is valid, it's doing good things for my ageing body, perhaps delaying the inevitable a tiny bit. But that's the least of it. It's become a meditation, and a centrepiece to my day. On my farm in Vermont, I usually walk about five miles after I've finished my day's writing; it's a time to unwind, reflect and, sometimes, work on a problem. (I admit I carry a stubby pencil and little blank cards in my pocket - I never break my pace, but I do sometimes record things when I finish.) On the road - in the parking lot outside my Frankfurt-airport hotel, amid the grimy 5am smog of Bangkok - I launch the day with a one to three-mile chug. As you can doubtless tell from this description, I've become a true believer; which amuses me and my close friends - although a second-rate jock in college (lacrosse), I was vociferously anti-exercise until I became a fanatical advocate. Thence the walking led to the breathing. Maybe one of these days I'll emulate Chicago Bulls' basketball coach, Phil Jackson, and become a full-fledged Zen Buddhist. (Yes, Jackson does say that he tried out his Buddhist approach, successfully, on his eminence, Michael 'Air' Jordan). Truth is, relaxing has never come hard for me. I go when I go. I stop when I stop. In fact, and I realise this is unadulterated bias, I hold in contempt my Type A friends whose weekend frenzy matches their workday pace. But I do 'work' on the weekends. That is, I read insatiably, mostly fiction. My purely professional reading, also a passion, rarely includes management books (b-o-r-i-n-g), and tends strongly toward history. Business schools (on both sides of the Atlantic) ignore economic history to their great discredit. James Grant's Money of the Mind: Borrowing and Lending in America from the Civil War to Michael Milken, for example, taught me more about finance than several courses at the highly esteemed Stanford Graduate School of Business. My inability to slug it out on a TV show with US Labour Secretary Bob Reich on industrial policy led to a thrilling four-week summer adventure - reading up on the early days of the industrial revolution in America. If I had to do it all over again, I'd take my degree(s) in economic history or the history of technology. In fact, my reading 'programmes' have become the mainstay of my official summer vacations. About 10 years ago, Kate and I got into the habit of renting a house somewhere (the Dordogne, western Ireland) for three or four weeks. And I got into the habit of getting slightly organised about my reading on these mini-sabbaticals. It has been a pure, unadulterated joy. Whether my breaks last 30 seconds or 30 days, they are of the utmost importance to me. This is the wrong age to go stale. Lucy Kellaway is away.</p>

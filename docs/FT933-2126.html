			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / 9 per cent choose teaching as their first choice of career ONLY 9 per cent of final-year university students made teaching their first choice of career, a survey showed yesterday. The survey, in which 411 students at 22 universities were interviewed by BMRB International for the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, also showed that teaching was least popular among engineering and science graduates. It is government policy to encourage science teaching. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, has said pay claims as high as 14 per cent by teachers' unions were unrealistic because 'students are queueing up to be teachers'. The research, however, suggests that the healthy numbers entering teacher-training are caused by the recession. Of those graduates who made teaching their first choice, only 8 per cent mentioned a high starting salary or high social recognition for teachers' status, and only 3 per cent mentioned high quality resources, support and equipment.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 22 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Today the Russian  Foreign Ministry made a statement, which says:    "On 21 June 1994 the Latvian Republic's Saeima adopted a  citizenship law. In its content, it is an unprecedented legal  act, according to which the overwhelming majority of ethnic  Russians who reside permanently in that country are in fact  deprived of a real possibility of obtaining Latvian citizenship.    The law contains elements of discrimination on ethnic  grounds  and consolidates the principle of quotas for the naturalization  of Latvia's permanent residents that, in general, is to start in  2000. Thus, on the threshold of the 21st century, a state that  claims to be democratic and based of a rule of law, has made yet  another step towards discrimination in law of hundreds of  thousands of residents of the Latvian Republic and formation of  a monoethnic state.    Long before the citizenship law had been adopted, by  depriving "non-indigenous" residents of citizenship, Latvia  started purposeful discrimination against them in the political,  social, economic and other spheres by adopting relevant laws and  statutory instruments. These include the law on elections to  central and local bodies of power, on civil service, on  languages, on election campaigning and so on and amendments to  the laws on entry and foreigners' stay or on the police. These  have seriously worsened the situation of hundreds of thousands  of permanent residents, the majority of whom are ethnic  Russians, and have created a legal basis for introducing  discriminaton on ethnic, language, religious, and other gounds  in Latvia.    Latvia has been persistently ignoring the real situation in  the country, fundamental human rights documents, the views of  international experts, and recommendations by the CSCE high  commissioner for ethnic minorities, the Council of Europe, and  the calls of some neighboring states concerning the rights of  minorities. All this cannot be evaluated otherwise than an open  challenge to democratic and humanistic traditions in today's  Europe and world.    In this situation the absence of an appropriate  international  reaction, let alone the acceptance of the country in the Council  of Europe, would look as a sign of approval of the Latvian  authorities' discriminatory policies and would be tantamount to  the lowering of international and European standards in the  sphere of human rights.    For its part, in accordance with UNGA resolution no. 48/155  "The situation in the sphere of human rights in Latvia and  Estonia" and in connection with the further deterioration of the  situation in the sphere of human rights in the Latvian Republic,  Russia will resolutely strive to ensure that Latvia complies  with the international obligations it has taken upon itself.    In developing relations with Latvia henceforth the Russian  side will take account of the situation that is taking shape in  that country following the adoption of the citizenship law."</p>

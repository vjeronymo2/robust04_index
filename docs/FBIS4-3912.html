			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Shao Ling (6730 7227): </F> "Mainland State-Owned Enterprises Almost Completely Lost Their  Role as Locomotive of the Economy"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 22 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--In the  first quarter of this year, the gross domestic product of the  Chinese mainland increased by 12.7 percent over the same period  last year; in particular, industrial production increased by 16  percent and continued to maintain a high growth rate. There  were some prominent contradictions in industrial operations,  however. For example, growth of state-owned enterprises only  accounted for 6.6 percent of the national industrial production  growth, while 93.4 percent of the growth was made by  non-state-owned enterprises (including collective enterprises in  urban and rural areas, private enterprises, and foreign-funded  enterprises). The state-owned enterprises, which produced 50  percent of the mainland's output value, almost lost their role  as the locomotive of the economy, and this was certainly a major  problem for China's economy.    The declining economic efficiency of state-owned industrial  enterprises was primarily reflected in the facts of declining  profits, increasing losses, the shortage of funds, and the  accumulation of debts. According to official statistics, in the  first two months of this year, 370,000 industrial enterprises at  and above the township level incurred losses totaling 17.6  billion yuan, an increase of 5 percent over that in the same  period of last year, and 40.7 percent of the state-owned  enterprises incurred losses, twice as much as those among  non-state-owned enterprises. Triangular debts that the  enterprises owe the banks and each other exceeded 300 billion  yuan.    There are currently more than 14,000 large state-owned  enterprises in China, and they account for only 3.9 percent of  the total number of industrial enterprises; however, their  assets account for 46 percent of the industry in the mainland,  and the profits they handed over to the state account for  approximately 67 percent. They have always constituted the main  force of the mainland's economy, the backbone of the national  economy, and the primary source of the state's financial  revenue. Therefore, the state-owned enterprises hold a  decisively important position.    At present, however, some 40 percent of the large and medium  state-owned enterprises on the Chinese mainland are running in  the red, and the situation is rather serious. In Liaoning  Province, the country's major heavy industrial base with a large  number of state- owned enterprises, in recent years, nearly half  (46.2 percent) of the state-owned enterprises have been running  in the red, and nearly 700,000 workers could not receive their  wages on time. The situation of Heilongjiang Province, another  major heavy industrial base, was even worse. The large and  medium enterprises in Harbin have failed to pay a total of 1.3  billion yuan of debts that are due, and still owe debts  totalling 6.3 billion yuan. Some enterprises have been mired in  a state of suspended or semi- suspended operation.    In the authorities of the mainland, there are different  opinions on how to carry out reform in those state-owned  enterprises that have lost their vigor. Some people maintain  that financial input to such enterprises should be increased  appropriately in order to support the state's basic industries  and the high and new technology industries; otherwise, some  trouble may occur. Other people maintain that increasing  investment and financial subsidies to enterprises which have  been running in the red for a long time would only be a waste of  resources and would achieve no result in creating new productive  forces; moreover, it would increase the government's financial  deficit and become a major burden on the government. The  problems with the state-owned enterprises, which have not  adopted the market mechanism, cannot be solved by increasing  financial input; instead, the problems must be solved through  enterprise reform and through the establishment of the social  insurance system, the property right transaction system, the  debt settlement system, and the mechanism for keeping the good  and eliminating the bad. Therefore, many experts proposed that  the enterprises running in the red be auctioned through property  rights transactions, that mergers be allowed between enterprises  and individuals within the mainland, and that foreign investors  be allowed to buy and run such enterprises. At the same time,  it is necessary to set up the debt settlement system and the  system for laying off workers and to allow enterprises running  in the red to apply for bankruptcy; thus, the state-owned  enterprises can actually play the role of the locomotive of  industrial production after those that have lost vigor are  eliminated.    It is said that Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is in charge of  the financial and economic work, agreed to adopt measures to  "resurrect" the loss-incurring enterprises and called this  "rising again like a phoenix from the ashes." He said: Going  bankrupt does not mean that the workers will not be taken care  of. In the course of reorganizing the property rights of the  enterprises after bankruptcy, workers will live on social  insurance, and part of the money from the auctions will be used  to help the workers. After the enterprises are reinvigorated,  the banks can also recover the money. Bankruptcy cannot proceed  too quickly, however, because this may cause social unrest. At  least one enterprise may go bankrupt in one county. This  mechanism may be adopted on a trial basis so that all factory  directors will be under pressure and will not dare spend public  money on sightseeing trips. They will have to discharge their  responsibilities as factory directors or they could lose their  jobs!    At the same time, Chen Qingtai, vice minister of the State  Economic and Trade Commission, said that, over a period of three  to five years, the large and medium state-owned enterprises will  be pushed to the market in groups so that they will be tested by  market forces, with the good being kept and the bad being  eliminated. Chen said that 30 percent of the present  state-owned enterprises were vigorous and dynamic in their  operation and would be able to survive in the market, and 20  percent of the enterprises would fail and would have to be  closed down, suspended, merged, shifted to production in other  fields, or leased, contracted, auctioned, or taken over by  foreign investors. The remaining 50 percent of the enterprises  will find a way out only through transforming the operational  mechanism and adjusting the structure.</p>

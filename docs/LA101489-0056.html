			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY SPOT: TAFFY DAYS ARE A SWEET WAY TO ENTERTAIN CHILDREN  </P> <P> Lord and Lady Bacon may not exactly preside over the festive doings in  Puddledumplin at this weekend's fifth annual Theatre Arts Festival for Youth  (TAFFY), but they and about a dozen other strolling, costumed characters will  manage to make their presence known.  </P> <P> Held on the broad lawns and three stages of Peter Strauss Ranch in Agoura,  TAFFY is one of the most ambitious children's theater events in the Southland.  Entertaining during the two-day event will be Peter Alsop, Dan Crow, We Tell  Stories, J. P. Nightingale, Paul Tracey and Schwartz and Chung.  </P> <P> Families may bring their own picnic lunches, set out blankets and enjoy the  entertainment. There also will be fast food (hot dogs, sodas) for sale.  </P> <P> Youngsters can help decorate the 30-foot-long balloon, from Michael Mark's  Inflatable Art, by crawling inside and taking colored markers to the side.  Crafts workshops include puppet making, bead stringing and origami.  </P> <P> Local ethnic arts groups are scheduled for the Marble Stage and include the  Aman Folk Ensemble, Rythyms of the Village and Teatro de los Puppets.  </P> <P> Tickets are $8; children under 3 are free. Peter Strauss Ranch is at 30000  Mulholland Highway. Festival hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. today and Sunday.  Information: (818) 998-8424.  </P></p>

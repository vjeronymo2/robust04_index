This  despicable crime brings to mind other Zionist massacres, like  Dayr Yasin, Kafr Qasim, Qibyah, and al-Samu'. Political  analysts and observers are unified in their position that the  massacre was the natural upshot of unrelenting occupation and  settlement activity. They point out that to discuss peace while  occupation and settlement activity continue is an exercise in  futility and that, if there is to be peace in the region,  occupation must end, settlements must be dismantled and settlers  repatriated.    The savage Zionist massacre was perpetrated in full view of  the Israeli military, who checked the identity of worshipers  before their entry into the mosque. During 10 minutes of heavy  firing at the backs of kneeling worshipers, none of the Israeli  military personnel acted to halt the carnage. With a hail of  fire raining at innocent Arabs from different corners, the  massacre was a systematic act, the scenario of which must have  been mapped out by the higher settlement council. The outrage  was a message to Arabs and the world that racist, expansionist  Zionism and its characteristically blood-thirsty savagery are  still there, and that peace rhetoric is so much lip service.    Zionism and criminality are natural twins. Zionism cannot  possibly be a peaceable movement, since it would thus be at  cross purposes with it own psyche and objectives. Right from  the beginning of the peace process and the Washington talks, the  Arab negotiating teams sought an end to Israeli settlement  activity and Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab territories,  with the Israeli Government consistently offering a negative  response to these basic demands. Indeed, Israel has put up  hundreds of millions of dollars of U.S. loan guarantees to  expand existing settlements, build new outposts, and arm  settlers. The Israeli Government went even further and  introduced joint military-settler patrols. Furthermore, leaders  of the settler community have issued threats to carry out  massacres against Arabs in the occupied territories. It came to  light recently that Zionist settlers have started an armed  organization. Rabbis have been urging Israelis to commit murder  and drive Arabs from their homes. Only a couple of days ago,  the Zionist settlers in the occupied Golan Heights declared  their full confidence in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  for his support and encouragement. They are known to make it a  habit to provoke our people in the Golan and to stage violent  demonstrations in order to send the message that Israel is not  about to vacate the occupied Syrian territories.    All these acts of aggression culminated in the monstrous  crime against the peaceful worshipers. They point to the Rabin  government's involvement in this murderous episode. They prove  beyond a shadow of doubt that any bargain with Israel that does  not provide for the withdrawal of the Israeli military and  settlers from the occupied territory is not worth the ink in  which it is written.    Peace and occupation and settlements are strange bedfellows.  The ABC's of Middle East peace require an Israeli pullout from  all occupied Arab territories and their devolution to their  rightful owners' control. Yesterday's massacre must be directly  or indirectly laid at the door of the Oslo and Cairo agreements  and whatever other pact may follow. Talk about Palestinian  self-rule while Israeli occupation and armed settlements remain  is a waste of time and a stab in the back of the Palestinian  people's struggle. It legitimizes a state of affairs rejected by  U.N. resolutions and whets the appetite of Zionist settlers to  perpetrate further atrocities.    It seems Palestinian negotiators forgot Israel's  crime-ridden  track record, and were too trustful and unsuspecting, thereby  facilitating the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.    Condemnations and denunciations, no matter how strongly  worded, are not good enough. The international community must  shoulder its responsibilities and work toward dislodging the  Israeli occupation and settlers if it cares enough about a just  and universal peace in the Middle East. Throughout two years of  negotiations in Washington, the Arabs never detected an Israeli  willingness to pull out from the occupied territories, cease  settlement activity, or disband settlements. All this, then,  when total Israeli withdrawal is a key requirement for any  progress toward peace. The community of nations and the  sponsors of the peace process will have to immediately intervene  to end Israel's equivocation, instead of pressing for an end of  the Arab boycott of Israel and a blueprint for regional  cooperation incorporating Israel. The UN Security Council,  which convened to consider the grave situation, must state the  need for a total Israeli withdrawal, settlement disbandment, and  restitution of rights and territories.</p>

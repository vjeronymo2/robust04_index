			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Taking Groupe Bull by the horns / Profile of Jean-Marie Descarpentries MR JEAN-MARIE Descarpentries' message to his staff after his appointment yesterday as chairman of Groupe Bull was succinct and brutal: 'There is not a minute to lose and not a franc to waste.' The combination of Mr Descarpentries' appointment and - subject to European Commission approval - a cash injection of FFr7bn (Dollars 1.23bn) is the last throw of the dice for the state-owned computer manufacturer. Bull's position is serious. It is overmanned, its manufacturing costs are too high, its products lack innovation, and its balance sheet has been shaken by FFr15bn of losses in the past three years. Mr Descarpentries knows all this. He was a member of Bull's board between 1986 and 1992, a critical period when customers began to favour computer networks over mainframes and traditional computer companies began to report losses. But is Mr Descarpentries, 57, the man to administer the medicine Bull needs to effect a recovery? Flamboyant, charismatic and didactic, he cuts a different figure from the cool, analytical Mr Francis Lorentz, Bull chairman until 1992 and the man who devised the basis of the company's recovery strategy. He is also distinct from his immediate predecessor, the affable but determined Mr Bernard Pache. Mr Descarpentries has a fondness for management philosophies that seem to go down better in the Gallic than the Anglo-Saxon business world. He divides managers into chevaliers (warriors with swords), and Benedictines (withdrawn sceptics). In one of his best known initiatives, 29 senior executives from the packaging company CarnaudMetalbox, whose formation he had overseen, were taken, clad in green jogging suits, into the Jordanian desert for a brainstorming and bonding session. Such bizarre events detract from the evident respect colleagues have for his business sense. Mr Pierre Bonelli, chief executive of the Anglo-French computing services company, Sema Group, and a close friend of Mr Descarpentries, believes he will be good for Bull. 'He is a good leader. His chief strength is in operations and that is what Bull needs most at present,' he said. 'Being owned by the government does not make it any easier for Bull to solve its problems. I think the appointment of Jean-Marie is a clear signal that this is going to change. I think he will have more freedom than any Bull manager has had in the past. I hope so - for Bull and for him]' Others, while paying tribute to Mr Descarpentries' strength of purpose, warn of apparent character flaws. One British manager who has worked closely with him said: 'He can touch the high spots, but he can fall from grace. He is not all that sensitive in personal relationships and often does not get the best out of people. 'There are contradictions in his personality. One of his strengths is his ability to to manage cost. He has a clear view of what must be done and if he has to get rid of people then he gets rid of people'. A graduate of the prestigious Ecole Polytechnique, he began his career at Shell, where he held various engineering and technical posts before becoming commercial director of the petrochemical division. Between 1969 and 1976, he worked at McKinsey, the management consultancy. He is best known, however, for his work at Carnaud, the French packaging group, where he was managing director between 1981 and 1991. There he oversaw the merger in 1991 with Metal Box of the UK to create CarnaudMetalbox, one of the world's largest packaging groups. Although the merger was hailed at the time as a model of international co-operation, it quickly encountered problems. Profits fell sharply, and the following year he was quickly replaced by Mr Jugen Hintz, the current chairman. Observers say he has already declined the Bull chairmanship once - at the time of Mr Pache's appointment in 1992. Mr Descarpentries new role reflects the French government's impatience with Mr Pache's efforts to restore Bull to profitability. Since taking office with the centre-right government in March, Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, has repeatedly demanded strong measures to stem the company's losses. The fact that Mr Descarpentries comes from the private sector is also significant. Heads of French public sector companies are usually drawn from the ranks of senior bureaucrats. 'Since its nationalisation in 1982, Bull has been too dependent on the state,' said Mr Longuet. He described Bull's new chairman as 'a man of industry', citing his record of a tenfold increase in sales during his tenure at CarnaudMetalbox. Bull should now take its management decisions only on the basis of the market, said Mr Longuet.</p>

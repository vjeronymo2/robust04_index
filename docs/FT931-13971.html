			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Clinton pledges era of renewal PRESIDENT William Jefferson Clinton yesterday summoned his country to join him in 'a new season of American renewal'. Sworn in as 42nd president at noon on a brilliant sunny day before tens of thousands of the highest and lowest of his fellow citizens, the 46-year-old former governor of Arkansas promised in a 14-minute inaugural address 'that the era of deadlock and drift is over'. 'There is,' he proclaimed, 'nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America'. But 'it will not be easy, it will require sacrifice', he said, echoing themes so frequently invoked in his long run for the presidency. He admonished Washington ('this beautiful capital') for being consumed by 'who is in and who is out, who is up and who is down'. Americans 'deserve better and in this city there are people who want to do better. Let us resolve to reform our politics so that power and privilege no longer shout down the voice of the people'. It was an address aimed at his domestic audience, as is customary, but he pledged to meet all external challenges because 'there is no clear division today between what is foreign and what is domestic - the world economy, the world environment, the world Aids crisis, the world arms race affect us all'. He said that 'together with our friends and allies, we will work to shape change, lest it engulfs us all'. But, 'when our vital interests are challenged or the will and conscience of the international community defied, we will act - with peaceful diplomacy when possible, with force when necessary'. As is also traditional, the new president thanked his predecessor, 'for his half century of service to America'. Mr George Bush, who had met the Clintons in the White House and escorted them to the Capitol, rose and acknowledged the applause, which also broke out several times in the middle of the address when Mr Clinton hit a rhythmic stride as he spoke of his 'new season of renewal'. If the speech lacked memorable lines, its message was clear. It was also brief - as is not always Mr Clinton's wont. His aides said only George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, no mean role models, had given shorter inaugural addresses. But mostly this was a day of pageantry, given an especially Clintonian flavour. He began it not by jogging but by attending a service at the African Methodist Episcopal church, marked by glorious gospel singing. His touch was evident in the ceremonies themselves, with Marilyn Horne from the Metropolitan Opera singing a medley of traditional songs and Maya Angelou reading a powerful poem, 'On The Pulse Of The Morning', specially composed for the occasion. He took his oath from the Supreme Court's chief justice, Mr William Rehnquist, with his left hand on a bible given to him by his grandmother, open at the passage from St Paul's epistle to the Galatians, which concludes: 'He that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap everlasting life'. In the afternoon, hand in hand with his wife Hillary, the new president walked the last few hundred yards to a reviewing stand outside the White House to watch the vast inaugural parade. When it was all over, he took Mr Bush to a helicopter to begin his journey back to Texas and a new life as a private citizen. The world outside, including Iraq, did not intrude on the day. Yesterday, the Senate confirmed in their appointments the new secretaries of state, treasury and defence - Mr Warren Christopher, Mr Lloyd Bentsen and Mr Les Aspin respectively. Business as usual resumes today. Text of speech, Page 3 Editorial Comment, Page 19 Observer, Page 19</p>

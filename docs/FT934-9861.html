			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Warehouse club status limited WAREHOUSE shopping clubs will be given planning permission only as retailers, Mr Tony Baldry, environment minister, insisted yesterday. This is in spite of a High Court judgment last month that a local authority was right to treat the UK's first such club as a wholesaler. Mr Baldry also said the government was committed to encouraging retail investment in town centres, and that the age of giant out-of-town shopping centres was over. He was speaking at the launch of a report on the Merry Hill retail park near Dudley, West Midlands, which found the centre had 'severely affected' the vitality and viability of two town centres and harmed five other towns. Mr Baldry sought to end confusion over how councils should assess warehouse clubs - which sell goods at low prices to fee-paying members  - after the High Court ruled that Thurrock Borough Council in Essex was justified in considering US company Costco as a wholesaler when Costco made a warehouse club application. He said the government's planning policy guidance, PPG6, issued after Costco was first given consent, made it clear that clubs should be treated as retailers. 'Let there be no shadow of a scintilla of doubt that no warehouse club will ever be able to get planning permission in the future except as a retailer,' he said. Planning applications contravening guidelines would be called in by the Department of the Environment. Mr Baldry said PPG6's main aim was to swing the pendulum in retail development away from out-of-town and back towards city-centre sites. 'We expect people to look first at town centres. If they can't find a town centre location, we would expect them to look at edge-of-town. Only if all that fails would we expect people to look at out-of-town locations.' He said yesterday's report on Merry Hill provided a 'clear indication' of the impact of out-of-town shopping centres. It found Dudley town centre's share of the region's retail market had dropped to one-third of its level when Merry Hill was completed in 1989, leading to the departure of large retail chains, an increase in vacancies, and a fall in rents. The centre also caused a 'marked reduction' in the quality of retailing at nearby Stourbridge. Merry Hill Impact Study. HMSO, PO Box 276, London SW8 5DT. 071-873 9090. Pounds 15.</p>

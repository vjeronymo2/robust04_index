			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: ABF in talks for sale of retail side Associated British Foods yesterday confirmed that it was in talks about the possible sale of its retail outlets to Greggs, the chain of bakers. AB Foods said a further announcement would be made 'within the next four weeks'. Meanwhile no other details would be released. One analyst said the sale could raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m for AB Foods, but it was hard to estimate as there was little information about the portfolio of shops. While the deal would be a small one for AB Foods, it could double the size of Greggs. AB Foods shares rose 6p yesterday to 583p, after a 18p rise on Tuesday when the deal was widely rumoured. Greggs were unchanged at 743p. Greggs, which is based in Newcastle upon Tyne, has 500 shops, while AB Foods' chain totals 495 shops, mostly trading under the Baker's Oven name and concentrated in the south-east.</p>

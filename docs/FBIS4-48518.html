			<p>BFN     [Text] The Conservative Party's [CP] Executive Committee  has decided that the party will continue promoting the ideal of  a free Afrikaner nation with new zeal and enthusiasm.    CP leader Ferdi Hartzenberg said the CP remains convinced  that a nation's right to self-determination can only be realized  in a sovereign volkstaat [homeland]. No freedom of nations is  possible within a unitary state.    The Afrikaner National Front [AVF] has also decided to  recommit itself to the attainment of a sovereign Christian  Boer/Afrikaner republic.    Dr. Hartzenberg, also leader of the AVF, said the AVF was  appealing to all Boer/Afrikaners to join them, and in so doing  become involved in the realization of a volkstaat.    Dr. Hartzenberg has no doubts whatsoever that the majority  of  Afrikaners are in favor of a volkstaat and self-determination.  This support, however, was not reflected in the outcome of the  election because the majority of CP supporters did not vote.    He said in a statement: "We are happy we did not take part  in the election, because now we can say that we did not become  part of the fiasco surrounding the election, nor did we commit  ourselves to abandoning in any way the Afrikaner people's claim  to freedom."    According to him, the election was definitely not free and  fair. There were blatant irregularities, and under a new  government the country is heading for an administrative disaster.    "The CP will not become irrelevant by not participating in  the country's new parliamentary politics. We will still voice  our protests loudly and clearly against any measure by the  government which will be detrimental to the country's future.  The CP was created then to bring about freedom and  self-determination for the Afrikaner people. This task has only  just begun."    The CP's biggest task is to bring about complete unity among  Afrikaners and to promote relations with other peace-loving  peoples in order to gain more bargaining power.    The CP will remain a fully fledged political party which  will  act outside Parliament in every sphere of life as a fighter for  the rights of its supporters.    "I am not in anyway sorry that the CP did not participate in  the election. Today the whole world knows that the CP was not  part of the election. Nobody would have known about our claims  to self-determination had we been part of the new system. We  could not have achieved anything inside Parliament as we would  have been outvoted. Outside the new parliament we can do exactly  the same as we did in the old parliament."    Dr. Hartzenberg said the CP is to introduce a political  strategy which will lead to the self-determination of the  Afrikaner nation. There will again be a transitional process in  the country -- from a communist controlled unitary state to real  freedom. The CP will then be in the forefront.</p>

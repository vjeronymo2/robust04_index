			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Phantom Phallout: That $74,500 total for three pairs of tickets sold at auction  to Michael Crawford's final Sunday matinee of "The Phantom of the Opera," had  shrunk by noon Thursday, when some of the high bidders in Wednesday's KABC  Channel 7's "A.M. Los Angeles" auction -- notably the second runner-up, at  $26,000 -- had second thoughts and went phfffffft.  </P> <P> The top bidder's check for $27,500 and the next highest for $21,000 were in by  the deadline. The third runner-up came in at $7,500. Proceeds are destined for  a pair of charities: Para Los Ninos and Equity Fights AIDS. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

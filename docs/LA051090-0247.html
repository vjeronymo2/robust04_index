			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> MEMORIAL DESIGNER BACK AT YALE  </P> <P> Architect Maya Ying Lin, who designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in  Washington, D.C., when she was a Yale student, has returned to her alma mater  to mark the arrival of women undergraduates 20 years ago.  </P> <P> Yale has commissioned Lin to design a sculpture to celebrate new generations of  Yale women on campus, culminating a yearlong observance of the 20th  anniversary.  </P> <P> The monument "is more about the future than commemorating the past," Lin said  this week, and likely will include places where "people can sit and enjoy  themselves." She would not discuss possible designs.  </P> <P> In 1981 as a senior, Lin's design was chosen from 1,420 entries for the Vietnam  memorial, a black granite work inscribed with the names of 58,000 Americans  killed or missing. It is the most visited monument in Washington.  </P> <P> Lin also designed a monument to those slain during the civil rights movement.  The work was dedicated in Montgomery, Ala., in November.  </P></p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Travel: The six-dollar sunrise - Nicholas Woodsworth stays near the Nile in a sauce-stained hotel with a wonky lavatory but brilliant views 6am. The Abu Simbel Hotel is not a luxury establishment. In high season you take what you can get when you fly into Aswan in the middle of the night without a reservation. My bed sags. I cannot sit on the toilet without banging my knees into the sink. Outside my room a morose floor attendant sits in a ragged turban and long robe like a mummy propped in a chair. The lift is operated by touching two bare wires together. In the dimly-lit, sauce-stained dining room downstairs, ancient and cadaverous waiters stagger about like the cast from Night of the Living Dead. What can you expect for Dollars 6 a night? What you do not expect is a room with a view worth a million dollars. I had never believed in the phrase 'breath-taking' until I pulled back my curtains a minute ago. Suddenly, the room was filled with scintillating light. The view was a vision of luminous clarity. In the delta far to the north, Mediterranean winter storms are battering Alexandria, and Cairo is wet and grey. But here on the Upper Nile the air is different. Bathed in early morning sunlight, Africa is startlingly close and beautiful. Outside my window the Nile flows blue and silver-stippled through the desert, past the smooth granite outcrops and boulders of the First Cataract, past the mud-brick villages and date groves on Elephantine Island, and on round a wide, slow bend in the river. On the other side, yellow sand-dunes rise steeply out of the water. At their foot, above a fringe of feathery palms, sits the domed stone mausoleum of the Aga Khan; 500 ft higher, a row of dark entrances dug into sand and rock mark the Tombs of the Nobles. Below, on the riverside corniche, I can see life stirring. Horse-drawn caleches, all brass and polished leather, jingle down the road toward the five-star hotels. With a little horn-honking, the first cars and buses are warming up for another day's insane driving. Goats are browsing on grass and cigarette packets on a traffic island in the road. A cook emerges on the rear deck of a moored cruise boat and dumps a bucketful of papaya skins onto the bank. Already, advance units of the Corniche's army of touts and hawkers are on the march along its granite-tiled promenade. They are determined, irrepressible, skilled in the arts of the sidewalk ambuscade. 'You want guide?' 'You want felucca?' 'You want to see my shop?' This is just the beginning of a long day's skirmishing. 11.30am. All morning I have been tramping about Elephantine Island, the largest of the islands that sit in the Nile at Aswan. It is long and narrow, and houses not only the remains of a temple complex devoted to the ram-headed god Khnum, but two Nubian villages. I like the lush fields that surround the villages. Water splashes noisily through winding irrigation ditches, pannier-laden donkeys sleep under shady fig trees, and dark-skinned peasants in bright blue djellabas - the long cotton robe of Egypt  - swing mattocks in mud-walled vegetable fields. But the villages themselves I could do without. They have suffered an annual winter invasion ever since Thomas Cook opened Upper Egypt to tourism a century ago, and it shows. 'Hello Bicpen]' shout little boys as they rush from blue-and-yellow-painted mud-brick houses to greet visitors. 'Hello Bonbon]' scream little girls as they trip over fat-tailed sheep in a rush to reach you first. 'Hello Baby Baksheesh]' yell mothers draped from head to toe in black bombazine. Panicking, I have sought refuge in the garden that sits between the Aswan museum and the Khnum temple. It is a place of delightful calm. It is not nearly as large, ambitious or elegant as the botanical gardens established by General Kitchener during the Khartoum campaign - they are on the neighbouring island bearing his name. Rather, this is a rambling garden of straying vines and creepers, ancient Egyptian statues carelessly concealed in the undergrowth, and brilliant displays of flowers. My companions here are Mohammed and Ouedah, Egyptian equivalents of Bill and Ben the Flowerpot Men. They are in their 70s, they think, and have worked in the garden most of their lives. Mohammed is the chief gardener and Ouedah his assistant, although their polite manners, white turbans, grey moustaches and broken plastic shoes are so similar it is hard to tell who assists whom. Mohammed introduced himself with the gift of a fragrant sprig of basil. Now, ladders and pruning hooks forgotten, we are sitting under a bower of flowering jasmine, smoking a water pipe, drinking glasses of sweet tea, and deliberating on the foreign policy of 'Egeorge Ebush.' Mohammed approves, Ouedah does not. I am more interested in a drum-beating, hand-clapping Nubian wedding party that is skirting the island in a felucca, the graceful miniature dhow of the Nile. 5pm. More hard slogging this afternoon, this time through the jammed bazaar. Camel caravans of slaves and gold may have disappeared, but this remains one of of the noisiest, most colourful, odorous and crowded market streets on the continent. Here you can find glib young polyglot Egyptians in wrap-around sun-glasses selling tourists anything from stuffed baby crocodiles to bottles of bogus Chanel perfume. But on the whole this remains the genuine thing, a Nubian market used by local people for everyday purchases. Under shady awnings that overhang the street there are oranges, lemons and tangerines sitting in tall, geometrically perfect pyramids. There are shops that specialise solely in dates; in one I counted 18 varieties. There are piles of bright red peppers and shiny purple eggplants; stacked baskets of green lentils, yellow corn and tawny millet rising tier upon tier; melon and pumpkin seeds for chewing and spitting; cages of fat pigeons and barrows of tripe; blocks of rock salt, rows of hookahs, bales of cloth. The riotous profusion runs even to smells - odours of coffee, incense, drains, sweet tobacco, dried fish, sugar cane and a score of spices all blending in happy confusion. Everything meets and mingles in this market - even races. The man sitting cross-legged on his vegetable barrow is an inky black colour. The ragamuffin on the shafts of a donkey cart is bricky red. The woman hawking brassware is a pale, eggshell brown. Aswan may no longer be the major trading crossroads between Arab and black Africa that it once was, but its legacy lives in its genes. 7pm. I am taking my revenge on the shoddiness of the Abu Simbel and drinking a gin-and-tonic on the riverside terrace of the Old Cataract Hotel. It is quite possibly the most beautiful place in the world to watch the sun go down. Long after it has sunk below the horizon, feluccas continue to glide and swirl on the river below like swallows on a twilight hunt. 10.30pm. A cold wind is blowing in from the Libyan desert, and it is as chilly now as it was at dawn. But the people of Aswan, swathed in heavy turbans and thick cotton gowns, are as hardy as they are sociable. At the outdoor cafes on the square by the railway station, business is booming. Water pipes are bubbling, tea steams from glasses, and from every table comes endless chatter and the rattle of dominoes and dice. I have eaten two stuffed pigeons, been beaten three times at backgammon, and am going to bed. There are no rooms free elsewhere, so it is back to saggy beds, dodgy lifts and zombie waiters. But I do not mind. With an Upper Nile sunrise only hours away and just outside the window, how could I?

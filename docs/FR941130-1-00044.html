			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would allow MSHA to more effectively determine whether products are, in fact, being manufactured as approved. MSHA, not the manufacturer, would select the product and MSHA also would continue to obtain approved products from sources other than the manufacturer. This approach is particularly useful for products that are ``one of a kind'' or of limited distribution. Because these products are not readily found at mine suppliers or distributors, they would be difficult to locate without the assistance of the approval holder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining which approved products would be subject to audit at any particular time, MSHA would consider a variety of factors such as whether the manufacturer has previously produced the approved product or similar products, whether the approved product is new or part of a new product line, or whether the approved product is intended for a unique application or limited distribution. Other considerations may include product complexity, the manufacturer's previous product audit results, product population in the mining community, and the time since the last audit or since the product was first approved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on MSHA's experience, the Agency anticipates few instances in which it would request at no cost more than one approved product from any one manufacturer in any one year. There are circumstances or causes, however, under which additional products for audit may be necessary to ascertain compliance with the technical requirements upon which an approval was based. Examples of such circumstances include verified complaints about the safety of an approval product, evidence of product changes that have not been approved, audit test results that warrant further testing to determine compliance, and evaluation of corrective action taken by an approval holder. Under these circumstances, the approval holder would have to provide, at no cost to MSHA, additional approved products so the Agency could ensure that the approval holder is meeting the obligation to manufacture the product as approved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When discrepancies are found during MSHA audits of approved products, MSHA would require that the manufacturer take all necessary corrective actions. These actions could include, but are not limited to, the approval holder's recalling or retrofitting the approved product involved and issuing user notices. Revocation of the approval by MSHA could result when discrepancies in approved products are not successfully corrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;6.10(h) would require all proposed changes to approved products to be submitted to MSHA for an extension of approval prior to implementation of the change to ensure that product changes do not result in hazardous conditions or violations of MSHA requirements when approved products are used underground. It is important that MSHA be aware of and approve any changes to the approved product that may impact on the approval requirements. Such changes would be tested and evaluated, as necessary, to determine compliance with MSHA approval requirements. In keeping with the philosophy and intent of this proposed regulation, testing and evaluation of changes to approved products would be carried out by an NRTL specifically recognized by OSHA to perform the necessary tests and evaluations for MSHA product approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;6.10(i) would establish the bases and procedures for revocation of NRTL recognition. The Assistant Secretary for OSHA has the authority to revoke for cause the recognition of any NRTL accredited under OSHA's NRTL program, and this would include the authority to revoke the recognition of an NRTL accredited to perform testing and evaluation to MSHA approval requirements. Under the proposal, action to revoke recognition of an NRTL to perform MSHA testing and evaluation would be taken if the NRTL: (1) Has failed to continue to substantially satisfy the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.7 or Appendix A to 1910.7; (2) has failed to reasonably perform the NRTL testing requirements encompassed within its letter of recognition; (3) has materially misrepresented itself in its applications or misrepresented the scope or conditions of its recognition; or (4) has failed to comply with the requirements set forth in this proposed rule for recognition as an NRTL to perform testing and evaluation to MSHA approval requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

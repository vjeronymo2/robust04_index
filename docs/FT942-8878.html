			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Ciga shares up as rights auction is completed Shares in Ciga, the Italian luxury hotel chain, yesterday rose nearly 7 per cent to L1,188 from L1,112 as it became clear the group had successfully auctioned the outstanding rights to its shares. The auction and the preceding L1,000-a-share rights issue were supposed to fail, delivering a majority of shares to Ciga's creditor banks and then to ITT Sheraton of the US, which had offered L740 a share for the company. Instead, Ciga said yesterday the auction and rights issue had raised L1,003bn (Dollars 593m). Since the rights issue was launched on March 17, Ciga's shares have consistently traded at well above the issue price. ITT Sheraton's threat to withdraw from the bidding at the end of last month failed to dent investors' enthusiasm. The company is likely to try to strike a separate deal with the banks to write off part of its L954bn of short-term debt. The funds raised will be used to repay the most of the outstanding overdraft and take care of day-to-day operations. Several investors are now thought to hold small speculative stakes. They will have to declare any holdings above 2 per cent within 30 days. Fimpar, the Aga Khan's holding company, which used to control Ciga, has reduced its stake to less than 3 per cent by renouncing its rights.</p>

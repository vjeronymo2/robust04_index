			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Venezuela ruling party picks black to run for president VENEZUELA'S ruling Democratic Action (AD) party has chosen a black ex-mayor as its presidential candidate in national elections scheduled for December this year. Mr Claudio Fermin, 43, easily beat three other candidates in Sunday's primary. Although known as a populist, Mr Fermin has not had time to put together a comprehensive political programme. After winning the primary he said he would not change any national policies producing positive results. The Social Christian party, second largest after the AD, is due to vote for a presidential candidate on April 25. Former president Mr Rafael Caldera and Mr Andres Velasquez, a leftist state governor, are the principal candidates. Despite inroads by other parties, AD and the Social Christians dominated state and local elections last December. AD has won five of the seven presidential elections held since the last military dictator was ousted in 1958. This year, however, the ruling party is facing serious challenges as voters grow disenchanted with the traditional political leaders. Military rebels tried twice last year to overthrow the government. AD is viewed as corrupt and inefficient and is blamed for the tough economic reforms that President Carlos Andres Perez, a founder of the party, began implementing in 1989. Mr Fermin is the first black to run for president in Venezuela. He has degrees in sociology and law and has spent his life working as an official in the AD. In 1989 he was elected mayor of west Caracas, Venezuela's largest municipality.</p>

Meanwhile, more than 300 fighter-bombers, assault planes,  observation planes, helicopter gunships and reconnaissance  planes belonging to the U.S. Air Force based in South Korea and  the puppet air force staged an exercise in the air above  Yongwol, Chungju, Yoju and Oeyon islet on the same day for the  purpose of bombing, support for ground units and aerial warfare.    Synchronizing with the exercise, RC-135, RV-1, RC-12 and  other tactical reconnaissance planes flew on the mission of  aerial photographing and electronic espionage on the coastline,  the forward and inland areas of the North.    The warplanes mobilized in the aerial exercises and  espionage  on the 17th totalled more than 600.    The U.S. imperialists' belligerent moves are getting more  wanton with each passing day, screwing up the tension to a  higher pitch on the Korean peninsula.</p>

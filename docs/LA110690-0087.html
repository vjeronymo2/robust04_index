			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRANDT IN IRAQ ON HOSTAGES MISSION  </P> <P> Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt arrived in this capital Monday night  on a personal mission to win the release of hundreds of Iraqi-held hostages.  </P> <P> Brandt traveled in a chartered Lufthansa Airbus that can carry about 250  people, bearing flowers and letters from relatives of the estimated 400 German  hostages.  </P> <P> Also on board were four aides and two tons of medicine for Iraq donated by  German companies.  </P> <P> The British, Belgian and Dutch governments have criticized the journey, and  Brandt has been unable to stir up much support outside Germany for the trip.  </P> <P> The German government said it backs the journey even though the 12-nation  European Community last week stated there should be no negotiations with  Baghdad on hostages.  </P> <P> The Netherlands has asked Italy to call an EC foreign ministers' meeting out of  concern that missions such as Brandt's undermine Western resolve against Iraq.  </P> <P> Brandt, honorary head of the opposition Social Democrats in Germany and a Nobel  Peace Prize winner, says his trip is a private mission and that he is not going  to Baghdad as a representative of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Away From Middle Policy"] </F>   [Text] When this year's Folketing elections arrive, for  once people will have a choice between two clear alternatives,  each of which will lead us away from the political middle,  either in the Social Democratic direction or the nonsocialist  direction. This is an interesting development and it will be the  beginning of an era in which the traditional consensus, with  compromises with the middle parties, will be replaced by more  ideologically flavored solutions. The broad majorities will no  longer decide. On the other hand, legislation will be more  temporary and what is approved by one Folketing may be thrown  out by the next, even if it is a matter of far-reaching reforms.    Thus, Danes must get used to the idea that political reality  can change faster than fickle spring weather.    The Social Democratic grouping includes the four present  coalition parties. There has not yet been any clear indication  as to whether these four parties will enter the election  campaign as a unit, but since all four parties are expressing  enthusiasm over their performance this past year, they must  believe that the voters will reward them with a mandate for  another four years in power. Continued cooperation among the  coalition parties with support from SF [Socialist People's  Party] seems to be Poul Nyrup Rasmussen's only chance to remain  as the government's leader. And he is willing to go a long way,  an extremely long way, to retain the title of prime minister.  However, he will experience the same kind of schism that Poul  Schluter faced as the head of his government: Entering the  elections with the idea of continued coalition government means  that governmental cooperation must be placed before party  egotism. That is something that burned the Conservatives and it  will be no different for the Social Democrats that, as the party  that sets the tone, must demonstrate its good will by giving the  small coalition parties preferential treatment and by stressing  the government in its entirety rather than the party's own  virtues.    Despite the possible problems, Rasmussen has no real  alternative to acting as a unifying force, even to the detriment  of his own party. Both the Radical Liberals and the Democratic  Center, each in its own way, have announced their desire and  willingness to continue under Rasmussen's leadership, even  though the polls do not give the coalition much chance to  survive beyond Christmas. Typically, it is more difficult to get  a statement out of the Christian People's Party, but it is  probable that the Christian People's Party, too, is geared  toward continuing in the coalition with the Social Democrats,  assuming that the party receives the minimum percentage required  for representation in Folketing. This is every bit as true for  the Democratic Center. Paradoxically, it is the small middle  parties, which traditionally favor the broadest possible  cooperation, that are now forcing the creation of political  blocs. Not only have these parties used a simple majority to  reform tax and labor market policy, but now they are actually  warning the nonsocialist opposition of the calamities that would  befall the nation if they, in a similar manner, would utilize a  fragile majority that would include the Progress Party.    This is hypocrisy with a vengeance. The government itself  set  the tone, so it does no good to become angry if others play the  same tune. The opposition, too, has no common foundation on  which to form a government. It will probably present an  alternative budget in August, but even now there are clear  differences. The Liberals have presented an extensive tax plan  and now the Conservatives have come out with an economic  package, the essence of which is a strong investment in  education and research and tax changes that are clearly aimed at  creating growth in the private sector.    The fact that each party has its own plan could create the  impression that the opposition is split. But there is nothing  wrong with independent parties having their own independent  plans and independent programs. But there should be no doubt  that the Liberals and the Conservatives can and will work  together when the parliamentary prerequisites are in place. For  decades Danish politics have been characterized by nonsocialist  majorities that, due to a lack of willingness to cooperate,  turned the power over to the Social Democrats. The last decade  has shown that nonsocialist Denmark is capable of offering an  alternative, even though some of the legislation from the last  10 years of governments looks more like the art of the possible  rather than nonsocialist ideology.    This noon when the government holds its news conference  after  two days of strategy meetings at Toruplund in North Zealand, it  would be nice to hear whether the government plans to face the  voters as the four musketeers with a self-imposed common destiny  or if they choose to operate with a hidden agenda until all the  votes are counted.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Letter: Prudential under a spotlight Sir, What has happened to the Prudential? After the estate agency debacle, the directors appear to be paid more, and for the first time in 50 years the reversionary bonus is cut by 8 per cent Meanwhile, an expensive TV publicity programme is a constant reminder of my very high uncompetitive 14.6 per cent house purchase loan. I can get no response from the local office on whether I can repay my loan or expect a reduction in interest rate. I do, however, receive a renewal schedule of my Prudential household insurance, up 29 per cent to Pounds 767. When I obtain a competitive quotation this premium is reduced to Pounds 326. My impression is that this new premium scale is for new customers and only for those existing customers, in my case of 30 years, who complain. Which company do you think I will advise my children to avoid? Robyn Grant, Old Smith, Wisborough Green, West Sussex RH 14 0EU</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (6): Pro-Peking lobby - Angus Foster highlights the two main political groupings GROUPS united by their conservatism, broad pro-China views and determination to undermine the liberals may form an informal alliance to contest the September elections. The alliance includes the pro-business Liberal Democratic Federation, the leftist Federation of Trade Unions and traditional rural interests represented by the Heung Yee Kuk. The grouping has the blessing of China and will claim it can influence China's policies towards Hong Kong. The grouping is committed to maintaining Hong Kong's stability, a by-word for conservative economic management and minimal democratisation. But underlying differences, for example on labour policy, prevent the groups co-operating too closely. In some constituencies they could work well together, for example in the working class areas of Kowloon. But in others they will compete and, in others still, their combined influence is weak. The Liberal Democratic Federation grew from the conservative 'Group of 89' business lobby, formed to protect business interests when Hong Kong's Basic Law was being drafted. The Liberal Democrats now have over 200 members, are well-funded and are have the backing of top business tycoons including, it is believed, Mr Li Ka-shing. The party will field candidates for between five and eight seats. It has the support of several Hong Kong political heavyweights, including legislative councillor Maria Tam, a vice chairman and possible election candidate, and prominent businessman Vincent Lo. However, other leading businessmen who were expected to join such as Stephen Cheong and Allen Lee, both senior legislative councillors, have so far preferred to retain their independence rather than be linked to a party. Despite the advantages of funding and well known leaders, the Liberal Democrats are poorly organised. They are more used to the politics of patronage and privilege, they enjoy scarce media access and command little grass roots support or experience. The pro-Peking Federation of Trades Unions (FTU) is well organised and claims a membership of 170,000 people. But membership is split across constituencies. Outside urban areas like Kowloon the FTU will have to seek other supporters, according to Mr Tam Yiu-chung, FTU member and legislative councillor. The FTU will field two or three candidates, one of which is likely to be prominent unionist Mr Cheng Kai-nam. In what will be one of the most high profile races, he intends to stand against Mr Martin Lee in Island East. The Heung Yee Kuk, representing rural interests from Hong Kong's New Territories, could also play an important role in the elections. The Kuk has traditionally shunned politics. But, fearing its influence is waning, it has helped set up the 120-strong Federation for the Stability of Hong Kong. Lau Wong-fat, chairman of the Kuk, says the new organisation could evolve into a political party 'at some stage.' The Kuk claims to represent 500,000 people who look to it for guidance. But as more people have moved into the New Territories from the urban areas, it is not known how much support the Kuk can still mobilise.</p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW BOOKS: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> THE MISSIONS OF CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> BY STANLEY YOUNG  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPHY BY MELBA LEVICK (Chronicle Books; 1988)  </P> <P> THE MOST ENDURING and pervasive architectural tradition of California,  particularly Southern California, is the Hispanic, its roots having started  about 200 years ago in the mission churches that marked the region's  settlement. Fashioned by untrained priests and built by unskilled laborers, the  missions combine the classical and churrigueresque-styled ecclesiastical  designs of an idealized Mexican and Spanish motherland, albeit in available  materials. Capturing the idealized spirit of the 21 missions built between 1770  and 1850 is this attractively designed guide, with light histories of each by  Stanley Young, and resplendent, studied color photographs by Melba Levick.  There also is a brief foreword, by architectural historian Sally B. Woodbridge,  that touches upon the romantic image and influence of the missions. ($14.95)  Sam Hall Kaplan  </P></p>

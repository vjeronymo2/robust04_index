			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / The mathematics of a Brazilian impeachment MOVES to impeach President Fernando Collor of Brazil, which are expected to gather pace next week with the publication of the results of an investigation into government corruption, will take the country's politics into a legal and constitutional minefield. Impeachment is a maze of parliamentary and legal procedures, involving both chambers of Congress, the national prosecutor's office and the supreme court. During the final stages of the impeachment process the president would be suspended from office for 180 days while the Chamber of Deputies analyses, debates and votes on the charges. A two-thirds majority of the 503-member lower house would be enough to send to the supreme court a recommendation for conviction. The court would make the final determination on removal from office. The main cause for confusion is that the relevant part of the 1988 constitution has not yet been ratified, leading some lawyers to argue that the process should be governed by a 1950 law. Mr Collor is expected to use this uncertainty to make a series of legal challenges. The congressional investigating commission has put back publication of the report from tomorrow to Monday. This was because commission members needed extra time to review the sums of money alleged to have originated from Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, Mr Collor's election campaign treasurer and main subject of the inquiry, and which were deposited in the bank account of the president's personal secretary. That money, apparently overestimated in a first tally, is alleged to have beeen used to pay the president's personal expenses. The committee meeting to approve the report formally is still scheduled for Wednesday. It is still uncertain whether the report will mention Mr Collor by name and, if it does, whether he will be accused of any crimes. The president's legal team sent briefs to members of Congress arguing that he could not be incriminated by the document. Lawyers with the commission have publicly stated that the inquiry has uncovered enough evidence for five counts of presidential corruption. The opposition hopes to avoid a long procedural battle by creating a political environment to force the president to resign. After the report's release, opposition parties plan to lend their resources to pro-impeachment demonstrations. Mr Collor's political support continues to waver. On Monday, Governor Leonel Brizola of Rio de Janeiro state is expected to break with the president. The decision was reached on Wednesday when Mr Brizola met in Braslia Congress members from his Democratic Labour party. Pro-impeachment forces estimate that they are 20-30 votes shy of the two-thirds necessary to oust Mr Collor. A running poll by the opposition newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo shows 212 on record as favouring impeachment and 33 opposed, with the rest undecided or yet to respond.</p>

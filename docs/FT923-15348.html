			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Farewell to life in the fast lane: Recession and high capital costs are curbing the expansion of Japan's car manufacturers For many years car manufacturers in the west have waited impatiently for the aggressive international expansion of Japan's automobile industry to lose its cutting edge. The time may finally be coming. Japan's carmakers are deep in a recession which is likely to leave lasting scars. Increasingly, industry leaders believe the downturn has brought to a close an era of rapid expansion, and will mark the advent of a more mature industry. 'The Japanese automobile industry is at a turning point,' says Mr Yutaka Kume, chairman of Nissan Motor and, as chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, the industry's leading spokesman. 'We have to adopt new policies and strategies. We should not depend on numbers, on the quantity of production for profitability.' Mr Kume believes that Nissan and the other Japanese carmakers need to wean themselves off ingrained habits, which mean that companies have narrowly pursued sales and bigger market share, often at the expense of short-term financial gain. With profits now falling sharply and prospects for growth waning, the Japanese industry is being forced to pay more attention to immediate financial returns. The full impact of this change in outlook remains to be seen. But already this year Nissan has pulled out of marginal markets in Australia and Peru by closing assembly plants. Toyota Motor, Japan's biggest manufacturer with 41 per cent of the domestic market, is cutting costs by reducing optional extra equipment on new cars. Industry executives say Toyota is planning to reduce the number of models it offers, in particular in low-volume niche market segments. Toyota this year raised average prices in the US, in spite of the recession, by Dollars 432 a vehicle. The price of its top-of-the-line Lexus, for example, was lifted by 5 per cent, or Dollars 2,100 (Pounds 1,130). Of course, the Japanese companies have not suddenly become uncompetitive. Indeed, they are likely to continue making inroads in the luxury car market at the expense of manufacturers such as Mercedes Benz and BMW of Germany. Yet the overwhelming comparative advantage of the Japanese industry, supported by the country's strong domestic market in the late 1980s, is being pared back as a result of changes arising from the recession. Competition between Japanese and foreign carmakers promises to be more evenly matched. The change has been sudden. The Japanese industry went on a spending spree for new plant and equipment when worldwide sales accelerated in the late 1980s. In the three years to the end of fiscal 1990, Toyota's capital spending doubled to an annual level of Y858.4bn (Pounds 3.6bn). Nissan's spending tripled in the same period to Y318.6bn. But the bills for this surge in investment are now falling due. Toyota, for example, saw a Y40bn increase in depreciation charges in the six months to December, compared with parent company operating profits of Y77bn. At the same time, demand has contracted. Sales of passenger cars in the domestic market last year fell by 6.5 per cent. The downturn has left the industry with excess capacity, and a mismatch between the models rolling off the line and what consumers want to buy. Toyota's efforts to move its Corolla - a sturdy, value-for-money car - up market by lifting the price and quality have fallen flat, contributing to a loss of market share in the small car sector. The adverse business environment, however, has affected the companies differently. Nissan Motor, number two in Japan, is struggling to stay in the black after reporting a 71.8 per cent fall in operating profits to Y33.8bn in the year to March. Under Mr Kume's leadership, Nissan shook off its stodgy image by introducing a series of radically styled cars, beginning in 1987. But other companies quickly copied Nissan's strategy and its market share remained stuck at about 23 per cent. Its long-term goal of regaining its former 30 per cent of the market is now a distant dream. In the past year, Nissan's debt (including bonds) has grown from Y3,100bn to Y3,570bn and the ratio of debt to equity has increased from 128 per cent to 147 per cent. The company desperately needs cash, and has been forced to sell long-held securities. Toyota has also suffered from the downturn and forecast a 30 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y400bn in the year to the end of June. But the company is sitting on large cash reserves, totalling Y1,180bn at the end of December, and has insignificant net debt. Mr Soichiro Toyoda, the company's president, is confident about Toyota's future, and dismisses suggestions that the industry is passing through more than a cyclical trough. Many industry executives, however, echo the themes articulated by Mr Kume, and say that Toyota too must learn to live with lower growth, longer product cycles and less choice for customers. Mazda Motor, with 8.3 per cent of the domestic market, boasts the most eye-catching network of dealerships in Japan. It has just finished rebuilding its sales network into five channels for different types of cars and launched a series of stylish vehicles, such as its Sentia luxury sedan, but its sales and market share are also in decline. It has lost third place in the Japanese market to Mitsubishi Motor. Mazda's operating profits fell by about 53 per cent in 1991, with margins of less than 1 per cent. Poor sales have forced Mazda to cancel night shifts at its most automated plant, which opened only in January. Honda Motor, which now ranks fifth, has halted a slide in its market share at about 7.6 per cent. Consolidated operating profits grew by 4.4 per cent last year to Y153bn owing to strong US sales. But Honda too has had to increase its borrowings and its debt-to-equity ratio has risen from 74 per cent a year ago to 87 per cent at the end of March. Only Mitsubishi Motors is expanding sales in Japan, and now claims an 8.4 per cent share of the domestic market. But its balance sheet is the weakest of the big five, with twice as much debt as equity. While the recession has brought difficulties to a head, the companies do seem to be facing more than a cyclical downturn: Growth prospects: Car markets in Japan, Europe and the US are mature and offer little prospect for rapid growth. Japan's annual domestic vehicle sales increased by 46 per cent between 1986 and 1990, providing a big stimulus enjoyed almost exclusively by the Japanese industry. But that market is now near saturation; Japan's population is declining and its roads are full. Mr Kume expects the market to stabilise eventually at about 6m vehicle sales annually, slightly higher than the 1990 figure of 5.98m. Cost of capital: Many Japanese companies raised finance at a cost of less than 1 per cent until the stock market crashed in 1990. Much of the debt raised during that period is expiring, and now has to be refinanced at interest rates closer to 6-7 per cent, placing a new burden on cash flow. The environment: Tightening emissions standards around the globe, led by stringent standards in California, have increased the costs of producing new models and placed a greater strain on cash flow. Labour shortage: Japan has a steadily worsening labour shortage resulting from its low birth rate. To recruit production line workers and to keep them from leaving the company, Japanese manufacturers are being forced to increase salaries, and to spend billions of yen to improve work environments and housing. Toyota's wage bill rose by Y20bn in the six months to December. At the same time it is cutting working hours by about 100 hours a year per worker. These factors make manufacturing in Japan more difficult and they are forcing the companies to squeeze more profits out of existing facilities. In part, this will happen by itself, provided that capital spending declines, as the heavy burden of depreciation charges on profits begins to ease in the years ahead. Cutting costs is also high on the agenda. In the hectic race to satisfy rising demand in the 1980s, manufacturing efficiencies were sometimes lost. Mr Ryuichi Tsukamoto, executive vice-president of Honda Engineering, says Honda's parts supply capacity is between 20 and 30 per cent greater than necessary. Mr Tsukamoto is leading a programme to increase the common use of parts among different Honda models, instead of designing each part separately for every model. Flexibility and choice for consumers - hallmarks of the Japanese car industry - may also be reduced. Honda is cutting by a third the hundreds of different designs of sun visors it uses. Mr Kume says Nissan will look to extend the current four-year model cycle on a case-by-case basis as an additional cost-cutting measure. Mr Toyoda is less optimistic about prospects for cost saving on the factory floor. He says: 'We have been trying to use common parts for a long time, but have not been able to do it very well.' This is because of the subtle differences in parts required for various vehicle designs. In the end, if the Japanese companies wish to raise profits, they may have no option but to become less flexible, offer less choice to consumers, and charge a higher price for their products. Should they follow this path, they will begin to look a lot more like the companies they compete against in the west. Indeed, as the automobile industry in Europe and the US continues to slim down and adopt many of the management techniques originally perfected in Japan, the Japanese companies will look increasingly less invincible.</p>

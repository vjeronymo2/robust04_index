			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Unlike some of the other operating administrations, FRA already has several years of industry drug testing data compiled from railroad annual reports previously filed under &sect;217.13(d). (On December 23, 1993, FRA repealed this section of its annual reporting requirements and replaced it with a Management Information System to collect drug misuse program data (58 FR 68233). These reports indicate that the rail positive rate has been below 1.0 percent for the previous two consecutive calendar years. In 1992, the rail industry positive rate, while testing at 50 percent, was .79 percent; in 1993 it was .72 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, based on this data, FRA reduces the minimum annual random drug testing rate from 50 percent to 25 percent effective January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995. FRA will announce the 1996 minimum annual random drug testing rate in a future Federal Register notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Replacement of Post-Accident Testing Kits <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On February 15, 1994, FRA published a final rule amending its regulations on alcohol and drug misuse (49 CFR 219) in response to the testing requirements mandated by the Omnibus Transportation Testing Act of 1991. Prompted by recent low positive rates, FRA also raised the amount of railroad property damage required for major train accidents and for impact accidents, by redefining &sect;219.201(a)(1)(iii) (major train accidents) to require testing for accidents that cause $1,000,000 or more in damage, and redefining &sect;219.201(a)(2)(ii) (impact accidents) to require testing for non-injury accidents that cause $150,000 or more in damage. Together, these changes should result in about 30 percent fewer post-accident tests being conducted. Additionally, FRA excluded from post-accident testing accidents that otherwise qualify but are clearly attributable to vandalism. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To accommodate these changes, FRA announced that it will be amending Appendix C to part 219 to modify its post-accident testing procedures, toxicology kits, instructions, and forms to accommodate mandatory urine split sample testing and optional breath alcohol testing. FRA also will change its post-accident custody and control forms, instructions, and testing kits. Since FRA already splits post-accident blood samples into two sealed 10 milliliter tubes, the only addition for split sample testing will be inclusion of a second urine specimen bottle in the kit. FRA will also revise Forms F6180.73 and F6180.74 to allow for railroad reporting of evidential breath test results by adding a check off box for the railroad representative to indicate whether one or more employees have been breath tested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unfortunately, FRA will be unable to provide enough post-accident kits and forms to supply the entire industry before the January 1, 1995, effective date for alcohol testing. Therefore, for now, railroads should continue to follow the Post-Accident Testing Sample Collection Procedures listed in the current Appendix C to Part 219. To allow for a smooth transition, FRA will not implement post-accident split sample urine testing until new kits and forms become available. When this occurs, FRA will publish a notice and a revised Appendix C to Part 219 containing split sample urine procedures. The anticipated target date is February 28, 1995. FRA will publish additional notices if further implementation delays become necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised post-accident testing criteria will still take effect as scheduled on January 1, 1995, however. As an interim measure, until new kits and forms are available, when testing is required under one of the redefined categories (i.e., ``major train accident,'' or ``impact accident''), railroad representatives should line through the existing monetary thresholds printed on the current form FRA F6180.73 and write in ``$1,000,000 or more'' (``major train accident'') or ``$150,000 or more'' (``impact accident''), whichever is applicable. (The criteria for fatal train incidents and passenger train accidents listed on form F6180.73 remain the same.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a railroad conducts breath alcohol tests, the railroad representative may either attach a copy of the standard DOT (49 CFR Part 40) breath alcohol testing form (the railroad will have to make an additional copy for FRA purposes, since the Part 40 form allows only for breath alcohol technician, employee, and employer copies) to the FRA forms to be shipped with the toxicology kit, or send a copy of each Part 40 form directly to FRA within 10 days of the tests. The revised Appendix C will also contain these instructions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Pernod-Ricard advances 15% PERNOD-RICARD, one of France's leading drinks groups, increased net profits by 15 per cent to FFr1.13bn (Dollars 204m) last year from FFr983m in 1991. Mr Patrick Ricard, chairman and chief executive, said that 'despite the unfavourable economic environment and the decline in consumption' the group had continued to show growth chiefly due to its international expansion strategy. The group saw turnover fall by 4.8 per cent from FFr15.22bn in 1991 to FFr14.5bn in 1992. This decline in sales was due to disposals, notably the sale last May of the bulk of the Societe des Vins de France wine business. Mr Ricard said the underlying rate of sales growth was 4.7 per cent. Pernod saw operating profits fall from FFr2.05bn in 1991 to FFr1.98m mainly because of disposals. However, it compensated with an increase in exceptional gains from FFr16m to FFr264m over the same period. The board has raised the dividend by 6 per cent to FFr8.5 for 1992. The company, like other French concerns, was affected by the franc's strength following the September currency crisis. It estimated that exchange rate changes reduced sales by FFr291m and operating profits by FFr32m. Last year was the first that Pernod received more income from its international operations than from its French business. It continued its international growth last year by opening new subsidiaries in Taiwan and South Korea and setting up joint ventures in Poland and Hungary. Pernod is also expanding its domestic activities, notably by securing the distribution contract for Pepsi-Cola in France.</p>

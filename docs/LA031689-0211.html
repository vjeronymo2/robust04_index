			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> LEWIS QUITS RACE FOR HOUSE POST  </P> <P> Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Highland) formally took himself out of the race for the No.  2 leadership job among House Republicans today, but another GOP member vowed to  nominate Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois for the job and make it a three-way  contest.  </P> <P> Lewis, who as chairman of the House Republican Conference holds the  third-ranking job in the GOP hierarchy, made no formal endorsement when he  announced his decision at a news conference. The job of Republican whip is  being vacated by Rep. Dick Cheney so he can become President Bush's secretary  of defense. The remaining candidates are Rep. Edward Madigan of Illinois, the  current deputy whip, and Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia.  </P></p>

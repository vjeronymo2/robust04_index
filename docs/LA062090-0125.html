			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKING AHEAD: CELLULAR PHONES: MEDIUM FOR MASSES  </P> <P> Cellular telephones promise to be the personal communication medium of the  1990s as they move rapidly from business tool to mass consumer product.  </P> <P> Annual sales have increased from 72,000 in 1982 to a projected 1.2 million this  year. In 1995, an estimated 3 million cellular phones will be sold and 5  million will be in use.  </P> <P> As have other electronic consumer products, such as hand-held calculators,  VCRs, CD players and digital watches, cellular phones will follow the cycle of  high prices shortly after introduction and price decreases as their popularity  grows.  </P> <P> Cellular phone revenue is expected to decline from $725 million in 1992 to $400  million after 1995. In 1984, the average price of a cellular phone was $1,600.  Today it is $550, with some units selling for less than $400. By 2010, cellular  phones are expected to go for about $60.  </P> <P> Digital cellular phone shipments are expected to begin next year. By 1995,  digital will capture an estimated 40% of the market. In Los Angeles, New York  and Chicago, analog cellular networks are near capacity. Because digital allows  for three times the number of users per network than does analog, network  operators in these areas are expected to use digital technology to expand their  subscriber base. In addition, digital voice transmission is preferred over  analog because of reduced cross-talk and static.  </P> <P> With economies of volume and technological advances, the value of the  semiconductors in telephones will decrease. The value of semiconductors in  phones sold in the United States will decline from an estimated $54 million in  1990 to $45 million in 1995. Suppliers of telephone semiconductors will have to  decide whether they can compete in the market in the long term. Suppliers that  are not -- or cannot become -- high-volume, low-cost producers should be  prepared to leave the market sometime during the next five years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bad News for Venture Capitalists  </P> <P> California venture capitalists scrambled for technology start-up opportunities  in the mid- and late 1980s. However, the failure rate of the start-up  companies, combined with the stock market crash of 1987, means big changes in  technology financing.  </P> <P> Today's venture capitalists face lower returns, fewer public offerings and  impatient fund managers looking for better performance. Fewer and fewer tech  deals are reaching the financing stage. Venture capitalists must also cope with  an extended time frame -- years, usually -- between start-up financing and  public offering.  </P> <P> In other words, the news for venture capitalists is mostly bad.  </P> <P> A survey by Investor Dealer Digest shows that the number of public offerings in  technology companies declined to 25 last year from a high of 178 seven years  ago. Twenty-seven offerings are expected this year.  </P> <P> Such numbers clearly will not support the more than 650 U.S. venture capital  firms. Unless dramatic changes occur in the fields of technology offerings or  mergers and acquisitions, it's conceivable that 30% to 40% of venture firms  will vanish within four years.  </P> <P> As venture firms have raised their standards, alternative funding sources have  emerged.  </P> <P> Fueled by a cheap dollar, foreign investors are acquiring technology to fill  gaps in their home countries. They often find hungry U.S. entrepreneurs eager  to bypass traditional venture capital channels. In 1989, Japan invested more  than $300 million in 50 American technology companies.  </P> <P> In many cases, a technology-start-up entrepreneur finds a foreign investor more  patient, more supportive and less distracting than an American investor. As the  market becomes more global, the entrepreneur finds the foreign investor even  more attractive.  </P> <P> A consequence of this financial market shift is that more equity will pass to  foreign companies. In some cases, foreign investors will end up owning a good  chunk of critical new U.S. technology. Many argue that because the technology  industry is rapidly becoming global, the transfer is inevitable.  </P> <P> Another consequence of current trends is that strong U.S. venture capital firms  will get stronger. In spite of the somewhat gloomy environment, many larger  private firms are reporting solid earnings and returns on investments.  </P></p>

			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Former Algerian PM shot dead MOSLEM fundamentalist gunmen have shot dead Mr Kasdi Merbah, the former Algerian prime minister and military security chief, in an ambush on his car, the official APS news agency reported, Reuter writes from Algiers. Mr Merbah, the first Algerian opposition leader to be assassinated by the gunmen in their campaign of violence against the state, was killed in the centre of the coastal resort of Bordj el-Bahri late on Saturday when returning from the beach. The attack, the most serious on a senior politician since the June 1992 assassination of the head of state, Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, coincided with the sacking of Mr Abdesselam Belaid, the prime minister, and his replacement by Mr Redha Malek, the foreign minister Diplomats said it was clearly the failure of Mr Belaid's economic austerity policies which led to his dismissal. Political parties, trade unions and business leaders had all condemned his policies. Mr Merbah, head of the Algerian Movement for Justice and Development, was the only member of the opposition to have publicly urged Moslem militants to lay down their weapons. He published the call in an open letter on July 13. Algiers radio said his son, brother, a driver and a bodyguard were also killed in the carefully planned attack on two cars carrying them all. APS blamed the killing on five 'terrorists', the official term for the militants who launched their campaign of violence in earnest last year after Algeria's army-backed leadership scrapped a general election which the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win. Mr Merbah, who played an active part in the 1965 coup that brought Socialist leader Houari Boumedienne to power, was head of Algeria's military security for 17 years. He was appointed prime minister in November 1988 after riots but was sacked in 1989. In a row that followed, he quit the ruling National Liberation Front and set up his own party in opposition.</p>

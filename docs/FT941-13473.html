			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Minister raps council over Tupe obstacle to contract The environment department yesterday ruled that a local authority had acted anti-competitively when it refused to disclose details of its workforce's pay and conditions to a private company bidding for a contract. The council believed that the Transfer of Undertakings (Public Employees) regulations, known as Tupe, applied to the contract, which meant that the bidder would be obliged to accept the workforce on its existing terms and conditions. The council insisted that Tupe terms would apply, but refused to say what they were. Yesterday's decision by the environment minister, Mr Tony Baldry, signals a crackdown on councils' use of the regulations. He said: 'I am determined to ensure that the treatment of Tupe by local authorities should not stand in the way of fair competition.' Langbaurgh-on-Tees Borough Council will now have to re-tender the contract. Three other authorities, the London borough of Redbridge, Southampton City Council and Bassetlaw District Council, have also been issued with statutory notices asking them to explain their actions in awarding work to their own labour force in possible breach of competitive tendering rules, following allegations of anti-competitive behaviour in their treatment of Tupe.</p>

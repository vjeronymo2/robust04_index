The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Supplemental Order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> 341 Tract Unit of the Citronelle Field,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> 5/18/94,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> LFX&hyph;0008  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning the disbursement of an escrow fund made available as a result of the termination of exception relief issued to The 341 Tract Unit of the Citronelle Field. The escrow fund, which is continuing to accrue interest, totals approximately $131 million. OHA decided that refiners as a group absorbed 5.4 percent of the cost of that exception relief. Each refiner listed on the Entitlements List for November 1980 will receive an allocable share of the escrow fund based on its percentage of runs to stills during that month. Refiners' final refunds will be based on the 5.4 percent absorption rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Refund Applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Enron Corporation/Odessa L.P.G.

Transport, Inc. (Odessa) submitted an Application for Refund in the Enron Corporation refund proceeding. The DOE found that Odessa had proved that it was injured with respect to Enron propane that it purchased and resold during the period June 1974 through January 1981. Accordingly, the DOE granted Odessa a principal refund of $116,781 for this product and accrued interest of $47,635. The total refund granted to Odessa was $164,416.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> 5/18/94,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> RF272&hyph;89582, RR272&hyph;92  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (Goodyear), a major manufacturer and retailer of tires and industrial rubber products, filed a Motion for Reconsideration of a Decision and Order that denied in part a crude oil refund application it had filed. In its reconsideration request, Goodyear argued that the DOE had erroneously denied it a refund with respect to its purchases of specified products. The DOE rejected Goodyear's arguments with respect to all the products except isoprene. Although the DOE determined that isoprene was not an eligible product, the DOE further determined that, for certain purchases, Goodyear had rebutted the end-user presumption of injury, i.e., the presumption that the isoprene supplier, as the end-user of eligible products used to make isoprene, is presumed injured by crude oil overcharges. The DOE based the latter determination on Goodyear's showing that for a portion of the refund period, one of Goodyear's isoprene suppliers had increased isoprene prices to Goodyear based on a dollar for dollar increase in its crude oil costs and, therefore, that for those purchases Goodyear bore the impact of overcharges attributable to isoprene feedstocks. The DOE, therefore, granted Goodyear an additional crude oil refund in the amount of $3,554.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The DOE also considered two other products for which Goodyear had previously sought a crude oil refund but which the DOE elected to defer in its earlier decision pending the submission of additional evidence by Goodyear. The two products at issue were butadiene and petroleum wax. After reviewing the evidence and/or arguments Goodyear had presented, the DOE determined that Goodyear had failed to demonstrate that the products in question had been produced in a crude oil refinery. Accordingly, the DOE concluded that those products were not eligible for a crude oil refund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

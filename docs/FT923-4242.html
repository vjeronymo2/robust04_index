			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Barclays sells Allied Trust Bank to SA group BARCLAYS, the UK clearing bank, has sold Allied Trust Bank, a loss-making subsidiary of which it took full control in 1990, to Investec Bank, for Pounds 25m. Allied Trust, formerly Allied Arab Bank, has total assets of about Pounds 200m. Its head office is in Cannon Street, London, and it specialises in marketing retail investment products and lending to small and medium-sized businesses. The purchase gives Investec, the fifth largest South African banking group, a presence in the UK for the first time and access to the rest of the European Community. During the last year Allied Trust's interest rates on savings deposits have been among the highest available in the UK, and the sale will be a blow to those investors who flocked to it because it was owned by Barclays. In 1989 the bank incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 9.4m, which fell to Pounds 6.4m in 1990. No figures for 1991 are available. Barclays had increased its stake in the institution, then a consortium bank, from 20 per cent to 46 per cent in 1984 after heavy losses. It bought the remaining 54 per cent for an undisclosed sum in 1990 from Sheikh Kamal Adham, a Saudi investor. It apparently intended to turn it around and sell it.</p>

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Letter: Caribbean banana exports need British protection Sir, Your article, 'Latin American banana producers attack EC quota plan' (August 20) ignores the critical importance of this issue for the economies and people of the eastern Caribbean. Latin American banana producers have legitimate concerns about restrictions on their banana exports in the EC system. But the interests of Caribbean exporters in maintaining their preferences must not be overlooked. Dominica, for example, would stand to lose 70 per cent of export earnings and employment for half its workforce if, as the US and Latin American exporters insist, the existing system of preferences is withdrawn. Britain has a special responsibility, both because it is the main protected market for Caribbean exporters and because it is president of the European Community. It should use this authority to protect the interests of Caribbean exporters. It should also press for aid to help Caribbean efforts at diversification out of banana production. Trade preferences for Caribbean banana producers may conflict with the EC's obligations to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). But surely this merely underlines the inadequacies of a treaty which places the principles of free trade above the interests of vulnerable communities?

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Leica may sell majority stake in camera offshoot LEICA, the precision optical and scientific instruments group which Mr Stephan Schmidheiny, the Swiss industrialist, took private from the USM last year, is discussing the sale of a majority stake in Leica Camera, its camera making subsidiary. At least two potential buyers have approached the Swiss-based company. One is a group of investors including Mr Bruno Frey, managing director of Leica Camera's German manufacturing operations. The other is an unnamed American distributor of photographic equipment. Mr Fritz Staudacher, head of corporate communications, said the company had decided to concentrate on its optical and scientific business and seek a partner to invest in and develop the camera subsidiary. 'But we are not forced to do it. We will only take a partner if we are convinced it will work,' he said. No details on price or what size of stake, if any, Leica would retain in the subsidiary have been released. Leica Camera has manufacturing plants in Germany and Portugal, a sales network in Europe and the US, and rights to the Leica Camera brand. Unotec, Leica's ultimate holding company, would retain the brand name for the non-camera businesses. In the 1991, the latest year for which results are available, Leica Camera made operating profits of Pounds 2.64m from sales of Pounds 63.8m. Microscopes, scientific and surveying instruments made combined profits of Pounds 13.2m from sales of Pounds 455.8m.</p>

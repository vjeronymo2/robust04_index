			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (10): The China option - The banks' future opportunity The telephones sit silently on desks beside a single trading screen in a 3m by 2m room in Shanghai. This is the Chinese foreign exchange centre of Standard Chartered, the oldest foreign bank in China. Like other banks, it is gearing up for a flood of business but, as yet, deals with a trickle. As businesses in Hong Kong have turned their sights to China, switching manufacturing operations into the Pearl River delta, so the colony's banks have rushed to re-establish their presence. China's headlong economic growth and developing financial infrastructure is a big opportunity. For the local Hong Kong banks serving Chinese families who fled to the colony after 1949 to avoid the Communist state, there is already a network through which to operate. Most hope to move back into China through lending to companies that are transferring operations back across the border. For the foreign banks that were forcibly ejected from China after the revolution - in the case of Hongkong Bank and Standard Chartered losing the grand buildings which line the Bund in Shanghai - there is a harder calculation about how much capital to invest in re-establishing a presence. China is a risky market, in which it is hard to judge credit risk. The legal framework is uncertain. It remains highly protected: foreign banks are barred from taking deposits in the domestic currency and have to make foreign exchange transactions through public 'swap centres'. One reason for controls remaining in force is that, paradoxically, foreign banks have advantageous tax treatment. The Beijing government is wary of deregulating financial markets before tax reform has been enacted, for fear of giving another advantage to sophisticated foreign banks. Since financial laws are in a state of flux - this month alone saw the publication of a series of new regulations, and a move to having a single interbank foreign exchange market - Hong Kong banks are caught between wanting to establish a presence quickly, and wariness about wasting capital. Mr Paul Selway-Swift, executive director of Hongkong Bank, says that the bank is keen to re-establish itself in China but cannot waive normal investment criteria. 'We take a long-term view, but there has to be a return to the shareholders, maybe not immediately but reasonably soon,' he says. Mr David Kiang, Standard Chartered's chief executive for China, says banks have to be selective. 'China is going through some very fundamental and dramatic changes, and we need to find a strategy to cope with that,' he says. Banks are concentrating on a variety of businesses in China: First, they are lending money. There is strong demand for loans in expanding economic areas, partly because of Chinese restrictions on credit to curb inflation. 'It is very easy to lend money in China. It is a bottomless pit,' says Mr Werner Makowski, managing director of Dao Heng Bank. Most Hong Kong banks are ready to make loans secured on assets in the colony - often to family businesses in Hong Kong. Mr David Li, chief executive of the Bank of East Asia, says margins on lending in China are 'much healthier' than in Hong Kong because of demand. Second, banks are trying to expand their securities operations so that they do not have to make all loans from their balance sheets. 'We want to move from booking assets to originating and distributing them. China's demand is so huge that we cannot just use our balance sheet,' says Mr Kiang. Many have started with the B shares in Chinese companies sold to foreign investors on the Shanghai and Shenzen exchanges, and H shares in large Chinese utilities traded in Hong Kong. There has been fierce competition among commercial and investment banks to underwrite and distribute these. Third, banks are waiting to be carry out foreign exchange transactions on behalf of customers trading in China, including multinationals which have set up joint ventures. Until this month, all trades had to be carried out through regional 'swap centres' which set varying exchange rates. China had planned to move to a single interbank market based in Shanghai, but has compromised by retaining swap centres as well. Foreign banks such as Standard Chartered hope that that they will eventually be able to use their own centres to trade independently rather than through the state. Finally, foreign banks want to develop wholesale transactions business such as credit card processing and cash management which they will be able to sell to Chinese businesses and financial institutions. They regard such operations as safer and more reliable than taking credit risks by lending. The biggest prize for foreign banks in China would be the ability to take domestic currency deposits. The ability to fund loans through taking relatively cheap deposits has been the backbone of their business in Hong Kong, and the chance to replicate it in China is a tempting prospect. It is unlikely to be realised soon. Full convertibility of the yuan is unlikely within five years, and loosening restrictions on foreign banks before then will depend on the Chinese authorities feeling comfortable that their own banks can compete on reasonably equal terms with foreigners. This means that banks will probably continue to tread carefully for some time yet. Mr Makowski says that China is more of a prospect than a reality for many banks. 'We are optimistic about the future, but cautious about using our capital for more than seed money,' he says.</p>

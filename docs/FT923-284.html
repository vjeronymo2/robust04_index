			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The classroom moves closer to the workplace: John Gapper examines experiments designed to improve US vocational education and equip school leavers for employment Beth Moore, an 11th grade school pupil in Boston, has learned a lot from working in a hospital. 'It's good for growing up. Everything you do there has to be right, because you can jeopardise someone's life if it's not,' she says. Unlike her friends, she has discovered what she wants to do after school. 'I think when they say they don't want to work, they mean they don't know how to go about it,' she says. Beth is fortunate for a US pupil who is not going to attend university. Unlike many who drift through school without any clear goal, her education is being directed to an end. She is preparing for two years of part-time study at a community college. If she succeeds, she will qualify as a medical technician and could earn about Dollars 25,000 a year. Beth Moore is taking part in an experiment funded by the federal government in Boston called Project ProTech. The aim is to fill some of the technical posts in local hospitals by providing an alternative to academic education for pupils who might otherwise drop out of school before 18. Many of the 90 in the experiment's first year come from public schools with high drop-out rates. These links between schools and employers are common in countries such as Germany with a strong tradition of youth apprenticeship. But they mark a profound change for the US, where most parents want their children to have a university education. Only now is the scarcity of well-paid jobs for those who do not enter post-secondary education forcing schools to rethink their purpose and methods. The result is a sharp increase in local experiments which try to provide a coherent strategy for the 84 per cent of pupils who do not go to university. The common aim of efforts such as Project ProTech is to help young people gain enough education to perform the expanding number of technical and professional jobs. The need for such innovation is plain when one sees how vocational education has been handled until now. The US has never had a European-style dual education system in which academic and vocational schools are split. Instead, the 15,700 comprehensive high schools - compared with only 220 specialist vocational schools - offer job-related courses as an optional extra to core academic disciplines. Such vocational courses are commonly second-rate. Many vocational teachers are recruited from industry, with less training than academic teachers. Their classes tend to offer narrow job skills rather than competencies applicable in all forms of work. Thirty vocational programmes in Philadelphia schools were stopped in 1988 after a business-led inquiry found they were achieving little or nothing. As a result, pupils not heading for college have resisted entering vocational classes. They have preferred a less stringent form of academic education, within schools, called 'general track'. General track classes are widely blamed for lowering standards by allowing pupils within a single school to choose between a dozen forms of maths or English courses of varying rigour and content. 'The alternative to the college track has been general education which does not prepare students for anything,' says Ms J D Hoye, Oregon's associate school superintendent. Ms Betsy Brand, assistant secretary at the US Department of Education, says schools have treated average pupils as an afterthought. 'Our attitude has been elitist, and we have got to start looking at different strategies,' she says. Current reforms fall into two groups: improvements to secondary vocational education, and efforts to create a better path from school into work and further education. Most reforms of secondary vocational education attempt to broaden the traditional view of preparation for work. Instead of encouraging pupils to learn craft skills such as carpentry or hairdressing, they tailor academic work to occupations. The aim is twofold: to motivate pupils to remain in school by making lessons more relevant; and to give them a better range of skills. Some initiatives involve 'schools within schools', which split the large public schools into small units where a group of teachers co-ordinates lessons around a subject. The best known examples are the 'high school academies' in Philadelphia which offer lessons based on sectors such as health and horticulture. In the latter, pupils run a flower shop as well as being taught landscaping and aboriculture. The academies achieved graduation rates of between 88 and 100 per cent last year, compared with about 60 per cent in other high schools. They were founded in 1969, but have been expanding and are expected to cover 17 per cent of the city's public school pupils by 1995. Ms Natalie Allen, the academies' director, argues that they are 'the closest we are going to get' to apprenticeships. Other states such as Oregon and Indiana are attempting a more ambitious approach. Indiana is creating a system under which 15 and 16-year-old pupils will take an exam covering literacy, technology and mathematics. They will then choose an area of study for their final two years of school from curricula such as business, health or technology. In all cases, they will study maths, science and language. These sort of courses - often known as Tech Prep - have been encouraged by amendments to the Carl Perkins Act, which provides federal funds for vocational education. Ms Brand says such courses 'hold out a vision of post-secondary education for many students who would not dream of it', by guiding them towards skilled occupations in which they are likely to receive further training at community college. The second set of reforms goes further than simply changing secondary education. It tries to link study at school and community colleges with jobs. The ProTech effort gives pupils a day's work experience at a hospital each week while they are at school. When they leave, they study part-time at community colleges for two-year degrees while working as trainees at the hospitals. But there are two difficulties with such efforts. One is that they require the kind of links between employers and schools common in Germany, but unusual in the US. The second is that parents are reluctant for their children to be selected for skilled employment rather than university at 16. Thus the best hope for the reform movement is probably that enough pupils such as Beth Moore gain well-paid technical jobs. Until they start to see the value of an alternative to university education, many US parents will remain loyal to a form of schooling that was built to serve the interests of all but is increasingly failing the majority.

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: M &amp; A The international acquisition business, it seems, reacts to recession in curious ways. It is no surprise that activity overall should have been down heavily last year. But it was also concentrated in countries which had yet to go into recession, as opposed to those in it already. Thus, according to Daiwa, foreign acquisitions by Japanese companies were down nearly 80 per cent by value last year, with the sharpest falls in the US and UK. Purchases of Japanese companies by foreigners, on the other hand, went up eightfold. Similarly, the London research company J P Mervis calculates that UK companies spent 73 per cent less on US acquisitions last year. But they increased their spending in Continental Europe, the heaviest concentration being in the late-cycle economies of Germany and Spain. There is something slightly perverse about this. It may be that companies in recession-struck economies are relatively expensive because investors are discounting recovery, as they plainly are in the US. Just conceivably, the reverse may be true in Germany or Japan. But commonsense suggests that acquisitive companies would find better bargains in economies where business confidence was at its lowest. Or perhaps the reality is the other way around: that it is the acquiring companies which lack confidence. The appeal of acquisition targets in countries which have yet to enter recession may be precisely that they show an unblemished profits record. If so, traditional bid activity within the Anglophone economies may be slow to pick up this year. If even the strong companies cannot judge their own future, they are less likely to take a bet on that of their neighbours.</p>

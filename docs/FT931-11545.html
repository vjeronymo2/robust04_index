			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: BOC in Pounds 48m drug deal with Du Pont BOC, the healthcare and industrial gases group, yesterday announced it had purchased the Brevibloc European and North American operations of Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical for Dollars 72.5m (Pounds 48m). Brevibloc is a drug used in operating theatres to control heart rate and blood pressure. The product will be marketed by Anaquest, BOC's pharmaceuticals division which specialises in products aimed at anaesthetists. The business, which last year generated sales of Dollars 15m, has been growing at more than 20 per cent a year, according to BOC. The group said it hoped to be able to use its specialist marketing force to boost Brevibloc's sales. Mr Roger Stoll, president of BOC Health Care, said the drug complemented its current portfolio of anaesthetic and acute care drugs. Du Pont Merck is retaining the product rights in markets outside North America and Europe. Mr Joseph Mollica, president of Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical, said: 'Brevibloc no longer fits in our core business strategy that focuses on the office-based physician market-place.' The move is part of BOC's efforts to boost its healthcare operations which increased sales by 4.2 per cent to Pounds 512m last year. BOC needs to lift its US revenues following the expiry at the end of last month of the American patents for Forane, its anaesthetic. Anaesthetics represent about 60 per cent of the group's health-related profits, according to Kleinwort Benson.</p>

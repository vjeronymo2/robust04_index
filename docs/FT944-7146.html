However, some analysts claimed that their rivals had 'over-egged' their expectations for Direct Line's growth prospects, and the sell-off in RBoS, which fell 17 1/2 to 425p, was merely the reflection of a return to reality. The insurance team at Smith New Court said that although Direct Line was still a 'high growth company that benefits from higher margins than anyone else', banking specialists might not have appreciated that the pressures on private car and household insurance were not going to go away. NatWest Securities cut its forecast for the year to September 1995 by Pounds 20m to Pounds 140m and SG Warburg was said to be arguing that the company would stop growing by 1996. Nevertheless, broker Credit Lyonnais Laing is confident that the Scottish clearer will achieve profits of Pounds 551m and a dividend of 13.5p - top of the range estimates - and was using yesterday's weakness as a buying opportunity. The two-way pull on the stock prompted exceptionally high turnover of 7.6m shares</p>

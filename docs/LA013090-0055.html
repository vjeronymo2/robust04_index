			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS: SOME COACHES STILL SUPPORTING THE NO-FAIL RULE  </P> <P> When the Los Angeles Unified School District decided to drop its no-fail  requirement for extracurricular activities last week, most City coaches were  pleased with the decision.  </P> <P> Many opposed the rule when it was introduced in 1982, claiming that it was  unfair to make a student who maintained a 2.0 grade-point average, but failed  one course, ineligible for athletics.  </P> <P> Since then, this view has gained support as many teams lost key players as a  result of the City's 10-week grade reports. In November, Fairfax's football  team had to forfeit its opening-round playoff game against El Camino Real of  Woodland Hills because of too many ineligible players, and there was even talk  of coaches boycotting the playoffs because of the rule.  </P> <P> However, Randolph Simpson, boys' basketball coach at Manual Arts, said the  recent decision is more of a setback than a move forward.  </P> <P> "What this decision does is say to the kids that it is OK for them to fail a  class and to slack off," said Simpson, whose Toilers are the top-ranked team in  the City this season. "Everyone should be pushing harder with an attitude that  they have to get it done because it is not going to be that way for them when  they move into the real world.  </P> <P> "This move may help a lot of athletic teams but it is condoning failure. I  truly believe that athletes need to deserve to play. They need to strive to be  the best on the court and in the classroom because if they don't make it in  sports, they will need to turn to academics."  </P> <P> At Manual Arts, there are special study halls and tutoring programs for  athletes to assist in their academic careers. The school also has its own grade  checks every two weeks. This practice has been effective with the Toiler boys'  basketball program, which has not lost a player to academic ineligibility in  the past four years.  </P> <P> "Even though the board has made its decision to get rid of the rule, we will  continue among ourselves to have tough academic policies," Simpson said. "The  kids need to put in the extra work in order to be successful; they have to do  this just to have a chance in college. By changing this rule we are teaching  them the wrong thing . . . that academics is not foremost."  </P> <P> Carson football Coach Gene Vollnogle, disagrees.  </P> <P> "For the first time in a long time, the City finally took a step in the right  direction by eliminating that rule," said Vollnogle, who has been against the  no-fail rule since its origin.  </P> <P> "Students can now take a difficult class that they were not sure they'd pass.  So, a player can take that higher math course without being worried about  flunking out. It also gives us coaches a chance to work and counsel students we  would normally not have a chance with because they are now eligible."  </P> <P> Opponents of the no-fail rule said student-athletes are not graded fairly in  the midsemester grade reports, claiming it is a common practice for teachers to  give a student a lower grade in an effort to prevent the student from slacking  off later in the semester.  </P> <P> "This rule change will also help teachers because sometimes they are pressured  not to fail a kid to keep him eligible," Vollnogle said. "And it also will help  those teachers who always give kids lower grades at report time to motivate  them. Consequently, I just did not see anything good out of that rule."  </P> <P> Added Simpson:  </P> <P> "We are not teaching the kids reality. Allowing a kid to fail is not what it's  going to be like when they move out into society. What is lost is the fact that  it takes a real lack of effort to fail a class, and if a kid is still failing  while putting in the effort, he needs to get extra work and attention."  </P> <P> After searching for a qualified coach for two months without success, Reseda  Cleveland canceled its track and field season, forcing athletes interested in  competing to seek eligibility at another school.  </P> <P> The program was canceled when a replacement for Steve Landress, who last season  was the third track coach in as many years, could not be found.  </P> <P> According to Bob Kindseth, Cleveland's administrator in charge of athletics,  for a Cleveland student to compete at another school:  </P> <P>  -- Permission is needed from both principals and the coach at the second  school.  </P> <P>  -- The athlete would have to enroll in a sixth-period physical-education  course at the new school.  </P> <P>  -- The athlete would have to provide the necessary transportation between  schools.  </P> <P> Amy Jalewalia scored 60 points in La Quinta High's 85-32 victory over Kennedy  Monday to establish an Orange County girls' single-game scoring record.  </P> <P> Jalewalia broke the record of 59 set Cincy Vyskocil during the 1986-87 season.  </P> <P> TIMES' BASKETBALL POLLS  </P> <P> Through Games of Jan. 28  </P> <P> BOYS  </P> <P> CITY  </P> <P> No., School, League: Record  </P> <P> 1.

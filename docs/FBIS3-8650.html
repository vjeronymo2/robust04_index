			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Basic Human Rights Violated"] </F>   [Text] The Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM] Foreign Ministry expresses the concern and  bitterness of itself and the Macedonian public about the latest  agency reports that the Australian Government is preparing to  implement the decision to name the Macedonian community living  in Australia as "Slav-Macedonian."    The Macedonian Government does not intend to interfere in  the  internal affairs of any country, and in this case Australia, but  it feels the need to emphasize that by such an act the  Australian Government is violating the basic human rights of  loyal Australian citizens of Macedonian origin. By that act,  with the force of law, solutions are being imposed that are the  opposite of the generally accepted and successfully implemented  multinational policy of Australia, thus directly transferring  the misunderstandings and conflicts from the Balkans to the  decades-long peaceful multicultural milieu of Australia. It is  hard to understand that, with an legal act of the Australian  Government, the positive practice of Australia in this field is  being violated. That practice was, with its results, an example  of solving the multinational questions not only on the  Australian continent, but at large. Those positive experiences  have been studied and supported with great sympathy by the  Republic of Macedonia.    After the recent violent terrorist acts against the  buildings  of the Macedonian Orthodox Church and the Macedonian community  in Australia, which caught the attention of the world's public,  the Macedonian Foreign Ministry officially drew the Australian  side's attention to the unacceptable reasons for such terrorist  activities and the possible consequences, and requested urgent  action by the Australian state in detecting and punishing those  who endanger the order and peace of the prosperous multicultural  Australian society.  <H5>  [Box, p 1] </H5> <H5>  Protest of the Macedonians in Australia </H5>   Sydney, 13 March--According to the announcements of the SBS  Radio Broadcast in the Macedonian language, the Federal  Government has ordered all its institutions to refer to the  Macedonians as Slav Macedonians in the future. The Macedonian  community reacted strongly to this decision, and Chris Popov,  Goce Stefanovski, as well as some other influential  personalities in television stated that "if Australia does not  change this incomprehensible decision, the Macedonians will  embark on mass demonstrations...."    -- T.B.</p>

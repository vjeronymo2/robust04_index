			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 0725 GMT on 22 May 1994 broadcasts the 30-minute "De  Facto" program. Correspondent Oleg Vakulovskiy explains that  the May edition of "De Facto" was to have included an item about  the Black Sea Fleet, and a camera team was sent to Sevastopol.  In the light of recent events it was decided to devote the  entire program to the subject of the Black Sea Fleet.    In his introductory remarks, Vakulovskiy says that the Black  Sea Fleet has always been Russian or Soviet. Its warships are  currently flying the red flag, even though the Soviet Union no  longer exists.    This expedient has been adopted because the fleet is now  under the command of two presidents pending its division.  Vakulovskiy points out that such a division, however desirable,  will be very difficult. The Black Sea Fleet and the city of  Sevastopol have been in a unique position for a long time, he  says. No other fleet has ever been commanded by two presidents.  No other port has ever hosted two navies. Both sailors and  warships are suffering, Vakulovskiy says. He recalls that the  Black Sea Fleet had scuttled itself twice before, in September  1854 and in June 1918, and says it seems likely that history  will repeat itself in the 1990s. Vakulovskiy interviews Captain  Valeriy Zubkov, the commander of the antisubmarine warfare, ASW,  escort ship Smetlivyy:    He asks: "What is the job of your ship?"    Zubkov says: "The main function of this ship is to seek out  and destroy submarines and to protect naval formations."    Vakulovskiy then asks: "Is your ship the only one needing  repair at the moment?"    Zubkov replies: "No, the ship is not the only one needing  repair, but she is the only ship on which repairs are currently  being carried out. In fact, the repairs are in full swing and  nearing completion. Dockside testing is under way at the  moment. The ship is preparing for sea trials. I hope that this  will be completed in the near future.    Vakulovskiy asks: "Why has she been under repair for eight  years? Is this normal?"    Zubkov says: "No, it is not normal for a warship to spend so  long at the yard. Because of the collapse of the Union,  probably, the target time for completion has been postponed four  times. The fleet is aging -- dying, basically. If things carry  on like this, there will probably be nothing to share out in a  year's time. Almost 60-70 percent of the ships we now have, have  had the interval between overhauls extended. These problems are  not being tackled. Even keeping the ships in dock is a problem.  A number of ships that are supposed to be under repair are  stuck here.    But it is bad for the crews too. Even those ships that are  capable of putting to sea, do so less often. The crews are,  naturally, becoming rusty. Training in port cannot take the  place of practical work at sea."    After interviewing Lena Kolomiytseva, a local radio  journalist who witnessed last month's seizure of premises  belonging to the 318th reserve division of the Black Sea Fleet,  Vakulovskiy interviews Zubkov about strategic changes taking  place in the Black Sea. Zubkov says:    "Ships are putting to sea much less often. Above all,  warships are virtually unable to meet the objectives of combat  service. No vessels are on duty in the Mediterranean at the  moment. Naturally this affects the readiness of crews and the  skills of warship commanders. Here too trips to sea have been  substantially curtailed. This also affects crew training  levels."    Vakulovskiy adds that ships were putting to sea only rarely.  If they did leave port, it was not for months as before but for  a few days, in order to save fuel. Capt. Zubkov goes on:    "Any vacuum will be quickly filled. Warships of allied  navies, of the United States, used not to enter the Black Sea.  But last year a NATO naval squadron of nine warships sailed  into the Black Sea. Inexorably, NATO warships are taking over  the Black Sea theater. Turkey is also filling this vacuum by  developing and improving its Navy, by deploying new warships,  new types of weaponry."    Vakulovskiy recalls that a few years ago a warship of the  Black Sea Fleet, "Bezzavetnyy," rammed an American missile  cruiser, the "Yorktown," which had entered Soviet territorial  waters and refused to leave, even after a warning. In those  days the very fact of a violation of territorial waters was an  extraordinary occurrence. There were few U.S. vessels in the  Black Sea then. Now there are far more. Igor Korsakov, an  analyst employed by the Black Sea Fleet, adds:    "Because of the geopolitical changes that have taken place  in  the world in recent years, following the collapse of the CIS [as  heard], Turkey's policy in the world as a whole and its regional  policy in particular has, naturally, changed. Turkey used to be  a counterweight, in many respects, to Russia or the Soviet  Union. Now Turkish policy is to expand its influence on many  countries of the Black Sea, including those on the southern  border of the CIS.    Vakulovskiy asks: "Which countries?"    Korsakov says: "Romania, Bulgaria, Georgia, and  Turkic-speaking countries of the CIS."    Vakulovskiy says: "Azerbaijan?"    Korsakov replies: "Yes, Azerbaijan. The Turkish Navy now  consists of about 200 warships, including 17 diesel submarines,  12 destroyers including two guided missile destroyers, four  frigates including two guided missile frigates, 41 assault  craft, 33 minesweepers, and a large number of large and small  patrol boats, including those designed for minesweeping. NATO  experts say that in the very near future the Turkish Navy will  be a match for Russia's Black Sea Fleet on the Black Sea."    Vakulovskiy asks: "What is your expert assessment -- that  was a NATO assessment."    Korsakov says: "I cannot divulge these assessments."    Vakulovskiy then asks: "But in your own personal view, are  the NATO experts close to the truth?"    Korsakov replies: "I think they are very close to the truth.  In the next few years Turkey will become an even stronger naval  power."    Offering his views on the decline of the fleet, Admiral  Aleksey Kalinin, former commander of the Black Sea Fleet, says:    "When I handed over the fleet in 1985, the ratio of strength  between us and our closest neighbor, Turkey, was about 2.5 to 1  or even 3 to 1. In 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, it  was 2 to 1. Now, after two years of confusion and chaos, this  screw-up, it has fallen to 1:1. This ratio will continue to  deteriorate, I am afraid, if things go on this way."    Kalinin concludes his contribution by saying: "For more than  two years I have been saying -- both in the press and at various  meetings, reporting to both presidents and to delegation leaders  -- that there can be only one solution to this problem. This  solution is very simple. Since they have declared themselves to  be independent states, Russia and Ukraine should conclude a  treaty on an all-embracing alliance. This treaty should  stipulate that there will be a single maritime defense area in  the south for which the Black Sea Fleet is responsible. It must  be preserved."    The program is illustrated by extensive footage of warships,  in varying states of repair or disrepair, in port at Sevastopol  or leaving port. Some of the vessels shown are rusting hulks or  wrecks.</p>

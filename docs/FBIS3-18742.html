			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hani Faydi, Palestine Liberation </F> Organization representative in Spain, by unidentified program  announcer from the "Spain at Eight" program -- live]    [Text] [Announcer] Hani Faydi is the representative of the  Palestine Liberation Organization in Spain. Good morning, Mr.  Faydi.    [Faydi] Good morning.    [Announcer] First, is there any news about those  negotiations  in the UN, with that offer from Great Britain and Norway, who  could participate in a possible monitoring mission and above all  a mission protecting the Palestinians in the occupied  territories?    [Faydi] Well, the fact is we are working with them, we are  holding contacts with all the forces and the countries of the  Security Council, and we hope to achieve that, because it is the  only way to be able to sign or to achieve peace.    [Announcer] It seems that these nations are prepared to  participate in a commission of observers, but without weapons.  To be unarmed, which is what Israel wants.    [Faydi] We are asking for armed forces because forces  without  weapons would have to protect themselves, not protect us. So we  need armed UN forces to protect us.    [Announcer] How did the Hebron mosque massacre affect you  here?    [Faydi] The truth is that here we have all put our faith in  peace, we are optimistic and waiting for good news, because many  of us want to go back home now. With the massacre we lost  something -- a faith that we held with much hope. And the truth  is that we are waiting for Israel to make an important  declaration on withdrawal, on disarming the settlers and on the  protection of the Palestinian people, in order to breathe life  into the peace process and begin to achieve that stability in  the region.    [Announcer] But things are getting very difficult because  the  settlers have done a series of things, like the Hebron killing  and a series of other things, that are hard to control, even for  the Israeli army itself.    [Faydi] Well, you know it is a fait accompli, brought about  by successive Israeli Governments (?in) the occupied territory,  and I think it is the Israeli Government's problem. Because it  is the government, it must control them and find a solution to  this. I think that in order to be able to continue negotiating  peace, Israel must take important measures for its own security  and of course for our security.    [Announcer] Where exactly does the problem lie? In the  Israeli extremists, in the Palestinian extremists -- who also  exist and who are also causing a series of disturbances, seeking  almost to stop the peace dialogue continuing -- or in both?    [Faydi] Well, in reality the problem...[pauses] there are  several important points that we must resolve.    First point: the seriousness of Israel in the negotiations.  Israel is not taking the peace negotiations seriously. It  should have withdrawn on 13 December and did not and raises  difficulties in those negotiations.    Second point: the settlements. The settlements have shown  that 140,000 settlers are rather aggressive and fanatical and  act violently, as if they were paramilitary groups.    Third point: the passivity of the Army. The Army saw the  actions of the settlers, saw them shooting and killing  Palestinians, and did not defend them -- tremendous passivity.    Fourth point: The left-wing forces in Israel must put  pressure on the Israeli Government for these problems to be  resolved.    Those are the obstacles that we face. Anyway, the way  forward depends on Israel.    [Announcer] Today there is a meeting in Cairo between Yasir  'Arafat and Mubarak, the Egyptian president. Do you expect any  interesting, positive consequences or conclusions for the peace  process?    [Faydi] Mr. Mubarak is indeed the president of Egypt, and  the  ones who must provide means or resolve the problems are the  Israelis. And I think it is good and positive to negotiate with  our Arab brothers and talk about how the peace process can be  saved. But it is the Israeli Government that must provide  explanations and means and concessions.    [Announcer] But can Mubarak perhaps act as a mediator with  the Israelis too?    [Faydi] Yes, but I think that mediators are no longer  needed,  because we are in constant contact with the Israelis at  head-of-state level and foreign minister level, and I think that  after what happened in Hebron, Israel must be aware that it is  necessary to find a rapid solution in order to be able to  convince our people (?about) the peace process, in order to be  able to convince the whole of international public opinion that  the only solution is negotiation. But not as if nothing had  happened. There has been a massacre and it is necessary to find  solutions in order to be able to stabilize the region, the  situation.    [Announcer] Might not everything that is happening now be a  reflection of the weak position in which 'Arafat apparently  finds himself within his own organization, within the PLO? He  is being called into question for the way he acts, for his  excessive authoritarianism too, in a way?    [Faydi] Well, it appears that recently there is talk of  authoritarianism and all that. I believe that...[pauses] look,  the PLO is the only national liberation organization to have  come into existence with a parliament to guarantee democracy and  rights and self-criticism, critical self-criticism. But we are  of course away from our occupied land. We have to work every  day, constantly. We have Palestinian (?organizations) and we all  participate within the Palestinian institutions in the  democratic process and within the PLO. So I think that lately  they are talking about...[pauses] it is necessary to wait until  we have the state and see how government is going to be carried  out there. In any case the situation is complicated, not  because of the situation of the PLO, but because of the  situation that has come about and the massacre that occurred in  Hebron. All the solutions must come from Israel, not us.</p>

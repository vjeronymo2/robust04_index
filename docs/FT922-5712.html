			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Letter: Insights into investment performance of pensions Sir, Mr Lee Mallett (Letters, May 19) complained that he found it difficult to obtain details of the investment performance of pension funds and, if such performance were more widely reported, then he would find it easier to pick the fund of his choice. In fact there is one pension fund whose investment performance he is already entitled to know about and that is the fund of which he is a member or a prospective member. The Social Security Act of 1985 requires the trustees to produce an annual report giving information about, among other things, the investment performance of their fund. It is quite true that he is not entitled to similar information about the funds of other employers but neither is he entitled to join the fund of any other employer. There are good reasons why employers should be given every encouragement to provide good pensions for their own employees. It is hard to think of a single reason why they should be forced to provide pensions for the employees of their competitors.

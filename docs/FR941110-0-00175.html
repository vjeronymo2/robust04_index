			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 1919(h)(3)(C)(i) of the Act, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may deny payments for all current Medicaid residents but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this denial authority is exercised against the State, not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility. Only with respect to State-operated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities may the Secretary take action directly against a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility because section 1919(h)(3)(A) expressly provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are adding new &sect;488.418 to make explicit this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority. We provide that, if a facility has not met a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement, in addition to the authority to deny payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for all new admissions as set forth at &sect;488.417(a), HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has the authority to deny any further payment to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility for all Medicare residents and to deny further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment to the State for all Medicaid residents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under paragraph (b) of new &sect;488.418, if the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieves substantial compliance, HCFA resumes payment to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility or the State prospectively from the date that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verifies as the date that substantial compliance has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved, except as provided in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If payments to the facility or the State resume, no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments will be made for the period between the date the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy was imposed and the date that HCFA verifies as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date that substantial compliance was achieved. This is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case with both denial of payment for all new admissions as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as with denial of payment for those already residing in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Should HCFA or the State find that the facility was in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial compliance before the date of the revisit, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before HCFA or the survey agency receives the credible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence of such compliance, the remedy must be lifted as of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the date that substantial compliance was achieved, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by HCFA. The exceptions to this rule occur when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the denial of payment remedy is imposed for repeat instances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of substandard quality of care. The remedy is not lifted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until substantial compliance is achieved and HCFA believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the facility will remain in substantial compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 488.422&blank;State Monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters expressed concern that the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> did not provide for State monitoring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We disagree. The statutory authority for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State monitoring is implicit for cases of repeated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance (see sections 1819(h)(2)(E)(ii) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h)(2)(D)(ii) of the Act with cross references to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 1819(g)(4)(B) and 1919(g)(4)(B) of the Act for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare and Medicaid respectively).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters asked in what instances the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy of State monitoring is to be applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Act requires State monitoring in cases of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repeated noncompliance. That is, if a facility, on three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consecutive standard surveys conducted under sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1819(g)(2) and 1919(g)(2) of the Act has been found to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided substandard quality of care, State monitoring is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be imposed. Otherwise, State monitoring may be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as an optional remedy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters raised questions as to how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funding for State monitors would be met. Some suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that costs for monitoring be borne by the facility and not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be an allowable cost for reimbursement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We believe the costs of State monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be part of the survey and certification process and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, should be considered by the State survey agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in planning its annual Medicare and Medicaid workload. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> budgeted amounts for these activities are approved by HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as part of the annual survey and certification budget  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters suggested that we prescribe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the role of the State monitor in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We do not wish to prescribe the role of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State monitor; however, we have clarified language in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule describing in general terms the purpose of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State monitor. The State monitor oversees the correction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cited deficiencies and ensures that residents are protected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from harm. Any more specific description of State monitor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> roles and responsibilities will be addressed in manual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions to the State survey agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters expressed concerns regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the length of time State monitoring would continue. Several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters suggested that the State survey agency retain the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to monitor ongoing conditions in the facility until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State survey agency or HCFA determines the serious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition(s) have been corrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree with the commenters. State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring remains in place at least until HCFA or the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey agency determines that the provider is in substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the requirements of participation. In the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case of State monitoring imposed for repeated substandard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality of care, the sanction will stay in place until the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility has demonstrated to the Secretary or the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey agency that it will stay in substantial compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At this time, any serious deficiencies must have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrected to the point where the facility is in substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We received several comments suggesting we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> write qualifications for a State monitor in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Because of the broad spectrum of situations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in which State monitoring might be used, we choose not to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expand the current language in &sect;488.422(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

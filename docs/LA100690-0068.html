Joe Harwell said.  </P> <P> Officials do not know whether she was taking a bath or was placed there by the  killer.  </P> <P> Timothy Velasco, 22, of Van Nuys told Los Angeles police that he killed his  girlfriend and gave them details that led sheriff's deputies to Cleary's  condominium in the 1100 block of Bright Glen Circle, authorities said.  </P> <P> Despite Velasco's admission to the slaying, investigators have failed to find a  motive.  </P> <P> "We feel confident we know who perpetrated the crime.

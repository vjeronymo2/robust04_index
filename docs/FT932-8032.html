			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Golden opportunities go begging  -Minorco's plans for expansion are thwarted MR Hank Slack does not try to hide his disappointment. As chief executive of Minorco, he was ready to spend about Dollars 1bn cash on two acquisitions aimed at turning his businesses into one of the world's biggest mining groups. But both prospects slipped from Minorco's grasp. Mr Slack's goal was to transform Minorco, until 1988 a sleepy offshore investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation-De Beers group of South Africa, by reorganising its portfolio, shaking-up or turfing out existing operations and buying new ones. Many analysts suggest, however, that until recently the process has been painfully slow and not particularly impressive. Minorco's market rating said it all: its share price has languished at a 30 to 40 per cent discount to asset values. The two big opportunities would certainly have changed market perceptions. Minorco was offered the chance to join the world-class copper producers when British Petroleum agreed to sell it 49 per cent of the Olympic Dam mine in South Australia for Dollars 240m, plus Dollars 190m to repay loans. But Western Mining, the Australian group which had the majority stake in Olympic Dam, had pre-emptive rights to the BP stake. It kept Minorco in suspense for four months before deciding to exercise those rights. All might not be lost, however. Mr Hugh Morgan, managing director of Western, has invited the Minorco chief to bring a team to look over Olympic Dam. Analysts suggest this could mean an invitation to a piece of the action. Minorco's other disappointment involved Gold Fields Mining Corporation which the group hoped to buy from Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate. GFMC would have been merged with Minorco's Independence Mining subsidiary to become one of North America's top 10 gold producers. Hanson opted instead for an asset swap, handing over GFMC to Santa Fe Pacific in exchange for the US group's coal and aggregate operations. Mr Slack says Minorco is still looking for more gold opportunities, but that 'the prices being asked are still very fancy'. Most analysts suggest Minorco paid a 'fancy' price indeed for Independence Mining, which it bought for Dollars 705m from Freeport McMoRan of the US in 1990. There was, however, an important reason. Minorco started down its new strategic road in 1988 by making a Dollars 3.5bn hostile bid for Consolidated Gold Fields of the UK. Minorco owned 29.9 per cent of Gold Fields and acceptances took its holding to more than 50 per cent. However, a New York judge blocked the takeover, citing Minorco's South African ownership and Anglo's liking for cartels. Minorco gave up the Gold Fields battle, leaving the way clear for Hanson. Minorco collected Dollars 1.6bn cash for its Gold Fields shares. However, because of the New York ruling, it appeared to have no way of spending it in the US. But Minorco was eventually given the go-ahead to buy Independence. Mr Slack admits Independence's financial performance has been disappointing, but cost-cutting is under way. This includes dismantling the Independence board and the consequent streamlining of Minorco's cumbersome US management structure. There has also been a wider management shake-up at Minorco, which effectively had three managing directors: the original 'Young Turks' who persuaded Anglo that Minorco should change its style and mount the offensive against Gold Fields. Now Mr Tony Lea is being recalled to Anglo's headquarters in Johannesburg and Mr Roger Phillimore resigned because he lost the contest for the chief executive's job. The changes, however, have not diminished Minorco's appetite for acquisitions. In the past seven months it has spent about Dollars 337m on four deals: jointly with Anglo it paid Dollars 190m for one third of the Collahuasi copper project in Chile; it paid Dollars 66m for a half-share in the Lisheen zinc deposit in Ireland; it paid Pounds 55m (Dollars 84.7m) to buy Steetley Iberia from Redland, and Dollars 90.6m to swap an indirect interest in Johnson Matthey, the UK platinum marketing group, for a 10 per cent direct stake. Minorco's (and Anglo's) main interest was always Johnson Matthey. Now that Minorco has a direct shareholding in JM, it has no reason to retain its stake in Charter Consolidated. Minorco will also eventually sell Terra, a non-core US unit producing and distributing agricultural products. Minorco now has direct interests in two of the world's three big platinum marketing companies. Apart from 10 per cent of Johnson Matthey it owns 30 per cent of Engelhard in the US.</p>

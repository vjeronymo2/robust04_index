			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Transferring a holding I intend to transfer to my son part of my holding of SPLIT (Save &amp; Prosper Linked IT) capital shares, the price of which is substantially above that at which I bought them. To save market-makers' spread (substantial in this case) and broker's commission, I wish to execute a direct transfer form which my son can then register directly with S&amp;P. Am I correct in assuming that: 1. My son will have to send the completed form and pay  1/2 per cent of the market value to the Stamp Duty Office before he can register the transfer with S&amp;P. 2. This market value will be based on stock exchange closing price (as stated in the FT Cityline) on the day of the transfer. 3. A simple written letter from me to my son, signed by us both, will be sufficient evidence of this transaction andacceptable to the Inland Revenue for CGT purposes. Alternatively, I might wish to transfer these shares to my son as a gift, for no consideration. In this case, would the transfer be exempt from stamp duty? Also, would I have the choice of either effecting the transfer at present market price, accepting the CGT liability myself, or postponing liability (as in the case of transfer between husband and wife) until my son disposes of the shares? If you sell the shares to your son, the stamp duty will be based upon whatever price he actually pays you - as shown on the transfer form. If you give them to him, no stamp duty will be payable (provided that you complete the stamp duty exemption certificates on the back of the transfer form). For CGT purposes, it makes no difference whether you sell the shares to your son or give them to him: you and he will be treated as though you had sold them to him at their market value (on the quarter-up basis) on the day of the sale contract or gift, as the case might be. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction). The CGT rules for transfers between husband and wife do not apply to any other transactions. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

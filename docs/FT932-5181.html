			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: German insurer maintains payout AACHENER und Munchener Beteiligungs, the German insurance group, reports a slight dip in net profits for 1992 but says earnings for this year should be broadly maintained, Reuter reports from Aachen. The company made a net profit of DM73.2m (Dollars 45.8m) last year, against DM74.1m in 1991. It is paying an unchanged DM12.50 a share dividend for 1992 and plans to hold this rate of payout in the current year. Mr Wolfgang Kaske, chief executive, told the annual press conference that 1993 would be a year of consolidation, adding AMB was well-equipped to deal with the currently difficult trading conditions. Last year had been a year of change, marked by the turbulent addition of French state-owned insurer Assurances Generales des France (AGF) to AMB's list of shareholders and the sale of a large stake in its BfG Bank. Following the recent sale of a 21 per cent stake in AMB by Italian insurer La Fondiaria to a number of German banks and insurers, the AMB group would have a solid shareholder structure, Mr Kaske said. He said AGF and AMB would be looking to expand their co-operation in the area of home finance. AMB was currently trying to export the German concept of 'save-and-build' to France by means of AGF's distribution network, Mr Kaske added.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 08, BNS -- Some 100 to 150 people in  Vilnius may be related to communists and Russian  ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's party, the LIETUVOS  RYTAS newspaper reported with reference to the Lithuanian  National Security Service.    The newspaper said several members of the underground in  Vilnius and some other Lithuanian towns are constantly watched.  The security service knows secret addresses and routes used to  deliver underground communist publications to Lithuania from  Belarus and the Kaliningrad region, LIETUVOS AIDAS [as received]  said.    According to the report, the communist underground and  Zhirinovskiy's supporters became especially active when coup  leaders were amnestied in Russia.    Leaflets claiming that Lithuania is a historical territory  of  Russia and that Lithuanians are assimilated Slavs appeared in  some parts of Vilnius in late March.    LIETUVOS AIDAS said the security service sees no need to  detain any members of the underground yet because their  activities pose no major threat and it is better to watch them  in order to reveal the whole system.    The newspaper pointed out a connection between the communist  underground and the recently created Socialist Party of  Lithuania, whose program was published in an underground  communist newspaper.</p>

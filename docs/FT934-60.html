			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Shanghai to resume old role as China's financial capital Shanghai will resume its place as China's financial centre as part of the country's currency and financial reforms to be introduced tomorrow . Details published yesterday of plans announced on Wednesday to unify the exchange rate made clear that Shanghai, the financial and trading hub of pre-revolutionary China, would be the centre of a new currency dealing network. It also became clear that controls over the use of foreign currency by both Chinese and foreigners will remain strict and will even be tightened in some respects. The government said it would enforce a ban on circulation of foreign currency in China, though economists in Hong Kong said this would be difficult. The currency reforms take effect tomorrow at the same time as a fundamental reshaping of the taxation system. Banking is also being restructured to create a true central bank and streamlined commercial banks which will permit monetary control and credit allocation along western, market-oriented lines. The new banking system is to be the base for a national interbank foreign exchange market. The People's Bank of China, the central bank, will post a daily official rate for the yuan based on conditions in this market and taking into account the dollar's international performance. The market will take some time to establish. In the meantime, foreign exchange trading will continue in 'swap centres' across the country. Shanghai has the largest of these and its centre will become a national hub linked via computer to other main cities. A mansion which housed the central bank before the second world war will be the site for a new trading floor. Shanghai also plans to establish an interbank money market and a national gold market during 1994, and is expected to see growing trade in government bonds. Its stock and commodity markets are flourishing and it plans to establish a futures exchange. The fast pace at which China is proceeding with reforms, even before creation of the means to carry them out, suggests that the Communist party leadership is united behind them despite the vulnerability of the booming economy to inflation and overheating. However, controls on Chinese wishing to use foreign currency remain tight. Individuals must produce certificates authorising purchase of foreign currency, and will be allowed an amount based on the number of days they will be abroad, an official said. Foreign companies will be allowed to buy hard currency with yuan, but foreign individuals will be banned from changing yuan into other currencies. Economists in Hong Kong said it would be very difficult for China to enforce a ban on the use of foreign currency. Although prohibited, foreign currency is frequently used by mainlanders.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- China's legislature  adopted the country's first foreign trade law here today to  institute a unified foreign trade system.    It is claimed to be able to maintain a fair and free foreign  trade order and is believed to be conducive to China's  development in trade and economic cooperation with other  countries as well as facilitating the establishment of the  market economic structure.    The new law, consisting of 8 chapters and 44 articles, was  passed at the closing of the Seventh Session of the Standing  Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) today, over  which its chairman, Qiao Shi, presided.    The NPC Standing Committee also passed the State  Compensation  Law today to make state functionaries adhere to laws in their  operations.    It stipulates that citizens, legal persons and other  organizations will be "compensated for their losses or suffering  when their legal rights are harmed due to illegal deployment of  power by state functionaries or state employees."    The lawmaking body also approved three decisions today:    -- The supplementary provisions to regulations governing  offenses against public order, initiated by the ministry of  public security, defined 18 new offenses, targeting  newly-emerging public security problems in the country at the  time of reform and opening to the outside world.    -- The amendments to the regulations on active service and  rank of military officers of the People's Liberation Army are  meant to meet increasing needs of the reform and construction  drive of the the nation and the armed forces.    The first amendment takes two to three years off the ceiling  age for officers of deputy-army level, officers at the level of  deputy commander-in-chief for the greater military areas and  officers with elementary professional posts.    The latter one spells out the disestablishment of  first-class  (highest ranking) general. It also stipulates that no military  rank will be granted to the chairman of the central military  commission.    Wang Yingwei and 12 other persons today were added to the  membership of the Preliminary Working Committee for the  Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region.    The NPC Standing Committee appointed Nie Li as a member of  the NPC Internal Affairs and Judicial Committee, named Song  Ruixiang and Sun Jiazheng as minister of geology and mineral  resources and minister of radio, film and television, to replace  Zhu Xun and Ai Zhisheng respectively. Guo Zhenqian was named  auditor-general of the auditing administration to replace Lu  Peijian.</p>

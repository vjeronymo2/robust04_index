We  have confirmed that the 38 prisoners mentioned were indeed  released. Division General Castellanos Dominguez is in perfect  health and knows he will be released soon. Division General  Absalon Castellano will definitely be released.    The second point of the communique reads: We received the  letter from Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis dated 29  January 1994 regarding the establishment of buffer or gray  zones. We inform you that we fully agree with the entire  proposal from the peace commissioner for peace and  reconciliation in Chiapas in this respect.    The third point of the EZLN communique reads: In saluting  the clear intentions of the commissioner for peace and  reconciliation in Chiapas to make advancements to alleviate the  grave situation affecting the civilian population in the  conflict areas, the CCRI-CG will order the immediate withdrawal  of EZLN troops from Los Ejidos, San Miguel, Ococingo  Municipality, and Guadalupe Tepeyac, Las Margaritas  Municipality.

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / People: More Bodies on Shop board Natural cosmetics retailer Body Shop International has appointed its first non-executive directors, in a move to strengthen its board as the company becomes a global retailer. They are Penny Hughes, 35, president of Coca-Cola Great Britain and Ireland, and Aldo Papone, 62, former chairman and chief executive of the travel-related services arm of American Express, who is still a senior adviser to Amex. Body Shop said in August, when it changed the role of company founder Anita Roddick from group managing director to chief executive, and appointed Stuart Rose as MD - and before the recent round of criticism of the group's 'green' credentials - that it planned to take on non-executives. It did not want these to be 'token' directors to satisfy corporate governance guidelines, but people who could genuinely contribute to the business. Rose says the company has achieved that with its new appointments. Penny Hughes, he says, has particular experience in franchise management, an important issue for Body Shop. President of Coca-Cola GB and Ireland since 1992, she joined the company in 1984 from a marketing role with the Milk Marketing Board. Aldo Papone, says Rose, has a reputation in the US as a 'marketing guru' after 20 years' involvement in developing the American Express brand image. He began his career with Macy's department store group in 1956, and rose to general merchandising director, before joining Amex in 1974 as president of the travel division. His appointment strengthens the links between Amex and Body Shop; Anita Roddick appeared recently in TV advertising for the American Express card. Rose says Body Shop is still looking for more non-executive directors but will not give a number. 'We are looking for high-calibre people from diverse backgrounds,' he says. One ideally would be an industrial entrepreneur with international experience, another would have wide human resources experience.</p>

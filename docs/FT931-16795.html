			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / More fathers given time off THE NUMBER of companies offering men paid time off from work when their wives or partners have babies has increased dramatically in the past five years, according to the Confederation of British Industry. In 1987, only about 32 per cent of companies surveyed by the CBI gave paternity leave on either a contractual or a discretionary basis. By last year, that had risen to 76 per cent. Most companies give two or three days for paternity leave, with a small minority giving new fathers one or two weeks off. By last year, 36 per cent of companies surveyed by the CBI were giving paternity leave by contract, with a further 40 per cent giving it on a discretionary basis. The CBI says the service sector is much more likely to offer paternity leave than manufacturers, with about 60 per cent of service companies offering it on a contractual basis compared with 27 per cent of manufacturers. According to Mr Steve Palmer, the CBI's deputy director of employment affairs, the increase is partly explained by the increased interest that employers and unions have been showing in non-wage issues as wage increases have been squeezed during the recession. The granting of paternity leave had also became a trend among more progressive employers at the end of the 1980s. The survey of time off also finds that companies are still more likely to offer paid leave for military training, mainly for the Territorial Army, than for paternity leave. The most common reason for discretionary time off is bereavement, with 81 per cent of manufacturing companies offering two, three or five days leave. Although the service sector is usually more generous with discretionary leave, the manufacturing sector does better with standard holidays. The CBI estimates that half of all employees in manufacturing now get 25 days or more a year compared with only 20 per cent in the service sector.</p>

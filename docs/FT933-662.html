			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: European Airlines On the surface, the decision of Mr Jan Carlzon, SAS's president, to step down in order to work on the proposed pan-European alliance looks like a rescue mission. The delay in signing an agreement with Swissair, KLM, and Austrian Airlines suggests some fundamental stumbling blocks, and Mr Carlzon has staked particular credibility on the project. Austrian is still being openly courted by Lufthansa, so there must be a chance that at least the junior partner will drop out. But losing Austrian need not scupper a deal among the remaining three. Framing an agreement to satisfy four airlines, six national governments and innumerable trade unions always looked likely to take longer than the original timetable allowed. Decisions over job losses and where to site head office are politically charged. There is scope for disagreement over ownership. With the strongest balance sheet and newest fleet, Swissair in particular may feel entitled to more than the 30 per cent share originally envisaged. The main reason for optimism is that all three larger airlines badly need a deal. A strong balance sheet does not compensate for Swissair's lack of critical mass. SAS has the largest and most secure home market, but geography makes it weak in international markets. Burdened by debt - and with the memory of its abortive attempt to link with BA still fresh - KLM wants safety in numbers. Mr Carlzon's prophecy that there will be five European airlines by the turn of the century still looks correct.</p>

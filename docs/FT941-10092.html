			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Colombia poll row over US military presence The presence of 150 US combat engineers on the Pacific coast of Colombia has generated political embarrassment for President Cesar Gaviria just as he is canvassing for support to become the next secretary general of the Organisation of American States. The engineers are building a small school, a health post and a few miles of road in the village of Juanchaco, 190 miles southwest of Bogota, under a military co-operation agreement. However, the arrival of the US troops in December in great secrecy has turned into a highly charged pre-electoral issue, leading to anti-American protests and graffiti and a series of dynamite attacks on US-linked organisations. Colombia is holding congressional elections next month and presidential elections in May. The Council of State, a grouping of leading magistrates, released a communique this week saying that the president's interpretation of foreign treaties, on which the US agreement is based, ran counter to the constitution and violated national sovereignty. In an unusually heated press conference, Mr Gaviria defended military co-operation and stressed the importance of technical assistance in fighting drug trafficking. US military personnel are also helping to build a river operations base and installing radar in other parts of the country. The governing Liberal Party and its main election candidates have supported the president but the Council of State's ruling could lead to an investigation by Congress or by the attorney general's office. Congressmen joined Mr Rafael Pardo, the defence minister, in a tour of the construction site. Mr Pardo admitted there had been an information problem.</p>

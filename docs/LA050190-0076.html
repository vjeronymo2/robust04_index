			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> COUNTY ISSUE TENT CITY JAIL FOR DRUG USERS?  </P> <P> As part of stepped-up enforcement of minor drug offenses, Sheriff John V.  Gillespie has proposed housing jail inmates in two to four tents on a military  base. This would avoid further crowding of the County Jail. Gillespie is  negotiating with the Port Hueneme Naval  </P> <P> Construction Battalion Center to place the tents there. Inmates would be  assigned to work on the base and to clean parks and beaches. They would also be  required to attend substance-abuse classes or counseling sessions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Michael D. Bradbury  </P> <P> Ventura County district attorney  </P> <P>  "It's something the sheriff and I had discussed for about six months and  researched. As a general concept, I favor it. It would incarcerate people  presently avoiding jail time because of overcrowding.  </P> <P> With this halfway-tent approach, we'll be able to once again place some  sanctions on the casual use and possession of drugs. Judges may be more  inclined to put people in facilities where they're working to help clean up and  repair the military institution and the highways and beaches. And part of the  plan is to provide the inmates with education and treatment. Those are very  important goals toward reducing recidivism. Conceptually, I'm very supportive  of the project and look forward to hearing more details."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Richard Bryce  </P> <P> Assistant sheriff in charge of the county's jail system  </P> <P>  "We can't ignore the fact that there is a serious, ongoing drug problem in the  area not being attacked in the case of recreational drug users. They're the  ones who are creating major problems. Because  </P> <P> of them, people make millions of dollars a year and are gaining strength in  Columbian drug cartels. We've got to find some way to crush the demand.  Enforcement will bring people to the realization of what they're doing. If you  saw a doctor or an attorney or a schoolteacher you respect in the newspaper  arrested for possession and going to do 30 to 60 days in a drug rehabilitation  center, it would shock you into realizing how serious your actions are. People  in all walks of life are going to surface into this thing. A law is a law, and  it ought to be enforced. . . . If anything, it will help us deal with the  overcrowding. Some people in jail facilities now would be transferred to the  tents. Hopefully, it would reduce the number of people we ran into in the  future."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Kenneth I. Clayman  </P> <P> Ventura County public defender  </P> <P>  "Ithink that what we need for the individual who supposedly uses drugs is more  treatment and less incarceration. Loading up the system with more and more  cases would lead to an enormous financial  </P> <P> drain. I believe that the project is pursuant to federal funds but that those  federal funds would only go to the district attorney's office. The program  would create a need for extra defense lawyers and extra prosecutors. It's a  very expensive undertaking. There's also a great risk that people will be  warehoused and not treated, although the tent city may provide more treatment  than other facilities. I'm not sure the whole approach of going after the  casual drug user is correct. I'm not sure it's worth it to criminalize another  whole segment of the population."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Karrol Maughmer  </P> <P> realtor and president, Port Hueneme Chamber of Commerce  </P> <P>  "Idespise drugs. I would strongly support the sheriff's plan, assuming the  Navy is agreeable to being incarcerated on their premises, because it's not  fair to further crowd the jails. The Navy, I am sure, would  </P> <P> take very good care of the project. The so-called casual drug user is not too  likely to be a problem anyway, but I am sure their security would be well  enforced. The base borders Oxnard, so it affects both the communities of Oxnard  and Port Hueneme. But I think any incarceration of drug abusers is to the  benefit of both communities. I can't imagine that residents would be any more  concerned than I am because we have an exceptionally outstanding Police  Department in Port Hueneme, and the combination of that and the Navy security  would alleviate any concern of residents. I don't think the impact will even be  felt by businesses. I don't think people will even be aware of it."  </P></p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Books: Cinema all in the can MILLION-DOLLAR MOVIE by Michael Powell Heinemann, Pounds 20 601 pages THE SECOND volume of Michael Powell's autobiography comes to us from beyond the grave. The British film-maker died in 1990 after dictating these 600 pages, or a draft thereof, to his wife the film editor Thelma Schoonmaker. (His eyesight had become too poor to write or type.) She then edited them into shape, which must have been as daunting a task as her work on Raging Bull or GoodFellas. Yet the result is a wonder. All Powell's impishness and irony are preserved; all his flashes of absurdist wit at the expense of Korda or Selznick; and all his rosy-cheeked ebullience. For this was not only the gallows romantic who made A Matter Of Life And Death, The Red Shoes and Peeping Tom, he was also the only film-maker I ever met who tried to make everyone else go into films. 'Why aren't you making a movie?' he would cry whenever I met him, practically pushing a camera into my hand. Million-Dollar Movie begins in the late 1940s, as Powell's own creative high noon was turning to late afternoon. Yet tales of filming such accident-prone works as The Elusive Pimpernel (famous sneezing sequence), Gone To Earth (Jennifer Jones with Shropshire accent) and Ill Met By Moonlight are enlivened by an awareness of the corporate madness that cinema can be as well as by a willingness to take the can himself when he thought he was responsible for a failure. He was certainly responsible for one startling success: the now classic British horror film Peeping Tom. Powell is very funny on the scandalised press reaction at the time (1959, pre-Psycho). The movie, he records, 'was an insult to the film business, it out-cocked even Hitchcock, in fact it was all cock. What should be done with a film like this? It should be flushed down the water closet, with every responsible critic in London gleefully hanging on the chain.' It almost was. But even then Powell preserved his bonhomie. He carried on making films (They're A Weird Mob, Age Of Consent) or planning them (James Mason in The Tempest). And he created this magnificent double-decker memoir, which tells us all about cinema from the sublime to the ridiculous and back again.</p>

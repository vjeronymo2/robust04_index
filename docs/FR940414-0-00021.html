This action retains these inspection and possible repair or replacement requirements, but eliminates the dual compliance time of both hours time-in-service (TIS) and calendar time. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined that, since corrosion occurs regardless of whether the airplane is in service, the best compliance method for the proposed action is calendar time. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the wing structure because of corroded wing main spar lower cap angles. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective June 13, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of June 13, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Service information that applies to this AD may be obtained from de Havilland, Inc., 123 Garratt Boulevard, Downsview, Ontario, Canada, M3K 1Y5. This information may also be examined at the FAA, Central  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Jon Hjelm, Aerospace Engineer, FAA, New York Aircraft Certification Office, 181 South Franklin Avenue, Room 202, Valley Stream, New York 11581; telephone (516) 791&hyph;6220. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD that would apply to certain de Havilland DHC&hyph;6 series airplanes was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 28, 1993 (58 FR 68575). The action proposed to supersede AD 88&hyph;13&hyph;11 with a new AD that would retain the requirement of repetitively inspecting both wing main spar lower cap angles for corrosion, but require these inspections with a compliance method based solely on calendar time. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with the Accomplishment Instructions section of de Havilland Service Bulletin No. 6/492, Revision A, dated October 23, 1987.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. One comment was received in support of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of all available information, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these minor corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 169 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 8 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required initial inspection, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $74,360. This figure does not account for repetitive inspections. The only difference between this AD and AD 88&hyph;13&hyph;11, which will be superseded by this required action, is limiting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance method to only calendar time instead of both calendar time and hours TIS. Therefore, the required action will not impose any additional cost impact upon the public than that which is already required by AD 88&hyph;13&hyph;11.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

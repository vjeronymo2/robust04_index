			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> FIREWORKS CAP HOLIDAY SHOW AT MEADOWS  </P> <P> Appearing as a guest conductor, Pasadena Symphony music director Jorge Mester  led the Pacific Symphony through a competent if not very exciting concert on  July 4 to open the Pacific's second Summer Series at Irvine Meadows  Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> Naturally, there were fireworks.  </P> <P> The "All-American Celebration" actually was a Pan-American program, with the  inclusion of Mexican composer Jose Pablo Moncayo Garcia's "Huapango." A crafty,  colorful work, "Huapango" deconstructs and reassembles the rhythms and tunes of  three popular Mexican folk dances. (Unfortunately, no one bothered to include  program notes about this or any of the other works on the program.)  </P> <P> The orchestra played with vivid attention and modest sweep. But the strings  were often swamped, thanks to some murky, quirky amplification.  </P> <P> In any case, "Huapango" appealed irresistibly to visceral interests. The suite  from Walter Piston's ballet "The Incredible Flutist" made more intellectual  demands, which were well met.  </P> <P> Mester shaped the suave and witty dance tunes with affection, basked in the  written-in crowd-cheering section and skillfully evoked the eerie atmosphere  surrounding the magical title figure of the ballet.  </P> <P> Disappointing, however, was Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue," with piano soloist  Patricia Prattis Jennings venturing an introspective, sensitive reading and  Mester leading a plain-wrap, overt account of the work.  </P> <P> The conductor opened the program with a one-speed-fits-all approach to the  Overture to Bernstein's "Candide" and closed it with a series of marches by  Sousa, to which the fireworks were synchronized.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the taller housing erected over the stage in November caused  fire officials to order the fireworks display moved off to the right, so those  sitting in the first eight or nine rows of the orchestra section missed seeing  about 30% of the attractive, if less than spectacular, pyrotechnics.  </P> <P> The program was underwritten in part by Huntington Harbour residents Dr. and  Mrs. Wayne Allen. In dubious taste, Dr. Allen was brought on stage to conduct  the National Anthem.  </P> <P> The official audience tally was 9,516, a new high for attendance at a Pacific  Symphony concert.  </P> <P> Mester will return July 22 to lead the next summer program.  </P></p>

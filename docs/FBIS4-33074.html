			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina told the  ministerial conference of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] that the  movement's number one priority is the promotion of the Third  World countries' economic and social development.    During the opening of the conference, which is taking place  in Cairo, Egypt, Robaina said that for Cuba, the best guarantee  for a firm and lasting peace is the absence of hunger. Robaina  said this is how the human rights of all the inhabitants of the  earth will be respected. The Cuban foreign minister said the  world's current situation can best be summarized by an affluent  North and an impoverished South, and if the nonaligned countries  crossed their arms, one third of humanity would disappear.    In addition to his participation at the nonaligned  conference, the Cuban foreign minister met with representatives  of Libya, the PRC, Cyprus, Panama, Colombia, Italy, and Ecuador,  with whom he reviewed the need to find a common language to  achieve specific results.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Debate between National Party spokesman Andries Beyers and </F> Freedom Front spokesman Dr. Corne Mulder moderated by announcer  Freek Robinson in the Johannesburg studio on the "Agenda"  program -- live]    [Text] [Robinson] Good evening and welcome to Agenda.  Well, there are approximately 20 days left before the election  and the time is drawing near for people to understand more about  the policies of the various political parties. Approximately a  month ago, we began a series of debates between various  political parties involved in the election. Tonight we have the  National Party [NP] and the Freedom Front, and it is the first  time they are facing each other because the Freedom Front was of  course one of the last parties to register for the election. To  represent these parties tonight, we have Mr. Andries Beyers of  the NP, on my right, and on my left Dr. Corne Mulder of the  Freedom Front. Before beginning tonight we tossed a coin to  determine who would open tonight's debate and it was decided  that Dr. Corne Mulder would receive one minute to state his  views, thereafter Mr. Beyers, and at the end of the program we  will follow the same order. Well, Dr. Mulder, you have one  minute.    [Mulder] Thank you, Mr. Robinson. On 27 April, in all  probability, the election will take place. Now compared to  other elections in the recent past in southern Africa and  South-West Africa, Angola, and Rhodesia, we have here a  different situation in this specific election. We have  succeeded, through negotiations, to what I call, force open an  ethnic door in the interim constitution -- to force open a door  for ethnicity, for political parties to follow their ideals, and  this is contained in Article 34 of the interim constitution  which refers to the issue of self-determination. Now Article 34  makes specific provision for a community to demand any form of  self-determination, for this to be made possible in the interim  constitution. Provision can be made for this if there is proven  support. For this reason the Freedom Front is taking part in  the elections, to open this door of ethnicity, and to use the  opportunity to prove maximum support, real support, for the  Freedom Front's idea of self-determination for the Afrikaner  nation. This is what we are doing at present.    [Robinson] Thank you, Dr. Mulder. That was 1 minute and 15  seconds. We now give Mr. Beyers of the NP a chance.    [Beyers] I think I want to immediately second Dr. Mulder's  statements and say that the Freedom Front's decision to  participate in the election is a step in the right direction for  Gen. Viljoen and his people, as far as the National Party is  concerned. They are taking part in a one man one vote election  within an undivided South Africa. They are taking part in a  constitution negotiated by the National Party, to which they  have also contributed, and this is exactly what the National  Party plans, namely, to bring about a constitution making it  possible for parties to participate. I say that it is good for  South Africa that they do participate in the election. Their  decision to enter into the election lends legitimacy and  credibility to the new constitution, and they are doing what I  said last year in Parliament, that they and of course every  other CP [Conservative Party] member will have to do and this  is, in reality, to follow the leadership of State President F.W.  de Klerk, right into the new South Africa. Tonight I want to  tell Dr. Mulder and his people: Welcome. It is good that you  are here. When South Africa is democratized then we can begin  to seek solutions to our problems and we will find it.    [Robinson] Well, we will have to look at some of those  solutions and I would like to hear what the real policy  differences are between the two parties. Dr. Mulder?    [Mulder] There are far-reaching policy differences, Freek,  and there are several important differences, but before I touch  on these I want to react to statements made by Mr. Beyers, that  he is so brave [as heard] and happy that we have accepted  President de Klerk's leadership. That is not correct. We in  the Freedom Front can think for ourselves. We evaluate  political developments and we take the necessary steps to  achieve our ideals. We do not accept the interim constitution.  From the beginning we have said that the constitution is full  of defects. The amendments we have succeeded in forcing through  at the end of February, beginning of March, brought about  certain improvements in the constitution, concerning  self-determination, the establishment of a homeland council,  etc., but in reality there are practical problems with the  constitution. We reject it. The fact that one uses the  opportunity to prove real support for the principle of  self-determination can not be seen as lending legitimacy to this  constitution. A constitution's legitimacy does not depend on  whether people are voting or not voting. At the end of the day,  it will depend on whether this thing can stand the test of time.  We say it will not be able to do this, but we can use the  process to achieve our ideals.    [Robinson] So you accept the process and you are using the  process to arrive at a point where you can effect more changes?    [Mulder] Certainly, we say that the constitution is  defective. As part of the Freedom Alliance we have always  pressed for several changes and improvements to the  constitution. We pressed for amendments which were later  written into the constitution. We will come back to those later  -- after the NP was totally satisfied with the constitution,  even though it was full of defects at that stage. Now concerning  basic differences, I want to say the following: The Freedom  Front is demanding self-determination -- self-determination as  an internationally recognized principle.    [Robinson] Do you regard that as a difference, self-  determination?    [Mulder] Absolutely, a real difference.    [Robinson] Now let us stop right there for a while. Mr.  Beyers, does the NP accept the principle of self-determination  of not?    [Beyers] Well, the National Party went as far as writing it  into the constitution, after negotiations, that there could be  forms of self-determination. Indeed, there are meaningful forms  of self- determination built into the present constitution. You  see the problem thus far with the homeland -- and this is the  self- determination proposed by the Freedom Front and it is  their right to do so -- the problem with this is that the  proponents of this did not have a plan on the table with which  they could agree, even in their own ranks. The National Front  of Gen. Viljoen, last year, and he was the co-leader of this,  could not put a plan on the table with which the main members of  the Front, that is the CP and the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance  Movement], could agree. Indeed, the CP could not produce a plan  with which their own caucus members could agree. When  negotiations took place they demanded a homeland before 27 April  or they would wage war, according to Gen. Viljoen and Dr.  Hartzenberg, and President de Klerk said: Let's negotiate.  Eventually President de Klerk wrote into the constitution  exactly what they asked for, namely, a people's council, and a  clause according to which further negotiations would be  possible, concerning self-determination. Can I just conclude by  saying that State President de Klerk did his best to accommodate  them even though they could not agree amongst themselves. Then  he said: Since you yourselves can't find a solution let me make  this possible by amending the constitution, to make it possible  for you to also amend the constitution after the election to  make provision for self-determination. With this step Gen.  Viljoen took the gap, participated and this was the right thing  to do, and this is the success President de Klerk achieved.    [Freek] The specific question I wanted to ask you, Mr.  Beyers, is whether the NP, and you as a person, accept the  principle of self-determination regardless of what form it takes  in the constitution?    [Beyers] Yes, unconditionally, provided that it can be  practically achieved. It must be so formulated that it does not  disadvantage other people. When self-determination is  formulated in such a manner that it is not discriminatory toward  other peoples and toward other communities, then the NP is  inclined to accommodate it and, indeed, to press for it being  written into a future constitution and also the final  constitution.    [Robinson] What form would self-determination take in the  state which the NP proposes?    [Beyers] The NP says there are various forms of self-  determination. The only practical manner in which to negotiate  it is to give people the opportunity to organize themselves into  political parties and power groups, people with the same values.  They must then be able to negotiate within an open democracy.  We do not think it is practically possible to divide the  country into a confederation, a confederation of independent  states. The different regions and communities have too much in  common, and therefore we stand for a federal system, and we have  tried to include in the constitution as many federal features as  possible.    [Robinson] Thank you, Mr. Beyers. Let's take it a step  further, Dr. Mulder. Self-determination. We accept that there  are differences regarding self-determination. From what I see  in your documents, you believe in a confederal system. That  means that eventually you want to exercise your  self-determination outside a unitary state -- an own homeland.    [Mulder] We have from the beginning said that we want true  self-determination and all that it implies. I believe we must  dwell on this idea of self-determination for a few minutes,  because to a certain degree it forms the basis of our goal. It  is not correct to say, as Mr. Beyers did, that the state  president wrote self-determination into the constitution. The  South African Parliament wrote it in. The fact is that this  came about after the negotiation process in which the Freedom  Alliance together with other parties included in the Volksfront  [Afrikaner National Front] had negotiated it and insisted that  such a principle must be included. With all due respect to my  colleague, I should have expected that the NP would claim to be  the great patron which provided for self-determination in the  constitution. That is not correct. The whole issue was  negotiated. The NP was quite satisfied with the constitution as  it stood, without the principle of self-determination. In  December they moved it through Parliament and voted for it as it  was.    [Robinson] The way I understand it, Dr. Mulder, according to  what Mr. Beyers has said, the NP stands for self-determination  within a unitary state, self-determination taking place through  organizers of cultural groups, while your party stands for self-  determination outside such a unitary state. So the way I  understand it, they do not reject self-determination, they  merely interpret it differently.    [Mulder] The self-determination for which the NP stands is  contained in Principle 12 of the constitution. That is what I  call the Saturday night option, which says you can promote  social values on Saturday nights in your barn, listening to  music, and so on. That's not true self-determination. We talk  about true self-determination, internationally recognized, and  which makes it possible for a nation, a community, to make its  own decisions and govern itself. It's got nothing....    [Robinson] But then it must be in an own state.    [Mulder] It must be part of a geographical dispensation,  based on an own state.    [Robinson] An own state, an independent state?    [Mulder] We say we want a system for southern Africa which  will bring stability. We believe it is possible, if you can  have a system which provides for the maximum political  independence but taking into account the realities of economic  interdependence. The problem is not that self-determination has  failed up to now because there was no plan. Mr. Beyers, when he  was in the Afrikaner Volksunie [National Union], had a plan for  self-determination. They had maps, everything, but it was not  acceptable. So the problem was not whether or not one had a  plan, it was the position of the South African Government and  the ANC who continually pressed for a unitary state, which we  maintain is not a federation.    [Robinson] Would you say that self-determination in your  interpretation is only possible if it takes place in a  geographical state, separate from the rest of South Africa?    [Mulder] No. There are various forms of self-determination.  We believe that part of the solution for South Africa must  include self-determination for those communities which choose  it, linked to a geographical basis which we call a homeland.  But there are also other forms of self-determination, in which  one can, for example, attend to the interests of certain  communities through community councils. We are not opposed to  that, we say it is part of the solution. But if you cannot  accommodate self-determination on that basis you will not find a  solution.    [Beyers] Freek, I would just like to correct Dr. Mulder on  the inclusion of the writing of the principles into the  constitution -- the last of them were written in during March,  including the principle of he homeland council. Of course, this  came about through negotiation. But when the vote was taken in  Parliament, Dr. Corne Mulder's party, the CP, voted against it.  Only the NP voted for it. In other words, it was not forced  through, While they were opposing it, the NP made it part of  the constitution. The NP voted for it. But let's not get  technical. Let's look at the forms of self-determination as  proposed by the Freedom Front. I think we must determine the  truth. The Freedom Front has announced a new policy. They say  their policy is exactly the same as that of the CP; that the  only difference is that they are participating in the election  while the CP is not. What we would like to know from Dr. Mulder  is: Where is this homeland, and whether other people living  there will have rights -- voting rights. If these issues can be  sorted out, one can begin to negotiate the implementation of the  homeland. I know the CP's position. These people say they  share the CP's position. Can Dr. Mulder then tell us whether it  is the Freedom Front's policy that colored and black people will  not have the vote in their future homeland? It is very  important to resolve this issue so we can know what their policy  is.    [Robinson] Could I just add, meanwhile, before we have a  break. Mr. Beyers, last week I asked General Constand Viljoen  the same question during an interview. He responded to the  first question by saying the Freedom Front will go along with  what Mr. Hartzenberg announced as a starting point in  negotiations. So it seems as though we are going to debate the  entire evening about CP....    [Mulder, interrupting] But about the right to vote...    [Robinson, interrupting] I would like to [pauses]. I have  noted here in my diary. I would like to give content to policy  trends within regions, albeit a volkstaat or a new South Africa.  As I have been made to understand, Dr. Mulder's National Front  will participate in the election so that it can be determined  where the volkstaat is going to be, so you have the chance to  talk about borders before we go any further.    [Mulder] I want to just respond briefly to Mr. Beyers's  question. If the National Party had cooperated in the  negotiation process, we could have resolved the details of a  volkstaat a long time ago. We wanted to have this done before  27 April -- and this fact is already well known. However, there  were a few practical problems. The first one was that the ANC  had always questioned whether the National Front had substantial  support for the idea; and the second point -- one Mr. Beyers  harps on -- where was the geographic region? Regarding the  support, we had a problem with that. We said we wanted the  matter settled before 27 April, so that that date would not only  be the day of liberation for others only, but for our people as  well.    [Robinson] Good. Now you are going to participate, and you  are going to prove that?    [Mulder] We are going to take part, and we are using the  opportunity to prove that, because the practical problem had  been: Even though the ANC had agreed that such a referendum  could take place before 27 April, it had been the National Party  which had been the obstacle. And I say it was malicious; it had  not been in South Africa's interest; not in the interest of the  Afrikaner and that of the whites; only in the interest of the  National Party. The NP deliberately blocked it.    [Robinson] That political point has been made several times  already, including by yourself.    [Mulder] You are right, but the problem is so large that the  people out there should know about it. The fact is, if we talk  about the geographic region, then we negotiated by saying that  we do not only want to use the opportunity to prove maximum  support for the idea of a volkstaat and self-determination. We  also want to utilize the opportunity to determine the region  where our people physically find themselves -- the people  striving for this ideal. And therefore provision has to be made  so that votes come in for the Freedom Front for the sake of this  ideal, so that votes can be counted from every polling booth, so  that after the election our people will know where they stand.  Now to get to the specific point....    [Robinson] Thank you Dr. Mulder, allow me to ask. Granted  that homeland -- no matter where it is, how it is constituted,  or whatever -- it is there, whether it is part of southern  Africa, South Africa, federation or whatever, but that state is  there. What will go on inside that state. What policies are  you going to pursue?    [Mulder] The perception has been created that such a state  will be for semi-retarded people and therefore it is going to be  in a backward place and so on. Not at all. It is going to be a  modern state like any other state in the world, one that will  implement modern guidelines, normal world tendencies. So if you  talk about....    [Robinson interrupting] May I quickly ask you? I have with  me here a booklet with all the constitutional policies of the  various parties. And there is a whole series of different  issues. I have also gone through your policies, and I must say  with due respect, Dr. Mulder, within your policy principles,  except the principle of self-determination and a homeland, you  say very little -- if anything -- about what you want to do  inside that state. What is, for example, your tax policy? What  is your housing policy? What is your health policy? What is  your education policy? What is your policy regarding voting  rights?    [Mulder] We would have liked all those details to have been  finalized. It was not possible. Now we have brought about a  constitutional structure -- the Volkstaat [homeland] Council.  The Volkstaat Council will comprise -- after the election -- 20  members, with the exclusive purpose of analyzing all the  relevant detail about a volkstaat, to negotiate and bring the  matter to finality. Among others, legislative and executive  structures, the relationship of the volkstaat at provincial and  national levels, the boundaries, all those things.    [Robinson] May I ask you, Dr. Mulder, do you accept  democratic principles to be entrenched, the fact that there has  to be voting rights -- freedom to the right to vote? And what  about those who do not support the volkstaat?    [Beyers] For blacks as well?    [Mulder] Give me a chance to just complete my answer. Mr.  Beyers is so....    [Beyers, interrupting] I just want to know, it is  important....    [Mulder] Mr. Beyers, you have one little point which you  consider a good point. If you just give me the chance to  respond then you will have a peaceful sleep tonight.    [Robinson] Please carry on.    [Mulder] It concerns this matter about the right to vote. Of  course, each person must have the right to vote, but we differ  in principle from the National Party. We say it is not  democracy to draw arbitrary boundaries like is currently being  done in South Africa -- to dump all communities together under  one voters' list and then to say vote now, this is democracy.  That is in no way democracy. We differ on that.    [Robinson] Within your state, will there be any blacks?    [Mulder] There will be blacks, there will be all types of  people.    [Robinson] Are they going to vote?    [Mulder] Let me answer. It is not about blacks or  non-blacks. It will depend on who is a citizen of that state,  and who is not a citizen.    [Robinson] But will blacks be able to become citizens?    [Mulder] That will depend on the rules that will apply in  that state. I just don't want to create a state, I want to  create a state for Afrikaners. And as soon as you bring me a  snow white Zulu, then I will give you a black Afrikaner. It is  not about being white....    [Robinson, laughing] But aren't you being racist? You are  using the terminology....    [Mulder] No, no, no. You are asking me about black people --  that is a racist statement. All that I'm saying is that we are  in a dilemma because the Afrikaner is incidentally -- regarding  race -- white. That is not the only characteristic, there are  others as well. All I'm saying is....    [Robinson, interrupting] Let's put it differently and say  non-Afrikaners, or those who do not identify with the Afrikaner.  Will they be able to become citizens, and will they be able to  vote?    [Mulder] No, it will depend on certain things. They will be  treated on the same basis as any other noncitizen is being  treated in South Africa or in any other state in the world. In  other words, normal rights, human rights, all those things will  apply....    [Robinson] In other words the right of access to any place,  right to property?    [Mulder] Of course, but a person who is not a citizen of a  state cannot lay claims on the right to vote in that state.    [Robinson] So that is the only disqualification?    [Mulder] Of course, it is determined on the basis of  citizenship, not otherwise. In other words, the illusion is  created that it is purely about race. It is not about that. It  is about citizenship.    [Beyers] Could I just respond? You gave Mr. Mulder about 20  minutes to talk uninterrupted.    [Robinson] Go ahead.    [Beyers] You see, that is the problem -- namely that Dr.  Mulder has formed a party. He is asking people to vote for  them. But after his explanation here tonight, or attempt at  doing so, nobody knows what they will be voting for if they vote  for the Freedom Front. He cannot say, the simple question on  [changes thought]. Nobody knows this evening after Dr. Mulder's  talk whether there will be a right to vote for all in their  volkstaat -- yes or no. Nobody knows where the volkstaat is  going to be for which they are supposed to vote.    [Robinson] That has already been mentioned.    [Beyers] The point is this: If you vote for the Freedom  Front in this election, then you are voting for a secret. You  don't know what you are voting for; and this is the problem we  had, that the right-wing people -- and I was part of it -- up to  this evening, could not agree on a plan for a volkstaat. They  could not agree; and therefore it is a big problem to convince  other people who are against a volkstaat, to convince them to  agree to a volkstaat. I am saying tonight if people are living  in the illusion that somewhere in the world you will get a  situation that is tolerated where people, on the basis of their  race or on the basis of their language or whatever, will be  excluded from the right to vote in the country, region, town,  city where they live -- then such people are living in a total  illusion. There is no such thing. But tonight Dr. Mulder has  unequivocally said that regarding these important things for a  volkstaat -- they are only still going to negotiate them.  Whether blacks are going to have the right to vote in that  volkstaat -- they are still going to negotiate about that in the  Volkstaat Council. He does not even mention what their  standpoint is going to be in those negotiations. The point is,  if you vote for the Freedom Front in this election you don't  know what you are voting for. You will be voting for a secret.    [Robinson] Hang on, Mr. Beyers, you are giving a good  summary, and I'm sure Mr. Mulder also appreciates the fact that  his policy is being stated twice, even though under criticism.  Now we get to your views -- those of the National Party. I  would imagine -- and I've heard it before -- right or wrong --  that Afrikaners are saying that the National Party is not  telling them what is going to happen to them. What guarantees  are there for the Afrikaner -- if you say they must not vote for  the Freedom Front -- inside the state which the National Party  is going to offer them?    [Beyers] The National Party and the state president  realized in time -- before I even realized it -- that the policy  of apartheid could not continue; that it did not bring  protection for Afrikaners and my people. It does not bring  protection for my children. An alternate plan had to be made.  And this plan was that South Africa had to be democratized;  that racism had to be part of the past.    The state president had the leadership and the courage to  carry through an unpopular decision in this regard, thereby  leading his party and the Afrikaner on a new road to full  democracy. Now we are saying that the best protection that  there can be for Afrikaners -- and for all the people in South  Africa -- is that all people with the same values, Christian  values, values such as a free economy, private initiative; all  those people who share the same values -- and there are  thousands of them. Almost all the Afrikaners have those  values, all the whites have those values, the great majority of  coloreds, of Indians. A great number of blacks in South Africa  have those same values which the National Party and Afrikaners  have. And the state president has launched the initiative. He  opened up his party to them. He put those people together in a  power bloc.    [Robinson] What is the guarantee?    [Beyers] The guarantee is that -- and this is important to  the Afrikaner -- those values that he shares with those people  should triumph in a future dispensation. And if you gather  those people in one powerful force, as the National Party is  succeeding in doing, then that is the best protection which you  can offer them. And in that case you are negotiating a  constitutional dispensation in which those guarantees are  protected through checks and balances, through a bill of  fundamental rights, through constitutional measures such as a  constitutional court and so on. And I say...    [Mulder] And cultural values?    [Beyers] The same applies to cultural values. It is the  National Party which has entrenched this in the Bill of Human  Rights; and the National Party is the agent of every minority  group and the next government of national unity -- in which we  will be presented strongly -- to see to it that the conditions  of that Bill of Human Rights do support every minority group, of  which the National Party is part. We say that is the only way.  There is no other.    [Robinson] And if the ANC gets more than 66 percent in the  election?    [Beyers] We will stop the ANC from getting more than 66  percent; but disregarding that, the National Party negotiated so  that the 34 constitutional principles are never changed; that  they should not be changed through any majority. And we in the  National Party in no way believe that the ANC will get a two  thirds majority, but people must not be divided. They have to  stand together, and the only party to stop the ANC from getting  a two thirds majority is in fact the National Party. That is  why in the election people must not go and vote for small  parties such as the Freedom Front, the Democratic Party, and the  other insignificant parties. The only effective vote to stop  the ANC, to curb the ANC, is a vote for the National Party.  President de Klerk has the courage, the leadership, the vision.  He is a strong man, he knows what he is doing, and he will  protect our people's interests in the new South Africa with the  aid of a strong National Party.    [Mulder] That is commendable. Freek, I want to react to that  if you don't mind. I am somewhat surprised. The National Party  appears to be....[pauses] Mr. Beyers is saying the only way to  stop the ANC is to vote for this big powerful National Party.  I'm puzzled. Two years ago, Mr. Beyers stated in his manifesto  when he won the Potchefstroom by-election that the National  Party -- and it was not the old National Party but the new one  with Mr. de Klerk at the head and the ANC unbanned. What did  Mr. Beyers say in his manifesto? Tonight he is saying there is  only one way -- we must vote for the NP. What did he say in his  manifesto? He said there is only one way to stop the ANC from  stealing our land -- get rid of the National Party government  which is helping the ANC to establish a black majority  government in South Africa. He said get rid of the National  Party government, it's the biggest danger. Now he says this  evening that the National Party is the party to stop the  communists. Now I'm puzzled. The National Party, when  communism was unbanned, Mr. de Klerk said -- and I think I must  read it to you: The year 1989 will be known in history as the  year in which communism died. The wave of violence came to en  end when communism was unbanned. And now? Now he calls a press  conference to warn South Africa about the enormous number of  communists on the ANC's candidates' list. I'm puzzled. Has  communism come to life again? Or was the National Party talking  nonsense?    [Robinson] There are two questions which you asked. The  first one is a little below the belt -- hitting at your own  conscience, Mr. Beyers. You will have to bear the pain, and the  second is about communism.    [Beyers] Alright, I'll bear the pain. I have changed my  political views. I think Mr. Mulder has also changed his  political views.    [Mulder] Not at all, not at all. Same policy, same policy.    [Beyers] Let me finish talking. When I left the Conservative  Party, he and others said that when I started negotiating with  the ANC I was a traitor, and three months thereafter he and Dr.  Hartzenberg and others were negotiating with the ANC, and they  were not traitors then. I don't think that's the point. I have  altered my standpoint in politics for a better view. And that  is true. I really believe that what the National Party is doing  now is in the best interest of my people; because apartheid and  a volkstaat and separate development we have tried, and they  brought no protection to my people; and President de Klerk had  the leadership to look people in the eye and say let's embark on  another path, and he embarked on that path, and to me that seems  to be the best path to tread. I therefore have no doubts that  people will be wasting votes on other parties.    [Robinson] The question of communism?    [Beyers] Regarding the communists, up to now the CP and Dr.  Mulder have been saying to ban the communists, put them back in  jail. But they negotiate with Mr. Mandela and they negotiate  with Mr. Joe Slovo. Did they, while negotiating with Mr.  Mandela and Joe Slovo say, look, it is our policy -- you must go  back to jail and your organization must be banned. The National  Party maintained that to fight communism effectively you cannot  lock it up in jails. You must level the playing fields, you  must democratize the country, and then you tackle it on the  political playing field. And that is what the National Party is  doing. And the National Party has been right as far as that is  concerned. Now it is effective, it can fight communism because  it differs marginally with communism regarding economic policies  and so on.    [Robinson] Both of you, our time is nearly up. Now I give  you each a minute's chance to tackle each other.    [Mulder] You mean a minute to conclude?    [Robinson] Yes.    [Mulder] Thank you. I say that every voter out there who  again trusts the National Party is doing it at his own risk.  The voters out there should by now have learned that the  National Party cannot be trusted -- we have seen the referendum  promises, we have seen election promises -- there was nothing  for our people in it.    Secondly, the National Party has all along been in alliance  with the ANC during the entire negotiation process. I asked the  president to name one example where the National Party came out  in favor of Inkatha during the negotiations and he could not  name one because there is none. That is why it is easy to play  down smaller parties. The result will show who the small  parties are. If you want to vote against the ANC -- and you  must vote against the ANC as it is dangerous -- if you want to  vote against it, you don't have to vote for the National Party  for that purpose. The National Party cannot be trusted any  more; that is why you can trust the Freedom Front. It is the  only party which has fought for self- determination, which will  look after minorities. You can trust General Viljoen, and if  you do that, there will be a secure future for you.    [Robinson] Thank you very much, Mr. Beyers?    [Beyers] Freek, one thing is very clear this evening, and  that is if you vote for the Freedom Front you don't know what  you are voting for. You are voting for a secret. I say vote  for the National Party because the National Party is ready to be  the advocate of all peace-loving, moderate South Africans in the  next government of national unity. The National Party is ready  to implement its expertise in administration for the benefit of  all the country's citizens. The National Party is prepared to  allow the validity of our policy of private initiative to  triumph over communism and over policies such as  nationalization. The National Party is braced for the pressure  which will come come from the free world, and also from the  private sector, demanding a free market economy. The National  Party is in gear to accompany the new government of national  unity to accept a security strategy through which South Africa  will be protected. The National Party is ready and able to  protect the rights of minority groups, to implement the Bill of  Rights for the protection of our people. The National Party is  the only party strong enough to curb the ANC.    [Robinson] Thank you very much. All the best.</p>

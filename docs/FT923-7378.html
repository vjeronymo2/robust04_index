			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / ITN staff accept 3.5% pay offer The 700 staff employed by the ITN television news organisation voted yesterday to accept a pay rise of 3.5 per cent for the next 18 months following a pay freeze over the past year. The offer was initially rejected but union leaders said that many staff fear redundancy as a result of the tough stand that the ITV companies are taking in the renegotiation of ITN's contract with them.</p>

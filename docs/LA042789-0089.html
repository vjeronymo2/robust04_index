			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN TO REGISTER HOMEWORK SHELVED  </P> <P> Officials in West Hollywood have shelved a controversial proposal that would  have required people who earn a living working at home to register with the  city. TV and motion picture writers opposed the proposed law, claiming that it  smacked of "Big Brotherism."  </P> <P> City officials said at a Business License Commission hearing that they were  postponing consideration of a plan to license many of the city's estimated  3,000 to 5,000 businesses. While exempting from regulation writers, artists and  others who are self-employed and work at home, the law would have required such  people to register with the city clerk's office and pay an annual fee.  </P> <P> About 500 of the Writers Guild of America, West's more than 7,500 members --  who represent about 90% of all film and broadcast writers in the United States  -- live in West Hollywood, according to guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden. The  guild is headquartered in the city.  </P></p>

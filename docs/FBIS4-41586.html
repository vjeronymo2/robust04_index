			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku, June 25, IRNA -- Interior Minister of the  Republic of Azerbaijan Ramil Usubov Friday called for an  agreement with Iran on extradition of offenders and cooperation  in campaign against drug traffickers.    He made the call in a meeting with Iranian Ambassador to  Baku  'Ali Akbar Nehavandian.    The ambassador touched on the escalation of perpetration of  crimes against Iranians in the republic and called on the  relevant officials to pursue the case. Nahavandian did not  dismiss possibility of links between the crimes and the  forthcoming visit to Iran of President Geydar Aliyev and  stressed that no doubt such criminal acts were carried out by  certain power sources to prevent boosting of mutual ties.  President Aliyev is to leave for Iran next week.    Pointing to the unrestricted entry of people to both the  countries, Usubov warned against infiltration of certain  elements affiliated to sabotage groups. He regretted deplorable  happenings for Iranians in Azerbaijan and said that necessary  instructions had been issued in order to decisively confront  those involved in such incidents. The minister underlined the  importance his country attaches to Iran and said Baku would not  allow such crimes to be repeated in future. He said that  Azerbaijan has recently signed an agreement with Turkey on  extradition of offenders and in case a similar contract would be  signed with Iran, runaway culprits would be arrested and  extradited.    Some ten days ago the body of an Iranian national identified  as Mohammad Seyyed was found at his residence here who had been  murdered heinously.    Due to the follow up of the Iranian Embassy, the Azeri  president ordered formation of an ad hoc committee by the  interior minister to probe into crimes against Iranians in that  republic. However the Azeri media did not give coverage to the  murder of the Iranian national.</p>

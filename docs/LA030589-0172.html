			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN NEWS: UNUSUAL LAVENDERS  </P> <P> The lavender flowers and gray-green foliage of lavender plants are a part of  all Mediterranean gardens and should be in every California garden as well --  for the fragrance, color and a host of practical uses. T. DeBaggio Lavender is  an unusual nursery doing a mail- order business only in lavender plants, but  not just any lavender. He sells several special selections, including the  variety "Grosso," which is the standard commercial variety in France. He also  sells "Irene Doyle," a dark, heavy-flowering variety, "W.K. Doyle," an even  darker version, and "Susan Belsinger," a dwarf, 11-inch high variety. His  catalogue costs $1 and includes a growing guide, from T. DeBaggio Lavender, 923  N. Ivy St., Arlington, VA, 22201. 703/243-2498. Robert Smaus  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tugay Ulucevik, Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy  under secretary, has said that if the confidence-building  measures [CBM's] package is restored to its initial content and  if a balanced agreement is reached, this will grant benefits to  the Turkish Cypriot people -- benefits they do not have at the  moment. Ulucevik stressed that everything should not be assessed  from the economic angle and that the Cyprus problem should not  be seen as an economic problem only. He added that if the holes  in the package are mended, the Turkish Cypriots will gain  political benefits that are not easily discernible and that  cannot be felt immediately.    Ulucevik met with Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary  general's  deputy special envoy in Cyprus, at the Turkish Embassy in  Lefkosa [Nicosia] for three hours today. Turkish Ambassador  Cahit Bayar was also present at the meeting.    In a long statement to the press after the meeting, Ulucevik  said that there is nothing to fear or panic about and that the  Turkish Cypriots have a strong position in the negotiation  process -- a position they did not have for years. Be aware of  this, he said, and rest assured; do not panic.    Ulucevik stressed that nobody can force the Turkish Cypriot  people or Turkey to accept a solution, be it in the form of the  CBM's or in the form of a comprehensive solution. He pointed  out that in diplomacy, as in everyday life, no one can force  someone else to accept something. A package or solution not  accepted by the two sides will not be implemented, he said,  adding that pressure will lead nowhere.    Ulucevik said: If the Turkish Cypriot people continue to  defend their just cause at the negotiating table with wisdom,  faith, and patience as they do now, there is nothing for them to  worry about.    Ulucevik pointed out that government officials are working  uninterruptedly in Ankara in connection with this issue. He  said: Our aim is to help you and to reach the diplomatic circles  you cannot reach.    Ulucevik stated that the Turkish Foreign Ministry was one of  the first to point out that the present form of the CBM's is not  the same as the initial package the UN secretary general asked  the two sides to accept. With our intensive diplomatic efforts,  he said, we want the just position of the Turkish Cypriots to be  understood and not to force the Turkish Cypriots to compromise.    The Turkish Foreign Ministry official said that he discussed  the CBM's in detail with Feissel for three hours. He went on to  say that he told Feissel what the holes in the package were one  by one and that he pointed out the differences between what is  being said now and what was said before.    Ulucevik said that if an agreement is not reached by the end  of April, that will not be the end of everything. In the course  of the diplomacy, he said, an expectation was expressed in terms  of a date, but that does not mean that the package will be  forcibly imposed and implemented on that day. He said: You say  it here; we say it in Ankara. If the holes in the package are  mended, an agreement can be reached. If they are not mended,  then everyone must stop and think. Those who made the holes in  the package will have to be held responsible at that time.    Ulucevik said that there is nothing to panic about and that  diplomacy is following its normal course. Nobody can force  either the Turkish Cypriots or Turkey, he said, adding: Turkey  in particular will not allow anyone to pressure you.    Replying to a question, Feissel said that he held a  beneficial meeting with Ulucevik on the details of the CBM's.  He said that it is possible that an agreement can be reached by  the end of April but that he does not know if that will be the  case.    Asked if the long meeting with Ulucevik on the details of  the  package means Denktas has been sidelined, Feissel said that this  is not the case and that he will continue to meet with Denktas  as well.</p>

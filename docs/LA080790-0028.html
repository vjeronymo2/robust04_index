			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> DOCTORS, LAWYERS RAISE FUNDS FOR FEINSTEIN  </P> <P> A group of Ventura County doctors and lawyers raised about $20,000 Monday at a  reception to help Dianne Feinstein's campaign for governor, moving the  Democratic nominee a small step closer to the $10-million campaign she says she  needs to win.  </P> <P> The fund-raiser, one of about a dozen Feinstein will attend this week, is part  of the price of running for governor of the most populous state in the nation.  </P> <P> Although Feinstein raised $5.8 million through June 30, a tough battle for the  party's nomination in the June primary left her with only $645,344 in cash. The  Republican nominee, Sen. Pete Wilson, who had no significant primary  challenger, had nearly $4 million in the bank as of the end of June.  </P> <P> Monday's fund-raising reception was wedged into a quick, one-day campaign swing  that began in Santa Barbara with a policy statement on Feinstein's opposition  to offshore oil drilling and ended at the Ventura Harbor with a stump speech to  union leaders.  </P> <P> "It's a big race," Feinstein said, urging more of the crowd of about 100  lawyers and doctors to join her "cabinet" of $1,000 donors. "We don't just want  your money, we want your knowledge, too."  </P> <P> Most of those attending Monday's $100-a-person fund-raiser at the Tower Club in  Oxnard were attorneys who handle workers' compensation claims or physicians who  treat injured workers in Ventura County. The race is important to this group  because the governor appoints administrators of the state workers' compensation  program.  </P> <P> "It's a big fight against insurance companies and self-insured companies," said  Louis Vigorita, a Ventura lawyer who joined Feinstein's 2,000-member group of  big donors. He said Gov. George Deukmejian has disappointed doctors and lawyers  in the field by not looking out for the interests of injured workers.  </P> <P> "Pete Wilson would just be a rubber stamp of Deukmejian's policies," Vigorita  said. "Dianne is our future. We are hoping as a new governor she will help us."  </P> <P> In a speech Monday night to labor leaders at the Harbortown Marina Resort in  Ventura, Feinstein criticized Wilson, as a U.S. senator, for receiving "more  contributions from the scandal-ridden savings and loan industry than anyone  else in the entire Congress."  </P> <P> "Frankly, I don't believe California can afford to have a governor who is  beholden to the savings and loan industry," Feinstein told members of the Los  Angeles County Federation of Labor.  </P> <P> Wilson has said it was unfair for Common Cause, a self-styled citizens lobby,  to single him out as the top recipient of savings and loan political donations  because he had to raise money for two elections during a period that most of  his colleagues only ran for office once.  </P> <P> Furthermore, Wilson said he refused to intervene on behalf of savings and loan  officials and he has opposed legislation to bail out the savings and loan  industry.  </P> <P> At a policy speech in Santa Barbara, Feinstein said she opposed offshore oil  drilling and outlined several steps she would take as governor to protect the  state's coast from the dangers of an oil spill.  </P> <P> She said she would seek to extend state control over coastal waters from  today's three-mile limit to 12 miles out to sea. In addition, she said, she  supports establishing a $500-million fund from oil transport fees that could be  used for immediate cleanup of any spill and restore areas contaminated by oil.  </P></p>

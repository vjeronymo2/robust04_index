			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHY DENY DEADHEADS ACCESS?  </P> <P> I attended the Grateful Dead concerts Saturday and Sunday at Irvine Meadows and  would like to commend the Irvine Meadows staff, the security staff and the  Irvine Police Department. They did an excellent job of crowd control and  traffic control and were at all times that I saw extremely courteous, helpful  and professional.  </P> <P> Newspaper headlines Sunday implied a near-riot, property destruction and  widespread drug use. By Tuesday, however, Irvine Assistant City Manager Paul  Brady, the Irvine Police Department and Irvine Meadows management were stating  that incidents were few and isolated, blown out of proportion and no worse than  any other event, except for the traffic mess compounded by the air show. This  was our experience: great shows by the Dead, great event management, a great,  well-behaved crowd, with only a few "rowdies" who are not fans of the band.  </P> <P> The Grateful Dead should be welcomed back to Irvine and should not be banned  because of the actions of a few. Their annual shows add to our musical richness  here in Orange County and generate considerable income to local businesses.  What would make a difference would be much more responsible journalism -- knock  off the sensationalist stories about the life styles of a few that insult those  of us who are responsible, active members of the community.  </P> <P> BRUCE D. GILLINGS  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P></p>

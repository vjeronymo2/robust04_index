It amounted to  an unwarranted and intolerable interference in the internal  affairs of the country.    Advani reacted to Clinton's recent statements which were  earlier criticised bv BJP spokespersons and its external affairs  cell with a view to put the Kashmir issue into focus on the  national agenda. The observations made by Clinton while  accepting credentials of the Pakistani ambassador were totally  against diplomatic norms as such occasions were never used to  attack a third country, Advani said.    He reiterated that Kashmir was an integral part of India and  the Indian people were confident of safeguarding its territory.  He said the present US stand on Kashmir was against its earlier  view in which it had recognised Kashmir as an integral part of  India. [passage omitted]  *</p>

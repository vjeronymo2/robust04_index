			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (7): A sector that needs refor - The authorities have themselves to blame for an unsound banking system BUSINESSMEN, residents and taxi-drivers are unanimous in blaming the 'VI banks' for the worsening traffic and telephone congestion on Victoria Island. Dozens of new banks which sprang up on the island acquired a notoriety in 1990-91 as 'foreign exchange shops', buying foreign exchange at a 'subsidised' price from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and selling it to customers at a handsome premium. Many were not banks at all, because they had no deposit base and the only service they provided was to supply foreign currency. With their access to foreign exchange under the previous foreign exchange allocation system, all banks were guaranteed a weekly allocation of dollars; and with leading firms operating literally dozens of bank accounts, in an effort to secure enough foreign currency to finance essential imports, banking was a low-risk, high-return business. Then came March 5, 1992, when the naira was devalued, the parallel market premium virtually eliminated, and banks could no longer arbitrage between the official and the free markets. Suddenly, banking became a different proposition altogether. Firms no longer needed to operate multiple accounts to be sure of getting their foreign currency requirements, nor could they be held to ransom and forced to pay a premium for free-market funds, because the CBN and the autonomous market between them were able to supply the market's needs. By the end of the year, the strains were beginning to show, especially as the authorities forced banks to hold growing amounts of low-yielding 'stabilisation securities'. Those without a sizeable deposit base, by far the majority of the country's 120-odd banks, found themselves in volatile market conditions, paying anything from 30 to 80 per cent at different times of the year, for interbank money, but earning a maximum of 21 per cent on stabilisation securities. There were reports of 'defaults' in the interbank market as some of the merchant banks, in particular, were squeezed by high interest rates on their borrowings and a major reduction in income. According to the central bank, roughly one third of the country's banks are now classified as 'unhealthy' or 'distressed', which in at least half a dozen cases is no more than a euphemism for insolvent. These 40 banks, some of them the old state-owned banks which have been in trouble for years, and others from the new breed of VI banks, were barred from bidding at the weekly foreign exchange auction that was their meal ticket until a year ago. Recently, however, the pendulum has swung back in favour of the unhealthy banks. Once again, foreign exchange is being allocated at the auction, this time on a pro rata basis relative to the bank's application for foreign exchange. At the auction on March 11, banks were given less than 20 per cent of their bids, again forcing importers and merchants to scour Lagos for foreign exchange and to pay a premium for a 'blend' of official market funds at N25 to the dollar and free-market funds costing as much as N34. For the disqualified 40 banks, its vital to get back into the auction where there is easy money to be made. Clearly, none of this makes for a sound, healthy banking system. The authorities have only themselves to blame. Until the issue of new banking licences was suspended in 1991, they licensed just about anyone, provided he could put down the necessary initial capital N20m until February 1991, and now N50m. Banks were given until mid-1992 to raise their capital to the new level, but the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) subsequently reported that, at the end of 1991, only 16 out of 65 commercial banks and 15 out of 54 merchant banks had raised their capital ratios to the required levels. The CBN had neither the expertise nor the resources to provide the level and extent of supervision necessary, while rapid money supply growth ensured that funds were not difficult to come by. Although liquidity was not really an issue, because the foreign exchange traders were able to earn handsome returns with only minimal liquidity levels, the 1991 NDIC report found that 20 of 116 operating banks had been unable to meet the specified 30 per cent minimum liquidity ratio. Last September, the CBN set out six criteria against which a third of the country's banks were adjudged unhealthy or distressed. The criteria included: 'sound' management, prudential guidelines, minimum capital, cash and liquidity ratios, and a new 8 per cent capital adequacy ratio. Bankers say that some of the unhealthy institutions will not find it difficult to satisfy the bank inspectors the next time around, and already one bank has been allowed to return to the auctions. But with money market conditions set to tighten this year, the weeding-out process by liquidation, merger or takeover will gather momentum. In its medium-term policy document, the government accepts the need for moving beyond the classification of banks to closure or enforced restructuring and more diligent supervision than in the past. The return of the foreign exchange market premium may delay the process; but since any strategy of exchange-rate stabilisation implies a reduction in the 'real' money supply - that is, inflation running well ahead of money-supply growth over the next year or two - the going will get tougher for all the banks. Ironically, the stabilisation security technique of mopping up excess liquidity punishes precisely those banks that the authorities should be encouraging, the liquid and responsible performers. One merchant banker says that no less than a quarter of his balance-sheet value is tied up in stabilisation securities, on which the return is not much more than half his cost of funds. 'The more liquid you are, the more you suffer'. The N32bn now held in stabilisation securities (40 per cent of the money supply) is due to be phased out from April, as the central bank switches to an indirect system, in the form of open-market operations, to control liquidity. As that happens and the authorities are forced to pay market rates for their funds, rather than borrowing from the CBN, pressure on margins should ease as the banks earn 40 per cent or more on treasury bills, rather than 21 per cent on stabilisation securities. But at the same time, credit demand will fall as government borrowing is reduced and as high nominal interest rates, a falling naira, and declining domestic demand force traders and manufacturers to cut back their borrowings. Inevitably, the authorities will soon be forced to abandon their efforts to prop up the naira, and the arbitrage window being exploited by some of the banks will slam shut again as it did a year ago. The writing will then be on the wall for many of the 'unhealthy third'.  ------------------------------------------------------------ GROWTH OF BANKING INDUSTRY  ------------------------------------------------------------ Year     Commercial     Merchant               banks        banks  ------------------------------------------------------------ 1980             20            6 1985             28           12 1987             34           16 1989             47           34 1991             65           54  ------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Central Bank of Nigeria  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

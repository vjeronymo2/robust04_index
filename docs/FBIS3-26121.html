"The most important duty of  all Beijing authorities this year is to protect political and  social stability," said Chen, an arch-conservative who was one  of the chiefs behind the bloody crackdown on the 1989  pro-democracy movement at Tiananmen Square.    Chen, who is also a member of the politburo, made the  comments Wednesday after a municipal meeting, flanked by Mayor  Li Qiyan, the report said. "Our task will be harder this year,"  he said. "We must work hard to create a stable environment to  enable the success of the economic reforms."    Chen said that public order in Beijing was "generally good"  but there were still "weak points." It was necessary to  "strengthen security networks based on the masses," he said, in  an oblique reference to neighbourhood committees, which play a  major role in surveillance.    Chen's remarks add to a a series of statements by Chinese  leaders pointing to fears at the highest level of an outbreak of  social unrest this year. Major economic reforms are set to be  implemented in the coming months, probably adding to  unemployment and inflation, analysts say. Officials have also  expressed concern at the huge number of migrant workers arriving  in Beijing and other major cities.    In an apparent reflection of official unease, Beijing police  recently stepped up their presence, launching round-the-clock  patrols.</p>

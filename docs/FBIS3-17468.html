			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Mar 24, BNS -- Lithuanian Premier Adolfas  Slezevicius announced the government's intention to increase  electricity and gas prices to individual consumers, and also to  raise pensions and salaries to employees of state institutions.    At a press conference Thursday [24 March], the premier said  budget receipts were too small lately to increase salaries and  pensions, however the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of  Social Security were commissioned this week to consider  possibilities to increase payments April 1. "The step is very  hard in some aspects, especially considering preparations for  the inevitable negative consequences of introducing the  value-added tax."    The government increased budget salaries and pensions nine  times in 1993 and once this year.    The premier said the new gas and electricity prices will  most  probably be introduced when the heating season ends.    Slezevicius said electricity prices must be increased  because  the Ignalina nuclear power plant has to use much more expensive  nuclear fuel cartridges. One cartridge costs 60,000 U.S.  dollars and the plant needs 90 million dollars a year, he said.  Slezevicius said electricity prices remained stabile for nearly  a year. In his words, electricity bills now make up only an  insignificant part of an average family budget.    The press conference that Slezevicius attended was devoted  to  a continuing political dispute over the appointment of Vytautas  Skuodis to head the Lithuanian genocide investigation center.    The premier said he will "initiate" an investigation of  facts  suggesting that documents were stolen from the former KGB  building in Vilnius in 1991-1992. "This of course should have  been done earlier, but it is better to do it now than never."</p>

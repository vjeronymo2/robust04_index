			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Management: Refining the strategy - The impact of BP's cultural revolution Broadcasting one's ambitions can be dangerous. Any organisation which issues a public proclamation that it intends to become 'the world's most successful company' in its industry may well succeed in its goal of lifting the ambitions and performance of its staff. But it is also asking to be derided at the first sign of strategic problems. So is a chairman who, to achieve that vision, launches a cultural revolution based on values such as 'openness, care, teamwork, empowerment and trust', yet who is then forced by the strategic problems to tell his managers to prune their ranks sharply. His change process risks breeding widespread insecurity and falling into disrepute. Nor does it help if that chairman is then quoted as wishing that he could use his 'good brain' to deal with some of BP's problems himself, rather than waiting until his subordinates cope with them. This, on the face of it, may seem the fix into which the usually rumbustious and supremely self-assured Robert Horton has got himself at British Petroleum over the past few weeks. He has been pilloried for it by UK investors and much of the media. In that time it has become clear that BP is experiencing an unexpectedly sharp profits slump, that it is planning many more job cuts than most outsiders thought, that it may have over-estimated the level which the all-important oil price is likely to reach in the mid-1990s, and that it is preparing one of its four business sectors for possible sale. Last week BP revealed miserable profits for 1991, announced a disappointing dividend payout, and gave a gloomy forecast for the near future. The apparent humbling of Horton has attracted widespread attention well beyond investment circles and the oil industry, because the progress of BP's ambitious culture change programme is being followed avidly by western companies and consultancies. The question is whether Horton actually does risk being humbled over strategy, and whether BP's culture change therefore really is endangered. The answer on the first count has been debated extensively in the media. The most that can be said is that the jury is out. But does this mean, as some commentators have suggested, that the two year-old culture change programme, originally called Project 1990 but now expected to run well beyond 1995, could be at risk? Far from it, would be the reply of many BP managers. Not necessarily, is a more balanced answer. To most insiders, other than those disaffected by the fear of redundancy, it is the very success of the culture change programme so far which is enabling BP to be able to react effectively to the deterioration in its circumstances. Up to now the myriad of workshops, communications and training programmes, and new 'human resource' initiatives across the company, are thought to have cost it considerably more than Pounds 20m. The initial payback appears to have come in two main forms. The first is a rapid shift last year in the 'ownership' of change, from top management to employees at all levels. Not only has the approach of each business varied, but a number of initiatives within each business has welled up from below, rather than being imposed from above. This has helped produce the second payback from the change process: a growing pile of 'war stories' from all sorts of levels and parts of the group about how the new values and ways of working are boosting employee motivation, breaking down departmental barriers, cutting costs, and boosting revenues. None of it is conclusive about the change programme as a whole, but it suggests pretty good progress. One of the most influential and indicative developments has been the introduction throughout BP Exploration of 'upward feedback' - the appraisal of managers by their subordinates. This is now spreading to other parts of BP. Most telling of all in current circumstances is the way that many people are handling the need to rethink their own departments' activities, and if necessary to trim or cease them. In the past, the company would have ground almost to a halt for months, while top management wielded an axe in all directions. Now teams all over the organisation - from head office outwards - are reassessing in a participative manner whether all their activities are necessary, how far they really add value, and what that means for staffing levels. With one or two damaging exceptions, 'decisions are being made by those directly involved,' says another insider. 'That should create far better decisions than top management used to make, when it simply shared the misery around, and handed out brown envelopes'. Outsiders seem to have forgotten that Project 1990's primary purpose was not to make BP a warm and friendly place to work, as the list of new 'values' might seem to suggest, but to reduce overheads, committees and other layers of management - to 'cut the cost of complexity', as BP explained it at the time. As one management consultant says: 'It's an illusion to think you can embark on a change in culture, creating a flatter, faster, less hierarchical organisation, without shedding jobs'. Project 1990 meant that the entire BP organisation was in for several years of frequent staff reductions. The cut of 1,150 jobs two years ago at head office, and the much larger number that went in the exploration business, were only just the beginning, both for HQ and the businesses. Considerable upward pressure on Horton to cut the corporate centre for a second time was evident at a top management meeting in March 1991, just 12 months after the original streamlining was announced. Several business heads argued then that the centre still needed to demonstrate that, at its current size, it really was adding value. All this was before the prolonged recession and BP's latest profits slide created pressure for still more cuts - and fast. An additional factor is the group's growing keenness to subcontract as many services as possible. Much of its information technology needs have been 'outsourced' since Project 1990 was launched, and exploration last autumn set a possible example to the corporate centre and the rest of the group by subcontracting most of its accountancy work. The results of the corporate centre's current deliberations will be decided by April. Though further slimming was part of the new culture, it would be facile to suggest that job fears are having no effect whatever on the readiness of some people to be open with team colleagues, and to trust the company. At a top management review of culture change progress last December, the heads of the businesses agreed that 'as we remove complexity in our organisations and reap the benefits of Project 1990, job security becomes an increasing concern'. In line with the advice given to many companies by management thinkers such as Charles Handy, BP's top managers concluded that the group's traditional implicit 'jobs for life' contract with its staff should be replaced by a new employment strategy. A main plank of this will involve employees more in the development of their own careers, with 'personal development plans' agreed with each individual. These "PDPs" are being introduced across each of the businesses and in head office. They are intended to be exactly what the name implies, and are starting to be accompanied by a substantial increase in training and development for staff at all levels. But not surprisingly, given the current climate, they have been re-christened 'personal departure plans' by quite a number of managers - not just by those who are disaffected, but by many people who have jumped at the opportunity to take the quite attractive packages on offer for voluntary redundancy and early retirement. All the same, the PDP process could be damaged irrevocably if it became associated only with departure. Hence the priority which each of the businesses, together with the corporate centre, are now giving to the agreement of plans with each employee. On staff development, as in so many other aspects of the group's culture change programme, it is vital that BP's top management is seen to put its money where its mouth is - to 'walk as it talks'. In this, as in the way the company's current 'downsizing' is handled, Horton has been told by his senior advisers that, in the words of one of them, Roy Williams, 'it's now that the rubber really hits the road - the next 18 months will determine the success or otherwise of our culture change'. As Williams says: 'We're going to have to work hard at it to make it stick'. This applies to every level of management, but especially to the top. Paradoxically, Horton's newly-evident fallibility could work to everyone's advantage - provided that he can temper his all-knowing air. Otherwise sceptics will continue to argue that the many practical steps he has taken to empower people are being undermined by the tendency of his own instinctive management style to surge to the surface. That could damage the change process far more than any number of job cuts.</p>

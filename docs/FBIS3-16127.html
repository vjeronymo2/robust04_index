			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS correspondents Leonid Vorontsov and Aleksey </F> Korinenko]    [Excerpts] Berlin, 11 Mar -- The leaders of the military  departments of the FRG and Russia called the visit to the FRG by  Defense Minister General Pavel Grachev "very successful and  friendly." [passage omitted]    During the visit, a joint statement was signed in which the  sides called good relations between Russia and Germany a most  important factor of stability and security in Europe. Protocols  on mutual exchange in training soldiers and officers and on  cooperation in the sphere of environmental conservation were  also signed during the visit. [passage omitted]    German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe stressed, in  particular,  the importance of Russia participating in the Partnership for  Peace [PFP] program. He called Russia a most important partner  of NATO's. Pavel Grachev, in his turn, stated that he regards  this program as a document for the transitional period. "This  period began with the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and will end  when the countries which belonged to it, and also the states  formed in place of the Soviet Union, find their place in the  world community," he said, in reply to a question from an  ITAR-TASS correspondent. "They should become independent  states, both in economic and political terms, carrying out a  course for democracy, peace, and cooperation."    Speaking of the role of NATO in the system of European  security, P. Grachev noted that it was not just the North  Atlantic alliance which should take part in it, but also all  international organizations on the continent -- the CSCE, the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council, the European Union, and the  West European Union. The main role here, however, should belong  to "the main peace-keeping organization" -- the Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe. He did not exclude NATO's  integration into the common European process right up to this  organization being transformed into a unified structure. "Time  will tell what this structure will be like," P.Grachev said. He  spoke out in favor of Russia's cooperation with the North  Atlantic bloc and for its integration into it.    Touching upon the intention of a number of East European  states to join NATO, the Russian minister stated: "We will not  foist our will upon other states. We do not have the right to  do that, but we would like to see on their part the desire to  cooperate with NATO and not to be integrated into it."    Having noted that the final decision on the ceremony to see  off the ally's troops from Berlin would be taken at the highest  political level, both ministers stressed that this should happen  in a "worthy manner." "We would like to leave Germany as  friends," P. Grachev said, "all the more so since the Western  Group of Forces have formed good relations with the German  side." Volker Ruehe in his turn said, in reply to an ITAR-TASS  correspondent's question, that he would like to see every  Russian soldier returning home as an ambassador of Germany's.  The date for the completion of the withdrawal of troops,  should, in his opinion, not just remind one of the past but also  allow one to take a look into the future where cooperation  between the two countries will be developed anew.    In Berlin, Pavel Grachev and Volker Ruehe laid wreathes at  the memorial in Tiergarten to Soviet soldiers and at the  memorial to those who tried to assassinate Hitler on 20 July  1944.    Having ended his official visit to Germany, Pavel Grachev  will spend another two days on German soil. He will hold  meetings with the command and men of the Western Group of Forces.</p>

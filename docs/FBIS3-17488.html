			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Friday morning [25 March], Russia's State Duma  passed, by 268 votes against 10, with 4 abstensions, a formula  for the realization of its earlier political and economic  amnesty bill.    The Duma decided that criminal charges could not be dropped  against those who in early October 1993 committed criminal  offenses which were not part of what is known as the "Moscow  developments" and had not yet turned sixty.    The Duma decided that everyone who had committed economic  offenses before 31 December 1991, marking the formal breakup of  the Soviet Union, were to be pardoned.    Also, criminal charges were to be dropped against those who  resorted to fraud to appropriate state or public funds and  against those who appropriated especially large sums. The Duma  instructed courts of justice to see to it that this last  decision is carried out.</p>

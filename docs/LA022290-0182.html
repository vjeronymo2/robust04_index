			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH &amp; FITNESS: TEST'S SQUIGGLES ALERT DIETER, GIVE NEW MOTIVATION  </P> <P> Since he started a new diet and exercise program last November, Kae Ewing's  biggest problem has been motivation. He wanted to lose weight and get in shape,  but there just didn't seem to be room in his busy schedule for regular exercise  sessions.  </P> <P> As a result, the 55-year-old Newport Beach stockbroker, who agreed to let  Health &amp; Fitness follow his progress, has been frustrated because there  hasn't been as much progress as he had hoped.  </P> <P> In the first two months of the program, he lost 14 pounds, and in the third  month he dropped aonly a single pound.  </P> <P> Since then, the numbers have been moving again -- but in the wrong direction.  </P> <P> Even though he's been sticking religiously to the low fat, high  complex-carbohydrate diet recommended by his fitness consultant, Ewing has  started gaining again and now weighs in at about 250, up from a low in January  of 243. The 6-foot, 3 1/2-inch Lido Island resident's original goal, on the  advice of fitness consultant Joe Dillon of Irvine's Body Accounting, was 203  pounds.  </P> <P> Instead of exercising five or six times a week, as Dillon recommends, Ewing has  managed only one or two sessions a week.  </P> <P> But last week, Ewing may have found the motivation he needs, in the form of  some electronic squiggles so slight even the doctor didn't notice them at first  glance.  </P> <P> The squiggles showed up on an electrocardiogram taken while Ewing walked, then  jogged on a treadmill at the UC Irvine Executive Health Program. Although Ewing  had no symptoms or history of heart problems or any other chronic ailments,  Dillon recommended that he undergo a health screening just to be sure.  </P> <P> It's something he suggests for all his clients, Dillon says, "But it's  especially important for somebody like Kae, who has been sedentary for a long  time, who's a male over 40 and who is significantly overweight."  </P> <P> As we are reminded every February during National Heart Month, heart and  circulatory diseases are the nation's top killers, accounting for nearly 50% of  all deaths. The UCI program also screens for other problems such as diabetes,  cancer and their precursors.  </P> <P> But wouldn't Ewing have noticed something -- pain, shortness of breath, high  blood pressure -- if he had a serious problem?  </P> <P> Not necessarily, says Dr. James Lindberg, medical director of the UCI program.  "In 40% of cases, the first symptom of heart disease is sudden death," he says.  </P> <P> Unlike some busy executives who never find the time for a checkup, Ewing had  undergone treadmill tests before, always with normal results. But this time,  the tracings of his heartbeat showed slight changes as he exercised, changes  that Lindberg says "might indicate there's some coronary artery disease." The  coronary arteries supply oxygenated blood to the heart muscle, and when they  become blocked, heart attacks can occur.  </P> <P> "It's nothing definite, but it does warrant further investigation," Lindberg  says. He glanced at the electrocardiogram tracings immediately after the test,  but "the changes were so slight I didn't even notice them at first," he says.  </P> <P> The treadmill test was part of the UCI program's comprehensive evaluation of  current health, which includes an individualized battery of tests based on a  person's age, sex and condition. In addition to the usual medical examinations  such as blood tests, thyroid tests, urinalysis, blood pressure checks, the  Executive Health Program also takes into account such factors as stress level  on and off the job and even whether the person wears a seat belt regularly in  the car.  </P> <P> After the results from all the tests are in, Lindberg will sit down with Ewing  for a one-hour review of the findings and prepare a thick, bound personal  health profile for him, spelling out Ewing's chances of dying of a heart  attack, various forms of cancer or a motor vehicle accident within the next  decade or so. The profile will also include a specific prescription for  exercise, based on Ewing's current condition and capacity.  </P> <P> But Lindberg isn't waiting for the numbers to come back from the lab.  </P> <P> Immediately after he looked at the electrocardiogram printout and saw the  irregularities, he made arrangements to send Ewing to UCI Medical Center in  Orange for further tests. The first step, he says, will be another, more  sophisticated treadmill test, and if that confirms Lindberg's findings, the  next step would be an angiogram, in which doctors at UCI would inject dye into  Ewing's coronary arteries while a special X-ray machine displays and records  the results.  </P> <P> If there is a blockage in one or more of Ewing's coronary arteries, doctors may  be able to remove it without major surgery by using a technique such as balloon  angioplasty, in which a tiny balloon is inserted in the artery and then  inflated to flatten out the blockage.  </P> <P> Of course, there's a chance that those suspicious squiggles amount to nothing  more than a false alarm. Lindberg says there's roughly a 20% chance that the  results are a false positive and Ewing has no coronary artery disease.  </P> <P> No matter what the doctors ultimately conclude, Ewing says the preliminary  results have made a difference already. "When Dr. Lindberg called and told me,  it was like when you hit the jackpot on a pinball machine, you know, how all  the lights flash and the bells go off? And I thought, 'Maybe that's why I  should lose weight.' Whether they find something this time or not, this brings  it home that being overweight has to be a health hazard. Maybe this is what I  needed to get me motivated."  </P> <P> In a couple of weeks, we'll check back with Ewing and find out what the other  test results showed.  </P></p>

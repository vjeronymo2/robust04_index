			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> FULLERTON GIRL'S KILLER GIVEN 26 YEARS TO LIFE  </P> <P> A judge sentenced 21-year-old Michael Robert Pacewitz to 26 years to life in  prison plus a separate life term today for a night of violence that resulted in  the stabbing death of a 3-year-old Fullerton girl, the attempted murder of his  mother and a knife assault on her boyfriend.  </P> <P> But Superior Court Judge Richard L. Weatherspoon also included a recommendation  to state corrections authorities that Pacewitz serve his sentence at a prison  mental facility at Vacaville.  </P> <P> "I strongly recommend that he be sent to Vacaville at the earliest possible  moment," Weatherspoon added in his sentencing report.  </P> <P> The victim's mother and father urged the court to give the maximum possible  sentence to Pacewitz. Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown then leaned over the  rail and asked Pacewitz's mother, Elena Fontaine, if she wanted to say  anything. She started to speak, but fighting tears, finally shook her head no.  </P> <P> Prosecutors contend that Pacewitz killed the little girl to get back at his  mother. Fontaine used to baby-sit for her and treated her like a granddaughter.  </P> <P> Pacewitz had called the police March 3 after stabbing 3-year-old Marcelline  Onick 44 times while she slept next to her baby brother, who was unharmed, in  the Fullerton apartment where he was baby-sitting.  </P> <P> Just hours earlier, Pacewitz stabbed his own mother repeatedly at her Anaheim  home, nearly killing her, and assaulted her boyfriend who had run into the room  to try to help her.  </P> <P> Pacewitz first told news reporters in jailhouse interviews that Satan told him  to kill the girl. But later, he changed that to say that he thought the little  girl, and his mother earlier that night, were Satan.  </P> <P> The jurors who convicted him in just one day then deliberated another eight  days before deciding Pacewitz was sane. Most of them said later they didn't  believe any of the Satan story.  </P> <P> At today's sentencing hearing, the little girl's mother, Joann Boydston, told  the court that the crime had not only cost her daughter's life, but resulted in  the loss of her job, her apartment, her career goals, and a six-month  separation from her son, who had been sent to the Orangewood Children's Home  after the incident.  </P> <P> "This crime was senseless and morbid. Michael Pacewitz is a menace to society  and will be a danger to the public if ever turned loose," she said.  </P></p>

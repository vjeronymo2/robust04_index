			<p>BFN     [Text] Fighting has continued throughout the day in Rwanda.  The Rwanda Patriotic Front forces coming from the north have  managed to link up with the 600 rebels in central Kigali, but  they have not yet taken control of the city. The rebels said a  moment ago that they control four strategic points in Kigali.  Christophe Boisbouvier has just filed this report:    [Begin Boisbouvier recording] With the rebels coming from  the  north linking up with those who were holed up in central Kigali,  the regular army now finds itself surrounded in the presidency  district. Unless there is significant resistance from the  civilian population which has set up roadblocks in the streets,  the fall of Kigali seems imminent. It might, however, be more  difficult for the rebels to take the northern strongholds of  Byumba and Ruhengeri, since the government forces there are well  armed with artillery.    The rebels will, however, have to be wary of their success.  In statements today, they gave assurances that they would not  confiscate the state for the Tutsi minority. The Rwandan people  will judge them on their actions. [end recording]</p>

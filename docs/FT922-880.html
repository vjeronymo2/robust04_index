			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Shevardnadze puts down coup attempt in Georgia MR Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, survived a coup attempt in Tbilisi yesterday after a battle in which loyal troops recaptured television studios held by armed rebels loyal to the deposed president, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia. The Georgian president then flew to the Black Sea and initialled an agreement to stop the ethnic conflict in the breakaway region of South Ossetia. In the Georgian capital national guardsmen backed by tanks and helicopters regained control of the TV building in an attack after a government ultimatum ordered the insurgents to surrender within two hours or face an assault. At least three were killed when guardsmen unleashed heavy barrages of automatic weapon and tank fire at the rebels without waiting for the government deadline. Mr Patmary Adamishvili of the ruling State Council put the death toll from the assault at three, with 26 hurt, but earlier put the toll at 40. The government said the leaders of the short-lived rebellion, including a top Gamsakhurdia lieutenant, had been placed under arrest. The rebels, put at 300, seized the TV tower in the early hours of yesterday morning and called for the return of Mr Gamsakhurdia, now in exile in the Russian republic of Chechenia. After the coup attempt Mr Shevardnadze, flew to the Black Sea resort of Dagonmys and concluded an agreement with Russian president Boris Yeltsin aimed at ending the conflict in the breakaway autonomous republic of south Ossetia. Mr Shevadnadze said the coup had been partly aimed at preventing him holding the talks. 'We have signed an agreement on the principles of regulating the Georgian-Ossetian conflict, which includes everything, a ceasefire, mutual co-operation and so on,' Mr Yeltsin said before signing the pact yesterday. The Russian president was quoted in a pool report filed by western correspondents from the Russian Black Sea resort. Mr Yeltsin said the two sides would send buffer troops to separate the warring factions on the borders of South Ossetia, which is part of Georgia. South Ossetians want to merge with their ethnic kin in Russia's North Ossetia. Leaders of South and North Ossetia took part in the meeting between the Russian and Georgian leaders. 'In principle we have agreed over the next month to prepare a large political treaty between Georgia and Russia,' Mr Yeltsin said. The package of documents would propose measures to stop the conflict and end bloodshed, he said. The republic has suffered from increasingly bitter fighting in recent months.</p>

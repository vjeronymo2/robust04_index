			<p>BFN     [Text] Pal Tar, Hungary's ambassador to Washington, has  resigned. He explained his decision by saying that he undertook  this task at the request of the Antall government three years  ago, and this period ended with the elections.    The foreign minister has accepted his resignation, which  will  therefore take effect from 5 July. According to the cabinet  chief of the foreign minister, a decision of this kind by a  leading diplomat is not an extraordinary event in a  well-functioning bourgeois democracy. This can even be  described as an elegant step. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is  not aware of any similar move being considered by other  diplomats.</p>

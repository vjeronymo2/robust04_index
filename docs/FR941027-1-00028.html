			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before EPA would be able to approve the State of Utah UST program for any portion of ``Indian Country,'' the State would have to provide an appropriate analysis of the State's jurisdiction to enforce in these areas. In order for a state to satisfy this requirement, it must demonstrate to the EPA's satisfaction that it has authority pursuant to applicable principles of Federal Indian Law to enforce its laws against existing and potential pollution sources within any geographical area for which it seeks program approval. EPA is not satisfied that Utah has, at this time, made the requisite showing of its authority with respect to such lands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In withholding program approval for these areas, EPA is not making a determination that the State either has adequate jurisdiction or lacks such jurisdiction. Should the State of Utah choose to submit analysis with regard to its jurisdiction over all or part of ``Indian Country'' in the State, it may do so without prejudice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's future evaluation of whether to approve the Utah program for ``Indian Country,'' to include Indian reservation lands, will be governed by EPA's judgment as to whether the State has demonstrated adequate authority to justify such approval, based upon its understanding of the relevant principles of Federal Indian law and sound administrative practice. The State may wish to consider EPA's discussion of the related issue of tribal jurisdiction found in the preamble to the Indian Water Quality Standards Regulation (see 56 FR 64876, December 12, 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 9004 of RCRA 42 U.S.C. 6991c and 40 CFR 281.50(e), the Agency will accept written comments on EPA's tentative determination until November 28, 1994. Copies of Utah's application are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the ``Addresses'' section of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a decision to deny final approval to Utah. EPA expects to make a final decision on whether or not to approve Utah's program by January 25, 1995 and will give notice of it in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The approval effectively suspends the applicability of certain Federal regulations in favor of Utah's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for owners and operators of underground storage tanks in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 281  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Hazardous materials, State program approval, Underground storage tanks. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  This notice is issued under the authority of Section 9004 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended 42 U.S.C. 6991c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 5, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William P.

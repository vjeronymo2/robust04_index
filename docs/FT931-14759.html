			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Pay freezes spread in construction MORE than 20,000 employees of recession-hit construction companies have had their salaries frozen or cut, a survey by the Financial Times indicated yesterday. Pay at one group has been cut by 5 per cent. A separate poll of 80 senior construction executives conducted by Gallup for Building magazine revealed that almost two thirds of contractors expect to impose a pay freeze this year. Costain, the troubled construction and coal mining group, announced last week that it was seeking to impose a 5 per cent pay cut on its 2,800 UK staff from April 1. It is also making 150 employees redundant in addition to the 300 whose redundancies were announced by the group in November. Trafalgar House Construction, Bovis, Taylor Woodrow and Alfred McAlpine are among building companies which are imposing pay freezes this year. Contractors faced with large borrowings, deteriorating order books and falling profitability are under pressure from banks to restrain overheads. Costain, as part of a package to reduce costs by Pounds 11m a year, has cut its entertainment budget and downgraded executive air travel, with senior managers no longer allowed to fly first class. Company cars will be replaced with more economic diesel models. Taylor Woodrow, which last year froze the pay of middle and senior management, has said there will be no annual salary increase this year for its 9,000 employees. The company, which made a Pounds 16m pre-tax loss in the first six months of last year, has told staff that pay will remain frozen until the economic situation improves. The 4,700 workers at Alfred McAlpine, who should have received an annual pay increase in November, have also had their salaries frozen. Bovis, which should have increased salaries on January 1, has introduced a six-month wage freeze for its 1,000 UK construction staff. It says it will review the position in June. Trafalgar House Construction froze the pay of its 3,500 UK staff last October. It says it will review the position this autumn. THC cut its staff by about 400 last year. More than 400,000 construction jobs are estimated to have been lost by the industry since summer 1989. The Building magazine survey says that 58 per cent of housebuilders, 67 per cent of building materials producers and 59 per cent of consultants also propose to introduce pay freezes this year.</p>

A highly placed Western source here said on Friday that  Choe,  who flew into Beijing last March 6, met Jiang on Thursday  morning to exchange opinions on ways to expand economic  cooperation between South Korea and China.    "We understand that during the meeting Choe asked for and  gained the Chinese Government's positive support for the  refinery project being promoted in a joint venture with the  China National Petrochemical Corp. and Shenzhen municipality,"  the source said.    He added that the meeting between Choe, who serves as  president of the Federation of Korean Industries, and Jiang  lasted about 30 minutes and that Choe left for Korea after the  talks.    Sunkyong and the two Chinese partners have agreed to build a  1.5 billion dollar refinery capable of producing 100,000 barrels  a day in Shenzhen. Sunkyong is to invest 40 percent of the  capital.    "We believe the refinery project has virtually been fixed  with Choe's meeting with Jiang," the source said. "A formal  contract could be signed timed with President Kim Yong-sam's  visit here beginning March 26."</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Observer: Survival test The fact that Sir Peter Abeles, the buccaneering Australian tycoon who founded TNT, missed the group's annual meeting should not come as a total surprise. He lives a highly pressured existence. Sir Peter is expected to recover in about a week, but the episode bears out suggestions that he exhausted himself by working much too hard on trying to solve TNT's intractable problems over the past two years. More surprising was the announcement that Abeles is not going to spend his retirement, after all, helping to sort out the problems of Ansett, the airline jointly-owned by TNT and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. TNT says that Sir Peter had decided that Ansett's return to modest operating profits in the latest quarter meant the airline could safely be left in the hands of Ken Cowley, Murdoch's top man in Australia, who is joint chairman. A more likely explanation is that Ansett's owners may be nervous about Sir Peter's swashbuckling approach to the airline's problems.</p>

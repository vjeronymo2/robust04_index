			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Mexican trade deficit widens MEXICO'S trade deficit deteriorated sharply in the first half of this year to Dollars 9.4bn (Pounds 4.72bn), more than double that in the same period last year, according to the Finance Ministry, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. The deficit including revenues from in-bond plants was Dollars 7.1bn. Mr Geoffrey Dennis, chief international economist at James Capel, said the deficit was 'widening at a disturbing rate'. He expects the trade deficit this year to be about Dollars 18bn, and the current account to be near Dollars 21bn. The government had forecast a current account deficit for 1992 of Dollars 13bn. The deficit was pushed up by rapid growth in imports, which reached Dollars 23bn in the first half, 30 per cent more than in the period last year. Intermediate and capital goods made up Dollars 19.3bn of total imports, or 84 per cent of the total. The government has argued the growth in such imports is linked to the restructuring of Mexican industry, and will lead to higher exports in the future. Exports excluding in-bond plants (maquiladoras) reached Dollars 13.7bn, down slightly on the same period last year, according to the finance ministry's bulletins.</p>

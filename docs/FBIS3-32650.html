An AFP correspondent  reported on Sunday that the explosion claimed no victims.    The explosions and resulting fire were caused by an  irresponsible smoker. Dozens of buildings were damaged,  including a small 20-room hotel.    The fire had not yet been controlled this morning, six hours  after the initial blast, which occurred when a tanker truck  exploded. At the site, it was confirmed that firefighters have  limited resources with which to work.    The petroleum products stored at the warehouses on Cesar  Street, near the cathedral in the Haitian capital, had been  brought in from the Dominican Republic. Gasoline sells for 22  Haitian dollars ($7.5) [unit not given] on the black market.    The UN ordered an oil embargo against Haiti last October to  pressure the military government which seized power in 1991 by  overthrowing Jean Bertrand Aristide, the democratically elected  president of Haiti.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 18 (KCNA) -- Papers here today  dedicate articles to the 20th anniversary of the establishment  of diplomatic relations between Korea and Guyana (May 18, 1974).    NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article says that the  establishment of diplomatic relations marked an important  occasion in the development of friendly and cooperative  relations between the two peoples.    The Guyanese Government and people made achievements in  their  efforts to promote national unity, rebuild the country and  develop the economy, the paper points out, and goes on:    Guyana, externally pursuing non-aligned policy, is making  efforts for regional cooperation, keeping good relations with  many countries of the world, the neighbouring countries in  particular.    The Guyanese people support the Korean people in their  struggle for the independent reunification of the country.    To develop the friendly and cooperative relations between  Korea and Guyana conforms to the desire of the two peoples who  are struggling to build a new society.    MINJU CHOSON in a signed article says that the Korean people  wish the Guyanese people greater success in the work for  prosperity of the country.</p>

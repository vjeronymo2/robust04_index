			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Smoke signals from tobacco sales - Why Zimbabwe's growers fear the worst ZIMBABWE'S flue-cured tobacco auctions opened this week against a background of near-uniform economic gloom. The farming season now drawing to its close has been one of the worst anyone can remember - 10 weeks of searing hot, dry weather from Christmas to March was followed by some relief in the last three weeks; but this came too late for most crops. Late-planted tobacco has benefited, however. Only a few weeks ago the crop was forecast at 160m kg; now it is estimated at 180m kg, about 5 per cent more than last year's. Because tobacco is a hardy, drought-resistant crop, the industry, which has enjoyed boom conditions in the past two years, will be least affected by the adverse climatic conditions, though between a quarter and a third of the crop is believed to be drought-stressed and will fetch poor prices at the auctions. Both growers and merchants predict that the price will average about ZDollars 10 (USDollars 2) a kilogram this year, down 14 per cent from 1991 in local currency but 40 per cent in US dollar terms. It is always dangerous to read too much into the first week's sales, but when the floors opened on Tuesday growers were disappointed with the daily average price of ZDollars 7.74 a kilogram. Quality leaf attracted reasonable prices but droughty tobacco sold at a discount as expected. While it will be at least a month before the market settles down sufficiently to draw any firm conclusion, some growers see the first day's prices as confirming their worst fears. Comparisons with 1991 are misleading because that was an unusual season. In the first few weeks prices were lifted by a bitter battle between major merchants for market share. Then, in the second half of the season, prices rose further on currency speculation. With production rising in Brazil and India, and recession-stressed cigarette manufacturers preoccupied with cost-cutting, the merchants are anxious to keep prices down this year, especially as leaf quality will be lower. A major change from last year, too, is the steep rise in interest rates in the local money market. Tobacco bills, which were yielding 15 per cent a year ago, are now returning 30 per cent, and the merchants want to hold leaf prices down to compensate for increased preshipment borrowing costs. The Zimbabwean authorities, anxious to curb currency speculation, have ordered that leaf prices be quoted in US dollars in 1992. This will have an impact only to the extent that buyers believe the central bank can maintain the local currency at ZDollars 5 to the US dollar. While no one doubts the reserve bank's desire to hold the line, the recent loosening of monetary policy at a time of 30 per cent inflation suggests that the best intentions could turn to ashes in the second half of the year. Some economists believe Zimbabwe's current account deficit will reach USDollars 1bn, or 20 per cent of GDP this year, making it extremely difficult to maintain the existing currency value. Tobacco crop financing was responsible for a surge in money-supply growth last year because the central bank was prepared to rediscount tobacco bills, thereby fuelling monetary expansion. In an effort to avoid this, and meet IMF credit-creation ceilings, it has been agreed that 15 per cent of tobacco sales revenue will be withheld from the grower and used to finance export sales. The grower is to be paid interest at rates above prime lending on these involuntary savings, which he will get back early next year. An average price of between ZDollars 10 and ZDollars 11 a kilogram this year would value the crop at just under ZDollars 1.9bn, 4 per cent less than last year's record ZDollars 1.97bn. But the foreign currency value of the crop will be down by a third because of devaluation. Even so, tobacco will remain the country's chief export; when local processing is taken into account, the 1992 crop is forecast to account for USDollars 500m out of projected total export earnings of USDollars 1.6bn. With costs having risen at least 30 per cent in the last year, the predicted 10 per cent fall in local prices will squeeze margins. In spite of this, growing flue-cured tobacco remains the most profitable activity in Zimbabwean agriculture and few growers will incur the losses facing their counterparts in livestock, maize, cotton, oilseed and coffee. This year is likely to be seen as no more than a temporary setback and industry expansion will continue apace, particularly now that growers will enjoy 35 per cent export retention. This means they can use up to a third of their export earnings to purchase imports and, since many of them will have more foreign currency than they need, they will earn a handsome premium from selling the funds to commercial and industrial importers.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Knight cheerful at entry to lists: John Gapper talks to Sir Brian Pitman about the hitch in Lloyds' Pounds 1.8bn bid for C&amp;G On his first working day as a knight, Sir Brian Pitman had lost none of the ebullience of his last weeks as a commoner. Since he disclosed in April that Lloyds Bank had bid Pounds 1.8bn to take over Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, he has insisted that the deal will not be scuppered. 'In my experience, it would be very unusual if two boards of directors are determined to get together, and there are clear benefits to customers and shareholders, that they cannot complete the deal,' he said yesterday. C&amp;G is trying to revise the terms of the offer barred by the High Court. That has been the judgment of the stock market since last week's court ruling. Lloyds' shares have hardly wobbled, closing at 576p yesterday despite having leapt 48p to 585p on the day of the announcement. This has baffled analysts who say they should have fallen further. 'If I was a fund manager, I would be selling the shares aggressively,' said Mr Neil Baker, banks analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing. Mr Baker argues that Lloyds' shares will be 'very over-valued' if the bank fails to achieve the latest of a series of proposed acquisitions since the mid 1980s. It would be the third big setback to Lloyds' acquisition strategy. The bank was rebuffed in its 1986 attempt to take over Standard Chartered with a mixture of preference shares and cash, and in its 'proposed' Pounds 3.7bn bid for Midland Bank using ordinary shares and cash two years ago. The confidence of Lloyds' chief executive has not wavered. Sir Brian said that 'from the thinking I have seen' it would be possible for C&amp;G to devise a new scheme that would comply with the law. He also indicated that the pair wanted to avoid another scheme being tested in court. 'The Building Societies Commission will want to go through whatever is proposed, but I am hopeful that a scheme can be devised that they find acceptable,' he said. There was no regulatory pressure for Lloyds to clarify its intentions before C&amp;G came up with a revised scheme. Yet Lloyds could face a sharp reversal of fortune if the C&amp;G bid were eventually blocked, by regulatory constraint or a failure to persuade enough members to vote for it. This would not simply be because it would look accident-prone in failing to consummate large bids. The C&amp;G purchase answers two difficulties for Lloyds. One is that its UK retail banking business has been growing very slowly. There is little demand for loans, and it has already exploited the easiest opportunities to sell other products such as life insurance to its customers. The second is that it provides a way for Lloyds to use excess capital more profitably than simply investing it in money markets. Without a C&amp;G into which to plough its surplus earnings, Lloyds would face pressure from shareholders to come up with an alternative. Lloyds' attempts to grow by acquisition fall into three categories: Small agreed purchases of niche players. Examples of these acquisitions include its 1984 purchase of Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst, a German private bank, and its acquisition last year of the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation for Pounds 27m. Such purchases tend to be ignored because of their size. But Sir Brian argues that they exemplify Lloyds' strategy 'of selective market leadership. We do not have to be the biggest in any market, but we have to have a strong competitive position.' Large hostile takeovers, such as the tilts at Standard Chartered and Midland. Sir Brian defends the logic of both deals. Yet his appetite for hostile deals appears to have been diminished by the Midland affair. Other Lloyds directors were disturbed at the controversy it created. Medium-sized agreed deals. The obvious example, apart from C&amp;G, is the move which saw Lloyds swap a set of businesses, including its estate agencies and its unit trusts and insurance arm, for a 57.6 per cent stake in Lloyds Abbey Life in 1988. This also bolstered its UK retail banking business. Analysts differ on what sort of deal Lloyds might seek if it was left with its Pounds 1.8bn after being jilted by C&amp;G members. A fresh large hostile bid seems to have become less likely. But Lloyds would have to buy a lot of niche players in order to spend its money. One possibility would be a private bank or fund manager. This could help to meet demand for alternatives to savings deposits. But Mr Chris Ellerton, an analyst at SG Warburg, says it would cost more and involve more risk because 'you would be buying people rather than net assets'. Mr John Aitken, an analyst at UBS, says that Lloyds will not have much time because it cannot 'sit there while capital keeps building up'. He suggests that Lloyds might even be driven to a revolutionary move - giving the money back to shareholders in a special distribution.</p>

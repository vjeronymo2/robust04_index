			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Dong Huifeng (5516 2585 1496): "Chen </F> Ziying Says People Should Rest Assured of the Prospects of  Religions in Hong Kong After 1997"]    [Text] Beijing, 9 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Chen  Ziying, deputy director of the State Council's Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office, met today with a visiting delegation from  the Hong Kong Buddhist Association, headed by Rev Kok-kwong, and  expressed deep appreciation for the Hong Kong Buddhist  Association's benevolent activities over the past 50 years since  its founding. He asked the Buddhists in Hong Kong to rest  assured of the prospects for religions in Hong Kong after 1997.    Chen Ziying said that, according to the Basic Law, the  future  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] Government will  not impose any restriction on religious freedom. People with  religious beliefs, including Buddhists, will be able to openly  carry out missionary work and hold various religious activities  that are not in violation of SAR laws.    Temples, hospitals, and other rights and properties of  religious organizations will not be affected, and will be  protected by law.    In addition, religious organizations and individuals in Hong  Kong may continue to maintain and develop relations with their  counterpart organizations and individuals in other areas.    Chen Ziying said that between the Hong Kong and mainland  Buddhist organizations, Buddhists should show mutual respect  before the Buddha, and there will be no subordinative  relationship between the two sides. The religious circles in  Hong Kong and the mainland are welcome to visit each other  frequently so that they can increase exchanges.    Zhao Bingxin, director of the Hong Kong Social and Cultural  Affairs Department of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office,  was present at the meeting.    In the evening, Chen Ziying and Zhao Bingxin invited the  12-member delegation headed by Rev Kok-kwong to the Hong  Kong-Macao Center.</p>

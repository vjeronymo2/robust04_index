			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> 'COCAINE EPIDEMIC' HITS EUROPE  </P> <P> Illegal exports of Latin American cocaine to Europe have jumped sharply this  year, and some experts estimate they are running at almost twice their 1989  level.  </P> <P> U.S. narcotics officials and Latin Americans familiar with the  multibillion-dollar cocaine trade said today that large-scale overproduction of  coca leaf and a stagnant U.S. market have caused an unprecedented export drive  to Europe.  </P> <P> U.S. experts estimate that Europeans consumed about 90 tons of cocaine last  year. Based on seizures in the first nine months of this year, they forecast  the 1990 figure at between 160 and 180 tons.  </P> <P> "The Europeans are now where we (Americans) were 10 years ago," said an  official of the Drug Enforcement Administration. "They are facing a cocaine  epidemic."  </P></p>

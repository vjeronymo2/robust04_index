			<p>BFN     [Text] The parliamentary opposition is getting set to carry  out its civil disobedience campaign. In a statement read today,  the group pointed out that this civil disobedience campaign will  only apply to appointed representatives of state authority and  will affect all sectors of state activity. It will, however,  not harm the interests and activities of individuals and private  firms.    It may be recalled that for the past few days, human rights  associations have been mediating in discussions between the  government and the opposition. In a statement reported by this  radio yesterday, the spokesman of these associations called on  the two parties to refrain from engaging in any act or acts that  could compromise national unity, social harmony, democracy, or  the republic.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri says he will push  to establish links between the Association of Southeast Asian  Nations and the South Asian regional grouping.    The minister said yesterday that as ASEAN chairman he would  consult his counterparts at the ASEAN ministerial meeting in  July in Bangkok on ways to set up ties between ASEAN and the  South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.    Ties between the two groups were raised during talks between  the Thai and Bangladesh foreign ministers in Dhaka at the  weekend.    Bangladesh Foreign Minister Mustafizur Rahman told his  counterpart that the SAARC would like to set up joint activities  with ASEAN including economic and social aspects.    SAARC comprises Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and  Sri Lanka, besides Bangladesh.    Sqn Ldr [squadron leader] Prasong returned from Dhaka  yesterday after a two-day visit during which he cochaired a  joint commission meeting with the Bangladesh foreign minister.    Thailand and Bangladesh called for increasing trade between  the two countries and for the private sector to play a greater  role in this.    Bangladesh has potential and is a promising market for Thai  traders, especially in textiles, because of an abundance of  labour and very high domestic demand for the product, Sqn Ldr  Prasong quoted the Bangladesh foreign minister as saying.    Bangladesh called for Thailand to buy more products  including  urea fertiliser, paper, paper products, tobacco, tea and jute.    Two-way trade between the countries accounted for about $93  million last year with a surplus of $53 million in favour to  Bangkok.    Sqn Ldr Prasong asked Bangladesh to ease measures against  Thai trawers and fishermen illegally fishing in Bangladeshi  waters.    Dhaka will conside Thailand's proposal to set up of a  committee to solve this problem.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Looking down the barrel of the supergun: Ministry procedures are blamed for allowing British involvement WHEN British customs swooped at Teesport, Cleveland, on April 10 1990, it seemed an unusual move. They seized innocuous steel tubes, supposedly for an Iraqi petrochemical project. One week later Mr Nicholas Ridley, then trade and industry secretary, explained to parliament that 'the government recently became aware in general terms of an Iraqi project to develop a long-range gun'. It is now know Saddam Hussein's 'Project Babylon' aimed to produce several giant guns theoretically capable of threatening the whole of the Persian Gulf - and Israel  - with nuclear or chemical warheads. Moreover, three British companies were involved, directly or indirectly, in supplying components. How these companies were duped both by Iraq and the designer of the supergun - Space Research Corporation (SRC) of Belgium - and how they avoided export controls for so long, has never been fully explained - nor has the validity of Mr Ridley's claim that the government was ignorant of the affair until the last minute. Those looking for answers in yesterday's report from the Commons trade and industry select committee may be disappointed. After a two-year investigation the committee has plumped for the 'cock-up' theory, blaming inadequate procedures and communications in government departments. The events which prompted the investigation began in summer 1988, when the Department of Trade and Industry examined two UK contracts to supply steel tubes supposedly for an Iraqi petrochemical project. Without consulting the Ministry of Defence the DTI decided one of the contracts - placed with Sheffield Forgemasters  - did not require an export licence. Walter Somers, the Halesowen steel company which had a similar contract referred to the DTI by the Conservative MP Sir Hal Miller, a business contact approached for advice, was told it did not require an export licence, although the DTI referred the matter to a materials specialist in the MoD. The specialist said he could establish no definite military purpose for the tubes. His decision was based on two 10-minute phone conversations. In autumn 1989 the MoD and UK intelligence services received separate tip-offs about the Iraqi project from directors of Astra Holdings, the British defence group. Astra had recently acquired PRB, a Belgian munitions company, and discovered it was supplying propellants to Iraq for a very large gun. A report was circulated around the DTI and MoD, but no connection was made with the contracts for steel tubes examined the year before. The MoD specialist who examined the Somers contract did not even see a copy. This was blamed by officials on MoD 'compartmentalisation'. In spite of the warnings more than five months passed before British intelligence tipped off customs officers in April 1990. Their information prompted the seizure at Teesport of tubes made by Sheffield Forgemasters. Further British-made components were impounded at Patras, Greece. This version of events, however, ignores several questions raised during the investigation. These have prompted theories of a conspiracy involving western intelligence services and, possibly, the highest levels of government. The unanswered allegations centre on the following claims: Dr Christopher Cowley, supergun project manager at SRC, has claimed that from June 1988 Dr Gerald Bull, the gun's designer, kept British intelligence fully informed about the project until he was murdered in Brussels in 1990. If so, why did intelligence officers allow it to proceed and did they notify ministers? Evidence emerged at the weekend that the UK's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) intercepted communications regarding the supergun in autumn 1989, which were passed to an assessment officer in the cabinet office. From here they may have been discussed by the joint intelligence committee and included in a weekly intelligence summary sent to some cabinet minis-ters and the prime minister. Mr Gerald James, former Astra chairman, has alleged his company was steered into acquiring PRB, the Belgian company manufacturing propellants, by a number of prominent figures with intelligence connections. New documents were presented to the committee last week suggesting that Sheffield Forgemasters may have had closer links with other European companies supplying supergun components than was disclosed during hearings. The only two legal cases brought in connection with the affair - against Dr Cowley and Mr Peter Mitchell, managing director of Walter Somers - were dropped on the grounds of insufficient evidence. Dr Cowley claims this was because they would have embarrassed the government. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the attorney general, and customs officials refused to answer the committee's questions about these cases. Mr Christopher Gumbley, who had been arrested by MoD police on corruption charges, met Dr Bull in Brussels only hours before the scientist's assassination. He says Dr Bull showed him what appeared to be surveillance documents on members of PRB's staff and said British intelligence had used the company for covert operations. What could have been the motives for a conspiracy by the government and intelligence services? Some believe the government had a covert policy of bolstering Iraq against the threat of Islamic fundamentalism. Only when opinions about Saddam Hussein were revised in early 1990 was the project stopped. It may never be established whether it was incompetence or a covert policy that allowed arms and equipment to be supplied to a country which would end up at war with Britain.</p>

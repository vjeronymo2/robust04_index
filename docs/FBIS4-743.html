			<p>BFN     [Text] Channel Africa reported this morning that the  Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] has elected Afonso  Dhlakama, its leader, as Renamo candidate in the presidential  elections scheduled for October. Quoting the Renamo secretary  general, Channel Africa reported that the decision was made at  the minicongress being held at the Renamo headquarters in  Maringue.    The source said that Dhlakama's candidacy was unanimously  approved by all attending the meeting. Renamo's congress, which  was scheduled to wind up today, is now focusing on issues  relating to electoral strategy and it could last longer than  initially expected.</p>

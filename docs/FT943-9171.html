			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Relationship sours after 26 years - The Scholes-ABB disagreement The breakdown in relations between Scholes Group, the medium-sized UK maker of electrical installation equipment, and Asea Brown Boveri, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, looks at first glance to reflect a classic mismatch between giant and minnow. Scholes agreed late last month to a Pounds 96.1m takeover bid from Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate. But on Wednesday it said it was open to higher offers and revealed that, when the Hanson bid was received, it had reached an advanced stage of discussion with Felten &amp; Guilleaume of Germany to replace ABB as technology partner. ABB has a 4.5 per cent stake in Scholes, and has given an irrevocable undertaking to accept the Hanson bid. But for Scholes to be seeking to replace ABB indicates how far relations between the two companies have deteriorated in the past three years. Early in 1991, amid much fanfare, they announced the formation of two important UK joint venture companies, strengthening a relationship that had begun in 1968 with a licensing agreement. The first, ABB Wylex Sales (51 per cent owned by the UK company) was to sell the products made by the second, ABB Wylex Product &amp; Development (51 per cent owned by ABB). This was an expanded version of a 1980, Scotland-based joint venture producing high performance miniature circuit breakers. But it would offer a range of new products supplied by ABB, including protective equipment, infra-red sensors and emergency lighting systems. The 'little and large' element of the deal was apparent at the time - ABB's research and development spending alone was more than 10 times Scholes' annual turnover. But both sides saw attractions. For Scholes, the deal was intended to bring protection from the shocks of the European Single Market. The late Mr Reg Harrington, then chairman and chief executive, foresaw dramatic changes in a UK market which still had about 50 installation equipment suppliers, against three or four for each of the main continental European markets. With aggressive foreign companies buying into the UK market, he saw a broader technology relationship with ABB, Europe's largest installation equipment supplier, as the key to Scholes' survival. ABB, meanwhile, hoped that access to 1,500 Wylex outlets would enhance its position in the UK installation equipment market, where it had been less successful than on the Continent. The two sides' accounts of the breakdown vary, but at least they agree on one point - that the relationship was not living up to expectations. Scholes' talks with F&amp;G show it would be happier working with a company nearer to its size. But Mr Eric Drewery, chief executive of ABB in the UK, rejects the notion that the difference in size made failure inevitable. 'ABB is made up of many large and small companies and the relationship was between Scholes and ABB Stotz-Kontakt in Germany,' he says. 'The big world of ABB did not impinge on the relationship.' Instead, he says, 'there was a mixed bag of problems, some small and some large, which meant we had not got the mileage we expected out of the joint ventures. We felt that Scholes could have penetrated further with the technology we supplied'. Mr Bill Riches, chairman of Scholes, says the two had come to recognise that their arrangements were not working as envisaged and relations became 'quite strained'. One particular flashpoint has been the two-year negotiations for Scholes to buy Hanson's Crabtree electrical equipment interests. Mr Riches says that two years ago ABB indicated it would support a Scholes offer for Crabtree, contribute Pounds 12m to Pounds 15m (increasing its stake to 10 to 15 per cent) and support the enlarged group with its technology. But after BMW's purchase of Rover, he says, ABB decided it would not put new money into minority interests involving its technology unless it had some guarantee that it would eventually lead to control. Scholes could not provide such a guarantee. Mr Drewery says ABB had little interest in a minority stake in the enlarged company, and was not in the business of becoming 'a friendly banker' to Scholes. It likened its position to that of Honda at Rover to explain why it did not want an enlarged stake in the bigger group. Due to this impasse, Scholes started looking for another European partner that would do more than just supply technology, and started talking to F&amp;G. Mr Riches claims that ABB, seeing the writing on the wall, went to Hanson with support for a bid for Scholes. Mr Drewery emphati-cally denies this - as does Hanson - and says the idea of a bid for Scholes was Hanson's alone. Mr Riches says that, if a deal with Hanson is not concluded, he is confident that replacing ABB as Scholes' technology partner would not be contrary to its interests. F&amp;G would even be better. ABB, meanwhile, hopes Hanson will succeed. Mr Drewery believes the combined Crabtree/Scholes business will be more effective in marketing ABB's products in UK than Scholes was alone.</p>

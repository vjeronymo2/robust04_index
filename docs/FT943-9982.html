			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: European chemicals Half-year results from the German chemicals giants, starting next week, should confirm that European recovery has come earlier than even bulls of the sector dared hope. ICI and DSM have already reported volume gains running into double digits by the end of second quarter. Although selling prices are not much higher than this time last year, the upwards trend from the trough reached in the final months of 1993 is clear. With capacity utilisation rates already pushing towards 90 per cent in some areas, there are surely further pricing gains to come. This is good news for this year's profits. In addition to strong volume gains through the first half of the year, the usual third quarter lull in activity has failed to materialise. But the broader question is whether the peak in chemicals industry profits will come sooner or last longer than investors hitherto expected. The recent growth trend gives grounds for optimism on the first count - barring an unforeseen event such as an oil shock. How long the peak lasts depends on the industry's ability to resist investing in excess capacity during the upswing. But big capital programmes announced this year or next would take some years to complete. If the profits peak comes in 1996-97, there could be at least a short plateau rather than an immediate downswing. The big European chemicals companies have been outperforming their local stock markets for about a year on expectations of a slow, sluggish recovery. Given the quickening pace of the upturn it would be extraordinary if they now fell behind.</p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE EXPECTED TO RULE FOR CRUMP'S ATTORNEY;  </P> <P> GATHERS' AFTERMATH: L.A. PROBATE COURT APPEARS SET TO GIVE PHILADELPHIA LAWYER  CONTROL OF ESTATE.  </P> <P> Philadelphia attorney Martin Krimsky is expected to be appointed as the special  administrator in California of Hank Gathers' estate by a Los Angeles probate  court today.  </P> <P> A legal battle surrounding Gathers' death began this week with attorneys  representing the Gathers' family and Gathers' son fighting to be appointed to  administrate the estate, which at this time has little value.  </P> <P> Gathers, the former Loyola Marymount basketball star, collapsed during a game  March 4 at Gersten Pavilion and died shortly after.  </P> <P> Tuesday's hearing, held in closed chambers, was a result of a petition  requesting that Gathers' brother, Derrick, be appointed administrator.  </P> <P> Arguing against that petition was Krimsky, who already has been appointed  administrator of the estate by a Pennsylvania court. He received the  appointment at the request of Marva Crump, the mother of Gathers' only child,  6-year-old son Aaron Crump, who was born out of wedlock.  </P> <P> Commissioner Robert J. Blaylock of Los Angeles probate court is expected to  announce his decision this morning. Attorneys representing each side, however,  said Tuesday that Krimsky would be appointed.  </P> <P> Bruce Fagel, a Beverly Hills attorney representing the Gathers -- mother  Lucille, brothers Derrick and Charles and Lucille's sister, Carol Livingston --  said Tuesday during a news conference that he does not believe that Aaron Crump  is the sole heir to the estate.  </P> <P> He said that Derrick Gathers should be appointed as administrator because he  best knows what Hank Gathers intended if he became an NBA star.  </P> <P> Derrick Gathers, also attending the news conference, said the family plans to  take care of Aaron the way Hank "would have wanted."  </P> <P> Krimsky's appointment will allow him to file claims and act on behalf of the  Gathers' estate in California. Krimsky would serve in that capacity until a  general administrator is appointed, which is expected to be decided April 16.  </P> <P> Krimsky and Derrick Gathers have filed petitions in Los Angeles requesting to  be appointed general administrator.  </P> <P> The issue of who is administrator is pertinent because it will determine which  attorney has power to authorize lawsuits filed on behalf of the estate. That  could be important if film rights or publication rights to the story of  Gathers' life are sold.  </P> <P> Not all lawsuits, however, need the authorization of the administrator. Those  affected in wrongful death suits are entitled to file separate claims. In  California, wrongful death suits cannot be filed by the estate. The estate can  file survivor claims. If a suit existed before a death, the estate could  continue the action.  </P> <P> Generally, if wrongful death suits are in the interest of family members, they  file the same claim. And in California, wrongful death suits, no matter how  many heirs join in, are usually consolidated and one verdict is returned.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Elliott Almond contributed to this story.  </P></p>

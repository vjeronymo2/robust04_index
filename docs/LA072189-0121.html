			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> PANEL REJECTS BID TO KILL MEDICARE SURTAX  </P> <P> A House tax panel voted not to repeal the 1988 catastrophic illness insurance  program that has brought protests from senior citizens groups over its  income-based surtax to pay for increased benefits. The House Ways and Means  Committee, meeting behind closed doors, also took no action on a proposal to  slash, from 28% to 15%, the capital gains tax on the sale of assets, as  President Bush has requested. Democratic leaders oppose the capital gains tax  cut and have urged Democrats on the tax-writing panel to keep the tax at its  current level. The panel defeated an amendment by Rep. Brian Donnelly (D-Mass.)  and others to repeal the catastrophic illness insurance program passed last  year. The law requires that senior citizens foot the bill for greatly expanded  Medicare benefits.  </P></p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: Hallenstein Glasson rises 70% on improved turnover HALLENSTEIN Glasson, the New Zealand men's wear chain, has reported a 70 per cent rise in net profits to NZDollars 6.8m (USDollars 3.7m) for the 12 months to August 1, up from NZDollars 4.04m. The directors said the new year had begun 'very well', with the company overcoming poor weather which meant slow sales of spring fashions. Despite this, sales for August and September were running 20 per cent ahead of last year. However 'early season sales volumes are traditionally lower than later months, making growth of this magnitude difficult to maintain throughout the summer season,' they said. Sales for the year advanced to NZDollars 123.01m from NZDollars 109.96m.</p>

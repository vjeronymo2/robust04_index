			<p>BFN     [Text] Malaysia has urged G-77 [Group of 77] countries to  reject the proposal to introduce social and environmental  clauses into the world trade. Law Minister Datuk Syed Hamid  Albar said the attempt to introduce these clauses will undermine  the objectives of trade liberalization and perpetuate  protectionism. He added G-77 must remain vigilant and check  this attempt which would be detrimental to the objectives of a  liberalized trade regime. He was speaking at a special  ministerial meeting of the Group of 77 in New York. The text of  his speech was faxed today.    At the meeting held to commemorate G-77's 30th anniversary,  Syed Hamid called on the joint coordinating committee involving  the G-77 and the Nonaligned Movement to chart a common strategy.  He said G-77 had to continue to build the bridges not only with  groups and institutions in the South but with those outside to  overcome the asymmetries in the international economic system.    In welcoming South Africa as a new member of G-77, Syed  Hamid  said that cooperation among developing countries was an integral  part of the strategy to achieve economic growth. He stressed  the problems of developing countries would not be resolved if  they remained dependent on the international community and  without a specific follow-up of the declarations adopted. He  said the issue of poverty which affected one-third of the global  population should be given priority attention in the United  Nations agenda for development.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 19. Information Already Available in the Literature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If any of the data needed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to complete the SNAP program notice are available in the literature, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitter should provide the Agency with references for such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information. Failure to provide the Agency with an accurate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete citation may delay review of the notice. Additionally,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitters are encouraged to provide copies of any literature to expedite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review, particularly if the citation is from a source not readily available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any references from sources in foreign languages should be translated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into English prior to submission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Submissions should be sent to the SNAP Coordinator at the address referenced at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning of this final rule. All submissions must be provided in three complete copies. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information is claimed as confidential, all confidential information must be excised from one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the three copies. This copy will be placed in the public docket. The other two copies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should include the confidential material. If no claims of confidentiality are made for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submission, all three copies should be identical. (See below, as well as appendix C, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further guidance on handling of confidential information under SNAP.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Submission of Confidential Business Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Clean Air Act Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Anyone submitting information for which Confidential Business Information (CBI)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> status is requested must assert a claim of confidentiality at the time of submission. Failure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assert a claim of confidentiality at the time of submission may result in disclosure of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information by the Agency without further notice to the submitter. Further, it should be noted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that information which is publicly available (e.g., in journals, trade magazines, product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> literature, etc.) cannot be claimed as CBI. Requesting CBI status for such information could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delay review under section 612. All claims of confidentiality will be treated in a manner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with 40 CFR part 2, subpart B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The submitter should be advised that under CAA section 114(c), emissions data may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be claimed as confidential. Moreover, there are further instances in which confidentiality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assertions may later be reconsidered by the Agency even when confidentiality claims are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> originally received. These circumstances are provided in the provisions of 40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR part 2, subpart B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The submitter will be contacted as part of this evaluation process when such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstance occurs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Substantiation of Confidentiality Claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, EPA proposed to require substantiation of any confidentiality claims at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time of submission. In making these claims, the following provisions apply: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _The specific information to which the claim applies must be clearly marked in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> body of the study as subject to a claim of confidentiality;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _A Supplemental Statement of Data Confidentiality Claims must be submitted,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identifying each section claimed confidential and describing in detail the basis for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim. (A list of points to address in such a statement is included in appendix C);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The Supplemental Statement of Data Confidentiality Claims must be signed and dated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and must include the typed name and title of the official who signed it. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA also stated that if required substantiation is not provided when submitting information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimed as confidential, the complete submitted information may be made available to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public without further notice to the submitter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters indicated that EPA should contact the submitter before releasing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information marked as confidential to the public even if it does not contain adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantiation. One commenter also indicated that complete substantiation should not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required until the end of the 90 day review period and that any issue regarding the adequacy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of CBI substantiation should not delay the review process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA agrees with the comment that submitters should be notified prior to disclosure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the public of information marked as confidential where substantiation, although it may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inadequate, has been provided. This will give the submitter opportunity to provide the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary additional substantiation or withdraw the submission. However, an acceptability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination on a substitute will not be published until all claims of CBI have been fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantiated under the provisions described above. Additionally, should no substantiation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CBI claims be provided, EPA may make the complete submittal available to the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without further notice to the submitter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Confidentiality Provisions for Toxicity Data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the event that toxicity or health and safety studies are listed as confidential, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitter should be advised that this information cannot be maintained as confidential where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such data are also submitted under TSCA or FIFRA to the extent that confidential treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is prohibited under those statutes. However, any information other than emissions data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in the toxicity study that is not health and safety data and is not relevant to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects of a substance on human health and the environment (e.g., discussion of process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, proprietary blends) can be maintained as confidential subject to the provisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. The Agency is therefore requesting that submitters not identify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the following information as confidential when submitting information under TSCA or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIFRA: All information concerning the objectives, methodology, results, or significance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any toxicity test or experiment performed on or with a substitute or its degradation products;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any information concerning the effects of the substitute on any organism (e.g., fish, wildlife,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> humans and other mammals) or the environment (e.g., studies related to persistence,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> translocation, and fate); and pharmacokinetics/metabolism studies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

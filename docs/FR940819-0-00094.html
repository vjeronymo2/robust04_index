			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, commenters indicated that different types of reserve status including ``call-in'' reserve and ``on-call'' reserve are commonly found in the aviation industry. As described by commenters, call-in reserve requires that a flight attendant contact, or be available to be contacted by, the operator at designated times for flight assignments. The commenters added that on-call reserve typically requires that a flight attendant be available for an assignment on short notice (usually within 1 hour) if contacted by the operator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A majority of the commenters on this issue discussed whether reserve status should be considered rest. ATA, NACA, and Southwest Airlines stated that the time a flight attendant is assigned to reserve status and is not assigned to a duty period should be considered rest for the purpose of meeting the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement proposed in &sect;121.466(n) of the NPRM. RAA stated that the type of reserve in which a person must contact the company for future assignments_rather than being available for an assignment on short notice_should be considered rest because it is free of all duty except for the possibility of communication with the operators. Two individual commenters stated that the time a flight attendant spends on reserve should not be considered rest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four of the commenters, including ATA, Delta Air Lines, and RAA, commented on whether reserve status should be considered part of a duty period. ATA and Delta Air Lines stated that the time a flight attendant spends on reserve should not be considered a duty period. ATA noted that, if reserve is considered duty, operators will need to increase staff by 20 to 30 percent. ATA estimates that the annual cost would be $100 to $130 million for salaries, benefits, and associated training and administrative costs. Delta Air Lines expressed concern that if ``on-call'' reserve is considered duty, flight attendants would request at-home pay. RAA stated that the type of reserve in which a person is expected to report on short notice should be considered duty. TWU Local 556 stated that duty time for a reserve flight attendant should be calculated from actual report time to release time for a flight assignment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> FAA Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the commenters who stated that reserve status should be considered rest, the FAA notes that the time during which a flight attendant is responsible for contacting a certificate holder or for being available to be contacted by a certificate holder for an assignment (e.g., reserve or stand-by status) does not meet any rest period requirements, because the FAA has defined a rest period as free of all restraint or duty and free of all responsibility for work or duty should the occasion arise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically in response to ATA's, NACA's, and Southwest Airlines' suggestions that reserve assignments should fulfill the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement if no duty period is assigned, the FAA reiterates that rest period requirements are not met when a flight attendant is assigned to reserve status even if the flight attendant is not given a duty period assignment. A duty period, as defined in this final rule, does not begin until a flight attendant reports for an assignment involving flight time. For example, a flight attendant who has been assigned to reserve status for 24 hours but has not reported for a duty period assignment during that time will not have satisfied the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement. The rest requirement is not satisfied, because the reserve assignment is a restraint and includes present responsibility for work as a flight attendant if the occasion arises. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters stated that reserve status should not be restricted by duty period requirements. The FAA refers the commenters to the definition of duty period in &sect;&sect;121.467(a) and 135.273(a) of the final rule, the first sentence of which reads: ``Duty period means the period of elapsed time between reporting for an assignment involving flight time and release from that assignment. *&blank;*&blank;*'' It should be clear that reserve status alone does not meet the definition of duty period. On the other hand, it also should be clear that reserve status may not be performed during a rest period. The definition of rest period in &sect;&sect;121.467(a) and 135.273(a) of the final rule states that ``Rest period means the time period free of all restraint or duty for a domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator and free of all responsibility for work or duty should the occasion arise.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Augmented Cabin Crews <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule permits operators to schedule flight attendants for duty periods of more than 14 hours provided an operator: (1) Assigns flight attendants in addition to the minimum flight attendant complement required for the flight or flights in that duty period under the certificate holder's operations specifications; and (2) schedules an extended rest period following the duty period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ten commenters submitted comments on the proposed augmented cabin crew requirements addressing: (1) The concept of augmenting cabin crews in proportion to the type of aircraft; (2) the relationship between augmented cabin crews and flight attendant fatigue; and (3) the effect of augmented crew requirements on unscheduled operators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> APA, NAA, and RAA noted that the proposed augmented cabin crew requirements are not based on the size of the aircraft. APA stated that if the FAA intends the provision for augmented cabin crews to be used only for long-range operations, this should be clarified in the final rule. APA noted that, under the proposed provisions, one flight attendant would be added to either a two-person crew or an eight-person crew. NAA noted that, one additional flight attendant on a Boeing 757 is a 20 percent increase in crew; one additional flight attendant on a wide-body airplane is a 7 percent increase in crew. NAA recommended that the FAA distinguish between wide-body and narrow-body airplanes by requiring one additional flight attendant for any duty period between 14 and 20 hours on a narrow-body airplane. RAA stated that operators of airplanes that require one or two flight attendants should not be required to augment cabin crews in order to schedule duty periods longer than 14 hours. RAA added that a passenger seat will be needed for an additional flight attendant. RAA also noted that regional operators schedule some duty periods longer than 14 hours; however, many of these include an intermediate rest period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> APA, the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, and RAA addressed the relationship between augmented cabin crews and fatigue. APA and the Coalition stated that a larger crew does not necessarily result in a less fatigued crew and noted that American Airlines, Trans World Airlines, United Air Lines, and USAir currently assign flight attendants in addition to the minimum crew complement. APA and the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions noted that the proposal does not require an operator to provide a flight attendant with inflight rest. RAA stated that requiring augmented cabin crews for the purpose of reducing fatigue has been inadequately justified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATA and Delta Air Lines stated that the rule should permit a flight to operate if an augmented crew is assigned but not present for a flight because of unforeseen circumstances (e.g., illness or injury during a layover). Delta suggested that 1 hour of on-board crew rest for the remaining flight attendant crew could be provided in this circumstance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AMR Combs noted that a change is needed for on-demand operators. They stated that a ``larger'' aircraft such as a Gulfstream or a Challenger cannot accommodate up to four flight attendants. AMR Combs stated that these operators would either apply for an exemption or not use a flight attendant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> FAA Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule provides scheduling flexibility by permitting an operator to schedule a flight attendant for a duty period of more than 14 hours if the flight attendant crew is augmented in accordance with &sect;121.467 (b)(4), (b)(5), or (b)(6), or &sect;135.273 (b)(4), (b)(5), or (b)(6). The augmented flight attendant crew provision permits extended duty periods to accommodate certain operational requirements such as those for long-range international flights, but this provision also may be applied to domestic operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

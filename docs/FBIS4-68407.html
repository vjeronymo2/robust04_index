			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Official Chronicle"] </F>   [Text] On 26 April there was a meeting of the government of  the Republic of Armenia under the chairmanship of Prime Minister  Grant Bagratyan. The results of the activity of the Ministry of  Energy and Fuel and the Ministry of Construction during 1993  were discussed.    A report on the work of the ministries during the  aforementioned period was presented by First Deputy Minister of  Economic Affairs Vardan Movsisyan. The ministers presented  reports on the activity of their departments.    Minister of Energy and Fuel Miron Shishmanyan noted that in  1993 the republic produced 68.5 percent of the planned quantity  of electric energy. Because of the shortage of energy sources  its production at heating and electric power plants decreased  sharply. It amounted to 31.7 percent of the overall quantity of  electric energy produced.    As a result of the transportation blockade in 1993 the  republic received: 27 percent of the envisioned quantity of fuel  oil, 11 percent of the gasoline, 23 percent of the diesel fuel,  16 percent of the aircraft fuel, 27 percent of the lignite, and  22 percent of the liquefied gas. Because of the constant  explosions in the gas line the republic received 22 percent of  the expected quantity of gas.    Work on creating small hydroelectric power plants continued  throughout the year.    In spite of the irregular deliveries of fuel in 1993 a  number  of branches of the national economy continued to function, city  transportation, the sphere of services, and partially the system  of education continued to operate, albeit with interruptions.  During the winter several rayons of Yerevan and a number of  cities of the republic were supplied with heat. Within the  framework of the Zima program, kerosene and liquid fuel obtained  through humanitarian aid from the United States were distributed  to socially needy segments of the population.    Preparatory, organizational, and technical measures were  also  taken to put the Armenian nuclear power plant back on line.    Minister of Construction Feliks Pirumyan noted that the main  task for his department was to prevent further decline of the  volume of construction work. Presenting the overall picture of  capital construction, he reported that in 1993 a number of  structures that are of great significance to the republic  economy were put into operation. Capital investments totaling  9,904.4 million rubles [R] were made with internal funds of the  enterprises and organizations.    With state capital investments it was intended to put into  operation 287,200 square meters of dwelling space. This program  was fulfilled by 82.8 percent. With funds from the population  and state subsidies, 97,100 square meters of dwelling space were  put into operation, 15,700 of which were in the disaster zone.  There was an exchange of opinions about the reports that were  heard. Summing up the results of the discussion, Prime Minister  Grant Bagratyan noted both the positive aspects of the  ministries' work and their shortcomings and omissions.</p>

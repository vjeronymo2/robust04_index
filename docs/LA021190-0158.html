			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: MARTIN CHOOSES N. ARIZONA OVER FULLERTON FOR FOOTBALL  </P> <P> Lance Martin, The Times' Ventura County Lineman of the Year, made an oral  commitment Saturday to attend Northern Arizona.  </P> <P> Martin, a 6-foot-1, 218-pound middle linebacker who led Thousand Oaks High in  tackles last season, chose between offers from Northern Arizona and Cal State  Fullerton after visiting both campuses.  </P> <P> "I liked Fullerton too, but the difference was the college-town look at NAU,"  Martin said.  </P> <P> Deena Drossin, a junior from Agoura High, placed third in the junior girls'  division of the U. S. World Cross-Country Trials in Seattle on Saturday.  </P> <P> Drossin placed third in 13 minutes 44 seconds over the four-kilometer course.  Melody Fairchild, a junior from Boulder, Colo., who won the Kinney national  cross-country title last fall, was first in 12:47. Jamie Park, a freshman at  Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, was second in 13:07.  </P> <P> By finishing among the top six individuals, Drossin will advance with the U. S.  Junior National team to the world championships in France on March 24.  </P> <P> John Johnson of Palmdale High has made an oral commitment to play football at  Washington State.  </P> <P> A defensive back and wide receiver, Johnson was the only player in the Golden  League to be named to the all-league first team on offense and defense.  </P> <P> Tisha Walker of Thousand Oaks finished ninth in the U.S. Figure Skating  Championships, which ended Saturday in Salt Lake City.  </P> <P> The 15-year-old Walker placed eighth in free skating among 16 competitors in  the senior women's division.  </P> <P> She improved from 15th place in the compulsory figures earlier in the week.  </P></p>

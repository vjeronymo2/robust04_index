			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SOKA UNIVERSITY TO HOLD MEETINGS ON  EXPANSION  </P> <P> Administrators at Soka University in Calabasas have invited neighbors to  meetings tonight and Thursday night to discuss plans for expanding the campus.  </P> <P> The Tokyo-based university formally announced in April that it wants to expand  from an 80-student English language center for Japanese exchange students into  a 5,000-student, international liberal arts college.  </P> <P> In August, the university cemented that intention by announcing it had acquired  332 additional acres, more than doubling its holdings in the Santa Monica  Mountains to almost 600 acres.  </P> <P> Beyond saying they hope to reach full capacity by 2015, the administrators have  been vague about what they call their vision for the campus. However,  invitations to this week's meetings indicate they now have more specific plans  to be shared with the community.  </P></p>

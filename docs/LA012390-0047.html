			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GAVALDON'S OPEN BID ENDS IN QUARTERFINALS  </P> <P> Coronado's Angelica Gavaldon saw her amazing Australian Open end Tuesday in the  quarterfinals as she fell to West Germany's Claudia Porwik, 6-4, 6-3.  </P> <P> Gavaldon, a 16-year-old amateur from Our Lady of Peace High School in San  Diego, blamed the loss on poor strategy and a lack of concentration.  </P> <P> "I think she played really well and smart," Gavaldon said. "I should have  attacked a little more. I tried to over hit and it was too windy. The ball was  blowing all over. I also could have concentrated a little more."  </P> <P> Earlier in the tournament, Gavaldon upset Hana Mandlikova, the seventh-seeded  player and two-time Australian Open champion, and 15th-seeded Gigi Fernandez.  </P> <P> "(Porwik) didn't come in like Gigi and Hana," Gavaldon said. "She stayed on the  baseline and played good with the wind. When I would touch the ball, it seems  like it would go into the crowd. But that's not an excuse, because it was windy  all week.  </P> <P> "I think everybody has a bad day, this was mine. My first serves weren't going  in. I really wanted to win badly, it just didn't happen for me."  </P> <P> Porwik, ranked 75th, reached the semifinals in a Grand Slam event for the first  time.  </P> <P> Gavaldon entered the tournament ranked 192nd, but will end it ranked 95th.  </P> <P> Gavaldon's incredible run began a week ago Monday with a first-round defeat of  Upland's Laxmi Pouri, 6-3, 6-3. She then beat Alexia Dechaume of France, 6-4,  4-6, 7-5 in the second round.  </P> <P> "I'm pleased with what I did, but I'm disappointed because I think I'm good  enough to beat these players," she said. "I had an opportunity here, but I  should have taken more advantage of it.  </P> <P> "I'm very pleased, but not surprised. I feel I'm ready to play at this level. I  gained a lot of confidence and experience."  </P> <P> Gavaldon had planned to play in a tournament in New Zealand next week, but,  instead, will return to San Diego for some rest and a reevaluation of her  future.  </P> <P> Originally, Gavaldon had said she would remain an amateur until she reached the  top 100. But after her success in Australia, she said her plans may be  changing.  </P> <P> "I have some decisions to make," she said. "I'm going to think about turning  pro."  </P> <P> As an amateur, Gavaldon can claim expenses, but won't collect the $24,000 prize  for reaching the quarterfinals.  </P> <P> Gavaldon's next scheduled tournament will be in Indian Wells at the Lipton  International on Feb. 26.  </P> <P> * Meanwhile, neither Boris Becker nor Steffi Graf nor Zina Garrison had an easy  time in the heat.  </P> <P> Becker had to go five sets. Graf nearly lost a set for the first time in the  tournament.  </P> <P> Only Garrison wilted.  </P> <P> The third-seeded woman fell to Mary Joe Fernandez, 1-6, 6-2, 8-6, in the  quarterfinals at the National Tennis Center, where the temperature on court was  said to be well above 100 degrees.  </P> <P> "It's pretty frustrating. I don't understand it sometimes," said Garrison, who  appeared to have a clear run to the final after an injury forced No. 2 Gabriela  Sabatini to withdraw.  </P> <P> Garrison was serving for the match at 5-4 and 6-5 in the third set, but her  serve was broken each time and then broken again at love when the sixth-seeded  Fernandez won the match.  </P> <P> "I work very hard, but I never seem able to make my breaks," said Garrison, a  Houston native who was a semifinalist at last year's U.S. Open. "Until I do, I  don't deserve to win. (This was) a match I think I lost. It was in my hands and  I didn't take advantage of it. More than anything, I wanted to win. Sometimes  you want to win too bad."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Graf had her toughest challenge of the tournament before turning  back Patty Fendick of Sacramento, 6-3, 7-5. That tied Graf's career-best  winning streak with a 46th consecutive victory.  </P> <P> Fendick had a 5-2 lead and a set point on Graf's serve in the second set, but  Graf held and allowed Fendick only four points in the next four games to wrap  up the match.  </P> <P> Becker survived a tougher test. Down a service break in the third set to  Miloslav Mecir of Czechoslovakia, Becker stormed back to win, 4-6, 6-7 (8-6),  6-4, 6-1, 6-1, and reach the quarterfinals against Mats Wilander.  </P></p>

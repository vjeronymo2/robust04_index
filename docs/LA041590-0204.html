			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE MOVIES: THE WEEK'S OTHER PRIME-TIME FILMS  </P> <P> Disney's beloved 1964 live-action/animation fantasy Mary Poppins returns on  KNBC on Sunday at 7 p.m. Julie Andrews, of course, has the title role as the  "practically perfect" nanny hired by the Banks family of Edwardian London.  </P> <P> The Living Daylights (KABC, Sunday at 8:30 p.m.) introduced in 1987 a new James  Bond, Timothy Dalton, who is splendid-provided you can put Sean Connery out of  your mind-but after a quarter of a century of 007, it's pretty much the same as  before, except for less casual sex in this AIDS era.  </P> <P> Top Secret! (KCOP, Wednesday at 8 p.m.) tries to send up-and update-the World  War II spy adventure, a rather antiquated target. There's a nonstop barrage of  gags, many inspired and hilarious in themselves but scattershot in effect.  Dynamic Val Kilmer stars as an American rock 'n' roller who's a last-minute  substitute for Leonard Bernstein at an East German cultural festival-and who  winds up trying to help an imprisoned scientist escape to the West, along with  his pretty daughter.  </P> <P> Tarzan, the Ape Man (KTLA, Thursday at 8 p.m.), the delirious 1981 Bo and John  Derek version,should've been called "Me, Jane." Silly, tedious and soft-pornish  -- but surely tamed for TV -- Bo's virginal Jane invades West Africa alone in  search of her great white hunter father (Richard Harris) and winds up saved  from a lion by an equally virginal Ape Man (Miles O'Keeffe).  </P> <P> In Endangered Species (KTLA, Friday at 8 p.m.), Alan Rudolph's taut 1982  political thriller, the cattle near a small Colorado town begin to be  decimated, their carcasses peculiarly mutilated while their internal organs  seem to have evaporated. The plot proves to be timely and chilling, but its  unraveling is less than inspired.  </P> <P> Two vintage adventures also air Friday: Robert Aldrich's 1954 Western Vera Cruz  (KTTV, Friday at 8 p.m.), with Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster, and Michael  Curtiz's classic 1938 The Adventures of Robin Hood (KCOP, Friday at 8 p.m.),  with Errol Flynn.  </P> <P> With the 1982 I Ought to Be in Pictures (KTLA, Saturday at 6 p.m.), Neil Simon  wrote two of his most believable characters-a burnt-out screenwriter and his  girlfriend, a studio hairdresser-and under Herbert Ross' direction, Walter  Matthau and Ann-Margret are wonderful. Unfortunately, Matthau's obnoxious  teen-age daughter (Dinah Manoff) turns up to become the film's center of  attention.  </P> <P> Ian McShane stars in the 1989 Dick Francis mystery, In the Frame (KCOP,  Saturday at 8 p.m.).  </P></p>

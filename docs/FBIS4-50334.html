			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By P. C. Tang and Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Geneva, May 16 (CNA) -- The first bilateral tariff  consultations between Taiwan and Canada under the framework of  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ended here Monday [16  May] in a friendly atmosphere.    Director General Huang Yen-chao of Taiwan's Board of Foreign  Trade, who led the Taiwan delegation to the tariff talks, said  that during the one-day meeting, the Canadian side again stated  its support for Taiwan's bid to join GATT.    The Canadian delegation was headed by Paul Haddow, a  division  chief in charge of tariffs and market access under the  Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.    Canada is prepared to give a detailed reply to Taiwan's  tariff proposals before the end of June and to hold another  round of negotiations with Taiwan at any time, Huang said.    Taiwan proposed to maintain current import duties on certain  products, and to lower tariffs on some others all at once or in  batches following its entry into the Geneva-based world trade  regulating body, he elaborated.    During the talks, he pointed out, both sides focused on  tariff reductions of 837 agricultural and industrial items,  non-tariff barriers, government procurement, and trade in civil  aircraft.    The Canadian delegation said that the first round of  consultations will have a positive effect on subsequent talks  and that Taiwan's plan to begin bilateral discussions on the  government procurement agreement immediately after its accession  to GATT is encouraging, Huang reported.    Canadian delegates, however, expressed deep concern about  some of Taiwan's price and quantity-based taxation systems as  well as protective measures for agricultural products, he added.    While Canada asked Taiwan to slash tariffs in line with its  application as a developed contracting party, Huang said he told  the Canadian delegation that Taiwan's import duties on  industrial goods are relatively low and that Taiwan remains a  developing country in its agricultural sector.    The two sides agreed to add service industries to the next  round of bilateral consultations, Huang noted. In addition, he  said, Canada showed keen interest in exploring Taiwan's  telecommunications market.    Huang is among a 33-member Taiwan mission here for the fifth  meeting of the GATT working party screening Taiwan's membership  application, which will open Tuesday and go through Thursday.  Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng is leading the  mission.    Taiwan was admitted as a GATT observer in September 1992 and  is expected to become a full member by the end of this year.</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Tokyo gives cautious response to Wellcome WELLCOME has received a cautious response from investors in Tokyo, the first stop on a global road show to promote the international tender offer for the drug company's shares. As Mr John Robb, chief executive, moved on to presentations in the US this week, most Japanese investors said they would wait to see the reaction in other parts of the world before deciding on how big a commitment to make to the shares. 'We'll need to see the reaction of investors overseas,' said a fund manager at Tokyo Marine and Fire, a leading non-life insurance company. He added that buying Wellcome would mean selling stocks such as Glaxo or SmithKline Beecham, in order to maintain his portfolio's exposure to British pharmaceutical companies. Although Wellcome is known in Japan for AZT, its anti-Aids drug which achieves local annual sales of Y25bn (Pounds 105m), its presence lags behind other leading UK drugs companies. One fund manager said he was thinking of spending Y30m but considered the share price still too high despite its sharp fall since the issue was announced. 'The offer doesn't seem to be generating excitement, and I would rather buy shares of Astra, the Swedish drugs company,' he added. Many Japanese institutional investors, hurt by the slump in the domestic stock market, are looking to decrease investments. Last year, net purchases of foreign stocks by Japanese investors fell from Dollars 6.3bn to Dollars 3.6bn (Pounds 1.9bn). Some 250 investors turned up to Wellcome's Tokyo presentation but they will have to wait until next Monday before they can begin to participate in the tender process.</p>

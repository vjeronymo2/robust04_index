			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister said that the government will go  all out to promote private investment in the power sector so  that scarce resources are available for the social sector. He  said many rules and regulations inhibiting private investment in  the power sector have been removed in the last two years and the  government is ready to further simplify the rules. Mr.  Narasimha Rao was inaugurating a conference in New Delhi today  titled India Power 94 on the development and financing of  private sector power projects. He said the government is fully  alive to the key role that power generation can play in the  country's industrial growth. He urged the power sector to reach  out to the people in the far-flung areas.    Earlier, in his keynote address, the power minister, Mr.  N.K.P. Salve, said the center is awaiting the findings of the  Sharad Pawar Committee on the working of state electricity  boards. He said the two-tier price mechanism for the private  power sector is proving highly encouraging.</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / All white-collar criminals in Malaysia to be caned The Malaysian government says it will make caning a mandatory punishment for white-collar crimes. Mr Syed Hamid Albar, the law minister, said white-collar crime had grown considerably in recent years and accounted for 15 per cent of all crimes reported. However, white-collar criminals did not cause their victims physical injury so the canings administered to them would not be as severe as those delivered to other violent offenders. Mr Hamid said businessmen, bureaucrats, company employees and lawyers were among those convicted of crimes. Caning in Malaysia and Singapore is carried out with a thick bamboo stick or rotan and causes intense pain, often splitting the skin. The Malaysian cabinet also approved a plan to do away with all trials by jury because of increasing difficulty in finding juries for long trials. Malaysia's GDP grew by an annual rate of 8.9 per cent in the third quarter of the year, according to Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the finance minister. In each of the two previous quarters GDP grew by 8.3 per cent on an annualised basis. Mr Anwar said inflation in the third quarter had moderated to 3.2 per cent. However last week Malaysia's central bank said inflation for the first 10 months of the year was 3.7 per cent.</p>

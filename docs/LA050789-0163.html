			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE SOUTH BAY  </P> <P> Reckless bicyclists, skateboarders, and roller skaters be warned.  </P> <P> The Hermosa Beach Police Department is cracking down on trick riding, group  riding, and speeding along the strand and at the Hermosa Pier.  </P> <P> "It's such a congested area, the bicyclists, the skateboarders, the roller  skaters and the pedestrians all are vying for a few feet of the strand," Sgt.  Wally Moore said. "We're now at the point where we have to do something."  </P> <P> He said aggressive enforcement of the city's ordinances governing bicyclists,  roller skaters and skateboarders will begin Monday in an effort to prevent  injuries. Leaflets explaining the crackdown are being distributed this weekend.  </P> <P> Several years ago, Moore said, a bicycle rider died after being thrown over the  handlebars, and pedestrians have been injured.  </P> <P> Police fear that skateboards shot into the air like arrows by stunt riders who  fall off their boards could cause serious injuries.  </P> <P> Violators will be issued citations similar to traffic tickets, and in extreme  cases, police can confiscate the skateboard or bicycle, Moore said.

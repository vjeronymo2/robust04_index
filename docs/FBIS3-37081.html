			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>   [Text] Yerevan, 11 Feb -- Armenia has been left completely  without gas once again. Late on the night of 10 February, the  only pipeline still supplying gas to the republic, which crosses  the Georgian territory, was blown up once again. The ITAR-TASS  correspondent was told at the press service of the Armenian  Government that the subversive act was committed at 2330 hours  on 10 February near the river Khrami in Marneulskiy Rayon in the  southeast of Georgia. A group of Armenian gas workers have been  sent to the site to examine and repair the damaged section of  the pipeline, the government said.    Gas supply to Armenia via Georgia had been cut off on the  previous day. According to the Gruzgazprom association, this  was caused by a drop in gas supply from Turkmenistan. The  Armenian side says that at that point, Georgia was receiving  9-10 million cubic meters of gas a day, while Armenia had been  receiving 0.8 to 1.2 million cubic meters a day for the past two  months. This tiny amount was just enough to satisfy the bare  minimum of the needs of the Armenian economy, and first and  foremost, vital facilities, such as hospitals, bakeries,  transport, communications, and administrative offices.    Since yesterday noon, Yerevan residents have not had any  electricity; in the afternoon, the subway was stopped. Domestic  heating and hot water are unavailable. Despite the critical  situation, 60 industrial enterprises have been working in  Armenia today, and trams have been in operation in Yerevan.  Buses have been standing idle in the Armenian capital due to  lack of fuel.</p>

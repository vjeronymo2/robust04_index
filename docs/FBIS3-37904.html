The statement released by the press center to the media says  that Vyacheslav Kostikov's statement "casts a shadow over the  emerging constructive cooperation between the State Duma and the  president, the government, and the Constitutional Court aimed at  consolidating all power structures and political forces, and  also impedes national accord and the revival of Russia."</p>

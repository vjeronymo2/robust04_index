			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Cross-border Kraftsmen - The US food group is aiming for closer collaboration between its European units Soon after Todd Martin became vice-president of marketing and business development at Kraft General Foods Europe 18 months ago, he made a radical decision. He gave his job away. That is how he describes the thinking behind a recent shake-up of marketing strategy at the large, US-owned food group, intended to tackle one of the toughest dilemmas facing consumer products manufacturers operating in several European countries. The challenge is to find a management structure which maximises scale economies and eliminates wasteful duplication, while remaining sensitive to often very different patterns of local demand. Prompted by the single market, tougher competition and the growing power of retailers, other companies including Unilever and Mars have recently extensively re-organised their operations in an effort to meet these objectives. However, in several cases, the search for strategic coherence has led to unwieldy centralisation or blurred responsibilities, leaving national managers confused and demoralised. Martin was determined to avoid these mistakes. Instead, he set out to make the group's eight European operating subsidiaries responsible for initiating and implementing cross-border collaboration. His approach was coloured by Kraft's failed attempts a decade ago to impose uniform product and marketing strategies across Europe. The results were so catastrophic and created such ill will that the central marketing team was disbanded soon afterwards. The loose system of headquarters co-ordination which replaced it mollified KGFE's national managers, but discouraged direct communication between them. Each pursued its own marketing strategies, even for big international brands such as Philadelphia cream cheese and Kraft dressings. By the time Martin, a 37-year-old American, arrived, national managers had begun to chafe at this compartmentalised structure. They needed little persuasion, he says, to see the advantages of closer cross-border collaboration. A year ago, he set up eight 'core teams', covering KGFE's principal product categories and the main marketing functions. The teams, which meet for two days, three times a year, bring together more than 100 KGFE national marketing staff. Each team has a co-ordinator, assigned to KGFE's Munich headquarters for two to three years from a country unit, who identifies issues of common concern, prepares research and case studies and guides debate. However, what to do and how to do it are left to national managers to decide jointly. 'I had to look to self-interest to drive this process because I can't be everywhere at once making sure it works,' says Martin, who stays away from team meetings so that managers can discuss mistakes and failures without fear of reproach. The biggest financial pay-off so far is from agreements to rationalise the specifications and packaging of the 1,000 KGFE product lines sold in more than one country, which account for 40 per cent of the group's Dollars 3.6bn (Pounds 2.3bn) annual sales. Some come in more than 50 versions, often because of unco-ordinated decisions by country managers rather than real differences in local demand. KGFE expects decisions already taken to reduce by Dollars 10m in the next two years the Dollars 100m in manufacturing fixed costs needed to support this product complexity. Martin thinks savings of as much again are achieveable. Another priority has been to improve effectiveness of brand management and advertising. The main goal here is not to cut costs, but to get maximum mileage from the Dollars 400m KGFE spends annually on advertising and marketing. Relying heavily on comparisons of national subsidiaries' past experience and detailed analyses of failures as well as successes, the core teams have begun to define general principles for effective marketing. One is that food products are often better promoted by focusing on questions such as when, how and by whom they are eaten, rather than by concentrating on intrinsic qualities such as texture and taste, as some national units have done in the past. The objective is a broadly consistent strategy across Europe which can be tailored to individual markets. It is already being practised in television commercials for Philadelphia cream cheese, one of KGFE's main product lines. In the commercials, a housewife shows a visitor various ways of serving Philadelphia. In Italy, where the aim was to differentiate the product from the many other soft cheeses on the market, an exotic touch has been injected by casting the visitor as a Japanese au pair. But in Spain, a hard-cheese eating country where Philadelphia is unfamiliar, KGFE played safe by making the visitor a neighbour's daughter. For a new range of do-it-yourself pizza and pasta dinners, sold under the Miracoli brand, KGFE uses identical commercials in five countries. These show an Italian family enthusing at mealtime, in Italian, over the toppings and sauces available. Ironically, the range is not sold in Italy, where its potential is considered very limited. However, as Martin observes, the Miracoli brand stands 'not for Italian food, but for the idea of Italian food'. Unlike previous KGFE campaigns, the Miracoli commercials were neither developed by each country separately, nor imposed from the centre. Instead, core team members adopted a campaign thought up by KGF Belgium after judging it superior to alternatives developed by their own and other subsidiaries. The Miracoli dinners are also an early result of efforts to develop more products jointly. Since the new system began, the list of research and development proposals from national subsidiaries has halved, and many more are for products to be sold in several countries. 'In the past, there were almost no multi-country projects - and if there were, it was pure coincidence,' says Phil Smith, marketing director of KGF's UK operation. 'The core teams have got marketing people to focus on big new ideas and meaty projects, rather than on easy window-dressing like minor line extensions.' A drawback is that the new system is relatively slow to respond to demands from KGF's US headquarters and Philip Morris, its ultimate parent. 'If Michael Miles (chairman of Philip Morris) asks if we can do something in a month, I have to say it will take six months,' says Martin. However, KGFE is also better equipped to formulate its strategies and initiate ideas without transatlantic prompting. Piero Capizzi, director of refrigerated products, says he spends only 30 per cent of his time liaising with the US, compared with 70 per cent for his predecessor. Martin thinks there are two main reasons for the smooth working of the core teams system, which Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss coffee and confectionery company owned by Philip Morris, is also thinking of adopting. One is that many traditional cross-border management links were severed by the reorganisation which followed Philip Morris's acquisitions of General Foods in 1985 and Kraft in 1988. That made it easier to introduce a new approach from scratch. The other is that KGFE has solidly established core businesses with broadly similar strengths in different markets. That means subsidiaries from smaller countries do not worry about being pushed around by those from bigger ones. 'Getting the balance right requires democracy,' says Martin. He is open-minded about how the system will develop, saying national subsidiaries may sometimes find it makes more sense to act separately than jointly. But at least they will have considered the possibility of cross-border co-operation first. 'If there are synergies to be had at a European level, we'll capture them,' says Martin. 'If we can't, they don't exist.'</p>

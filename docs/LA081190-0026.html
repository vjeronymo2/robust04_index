			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIVE THEM SOME CREDIT, BUT ALSO MORE SPEED  </P> <P> During the past 18 years, with Ben Wade as director of scouting, the Dodgers  have won more games than any team but the Yankees. Instead of criticism from  some in the media for draft picks, which can't fairly be evaluated yet, a  hearty thanks and congratulations for a job well done are due.  </P> <P> BOB CONGER  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> DRAWING OF ARSON SUSPECT RELEASED  </P> <P> Fire Department officials on Tuesday released a drawing of a suspect in the  Dec. 26, $2-million arson fire that destroyed a Thrifty Drug Store at a  shopping center at Katella Avenue and Euclid Street.  </P> <P> Fire Department Capt. Bill Dumas said the suspect's likeness was drawn from  descriptions given to officials by an employee and other people who were in the  store about 9:30 p.m. when the fire broke out.  </P> <P> The suspect is a male, possibly Latino, between 30 and 40 years old, about 6  feet, 1 inch tall and weighing about 200 pounds. He has short, dark wavy hair  that is combed back, Dumas said.  </P> <P> "We believe the suspect started the fire in a paper goods section of the store  in order to distract people so that he could steal merchandise from the store,"  said Dumas, adding that an employee had been watching the suspect in the store  because of his suspicious behavior.  </P> <P> The suspect disappeared after the fire started, Dumas said. "I don't think he  (the suspect) believed the fire would get out of control," Dumas added.  </P> <P> Anyone who may recognize the suspect should call the Fire Department at (714)  741-5626.  </P></p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Ministers to speak at Thatcherite group meetings THREE MINISTERS are to speak at meetings organised by Conservative Way Forward, a Thatcherite group, during the Tory party conference, intensifying the pressure on Mr John Major, prime minister, from the right of his party. The latest issue of Conservative Way Forward's quarterly magazine contained a vigorous attack on Mr Major's leadership, from Lord Parkinson, the former cabinet minister and chairman of the group. High-profile ministerial support for the group will further undermine party managers' hopes that the October conference would provide the basis for a political revival. Newspaper serialisation of Mr Kenneth Baker's memoirs is already raking over the divisions during the leadership contest of 1990. Tories are also apprehensive that Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, will use a speech to a conference fringe meeting to cause further difficulties for the prime minister. Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, is the most senior of the three ministers to address the CWF. The others are Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, and Mr Neil Hamilton, the deregulation minister. All will speak on matters within their own responsibilities. Apart from Lord Parkinson's bitter accusation that Mr Major's 'disunited' government left natural Tory supporters feeling betrayed, the CWF also took a hard line earlier this month on taxation. Its magazine warned that there could be a further rebellion from the right wing if Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, extended the base for value added tax, without making deep cuts in public spending. Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary, recently refused to rule out tax rises, although he made clear his opposition to such increases and his desire to reduce public spending. However, despite Mr Portillo's rightwing credentials, rightwing MPs are not yet convinced the government will be as tough on public spending as they want. Further divisions could surface over the second group of government departments to feature in the long-term public spending review. These are expected to include the ministry of agriculture and the department of the environment.</p>

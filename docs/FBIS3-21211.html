			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Sumitomo Light Metal Industries, Ltd. (Sumitomo  Light Metal), has successfully confirmed a new synthesis method  for titanium-aluminum intermetallic compounds. The method  comprises the blending process of titanium and aluminum powders,  the extrusion-molding process, and the reaction process in a  heated reactor. By developing this method, Sumitomo Light Metal  eliminated the problems of coping with difficult machining after  molding the intermetallic compounds and their tendency to  oxidize at as high a temperature as 800C. Initially,  Sumitomo Light Metal has begun distributing samples of  automotive engine valves to major automobile makers. The  lightweight intermetallic compounds will reduce the valve  weights, and in turn, improve engine output and reduce fuel  consumption. Titanium-aluminum intermetallic compounds, which  are promising as lightweight, heat-resistant alloys for  automotive components, can be applied more broadly for aircraft  and electric power generation turbines if their machinability is  improved.    The method developed by Sumitomo Light Metal was the  ``reaction-sintering method'' for titanium-aluminum  intermetallic compounds. In the method, titanium and aluminum  powders are mixed and melted with agitation after the component  ratio and heat input have been adjusted, and the molten mixture  is extrusion-molded into a final shape. Subsequently, in a  heated reactor in which the high pressure of 2,000 atm is  maintained, titanium and aluminum in the mixture are made to  react under pressure to form an alloy.    Titanium-aluminum-based intermetallic compounds have been  drawing attention for their lightweight and high-temperature  strength. However, the compounds have been extremely difficult  to machine after the compound is formed by the reaction of  titanium with aluminum. Moreover, both titanium and aluminum are  easily oxidized at a high temperature, and oxidized alloys tend  to undergo deformation.    Thus, Sumitomo Light Metal added chlorine to the titanium  during the production process to form a film to improve  resistance against oxidation. Currently, the company is  developing a mass-production technology based on the reaction  sintering method under a consignment from the Japan Research  Development Corp. of the Science and Technology Agency.    Titanium-aluminum intermetallic compounds have specific  gravities of 3.8 to 3.9, as compared with 2.7 for aluminum and  7.8 for iron. The tensile strength per unit area for the  compounds at normal temperature is 50-70 kg, which is slightly  lower than 60-100 kg for heat-resistant steel and nickel-based  alloys. However, at high temperatures, the compounds do not lose  as much strength as do the other metals, so that the compounds  are stronger than the other materials at approximately  800C. Sumitomo Light Metal plans to market the compounds  with their advantage as lightweight, heat-resistant materials  that can withstand high-speed rotation at high temperatures. The  initial target will be automotive engine valves that replace  existing valves of heat-resistant steel and nickel-based alloys.  The applications for the compounds are expected to broaden if  the production cost, including machining cost, can be reduced.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: INTERFERENCE: HOW ORGANIZED CRIME INFLUENCES PROFESSIONAL  FOOTBALL BY DAN E. MOLDEA (WILLIAM MORROW: $19.95; 436 PP.)  </P> <P> "Most Americans," Dan E. Moldea says, "view sports as a vehicle of inspiration  and entertainment" -- and as something to bet on. The estimated 25 million  people who wager tens of billions of dollars on National Football League games  each year eagerly accept the NFL's assurances that these games are honest. They  don't know, or don't care, that the 10% "vigorish" that bookmakers charge on  losing NFL bets provides the underworld with more illegal gambling income than  all other sports combined. They prefer to believe that the league has  rigorously investigated gambling and drug scandals, that team owners are  sportsmen and that players always give their best. These are myths, Moldea  says, but "powerful forces in America have built empires around these myths."  </P> <P> The truth is quite different, according to Moldea, a veteran crime reporter  whose last book was "Dark Victory: Ronald Reagan, MCA and the Mob." The NFL  claims that gamblers have made only two attempts, both unsuccessful, to fix  games in the league's 60-year history. Instead, Moldea says, as many as 70  games may have been fixed outright or manipulated to affect the point spread  set by mob-connected oddsmakers. Even when games are honest, gamblers use their  close ties to the NFL to gain inside information. Widespread drug use by  players gives the mob even more leverage. What Moldea calls "the sweetheart  relationship between the federal government and the NFL" has reduced many a  promising investigation into the league's dirty secrets to the equivalent of  three downs and a punt.  </P> <P> "Interference," in contrast, is like a hard-nosed fullback, gracelessly written  but packed with names, dates and places, hitting the holes until the defense --  one's incredulity -- gives way. This is not the first time such accusations  have been hurled; longtime NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle dismissed a 1983 PBS  TV expose of the league as "a rehash of press clippings, gossip and rumor."  Moldea's targets could say the same, but the weight of evidence is  overwhelming. Moldea, shows, for example, how former Los Angeles Rams owner  Carroll Rosenbloom partnered mob figures in business throughout his career. He  was also a heavy gambler who, when he owned the Baltimore Colts, bet $1 million  on them to win the 1958 NFL championship game with the New York Giants -- a sum  that puts the recent Pete Rose baseball scandal in perspective. And Rosenbloom,  Moldea makes clear, was -- and would be today -- just one of the boys. Michael  Harris  </P></p>

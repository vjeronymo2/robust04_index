			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Rifkind warns Germany not to quit Euro fighter project MR Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, said yesterday that he still hoped to persuade Germany not to leave the Pounds 20bn European Fighter Aircraft project and warned that withdrawal would be 'very damaging to Germany's credibility as a reliable partner'. In an interview with the Financial Times, he said there was 'very considerable scope' for cost savings in the project, up to now involving the UK, Germany, Italy and Spain. Senior UK and German officials are due to meet in London today to advance discussions about ways of reducing the cost of producing the aircraft, now in the late stages of development. Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, who has made clear his opposition to continued German participation, is expected to discuss the project with Mr Rifkind during a ministerial meeting of the Western European Union, a nine-nation defence grouping, in Germany next Friday. Mr Ruhe is due for further talks in London on July 6. Mr Rifkind said that although Mr Ruhe had stated his own 'personal recommendation', the German government had not yet reached a decision. He issued a severe warning of the political implications if Bonn did withdraw, referring to the recent arguments within the EC and Nato about plans for European defence. 'I don't think it is possible for the German government on the one hand to speak robustly about the desirability of a European defence dimension and European co-operation, and at the same time consider withdrawing from the single most important example of European defence collaboration at the present time,' he said. He said he understood Bonn's predicament in the face of parliamentary pressure against the approval of funds for pressing ahead with the programme. It would however be 'unfortunate' to consider withdrawing from a 20-year project 'simply on the basis of an immediate short-term parliamentary handling problem'. An effort was needed within the next few weeks to identify potential savings so that decisions may be taken. Mr Rifkind said he was encouraged by 'growing representations' within Germany in favour of the project, including those from industry and the CSU, the Bavarian party in the governing coalition. He said Germany would face costs if it backed out but this would depend on the manner of its withdrawal. A decision to withdraw now would be premature, he added. There was no need for the partners to commit themselves on production of the aircraft until 'sometime in 1993'. Final EFA sortie, Page 2</p>

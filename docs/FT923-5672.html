			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / CBI predicts no UK upturn until mid-1993 OUTPUT in the UK will continue to fall for the rest of this year and there will be no significant recovery until at least the middle of 1993, the Confederation of British Industry predicted yesterday. The CBI's latest pessimistic appraisal of the economic outlook coincided with the announcement of further big job losses in two leading British companies. Jaguar, the luxury car maker owned by Ford, announced it was to cut 700 jobs, while Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, said a lack of new orders was forcing it to make more than 1,400 workers redundant. The sharp downwards revision to the CBI's growth forecast and the new manufacturing job losses highlighted the weakness of the economy at a time when the government may come under renewed pressure to raise interest rates to protect the pound. The CBI now expects gross domestic product to fall by 1 per cent this year and to increase by 0.7 per cent in 1993. This compares with forecasts in May of 0.9 per cent growth for 1992 and 2.9 per cent for 1993. The CBI said a 1 percentage point increase in base rates this year would mean reducing its forecast for GDP growth in 1993 by 0.2 percentage points. Its present forecast assumes base rates will be cut by  1/2 point to 9.5 per cent in the second quarter of 1993 as other European rates come down. The CBI also said order books had weakened since May and that manufacturing output was expected to fall over the next four months. The August industrial trends survey, conducted at the beginning of the month, showed that only 9 per cent of manufacturers reported above-normal order books. Mr Sudhir Junankar, an economist at the CBI, warned that the latest forecast could turn out to be too optimistic if interest rates were raised to protect sterling. The projections were also subject to the risks of a further weakening of the housing market, which would dent consumer confidence, and slow world growth which would harm exports. The CBI expects the weakness of the economy to bring retail price inflation down to just over 2 per cent by the end of next year. Unemployment is forecast to touch 3m by the end of next year and a further 200,000 jobs are expected to be lost in manufacturing. Swan Hunter's decision yesterday to cut jobs will reduce its workforce by almost a half. The Treasury said the deterioration in output expectations was 'hardly surprising given the widespread gloom about the state of the economy in recent weeks'. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, criticised the government for its refusal to take action to help revive the economy. Business expects fall in production; Job loss details, Page 5</p>

These  motors constitute a successful test prior to the adjustment  phase of the factory that is being built in Cacocum, Holguin  Province, with PRC cooperation.    The new electric motor factory is scheduled to begin  operations during the first quarter of 1994. It is 72-percent  complete, and its 120 basic machine tools are already installed.  The first of these factories of moderate technological  complexity in the country has the means necessary to annually  produce 30,000 top-quality triphasic and monophasic motors of 23  types, motors that will fulfill vital requirements in such  economic sectors as the sugar and the nickel industries. The  factory also opens horizons for exports and for penetration into  the home electrical appliance field in Cuba.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alfonso Malespin Jiron] </F>   [Text] The Nicaraguan Government has denied that the United  States will freeze bilateral aid or that ESAF [Enhanced  Structural Adjustment Facility] remittances will be affected as  a result of a [U.S.] law amendment, not yet approved by  Congress, aimed at countries that have confiscated property from  U.S. citizens without paying compensation.    Nevertheless, National Assembly President Luis Humberto  Guzman described the situation as "extremely serious" and said  that "if the law is applied the way I think it will be, the  effects on the national economy will be devastating."    The amendment, which still does not have the force of law,  reads that all bilateral aid to the government will be suspended  if 90 days after the law is enacted the expropriation claims  made by U.S. citizens have not been resolved. The amendment  also establishes ways to avoid economic sanctions: return the  claimed properties; provide adequate and effective compensation  for such a property in foreign currency or another mutually  acceptable way; apply quick, adequate, and effective domestic  compensation in accordance with international law; or, submit  the dispute to arbitration in accordance with international law.    Yesterday, Engineer Ramiro Gurdian said in a television  program that Senator Jesse Helms had managed to get bilateral  and multilateral aid to Nicaragua frozen if Nicaragua does not  resolve within 90 days -- which expires in June -- the cases of  125 U.S. citizens who have made claims on 258 properties.    According to Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal, Helms has tried  to get the amendment approved without taking into account that  the Confiscation Quantification Office (OCI) has been operating  for nearly two years.    "I do not accept pressure from anyone," Chamorro said upon  her return from Costa Rica. "Of course, there are homes still  to be returned, and I call on those who have them to return  them," she added.  <H5>  It Will Affect Remittances </H5>   A diplomatic source in Washington told BARRICADA that if  this  law comes into effect, "apparently it will affect the  remittances that are about to be released covering 1994 and  future ones in 1995."    Deputy Danilo Aguirre said that the seriousness of this  affair will in part be conditioned by the internal capacity the  government shows to resolve the property issue. According to  him, the Sandinist Front must propose to the Sandinist wing in  the National Assembly an overall solution to these claims.    Minister Leal said that the Helms amendment "is not  applicable in the case of Nicaragua," because the Chamorro  government is implementing a mechanism provided for in this U.S.  law initiative. Helms insists Nicaragua has not shown any  progress and cited as an example some 28 state properties that  have not been returned to U.S. citizens. The foreign minister  said that these are 22 properties, and he said that these will  be dealt with as soon as possible by the OCI, created to deal  with 5,200 expropriation claims.  <H5>  The U.S. Wants To See Steps </H5>   According to Finance Minister Emilio Pereira, this total had  a variable number of U.S. citizens between 112 and 120. He  described the figure, which at one point surpassed 400, as "a  moving target," because it included Nicaraguan citizens who  became naturalized U.S. citizens after their property was  confiscated. According to Minister Leal these new U.S. citizens  count as Nicaraguans because this is what international law  says. Furthermore "their properties were properly confiscated  according to Decrees No. 3 and 38 and they will not be  indemnified," Pereira said.    The diplomatic source in Washington said that "what is most  important for the majority in Congress is that the Nicaraguan  Government take steps toward solving the cases of properties  claimed by U.S. citizens."    Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant secretary of state for  inter-American affairs, spoke in similar terms during his visit  to Nicaragua: "We hope Nicaragua continues to show progress,  resolving every possible case, in the least amount of time."    U.S. Ambassador to Nicaragua John Maisto has accepted that  the Chamorro government has made progress in the matter, but  also insisted that Chamorro must "continue to show progress."    The source stressed that the U.S. Congress would like to see  solutions "especially dealing with properties still in the hands  of the state and occupied by government officials or by the  state itself."    Regarding the possibility that the amendment to the Economic  Power Act of 1956 be approved by the U.S. Congress, the source  was of the opinion that "for most in Washington, Helms'  standards are not reasonable. The overriding spirit here is  that there has been progress (in Nicaragua)."    Nicaragua, according to Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal, "is  the only country in the world with problems of such magnitude  with the United States."</p>

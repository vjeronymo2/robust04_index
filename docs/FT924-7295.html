			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Finland dominates sector with Dollars 2bn, five-year issue THE Republic of Finland again dominated the international bond markets yesterday, with the confirmation of the main terms of its much awaited global US dollar issue. At Dollars 2bn, this first global sovereign issue was much bigger than expected and should be the republic's last big foreign currency borrowing for this year. Pricing of the five-year paper will take place this afternoon at a spread of 82 to 84 basis points over comparable US Treasuries, compared with the 75 to 80 tipped by bankers outside the deal last week. The spreads reflect Finland's heavy borrowing programme. Merrill Lynch, one of the lead managers, took issue with comments from traders that the issue will appeal to banks in particular which would be able to swap the bonds for floating rate assets paying 40 to 45 basis points over the London interbank offered rate. Mr Tim von Halle, head of syndicate at Merrill Lynch, said: 'We have not asset swapped a single bond, and we have sold almost Dollars 600m.' J. P. Morgan Securities and Nomura International are the other lead managers. Around 45 per cent of the issue was sold to US domestic investors buying the spread, said Merrill Lynch. The bulk of the balance went to continental Europe. Japan Development Bank's Dollars 300m seven-year 6 7/8 per cent straight bond through LTCB International received little attention in the circumstances. It had a mixed reception, supposedly failing to capture the imagination partly because of the clash with Finland, however traders note that the maturity and credit are quite different. Plus points for JDB include the strength of its credit and increasing demand for longer maturities because of the steepness of the yield curve. The pricing was thought somewhat tight at 34 basis points over comparable US Treasuries. The upward drift in the interest coupons payable on Japanese equity warrants continued with issues from Daiwa House Industry. The company has had to accept a coupon of 2 3/8 per cent on its Dollars 300m four-year issue and 2 3/4 per cent on an issue for SFr300m with the same maturity. Over the past month, coupons have climbed from around 1.5 per cent as a result of the oversupply of such issues and the rising cost of the dollar given the feeling that US interest rates have bottomed out. Bayerische Vereinsbank again reopened a collared floating rate note due 2002, issuing a further Dollars 50m tranche to fill pockets of demand. Caisse Autonome de Refinancement's FFr300m reverse FRN is seen as an investor-driven yield curve play. The DM380m 10-year 7 3/8 per cent issue for Metropolis of Tokyo was described as very tightly priced but well received, selling mainly to Japanese financial institutions with operations in Europe as well as to local retail investors. Sterling swap spreads are reported to be still recovering from the activity surrounding Sweden's record Eurosterling bond last week, keeping swap-related sterling borrowers out. Some selling pressure was reported on last week's new issues, as profits were taken.</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Dalgety profits rise 4.5% to Pounds 56.2m GROWTH in snacks for humans and feed for animals lay behind a 4.5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 53.8m to Pounds 56.2m, at Dalgety, the food and agriculture group, in the six months to December. Trading profit advanced 7 per cent to Pounds 61.5m on turnover of Pounds 2.11bn, compared with Pounds 1.95bn. Progress in consumer foods and the agribusiness was partly offset by a decline in food ingredients. Mr Maurice Warren, chairman, said: 'Extra-special results came out of the agriculture side.' That division's trading profit advanced 23 per cent to Pounds 14.6m, on turnover of Pounds 517m. Sales volumes for cattle and sheep feed rose 6 per cent and raw material price rises, following the pound's devaluation, had been passed on to customers. Mr Richard Clothier, chief executive designate, said The Pig Improvement Company, which has more than doubled sales in four years, had done particularly well in the US. Attitudes had changed from 'pigs are pigs' to an appreciation of the value of a good carcass. Trading profits in consumer foods grew 11 per cent to Pounds 30.8m on sales of Pounds 297m, including a full six months from Sooner Snacks, which was bought a year ago for about Pounds 44m. Golden Wonder is a leader in pot foods, where the market had grown by 9 per cent. Mr Warren said part of the success was due to two new products: Fun Pots for children and Pot Light. The snacks market was flat, but some Sooner products such as Wotsits were showing growth. The relaunch of Golden Wonder crisps in October had lifted its market share. Difficulties in the bread market and the temporary closure of a factory cut into the food ingredients division's trading profits, which fell 16 per cent to Pounds 9.1m on reduced sales of Pounds 139m. Federal Bakeries had been sold to Ranks Hovis McDougall. Further rationalisation of the milling and baking industries was awaited following Tomkins' acquisition of RHM. Net debt rose from Pounds 79m in December 1991 to Pounds 109m. Two-thirds was accounted for by the pound's fall against the dollar. The interim dividend was raised 5 per cent to 7.85p, twice covered by earnings per share of 18.5p, up from 18p. Lex, Page 18; Picture, Page 20; It's a dog's life, Page 20</p>

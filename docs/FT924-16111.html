			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Taiwan's Gatt entry may depend on trade reforms TAIWAN yesterday welcomed the decision by Gatt's ruling council to consider granting the island membership of the world trade body. But analysts said Taiwan would have to agree to trade and other reforms for its bid to be successful. Gatt agreed on Tuesday to set up a working party to consider the application. The group will review Taiwan's trade practices for up to a year, by which time the island will need a two-thirds majority vote from the full Gatt council. Trade areas likely to be reviewed include Taiwan's high tariffs on agricultural imports, curbs on foreign involvement in securities markets and preferential government overseas procurement policies, which tend to favour the US at the expense of Japan. This is designed to cut Taiwan's trade surplus with the US, which stood at Dollars 8.2bn (Pounds 4.8bn) last year, and contain the island's Dollars 9.7bn trade deficit with Japan. Officials said privately that joining Gatt would cause short-term harm to some Taiwanese companies, and is likely to be criticised by the local farming community. Farmers and forestry workers account for under 15 per cent of Taiwan's labour force, but are well organised and politically important. Taipei is likely to push on with reform, since Gatt membership would boost its international standing. Because of opposition from China, Taiwan has full diplomatic relations with only 29 countries. China's application is being reviewed separately and is likely to be approved before Taiwan's, if only by minutes.</p>

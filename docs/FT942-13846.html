			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Monsanto posts record first term Monsanto, the St Louis-based chemical group, yesterday said the cyclical upturn in the US economy and a strong performance by its herbicide business helped lift profits to record levels in the first quarter. Net income in the first three months of 1994 climbed 38 per cent to Dollars 194m, or Dollars 1.63 a share, from Dollars 141m, or Dollars 1.17, in the year-earlier quarter, when the company realised an after-tax gain of Dollars 22m, or 18 cents. The results exceeded Wall Street's consensus forecast of Dollars 1.53 a share, but the stock made only modest progress on the announcement. On the New York Stock Exchange the share price closed Dollars  1/4 higher at Dollars 76 1/4 . Mr Paul Raman, an analyst with SG Warburg in New York, said Monsanto's improved profitability reflected cost cutting as well as strong growth in sales volume. Consolidated net revenues came in at Dollars 2bn, against Dollars 1.94 in the first 1993 reporting period. In its agricultural division, the growing popularity of Roundup, a herbicide that allows farmers to clear land without tilling, lifted operating income by 37 per cent. Better-than-expected sales of BST, a controversial new hormone that increases milk production by cows, helped offset lower prices for most products, especially in Europe.</p>

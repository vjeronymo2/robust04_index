			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Soviet MPs set to approve emigration law THE Soviet parliament may today approve a long-awaited emigration law which the US has made a precondition to granting the country most-favoured-nation trading status. But a new catch to the draft law, which has been held up since its first reading last year, is that it would take effect only in July 1992. Previously Soviet officials have said only a six-month period would be needed before a more liberal passport system could be operated. Conservative opponents of the law, which establishes the right to free travel and emigration, fear it will lead to a massive exodus of Soviet citizens and continue a 'brain drain' which started with Jewish emigration. The proposal for the legislation to take effect only in mid-1992, contained in an accompanying resolution submitted to deputies, is an apparent concession to that opposition. While it has become easier for Soviet citizens to leave the country under President Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika, they still need an invitation from foreign hosts or a business reason to travel, even for a short stay abroad. Not surprisingly, a recent opinion poll showed that 93.6 per cent of Soviet citizens wanted a free exit law to be adopted swiftly. The poll, published by the weekly newspaper Nedelya, also suggested that only 20 per cent feared it would unleash mass emigration. Soviet authorities have estimated that between 500,000 and 3m people could emigrate if legislation was passed. Some Soviet officials have put out the wilder figure of up to 7m - in order, many suspect, to frighten western countries which have nagged Moscow on the issue of emigration. Nearly 500,000 people emigrated last year. But once the new law is passed, Soviet citizens will be restricted by tough visa requirements now being applied by most western countries. Many will also be unable to afford the cost of buying hard currency, and queues for tickets are months long. The absence of a free emigration law not only violates the Helsinki agreement, providing for the free movement of citizens, but has also been a stumbling-block in trading relations with the US. The Jackson-Vanik amendment, dating from the 1970s, prohibits the US government from granting export credits to the Soviet Union until it allows free emigration. Last year President George Bush suspended the amendment for six months, pending the legislation's expected adoption this spring. Washington has also regularly granted the Soviet Union credits to buy US grain. It is unclear, however, whether the Soviet law, if passed in its present form, will overcome US objections. Applicants seeking to leave the country for good still need an invitation from relatives living abroad. They can also be barred from leaving for a period of up to five years if they are deemed to hold 'state secrets' (this is progress, in so far as 'holders of state secrets' could be blocked from leaving indefinitely in the past). Exit visas can also be denied to people involved in criminal investigations, as well to men eligible for military service. Finally, the Soviet government reserves the right to suspend free exit legislation in case of unspecified 'threats to state security'.</p>

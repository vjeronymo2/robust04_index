			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD &amp; WINE;  </P> <P> THE LUXURIOUS LIMA;  </P> <P> FRESH CORN, PEPPERS AND (FROZEN) BEANS MAKE A NEW VERSION OF INDIAN SUCCOTASH  </P> <P> I COULD NEVER quite figure out why I'd never found fresh lima beans. They'd  show up from time to time in plastic bags in supermarket produce sections,  already shelled and usually treated with preservatives, but beyond that, they  were canned or frozen.  </P> <P> A few years ago, I started seeing fresh lima beans at farm stands in the  Camarillo-Oxnard area (where limas grow in profusion) and at the weekly farmers  markets in Santa Monica and other communities. "How come the supermarkets never  carry these things?" I asked a grower in Camarillo one day. "Too hard to  shell," he answered. "People won't buy 'em."  </P> <P> Limas do have flat, tough, dark green pods, but they aren't hard to shell at  all -- easier than fava beans and no more difficult than peas. But are the  fresh ones worth the trouble? Are they ultimately all that much better than the  frozen variety? In my opinion, no.  </P> <P> Lima beans survive the freezing process with a surprising amount of texture and  flavor intact. Frozen limas do not need to be boiled or simmered in salted  water for 15 to 25 minutes -- no matter what Birds Eye or Springfield or the  Jolly Green Giant may tell you. They just need to be heated through. Most  people don't like them because they're mushy. Take my word for it: They're not  mushy unless they're overdone.  </P> <P> The lima bean (Phaseolus limensis) takes its name from Lima, Peru, where it was  widely grown, and was first mentioned in print in 1756. The "Larousse  Gastronomique" adds that the lima is also called the Cape bean or pea, the  Sieva bean, the sword bean, the jack bean and the Chad bean. Larousse does not,  however, offer a recipe for the thing -- possibly because the French consider  the lima poisonous.  </P> <P> If Larousse had offered a lima-bean recipe, it almost certainly would have been  for succotash -- a dish which, with the possible exception of ham hocks and  lima beans, is probably the highest gastronomic use to which the lima can be  put. Succotash is said to be an Americanized form of the Narragansett Indian  word for an ear of corn, usually rendered as misickquatash. And whether or not  the Indians actually ate succotash, it has certainly been a part of American  traditional cooking for at least a couple of hundred years.  </P> <P> I make a non-traditional version of succotash, with no butter and not very much  cream but with the added flavorings of garlic, scallions and bacon. And I make  it with frozen lima beans.  </P> <P> NON-TRADITIONAL SUCCOTASH  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons olive oil  </P> <P> 3 1/4-inch slices slab bacon, cut into cubes  </P> <P> 6 scallions, trimmed and minced (use white and green parts)  </P> <P> 3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced  </P> <P> 1 stalk celery, cut into 1/4-inch cubes  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons mild paprika  </P> <P> 2 red or yellow bell peppers (or one of each)  </P> <P> 6 ears fresh white or yellow corn  </P> <P> 1 10-ounce package frozen baby lima beans  </P> <P> 1/4 cup heavy cream  </P> <P> Salt and pepper  </P> <P> In large skillet or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium-low heat; add bacon  and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until brown and crisp. Remove with  slotted spoon, drain on paper towels and set aside.  </P> <P> Add about 2/3 scallions, garlic, celery and paprika to oil and bacon fat, and  saute slowly until vegetables are translucent.  </P> <P> While vegetables are cooking, char peppers quickly on all sides on barbecue, in  preheated broiler or directly on gas burner. Allow to cool, then scrape off  charred skin, halve peppers and scrape out seeds, ribs and stem. Cut peppers  into pieces about 1/2 inch square; add to skillet.  </P> <P> Husk and rinse corn; cut kernels from cobs with sharp knife. Add to skillet,  and cook for about 2 minutes. Add frozen limas and mix well, cooking until  heated through but not mushy, about 5 to 8 minutes. Immediately stir in cream,  and add salt and pepper to taste.  </P> <P> Just before serving, stir in remaining scallions. Makes 6 servings.  </P> <P> Food stylist: Stephanie Greenleigh  </P></p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Pasminco sells mine interest Pasminco, the Australian zinc and lead producer, is selling a 40 per cent interest in the Elura zinc/lead mine in New South Wales to Korea Zinc Company for ADollars 40m (USDollars 28.7m). The price will be paid in two instalments: ADollars 27m when the deal is completed, and a further ADollars 13m when the mine is upgraded to allow it to operate at its 'installed' capacity of 1.2m tonnes of ore a year. It currently operates at only around 800,000 tonnes a year. Once back to installed capacity, Pasminco will take 60 per cent of the output to supply its Australian smelters, while Korea Zinc will use the remainder to supply zinc and lead smelters in Korea.</p>

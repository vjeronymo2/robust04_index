			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with V. A. Bakunin, chairman of the Oblast </F> Committee on Ecology and Rational Use of Nature, by M. Fonotov;  place and date not given: ``Ecology of Decline'']    [Text]    Fonotov: Vasiliy Aleksandrovich, in line with  established tradition we must make our fourth summary of the  ecological year, this time for 1993. In order to start a fire it  is necessary to toss in some statistical firewood. Please give  us some figures for last year. Let us start with the atmosphere.  Is the air we breathe cleaner? Are discharges into the air basin  of industrial enterprises decreasing? Please.    Bakunin: I will cite some figures not just for  last year, but for the five-year period--our committee was  created five years ago.    Thus, in 1993 discharges from stationary sources went down  13.9 percent, or by 256,000 tonnes. That is the highest index in  recent years.    Here are more details: Some 2,624,000 tonnes of harmful  substances were discharged into the atmosphere in 1988, whereas  in 1993 it was 1,883,000 tonnes. Over five years the decrease  amounted to 741,000 tonnes.    Fonotov: That is almost as much as was discharged  five years ago by Magnitogorsk. This is impressive! But let us  return to 1993. Interpret the discharges in that year.    Bakunin: The following picture appears. Out of  256,000 tonnes--that was the decrease in discharges last year,  only 40 percent was accounted for by implementation of measures  for the protection of nature.    Fonotov: What about the rest?    Bakunin: The other 60 percent was accounted for by  curtailment of production.    Fonotov: For example?    Bakunin: For example, Magnitogorsk, which was  mentioned. Last year enterprises in the city discharged 434,000  tonnes into the atmosphere. If one recalls, it used to be  856,000 tonnes. The Sintering Plant No 1, Open-Hearth Shop No 3,  and open-hearth furnaces No. 3, 5, 30, and 31, as well as blast  furnace No. 3 along with the coke furnace batteries, and other  facilities were closed down.    Fonotov: What about Chelyabinsk?    Bakunin: The decrease in discharges in Chelyabinsk  last year was limited. Just 49,000 tonnes. Only 4,600 tonnes of  which was accounted for by measures for the protection of the  air. The rest also resulted from a cutback in production    Fonotov: The notorious ESPTs-1 [Electronic Steel  Smelting Shop-1] at the metallurgical combine has finally been  stopped.    Bakunin: Yes. It was mothballed as of 15 February  of this year.    Fonotov: What does mothballing mean?    Bakunin: It means that operation was halted but  the equipment was not removed. What happens with the shop in the  future is up to the combine.    Fonotov: How about the workers?    Bakunin: The workers were transferred to other  sectors, but apparently even the ChMK [Chelyabinsk Metallurgical  Combine] will not be able to avoid manpower cuts.    Fonotov: Something else has closed in Chelyabinsk?    Bakunin: Of course. Some of the equipment at the  ChEMK [Chelyabinsk Electrometallurgical Combine], the tube  rolling-plant, the Stankomash, the abrasives combine, the  Kolyushchenko Plant, and elsewhere has been taken out of  operation. At the same time emissions increased at the TETs-1  [Heat and Power Plant] and TETs-2 as natural gas is replaced  with coal. The consumption of gas also went down in the city as  a whole because of production cuts. That is why the city and  oblast administration appealed to the government with a request  to increase the delivery of gas to the power engineers, but  Moscow is yet to respond.    Fonotov: Can you also name some other cities?    Bakunin: I can. The Troitsk GRES [State Regional  Electric Power Station] diminished discharges by 63,000 tonnes,  but unfortunately, also through a decline in the generation of  electric power. The volume of emissions decreased in Satka and a  number of other cities.    Fonotov: What about Karabash?    Bakunin: Karabash decreased its discharge tenfold  last year and even more now. In essence that combine has been  stopped. The city was left with no work to do.    Fonotov: About the ecology of 1993 it will  probably be possible to say that this was the ecology of  production cutbacks. The closing down of furnaces, shops, and  entire plants, of course, promoted a healthier environment. At  one time, however, we were not counting on that kind of  ``success.'' You must remember, of course, how strongly  Chelyabinsk workers demanded the closing of the ESPTs-1 at ChMK.  So many angry words were spoken, so many accusatory petitions  were compiled! The ESPTs-1 is now closed but no rejoicing  because of that is heard.    The decrease in production blunted the problem of ecology  but  did not eliminate it, merely postponing it. The best solution  probably lies in the replacement of old manufacturing methods  with new ones. Vasiliy Alkesandrovich, how do you and your  committee view the idea supporting a revival of Karabash as  proposed by the Klyuch Joint-Stock Company?    Bakunin: It is a good idea. We reviewed the  proposed manufacturing methods and approved them. They are  suitable not only for Karabash but for all of the other  metallurgical centers which have accumulated mountains of waste  products. But there are no funds. It would seem that only  limited funds are needed to start but even that is not  available. The oblast administration and the oblast ecological  fund appropriated some money but without government help such a  project is apparently impossible.    Fonotov: I want to ask you about another  ``famous'' facility--the ESPTs-6 at the ChMK. As we all know the  construction of that shop was received by city residents in a  rather ambiguous manner. Then interest in it vanished. What is  its fate? Is it being built or was it ``frozen?''    Bakunin: The working committee accepted ESPTs-6.  In the immediate future the facility should be accepted by the  state commission. In other words, the shop is ready. However it  is difficult to predict its fate under the new conditions. It is  apparently a complex situation.    Fonotov: Last year only a few scrubbers, filters,  and other installations for the protection of the environment  were built. That is understandable. The economy is concerned  with other matters. Does this mean that ecology will be of  secondary concern this year as well?    Bakunin: In the course of the year it was  necessary to carry out 41 measures. We are speaking about such  cities as Plast, Verkhnii Ufaley, Vishnevogorsk, Satka, and  Bakval.    Fonotov: And in Chelyabinsk?    Bakunin: In Chelyabinsk practically nothing was  completed. It is sufficient to say that a gas scrubber for  ESPTs-3 furnaces has been under construction for many years at  the ChMK. The reason for that is a lack of funds.    Fonotov: But it is said that enterprises are  paying a lot for polluting the environment?    Bakunin: That depends on the viewpoint. What does  ``a lot'' mean? The standards were introduced in 1991, before  August 1993 they were merely doubled. This year it is expected  that they will be increased tenfold. During that period,  however, the cost of production went up by a factor of over a  thousand.    Last year enterprises paid around two billion rubles into  the  oblast ecological fund. A fourth of that was transferred by us  into the federal fund. About another three billion rubles went  into city and rayon funds. Judge for yourself whether that is a  lot or not.    We spent over a billion rubles on the financing of  facilities  for the protection of the environment. The rest was spent on  scientific research work and ecological propaganda. We helped  the agricultural engineering and state universities establish  departments of ecology.    Fonotov: The enterprises, however, are idle and it  is awkward to pressure them.    Bakunin: It is, nevertheless, necessary to apply  pressure, of course, when there is a real possibility of  decreasing harmful emissions. If we did not pressure and fine  managers the results would be different.    Fonotov: Now another traditional question about  monitoring. I am talking about an automatic air quality  monitoring system in Chelyabinsk and other cities. Is there any  progress?    Bakunin: There is. The first monitoring station is  located on our committee building--the sensor is on the roof of  the building. Hourly monitoring of radiation is carried out. We  also receive data on radiation conditions at Chelyabinsk-65 and  in Kyshtym. Kaslinsk, Kunashaksk, and Argayashsk rayons are next.    Furthermore, the administration of Chelyabinsk established  three chemical air-quality monitoring stations at the expense of  its ecological fund. They are now being adjusted and calibrated.    As commonly known this work is being done by the KBM [Miass  Design Bureau] of the city of Miass.    Fonotov: We have said something about the air. It  is necessary to mention the water as well.    Bakunin: Work on purification of wastewater has  not stopped but is being carried out with a lag in the  fulfillment of the program. A circulating system was created at  the Ashinskiy Wood-Chemical Plant. The intake of water from the  Sim River was decreased. A circulating water supply system is  under construction at the Kyshtym Machinery Plant.  Reconstruction of purification structures at Kartaly has been  delayed. Afterpurification structures on the right bank at  Magnitogorsk have not been completed. It is time to place into  operation purification facilities at the settlement of  Fershamlenhuaz, at the Kragayskiy Bor rest home.    There is only one reason which is a lack of money.  Nevertheless we shall strive for the introduction of those  facilities in 1994.    Fonotov: How did we protect the forests last year?    Bakunin: We are devoting every effort in order to  preserve forest resources because the forest in the Ural is not  only raw material but first of all, pure air and clean water.  Five years ago 2,200,000 cubic meters of timber were felled,  while last year it was 1,500,000 cubic meters. We achieved such  a decrease in felling through the creation of water reservoir  and river forest shelter belts for water conservation. Two  national parks, the Taganay and Zyuratkul parks, were opened  with our cooperation. In addition to that, on the basis of our  order the Yekaterinburg Forestry Institute studied the question  concerning optimal age for coniferous forest clearing. It turned  out that pine trees in the Ural should be felled starting with  their 121st year, and not 20 years earlier. All that made it  possible to substantially decrease felling and preserve the most  valuable forests in the mountainous portion of our oblast.    Fonotov: You mentioned new national parks. How is  their development progressing?    Bakunin: The directorate of the Taganay Park has  started functioning. The decision regarding opening of the  Zyuratkul Park was adopted at the end of last year but no funds  have been allocated thus far. Initially our ecological fund  allocated eight million rubles. One must hope that this year the  forestry committee will initiate the financing of Zyuratkul Park.    Fonotov: Contradictory reports have appeared in  the newspapers that the Ilmensk Preserve and the institute of  mineralogy are being merged. What is the position of the  committee with respect to that matter?    Bakunin: This is a sore subject. The thing is that  the Ilmensk Preserve has always been a preserve and was never  renamed while the Ural Branch of the Academy of Sciences decided  to create the Ilmensk Preserve Scientific Association. In doing  so it committed a number of legal blunders. By registering the  association the administration of the city of Miass deprived the  Ilmensk Preserve of its status as a preserve. Now it is an  association governed by its own laws. The danger is that we  might lose the Ilmensk Preserve.    Fonotov: So the dispute boils down to some finer  points of the law?    Bakunin: Yes, but these are very important points.  The issue was discussed at various levels a number of times but  no final solution has been found. As far as I know the legal  service of the oblast administration plans to appeal for  arbitration requesting repeal of the decision of the Miass  administration. On its part our committee has appealed to the  Ministry for Environmental Protection with a request to  ``accept'' the Ilmensk Preserve into its agency. We proceeded  from the fact that out of the 47 preserves in Russia, 41 are  under the jurisdiction of our ministry.    In other words the Academy of Sciences had no right to  reorganize the preserve. That can be done only by the government.    Fonotov: As I understand it neither side wishes to  harm the preserve and, quite on the contrary, all are concerned  for its well-being--why the conflict?    Bakunin: It is necessary to be very cautious with  respect to this issue in order to avoid a mistake. The bylaws of  the scientific association states that taxes on entrepreneurial  activity will go into the budget of Miass. But what sort of  entrepreneurial activity is that if preserves are not permitted  to engage in it? At the same time there is some information that  there is already trade in stones. Plans are being made for the  building of ski runs and for construction of some kind of a  laboratory with 25 residents, without our knowledge, on Miassovo  Lake.    Fonotov: If the government refuses to maintain the  preserve perhaps it should make some effort on its own in order  to survive?    Bakunin: That is what we are telling the  scientists--if you do not have the money to maintain the  preserve, transfer it to our ministry.    Fonotov: It appears that the preserve might be  lost because of the word ``association.''    Bakunin: Exactly. The preserve belongs to the  government and cannot be privatized. At the same time an  association can be privatized and it could be, for instance, a  joint-stock company.    At any rate, the question concerning the preserve must be  resolved by the government.    Fonotov: Our conversation is coming to an end. It  is possible to think that the public has lost interest in  ecology. Is that good or bad?    Bakunin: Of course that is bad. In former years  the public raised and helped to resolve many questions dealing  with protection of the environment. That is not the case any  longer. Everyone is concerned with day-to-day worries and does  not look too far ahead. Our committee, however, will continue to  work on improving the environment. Particularly since in the  difficult time of reforms the tendency toward its improvement is  preserved. Revival of the economy, in turn, will create  conditions for renovation of equipment and assimilation of  modern ecologically clean manufacturing methods.</p>

			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Poor trend continues at Heinz H. J. Heinz said sales slumped in the final three months of its fiscal year to April 2, as the US food group continued a string of disappointing performances. The company, headed by Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish businessman, also showed a sharp decline in underlying earnings. The 4 per cent downturn in revenues to Dollars 1.95bn, compared with Dollars 2.03bn in the same quarter last year, reflected operational difficulties and unfavourable trading conditions. Heinz's strong presence in overseas markets heightened the impact of negative currency fluctuations. More troublesome, however, was a 4 per cent deterioration in sales volume, after two consecutive quarterly gains. The decline in the three months partly stemmed from a failure to revive its Weight Watchers businesses during the January and February period. However, Heinz's food-service business recorded higher sales volume for the quarter and the company raised prices on most of its core products. Nevertheless, at the operating level earnings of Dollars 200.3m represented a big decline from the previous year, if a Dollars 192m restructuring charge is added back to the 1993 results. With the provision held out, Heinz earned Dollars 54.3m a year ago at the operating level. The comparison would have been even more unflattering if the company had not reduced selling, general and administrative expenses by more than 7 per cent from the year-earlier quarter. Net income amounted to Dollars 129m, or 51 cents, against Dollars 69m, or 27 cents, a year earlier. However, the restructuring charge reduced the 1993 result by 43 cents a share. For the year, net income was Dollars 602.9m, or Dollars 2.35, including gains of 24 cents on disposals, against earnings of Dollars 396.3m, or Dollars 1.53, including a provision of 45 cents for restructuring and a charge of 51 cents to reflect accounting changes.</p>

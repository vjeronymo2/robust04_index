			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Lonrho rises 74% with the help of disposals LONRHO, the international trading conglomerate, yesterday reported a 74 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits after a series of disposals. The profit figure rose from Pounds 50m to Pounds 87m as sales fell from Pounds 1.96bn to Pounds 1.5bn in the six months to March. The shares gained 7 1/2 p to close at 121p. Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho deputy chairman, yesterday said Lonrho would be focusing on four core businesses. Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier appointed joint chief executive with Mr Tiny Rowland, believes Lonrho should concentrate on three: hotels, mining and agriculture. However, Mr Spicer said: 'There is a fourth dimension of other businesses, such as textile manufacturing, which we have no intention of getting out of or destroying.' The group has still to appoint the non-executive directors which Mr Bock has said are essential to build bridges with institutional shareholders. Mr Spicer said: 'You cannot take non-executives off a shelf as if you were in a supermarket. We have to find people who are not too busy and who are willing to serve.' The recent sale of Gewog, a German holding company, brought net borrowings below Pounds 600m and gearing to 35 per cent. In the first half, net debt fell from Pounds 849m to Pounds 731m. Net interest paid declined from Pounds 44m to Pounds 35m. The sale of VAG, the UK importer of Volkswagen and Audi cars, realised Pounds 124m and a rights issue brought in another Pounds 80m. Lonrho said the underlying increase in borrowings was due to the pound's devaluation and capital spending. Operating profit from continuing operatings increased from Pounds 35m to Pounds 43m. In the UK, improvement at the Metropole Hotel Group, in which the Libyan government-controlled Libyan Arab Finance Company has a one third stake, helped the leisure division report pre-tax profits of Pounds 5m. Mineral extraction and refining raised pre-tax profits to Pounds 16m; general trade doubled to Pounds 6m; agriculture and motor distribution each made Pounds 2m; manufacturing turned a loss into a Pounds 4m profit; financial services broke even. Earnings per share were 0.8p, against a loss of 2p. The interim dividend is maintained at 2p. Lex, Page 18</p>

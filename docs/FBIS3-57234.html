			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In an interview granted to Tiraspol television in  the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party and deputy of the  State Duma, has made a delirious statement again, throwing  menacing statements and invectives at an independent and  sovereign state -- the Republic of Moldova.    Here is an excerpt from that interview, which caused  consternation in Chisinau and not just there:    [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording, in Russian with superimposed  Romanian translation] Send us your request immediately to join  the ruble zone and that is it! You will have Russian currency,  all your payments will be made in rubles, and you will not have  any more problems. That is the sole solution.    You are a part of Russia, even if, for the time being,  Moldova does not want to become a part of Russia. I promise I  will do it! We will incorporate you within Russia on all planes,  including the diplomatic, military, financial, and economic  aspects.    I wish you courage and manliness. I understand your  situation. You are encircled by Moldova and Ukraine. Yours is  the most difficult situation in the whole of Russia. Look, the  Russians in Lithuania have Leningrad to support them. However,  there is no one standing beside you. You represent the most  heroic part of Russia! I will do everything I can. I will make  all necessary efforts for you to return to Russia, and we will  compensate all your losses. Of course, we cannot compensate  your losses in human lives, but we will compensate them by  severely punishing all those who are guilty for the crimes  perpetrated on the soil of the Dniester Republic. We will not  lie to you and we will not betray you! Never, ever! The  Dniester Republic shall be a part of Russia! [end recording]    In connection with the aforementioned allegations, which  justify the requests of Zhirinovskiy's many compatriots to begin  penal investigations against him or send him to a mental  hospital, the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the Republic of  Moldova has issued the following press communique:    The Foreign Affairs Ministry of Moldova today sent a note to  the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Chisinau in connection  with the interview granted by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to Tiraspol  television, which was broadcast on 18 January 1994, in which the  deputy to the Russian Duma formulated territorial claims against  the Republic of Moldova, saying, among other things, that the  Dniester Republic should be included in Russia and that the  [14th] Army will stay there.    The Foreign Affairs Ministry considers such statements made  by a representative of Russia's law-making body as irresponsible  and consequently as an attempt made against the sovereignty and  territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova. Such  statements prejudice Moldovan-Russian relations, create tension  among the public opinion, and might negatively influence the  talks on the political settlement of the conflict in the eastern  rayons [of Moldova] and the withdrawal of the 14th Army from  Moldova.    The Foreign Affairs Ministry of Moldova resolutely protests  and requests that adequate steps be taken to express the clear  distancing of the competent bodies of the Russian Federation  from the stance and statements made by Zhirinovskiy, concludes  the press communique released by the Foreign Affairs Ministry of  the Republic of Moldova.</p>

The agreement, the terms  of which he did not specify, would come about, when the time  comes, within the framework of a conversation between the two  top leaders, who in fact have an official meeting pending for  which no date has been set, although it is forecast that it  could be held from January onward.    The case Jordi Pujol cited of a negotiation currently under  way was the negotiation on the police force model, on the basis  of the draft bill on the police approved by the [Catalan]  government, which he discussed this week with government  representative in Catalonia Miquel Solans and which he plans to  discuss next week with Interior Minister Antoni Asuncion, who  will be visiting Barcelona in order to meet with the Generalitat  premier, "because the agreement reached with Jose Luis Corcuera  in 1990 is exhausted and must quite naturally, of course, be  reviewed." Nevertheless, Jordi Pujol stressed that contacts  with ministers -- "not just in this case, but in all cases" --  are not enough to reach agreements. To achieve this, he must  hold contacts with Felipe Gonzalez. In practical terms, this was  a reminder that his sole interlocutor is the prime minister and  that, as he himself has already hinted on previous occasions,  their mutual relationship does not allow the existence of  intermediaries. The Generalitat premier would not assess  relations with the government within this framework, "because  they are evolving, and static assessments cannot be made,"  although he specified that "the abolition of civil governors is  badly blocked."

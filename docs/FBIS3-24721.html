At the second stop of his western Transvaal campaign  trail, the ANC leader told a crowd at Stilfontein that his  organisation had made the Afrikaner's an offer they would be  foolish to refuse. Rightwingers could have their own separate  election ballot to vote for a volkstaat [homeland]. But, the  ultimate decision on the establishment of such a homeland would  be made by the government voted into power.    Mr Mandela further warned rightwingers not to do anything to  plunge the country into a conflict that would leave many, both  black and white, dead. "We know how to fight too," Mr Mandela  said.    From one packed stadium to the next, Mandela kept up a  hectic  schedule on Sunday. Despite being a poor community, residents  at the next stop at Jouberton Township outside Klerksdorp went  all out to welcome him. Here, his message of proper housing and  services, education, health care and employment for the masses  drew an enthusiastic response.    Mr Mandela said no matter how much money and effort the ANC  poured into uplifting poverty-stricken communities by creating  jobs and giving children a free education, the people themselves  had to work hard and be dedicated to improving their lot. He  said the ANC's national public works programme would not only  give people jobs, but allow the community to be part of a  labour-intensive project of building facilities like homes,  clinics, hospitals and roads.    Mr Mandela warned, however, that changes would not be  noticeable in the first few years after elections. "Do not  expect to be driving a Mercedes the day after the elections.  You must have patience. You might have to wait five years for  results to show. But, we will immediately begin mobilising  resources and implementing plans," he said.    Throughout the day, Mandela appealed to people to allow the  National Party to campaign freely in the townships. "We want  you to give all organisations a chance to canvass support in the  townships. Let them come and show they have nothing to offer  you. They will only expose themselves. We will not have to  bury them after elections. They are burying themselves," he  said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] After releasing a detailed report on the regrettable  incidents that were reported on 28 April, Social Communications  Minister Ernesto Machicado asked the Bolivian Labor Federation  [COB] leaders to overcome these attitudes that cause so much  damage to the Bolivian family.    These images clearly indicate what happened in the city of  La  Paz on 28 April following the COB-sponsored workers  mobilizations.    Without attributing responsibility to either side, and  merely  viewing the responsibility of the authorities in handling the  situation the best way possible, Social Communications Minister  Ernesto Machicado regretted the incidents at Government House.  He singled out these attitudes that caused these extremely  serious criminal actions against private property and  individuals. Machicado also asked the COB leaders to ponder and  overcome these attitudes, which, on occasions like this, are  used by some criminal sectors.    [Begin Machicado recording] For example, what happened here  at Government House, is (?extremely regrettable). The fact that  a journalist from Radio Nueva America has been injured by a  stone thrown by someone is extremely regrettable.    I, the social communications minister, who has permanent  ties  with the media, did not expect this to happen, particularly to  someone who was doing her job.    [Words indistinct] and journalist [name indistinct] was hit  by a stone. It is very regrettable that the police [words  indistinct] and seriously injured.    Following the destruction and the fires, the three detainees  who had been detained on the streets for common law offense  escaped. They fled and the police [words indistinct]. About 10  vehicles were destroyed [words indistinct]. I was close by and  [words indistinct]. This is very unpleasant information.    Both the labor minister and the human development minister  repeatedly asked not to include special measures in the talks  [with the COB]. There were no special measures. The events  have shown that this is not merely a whim because the government  has no reason to be whimsical.    We merely sought to [words indistinct] for the talks to be  fruitful because [words indistinct] on the one hand, they  implement pressure measures, and, on the other hand, they  participate in talks [words indistinct]. This shows a  contradiction in terms: To be a friend and to not be a friend at  the same time. [end recording]</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Apathy envelops the cold heart of Siberia: Elections in Russia Straddling the Trans-Siberian railway, exactly half-way between Russia's European west and its Asian east, the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk speaks for the Russian heartland. In the fight for the great Russian middle, Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of the reformist Russia's Choice bloc, kicked off his campaign there. Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the neo-fascist candidate, did better, visiting the city three times, and all of Russia's other leading politicians have been careful to include Krasnoyarsk on their whistle-stop tours of the country. 'We are in the middle of Russia, so we reflect the middle Russian view,' the energetic young governor of the region, Mr Valeri Zubov, says proudly. 'The way Krasnoyarsk votes is the way Russia votes.' But the hardy inhabitants of this frozen region - the centre of Russia's gold rush in the 1830s and later a place of exile for political dissidents - have developed a powerful aversion to the blandishments of the capital's politicians. Belying their city's name, which translates literally as 'red and passionate', the citizens of Krasnoyarsk appear largely indifferent to the forthcoming parliamentary elections and constitutional referendum. Everyone is heartily sick of what are commonly described as 'the political games' being played thousands of miles away in Moscow and would prefer to get down to the difficult business of surviving in Russia's crumbling economy. 'Nothing decided in Moscow has any effect on us here,' says Mr Sergei Dyakov, a moustachioed 30-year-old machinist who works at one of the city's chemical factories, as he patiently stands in a queue to buy sausage.' In our country, laws have less value than the paper on which they are printed, so I don't plan to vote for any of the candidates or on the constitution,' Mr Dyakov says. Mr Ivan Chupriyanov, the barrel-chested director of an alumina factory on the wind-swept Siberian steppes 250km north-west of Krasnoyarsk, heartily agrees. 'The past three years,' he says, 'have progressively taught us not to be political.' This indifference to party politics is reflected in the decision of many local politicians to run for seats in parliament on the basis of their personal reputations rather than party affiliation. Yet if eyes in Krasnoyarsk roll heavenward when the subject is politics, the interest in the economy is avid. As in the the rest of Russia, the area is beginning to feel the pinch of finance minister Boris Fyodorov's tight grip over the government's purse strings. In a region where entire cities were built up in isolated areas to serve the needs of a single factory, the repercussions of this policy are particularly grim. Unable to pay for fuel, dozens of towns - in areas where January temperatures regularly drop below minus 40'F - are cutting off domestic heating. Cash-strapped Krasnoyarsk enterprises are typically at least three months behind in paying workers' salaries. Unsurprisingly, this financial crunch means pressed factory directors admit their political sympathies lie with the left. Asked whether he prefers the more moderate reforms advocated by Mr Grigory Yavlinsky over the fast-track approach of Mr Gaidar, Mr Yegor Demianenko, director of an oil refinery in Achinsk, a city 250km north of Krasnoyarsk, is offended. 'Are you trying to insult me?' replies the manager, whose refinery, now operating at less than 50 per cent capacity and running debts of more than 40bn roubles, is one of only two employers in a town of 130,000. 'Both of them are terrible.' Although he probably won't bother going to the polls at all, Mr Demianenko says that if he did vote it would be for the centrist bloc led by fellow industrialist, Mr Arkady Volsky.</p>

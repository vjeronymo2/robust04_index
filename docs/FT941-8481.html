			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Executive share options: value should be clear at the time they are granted Sir, Your leader, 'Lining the executive nest'(February 14), concludes that stock options and the levels of executive remuneration must be a matter for shareholders to resolve. Reporting on the levels of gains derived by an executive from the exercise of an option does not aways help to inform shareholders as the the appropriate levels of options to grant. Shareholders need to know the value of the options at the time they were granted. There is an obligation under company law to disclose the estimated money value of options granted to directors in the accounts of the company covering the period of grant. If not so disclosed there is an obligation on the auditors to include in the audit report a statement of the required particulars so far as they are reasonably able to do so. I am not aware of any UK company complying with its obligations. It is not coherent to claim that options cannot be valued when the value of traded options is reported on a daily basis and 'fill the blank' option pricing calculators and computer models are available to any investor. Perhaps if proper disclosure of the value of the option grants were made, the focus of the media, and shareholders, would be more properly on the value of emoluments rather than on gains arising at the time of exercise of the options. Other share based remuneration strategies would then be explored by companies, in order to align the interests of directors with those of shareholders.

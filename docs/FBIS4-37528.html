			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 21 Jun (MENA) -- The Sudanese Ummah Party has  condemned the regime's arrest of its leader al-Sadiq al-Mahdi  and two of its prominent members, 'Abd-al-Rahman Farah  'Abd-al-Rahman and Professor Hammad Baqadi.    In a statement today, the Ummah Party described the arrest  as  a "drama" to divert people's attention from the numerous  internal problems, particularly the aggravating living  conditions.    The party said the arrest was part of the crackdown within  the regime amid the extensive corruption ailing the state.    The party held the Sudanese authorities and the National  Islamic Front responsible for the safety of the detainees and  appealed to the international community and human rights  organizations to put pressure on the regime to safeguard the  detainees' lives.</p>

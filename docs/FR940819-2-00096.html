No. 94&hyph;1564 (SS). The proposed Final Judgment is subject to approval by the Court after the expiration of the statutory 60-day public comment period and compliance with the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;16(b)&hyph;(h). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Complaint alleges that Microsoft uses exclusionary and anticompetitive contracts to market certain of its personal computer operating system software products. By these contracts Microsoft has unlawfully maintained its monopoly of personal computer operating systems and has unreasonably restrained trade thereby violating Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1, 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Final Judgment not only bans Microsoft's unlawful practices, but also contains additional provisions which are prophylactic in nature, and are intended to ensure that the anticompetitive effects of those practices are not replicated through use by Microsoft of other exclusionary practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Final Judgment includes four categories of limitations on Microsoft's contracting practices. First, it limits the duration of license agreements for operating system software between Microsoft and personal computer manufacturers. Microsoft is prohibited from entering into any such license with a term exceeding one year, except that a license may include a term permitting the computer manufacturer to renew the agreement for up to one additional year on the same terms and conditions as those applicable in the original license period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the proposed Final Judgment restricts the manner in which Microsoft may charge royalties for the distribution of its operating system software with personal computers. Microsoft may not enter into any ``per processor'' license (i.e., license requiring the computer manufacturer to pay a royalty for each computer shipped with a specified microprocessor). Microsoft's revenue from a license may not be calculated on anything other than a per copy basis (i.e., royalty for each unit of Microsoft operating system software licensed, sold or distributed) or a per system basis (i.e., a royalty for each computer system bearing a particular model name or number). Should Microsoft enter into a per system agreement with a licensee it must provide a statement, the text of which is set forth in the Final Judgment, advising the licensee of its rights under the license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, the proposed Final Judgment bans Microsoft from entering into license agreements that prohibit or restrict a personal computer manufacturer from licensing, selling, or distributing competing operating system products. Microsoft may neither condition the licensing of its operating systems on the licensing or use of other products, nor may it enter into any license containing a minimum commitment, nor may it use lump sum pricing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, the proposed Final Judgment places limits on Microsoft's use of non-disclosure agreements for its operating system products. Microsoft is prohibited from entering into any non-disclosure agreement whose duration extends beyond (a) the commercial release of the covered product, (b) any prior public disclosure of information covered by the agreement authorized by Microsoft, or (c) one year from the date of disclosure of information covered by the agreement to a person subject to the non-disclosure agreement, whichever comes first. Also, non-disclosure agreements may not restrict persons subject to the agreement from developing software products that will run on competing operating systems, provided that such development does not entail the disclosure or use of Microsoft proprietary information during the term of the agreement. Nor may any non-disclosure agreement restrict the activities of persons subject to the agreement to whom no information covered by the agreement has been disclosed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Computer manufacturers that currently have licenses that are inconsistent with any provision of the Final Judgment may, without penalty, terminate the license or negotiate with Microsoft to amend the inconsistent provisions. Otherwise, Microsoft may enforce the license, subject to the following restrictions: (a) if the license is a per processor license, it must be treated as a per system license; and (b) Microsoft may not enforce prospectively any minimum commitment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public comment is invited within the statutory 60-day comment period. Such comments, and the responses thereto, will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and filed with the Court.

Rosen, Chief, Communications &amp; Finance Section, Antitrust Division, Room 8104, 555 Forth Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20001 (202&hyph;514&hyph;5621).

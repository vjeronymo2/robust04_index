			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE WATCH  </P> <P> Tell Me, Kate: Acting legend Katharine Hepburn's memoirs are coming out next  year, according to the Alfred A. Knopf publishing house. The four-time best  acting Oscar winner and star of the "Philadelphia Story" and "The African  Queen" -- and other classics -- will reflect on her childhood and family, her  early days in New York, her long on- and off-screen association with Spencer  Tracy and working with the leading actors, directors and producers of the past  50 years. Describing her decision to write the book now, the 80-year-old  Hepburn said: "It's later than you think!" GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

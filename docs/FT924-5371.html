			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Warning by Tietmeyer on inflation GERMAN inflation could persist as a threat to monetary stability beyond the end of the decade, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank, suggested yesterday. As new figures were published showing inflation in western Germany stubbornly refusing to fall, Mr Tietmeyer said he hoped the new century would be an era of stability. However, he warned: 'At present this is unfortunately oriented more to the principle of hope than to reality.' Germany in particular was in a difficult transitional period, he said in a speech at Cambridge University, England. The challenges of German unification were still far from being met. Nor had 'necessary decisions' on corrections to fiscal and wage policies yet been taken. 'In our opinion, price increases of 3.5-4 per cent cannot be consistent with the principle of monetary stability in the long run,' he added. The government of Bavaria yesterday reported its fourth consecutive month-on-month increase in inflation, which took the annual rate to 4 per cent. North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany's most heavily populated state, said earlier that prices there had risen 0.5 per cent since October and that the annual rate was now 3.7 per cent. Prices in Baden-Wurttemberg rose 0.3 per cent during the month, leaving the annual figure unchanged at 3.3 per cent. Provisional figures for the whole of west Germany are due in the next few days. Mr Tietmeyer said that a public debate on 'necessary corrections' had recently started in Germany, and this was a positive sign. But he hinted that while his country sorted out its problems, others had work to do. In the meantime, further realignments within the European exchange rate mechanism might be necessary. Exchange rate stability was desirable, but justifiable only if economic fundamentals in the economies concerned were kept closely in line. 'As long as this is not the case, exchange rates must be adjustable to avoid disadvantages for all countries,' he added. German inflation, a crucial element in the criteria governing the Bundesbank's present punishing interest rates regime, has benefited from external factors such as falling oil prices and lower costs for seasonal goods. However, according to a new study from the Berliner Bank, when these are stripped out, prices have been increasing since July at an annual rate of 4.8 per cent. The source is home-made inflationary pressure from rents and the price of services. These are sectors not yet hit by or immune from competition or the weaknesses in the domestic economy, which account for more than 40 per cent of household spending. The cost of repairs and other services in Germany has risen at an annual rate of 8 per cent in the past three months, and rents have gone up 6.4 per cent, the bank said.</p>

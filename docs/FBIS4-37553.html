			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati by </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "'Arafat  Will Become Mayor"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat now wants  to visit the autonomous regions of Gaza and Jericho. However,  instead of promoting the process of reconciliation in the Middle  East, Iran supports the Islamic resistance fighters of the  Hizballah in southern Lebanon who are firing Katyusha missiles  against Israel.    [Velayati] The behavior of the Hizballah and of the  "Palestinian group" are two completely different things. The  Hizballah is a Lebanese organization. It defends its country,  whose southern part is occupied. Resistance against this  occupation is legitimate.    [DER SPIEGEL] Yet it also support the Palestinian  underground organization Hamas; Israel's and the PLO's most  dangerous opponent.    [Velayati] We have practically not taken any measures  against the PLO. We only said from the very beginning that this  agreement will not solve Palestine's problems. What was the  result of the agreement? 'Arafat will become mayor of Gaza, but  that is it. What process should we promote?    [DER SPIEGEL] Would it not be about time for Iran to  recognize Israel?    [Velayati] Israel is an usurpatory regime that we do not  recognize.    [DER SPIEGEL] Is Iran not pretending to be more Palestinian  than the Palestinians themselves?    [Velayati] First 'Arafat should prove that he is the  representative of all Palestinians -- which he is not.    [DER SPIEGEL] Even Syria holds negotiations with the Israeli  archenemy on a "real and comprehensive peace."    [Velayati] That's Syria's business. However, as far as we  know, the peace talks are stalled. Syria refuses to continue  negotiations with Israel. To exert pressure on Damascus, Israel  attacked Lebanon again recently.    [DER SPIEGEL] However, if Syria and Lebanon, which depends  on Syria, make peace with Israel, the days of the Hizballah are  numbered -- or the fighters for God would have to rise against  the Lebanese and the Syrian Armies.    [Velayati] Hizballah's prospects for a political future are  good. As a party, it even bears responsibility in the Lebanese  Government and enjoys a great deal of support. For this reason,  the Hizballah will not fight against the Lebanese Government.    [DER SPIEGEL] In Yemen, too, where the fundamentalist north  and the socialist south are engaged in a fierce battle, Iran is  allegedly fomenting unrest. It is reportedly supplying North  Yemen's President Salih 'Ali 'Abdallah with weapons.    [Velayati] We do not support either side. Our principle is:  First, the unity of the country should be preserved, and,  second, the conflict should be settled peacefully.    [DER SPIEGEL] Yet South Yemen has reported Iranian fighter  aircraft in the north.    [Velayati] This is simply not true.    [DER SPIEGEL] However, the Islamic-conservative north is  closer to Iran.    [Velayati] No, we are interested in all Yemenis, who are one  people and one nation -- like the Germans.    [DER SPIEGEL] The West -- and the Arab states -- are  concerned about continued Iranian efforts to export its Islamic  revolutionary model, thus causing additional unrest in the  Middle East region.    [Velayati] These accusations are not justified. We do not  export our revolution with the use of force.    [DER SPIEGEL] Islamic fundamentalists in Sudan or in Algeria  are boasting that they have been trained and supplied with  weapons by Tehran for their armed fight against lay and  pro-Western regimes.    [Velayati] I reject this allegation vehemently. Instead of  exporting violence, we are trying to cooperate with our  neighbors and promote economic cooperation in the region.    [DER SPIEGEL] You have even established contact with your  long-time war enemy, Iraq. You will shortly travel to Baghdad  for talks.    [Velayati] We want to have good relations with all our  neighbors, including Iraq. If Saddam Husayn is president --  this is none of our business. We will not interfere.    [DER SPIEGEL] Four officials of the Kurdish party banned in  Iran were killed in Berlin in October 1992 by a killer commando.  The secret service of your government is believed to be behind  the attack.    [Velayati] This is not true. We vehemently reject this  accusation.    [DER SPIEGEL] In the so-called Mykonos trial, the federal  public prosecutor described Tehran as the mastermind of the  operation and accused your government of state terrorism.    [Velayati] This is his business. It is our task to support  Iranian citizens who are facing trial abroad. After all, Iran  is their home country. However, there is no link between these  people and our government.    [DER SPIEGEL] Above all, extremists like Ayatollah  Mohtashemi are believed to promote the export of terrorism. Has  the more Western-oriented head of state 'Ali Akbar Hashemi  Rafsanjani lost the fight against the radicals in his own ranks?    [Velayati] Everybody can have his own political ideas and he  is allowed to express them. However, our government makes the  decisions in foreign policy. President Hashemi-Rafsanjani is a  very powerful head of state.</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Leadership change improves poll chances of Icelandic opposition AN UNEXPECTED change in the leadership of Iceland's main conservative opposition party has improved its chances of toppling the centre-left coalition government in this weekend's general election. The Independence party should win about 40 per cent of the vote, compared with 27 per cent four years ago, according to a recent opinion poll. With the existing coalition split over EC membership, Independence is should be able to form a government with the pro-European Social Democrats. Just over a month ago, Mr David Oddsson, Reykjavik's colourful mayor, successfully challenged former Prime Minister Thorstein Palsson for the leadership of the party at its annual conference. Mr Oddsson, a writer and radio comedian, is more than Mr Palsson, who fell out with his colleagues in the coalition he led after the 1987 election and was forced to resign as premier in October 1988. Independence is promising to cut taxes to stimulate the economy, a message that finds considerable support among the voters. Furthermore, Independence is expected to get most of the 11 per cent share of the votes it lost to a breakaway faction of the party in 1987, which is now facing extinction. The parties in the present coalition have all lost ground, according to opinion surveys. Another loser looks like being the Women's Movement, which burst upon the political scene four years ago with just over 10 per cent of the vote. This all-woman party with a strong environmentalist position seems set to fall back to around 8-9 per cent support. The centrist Progressives, main force in the present government, are expected to poll almost as last time, with around 19 per cent support. However, its total opposition to EC membership has reduced its chances of being a part of the next coalition.</p>

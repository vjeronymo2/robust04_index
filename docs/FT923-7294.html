			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Consumers blame banks for card fraud CONSUMERS blame the banks for not making credit cards more fraud-proof, but are reluctant to pay extra for photocards or thief-proof 'smart' cards, according to a Mori survey for Readers' Digest, David Barchard writes. About 2m payment cards are lost or stolen each year in the UK, with losses of around Pounds 166m for the banks. Two out of three people interviewed blamed the banks for failing to do more to make credit cards fraud-proof. A slightly higher number, 69 per cent, believed shop assistants should check purchaser identities more thoroughly. Of 2,049 cardholders interviewed, 58 per cent said they would not pay extra for a photo-card or a thief-proof smart card. Some 27 per cent said they would pay Pounds 2 or more for additional security. A third of cardholders admitted they had written down their personal identification numbers (PINs), potentially allowing fraudsters to draw money from their accounts though cash machines. More than one in 20 kept their PIN with their card. Barclays, the largest UK card issuer, said yesterday that it was shocked that such large numbers admitted writing down their PIN and keeping the number with their card. The bank added that it was pioneering the use of artificial intelligence which can detect fraudulent patterns of spending on cards. The system detects around 40 such cases each week.</p>

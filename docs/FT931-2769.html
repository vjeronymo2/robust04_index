			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Tax change puts pressure on dividends COMPANIES ARE likely to find themselves under pressure from shareholders to reassess their dividend policies in the light of the changes in advance corporation tax. Mr Andrew Jones, senior tax partner at Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants, is blunt about it: 'Companies will have to pay bigger dividends to keep their share prices up.' This could have implications for companies' decisions on where and how they raise new finance. Shareholders which do not pay tax, such as pension funds, will get a reduced rate of tax credit on dividends paid out of UK profits. Dividends paid from foreign earnings, under the proposed foreign income dividend scheme, will not carry any tax credit. Thus such shareholders will be significantly worse off unless dividends are increased. In theory, since a company is owned by its shareholders, it should not matter that a benefit is shifted from investors to companies. This will cut little ice with investors, however. On the positive side, if companies' tax bills are reduced by the ACT changes then their earnings will increase, giving them scope to pay more in dividends. Mr Jones said: 'If the rate of dividends rises to compensate investors, the only help companies get is in shifting the burden of cost from the tax line to the dividend line of the profit and loss account'. Companies were yesterday looking at the implications of the ACT changes. Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive of T&amp;N, the motor components and engineering group, agreed that 'there could be a problem from tax-exempt shareholders pressing for higher dividends'. Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive of Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, believed Hanson's tax charge could fall by as much as Pounds 35m. But he said: 'I think it is too early to say whether that means we will pay additional dividends.' Mr Peter Clappison, finance director of BBA, the component maker for automotive, aviation and industrial markets, said he would be taking soundings from the group's tax-exempt shareholders. 'It is not clear they will be pressing for higher dividends. We will make up our minds as to what we do after we hear back from them.' The ACT changes could also affect the timing of dividend payments in the short term. The shift from a 25 per cent to 20 per cent rate of ACT will hit higher rate taxpayers, who will be required to make up the difference between the ACT rate and 40 per cent income tax. Mr Jones suggested that private companies with higher-rate taxpayers as shareholders may pay substantial dividends before the end of the tax year.</p>

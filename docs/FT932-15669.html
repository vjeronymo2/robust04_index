			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Home cover rates soar THIS WEEK'S news that Abbey National is to increase its premium rates for home contents insurance by some 37 per cent is considerably less dramatic than it might appear. Abbey National, the country's second biggest mortgage lender, sells insurance on behalf of a panel of three insurers - Commercial Union, Royal Insurance and Legal &amp; General - and said that it was increasing rates because domestic theft claims had gone 'through the roof.' It announced on Tuesday an average increase of more than 26 per cent in rates for 1993. Some customers could also pick up an additional rise of 10 per cent announced in December last year, taking their total increase to 37 per cent. But these were the first increases by Abbey for more than two years, during which time insurers have increased premiums by an average of 40 per cent - a rise which is itself dwarfed by the increase in the cost of theft claims. The cost of theft from homes has increased by more than 200 per cent since the end of 1989, to Pounds 749m in 1992. Last year alone theft costs rose by 27 per cent according to figures released last month by the Association of British Insurers, the trade association. 'Theft losses have reached epidemic proportions. In this environment it is not surprising to see vigorous rating action taking place,' said John Chester, an analyst with SG Warburg, in a recent note by the securities house. Although UK insurers saw their results improve in 1992, only two of the leading six non-life companies - Commercial Union and Guardian Royal Exchange - registered profits. In 1990 and 1991 the six companies lost more than Pounds 2bn and saw their financial strength severely eroded. Stephen Bird, analyst with Smith New Court, another securities house, said: 'People just have to look at the claims costs. Looking at the results that the companies produced last year you can hardly argue that people are being ripped off.' Not surprisingly, few observers are quibbling with the need for rate rises, but some suggest that the industry may not be doing enough to isolate the highest risks and that the increases are being unfairly charged across the board. 'Everyone is suffering from the poor experience of the few,' said Peter Friend, of brokers Leslie &amp; Godwin. Friend suggests that insurers ought to evaluate the risks of individual householders more carefully and tailor premiums to individual risks. Leslie &amp; Godwin already does this for their wealthier customers, through its Artscope International scheme. Insurers have already begun to be more discriminating. They began to charge higher rates for residents of inner city areas and other 'high risk' areas some years ago. Premium rates now vary widely according to post code. In addition, a number of insurers are offering discounts to householders who instal good quality locks or reliable alarm systems and join police-approved Neighbourhood Watch Schemes. 'We are very keen to reward customers who take a responsible attitude to protecting their homes and strongly believe in helping them fight crime,' said Brian Richards, personal insurance development manager at Norwich Union. But Friend still says they could do more, by, for example, taking into account factors such as occupation, level of occupancy and 'lifestyle'. 'The fact is that a couple without children who are out all the time are more likely to suffer from thefts,' he says. Already there are signs that some in the industry may be taking the hint. Direct Line, the insurance subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland, which insures 250,000 householders, says that it is reviewing its rating structure and could announce changes later this year.</p>

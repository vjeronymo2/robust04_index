			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Pollution burden on shipping grows The cost of pollution is becoming a financial burden for shipowners, according to a study by the UK Protection &amp; Indemnity Club, which covers liabilities for the owners and charterers of 8,000 ships, about 25 per cent of the world's ocean-going fleet. Pollution claims have amounted to Dollars 132m (Pounds 88m) since 1987, with more than 114 claims costing Dollars 1.2m on average. During 1992, the last year for which figures are available, the number of pollution claims reported to the club increased to 35, compared with 79 over the previous five years. 'Pollution tends to be an all-or-nothing claim,' said Mr Peter Donnellan, a director of Thomas Miller P &amp; I, which manages the club. 'It is increasingly expensive for all shipowners. We have to make the mariner aware that even the smallest spillages of fuel oil can be very damaging for the environment,' he added. Tankers are involved in 45 per cent of pollution claims, according to the club's latest analysis of claims. But about one-third resulted from spills of fuel oil, many of which were the result of human error. Overall between 1987 and 1992 the club's managers paid Dollars 989m in meeting 1,971 separate claims, according to the analysis. In the course of 1982 527 claims were reported costing members Dollars 205m. Cargo and personal injury claims accounted for about three-quarters of total claims. The steady increase in claims has led to a tripling in premium rates since 1987.</p>

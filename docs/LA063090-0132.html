			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> MAN SENTENCED FOR KILLING WIFE, SISTER  </P> <P> A 30-year-old Orange man on Friday was ordered to serve time in a mental  hospital and then spend 26 years to life in prison for killing his wife and  sister in June, 1988.  </P> <P> George Gallagher, a former electronics assembler at Rockwell International  Corp., was found guilty by Superior Court Judge Robert Fitzgerald of  first-degree murder for stabbing to death his sister, Mary Gallagher, at her  home in Yorba Linda.  </P> <P> The judge also found Gallagher not guilty by reason of insanity in the stabbing  death of his wife, Barbara, at the Twin Cypress Motel in Orange, where they  resided.  </P> <P> Evidence presented during Gallagher's preliminary hearing indicated that  Gallagher stabbed his wife in the head in the presence of the couple's two  children, who were 4 and 5 at the time.  </P> <P> Gallagher, who had been suffering from mental problems, took the children to  his sister's home after the slaying. The children, according to the evidence  presented by Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher Evans, told the sister that their  mother was dead.  </P> <P> When his sister confronted him with the information, Gallagher left, then  returned later and stabbed her in the heart. In finding Gallagher guilty of  first-degree murder for his sister's death, the judge ruled that he was lucid  at the time of that slaying and had planned the stabbing. Evans had contended  that Gallagher killed his sister to eliminate her as a possible witness against  him in his wife's murder.  </P> <P> Evidence also indicated that Gallagher had begun suffering mental problems  during the year before the slayings.

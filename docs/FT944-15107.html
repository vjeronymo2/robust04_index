			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Pakistan poised to ease textile curbs Pakistan could become the first major Asian textile producer to agree to open its markets to foreign exports of textiles and clothing, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said yesterday. Praising a tentative agreement reached between the US and Pakistan, Mr Kantor said the 'landmark agreement. . . represents the first time in at least two decades that US textiles and clothing will be permitted in Pakistan'. In response to exporters' demands the US has been pushing for market openings in India, China and other Asian nations more accustomed to seeking markets in the US than opening their own. Mr J. Henry Walker III, of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, said yesterday's new trade figures, showing record volumes of textile and clothing imports, demonstrated the need for market openings in India and China. The tentative pact calls for Pakistan to remove all bans on the import of fibres, yarns, fabrics, home furnishings and clothing by July 1 1995. Tariffs would be lowered over a 10-year period to levels no higher than 10 per cent for many key US yarns, 20 per cent for many fabrics and carpets, 30 per cent for home furnishings and 35 per cent for clothing. Pakistan has also agreed to eliminate prohibitions and duties on the export of raw cotton, which the US textile industry says has resulted in artificially low cotton prices in Pakistan. This gives cotton spinners and weavers 'an unfair competitive advantage'.</p>

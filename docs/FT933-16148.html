			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Europe closer on acid rain problem A compromise is emerging between European countries seeking a timetable to reduce emissions from power stations which cause acid rain, write David Lascelles and Bronwen Maddox. The new targets could be agreed at a meeting of the Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva next month. The deal would bridge the gap between countries such as Germany and Norway which favour tough targets and those wanting more leeway on timing, like the UK. Including countries from east and west, it is expected to lay the basis for new emission standards for power stations in the European Community next year. It would aim at reducing sulphur emissions by up to 90 per cent by the year 2005. The reductions would be based on the 'critical load' approach, which takes account of an area's ability to withstand acid rain.</p>

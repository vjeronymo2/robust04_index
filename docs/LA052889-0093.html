			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Suzie Azar became the first woman mayor in El Paso history with a landslide  victory over fellow City Council member Ed Elsey in a runoff election. "One  hundred seventeen years is a long time for El Paso to wait, and I'm glad they  waited for me," Azar said. The final but unofficial totals showed she had  captured 65% of the votes, or 29,961, to 35%, or 16,218, for Elsey. The  successor to Mayor Jonathan Rogers, who by law had to step down after four  consecutive two-year terms, will face problems posed by widespread poverty and  rapid growth. El Paso's elections are nonpartisan.  </P></p>

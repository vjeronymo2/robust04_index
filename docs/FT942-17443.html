			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Tory MP tells 'softie dummy' Major to quit Mr John Major will attempt to shore up his leadership by touring the Tory heartland of Essex after more Tory MPs called for his early resignation. While the prime minister's advisers were predicting that his latest regional tour would galvanise his supporters, Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, a former minister, said the time had come for Mr Major to resign. The former solicitor-general for Scotland attacked Mr Major as a 'ventriloquist's dummy' and a 'softie' - and called on him to go after the European elections in June. Sir Nicholas, MP for Perth and Kinross, and neighbour to North Tayside backbencher Mr Bill Walker - who has also appealed for a leadership change - said the risks were greater of the Tory party tearing itself apart under Mr Major's 'benevolent and inadequate' leadership. Interviewed by BBC Scotland, Sir Nicholas said he favoured Mr Michael Portillo, the rightwing chief secretary to the Treasury, to succeed Mr Major. Sir Nicholas said the prime minister was 'not up to the task'. Among his shortcomings was a lack of stature, he said. 'He is vin ordinaire, and he should be chateau-bottled.' Conservative Central Office sought to shrug off the latest attack on Mr Major, predicting that he would receive the support of ordinary people on his regional tours. But Lord Archer, a former deputy chairman, said the prime minister was 'distressed by the continual attacks on him, which are unfair'. He told BBC Radio 4 that constituency parties would be 'livid' if a stalking horse emerged to challenge Mr Major in the autumn. Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat president, accused Lord Archer of being out of date. 'The Tory Party is already tearing itself apart in this phoney war period in the run-up to the leadership election which is now inevitable,' he said. A number of MPs on the Tory right said they had privately asked Mr Portillo to take part in any leadership election to prevent giving Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, a clear run against Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, has written to Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, demanding that he ask Labour spokesmen to renounce their spending pledges or say how they are to be paid for.

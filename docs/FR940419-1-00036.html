			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF-Australia) wrote that it had no objections to the reclassification of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Crocodylus porosus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> populations in Australia from endangered to threatened, bringing the designation in line with the current CITES listing. This was only supported, however, in full recognition of the conservation status (vulnerable) recently assigned to the species by the IUCN (IUCN 1990). TRAFFIC USA furnished helpful comments on the special rule and the reporting requirements as called for under Article VIII of CITES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. Explanation of Proposed Rule for the Saltwater Crocodile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule, if made final, would revise &sect;17.11(h) to reclassify the Australian population of the saltwater crocodile from endangered to threatened. Since it is difficult to distinguish between the skins and products derived from different saltwater crocodile populations, the Service also proposes to revise &sect;17.11(h) to list the saltwater crocodile population of Papua New Guinea as threatened by similarity of appearance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Australian and Papua New Guinea populations are defined by distinct geo-political boundaries that delineate an area representing a significant portion of the range of the species. In addition, both populations are biologically significant in maintaining variability of the species and in preventing the further decline of the species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the requirements of sections 3(3) and 4(d) of the ESA, this proposed rule also would amend &sect;17.42 by adding a new paragraph to allow for the commercial importation of certain specimens from Australia and Papua New Guinea into the United States without a threatened species permit but pursuant to CITES trade controls and marking requirements and certain other specified criteria (provisions of the proposed special rule are described later in this notice). Under CITES, Australia may export saltwater crocodile skins, meat, or products only if the specimen is captively bred in a breeding system that is generally maintained without augmentation from the wild, or the specimen is derived from a crocodile farm operation following CITES ranching provisions and under an approved management program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> D. Summary of Factors Affecting the Australian Population of Saltwater Crocodile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(1) of the ESA (16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and regulations promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the ESA (50 CFR part 424) set forth five factors to be used in determining whether to add, reclassify, or remove a species from the list of endangered and threatened species. These factors and their applicability to populations of the saltwater crocodile in Australia are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The saltwater crocodile occupies a variety of tidal and non-tidal habitats across northern Australia from Maryborough on the Queensland east coast to Broome on the Western Australian west coast. The Northern Territory has more extensive areas of prime saltwater crocodile habitat than either Queensland or Western Australia (report from the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) 1990, titled, ``Evidence in Support of a Petition by Australia to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to Remove Captive Populations of the Saltwater Crocodile,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Crocodylus porosus,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in Australia from the Endangered Species List under the U.S. Endangered Species Act 1973''_copy on file with the Office of Scientific Authority). Exploitation of crocodiles in Australia began on a large scale in the late 1940's and extended into the early 1970's. During this time, populations in the rivers along the north coast were nearly extirpated with only small scattered populations remaining (King  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1979). Export of saltwater crocodiles and their parts from Australia was prohibited in 1972. Today, the habitats are largely intact across the whole of northern Australia, and the species occupies the whole of its known historical range within the country. The species is protected in the three states where it occurs (the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia). Management programs allowing limited utilization of wild stocks for crocodile farm operations have been implemented by the states in light of the crocodile's increasing population size.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the ANPWS (ANPWS 1990, op. cit.), the Northern Territory population of saltwater crocodiles has undergone significant recovery since protection from hunting in 1972. Analysis of all available monitoring results from 1975 to 1987 shows that the density of wild saltwater crocodiles in tidal rivers has tripled since surveying began. In 1984, Webb  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1989) estimated the total Northern Territory population of the saltwater crocodile to be at least 40,000 individuals. Between 1984 and 1987, monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results indicated that the tidal population increased by 16.5 percent. Assuming that this rate of increase can be applied to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population as a whole, the minimum estimate for 1989 would be 46,000 crocodiles in the Northern Territory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Sport: 49ers make the cap fit - American Football A new American football year opens tomorrow, but if there was a prize for the best performance during the off-season, the National Football League would have crowned its champions already: the San Francisco 49ers. Not because the 49ers had the best pre-season record. They won three out of four games, but two teams, the Chicago Bears and Indianapolis Colts, went undefeated in exhibition games. But because of the team management's accomplishment in adding a formidable group of talented veterans to one of the most highly-paid rosters in the sport while keeping the payroll under the limit imposed by the NFL's new salary cap. The salary cap is the cause of the US professional baseball players' strike. Unlike their counterparts in football, baseball players are not prepared to accept a limit on their pay. The NFL players' union last year accepted a ceiling on the total each team could pay its players in return for securing free agency - which allows players to move teams after a certain period in the league. The difference between the NFL's salary cap and the cap proposed by the baseball owners, is the flexibility of the NFL system. There is a lot of 'wiggle room' under the football cap, and no one has proved more adept at wiggling than the 49ers. At the end of last year, the team's total payroll exceeded Dollars 40m. It seemed that they had to reduce salaries and / or shed players to fit under the Dollars 34.6m (Pounds 22m) cap the NFL had set for the 1994 season. Today, however, the 49ers have all their top players from last year on long-term contracts, including stars such as quarterback Steve Young and wide receiver Jerry Rice. And they have five new players, each an established NFL star - on extended contracts. Yet the 49ers team payroll has dropped from more than Dollars 40m to Dollars 34.59m, just under the salary cap. How did they do it? They started late last year by hurriedly signing several key players to lucrative 'front-loaded' long-term contracts, which paid the players a lot of money for the 1993 season, and considerably less for subsequent ones. By paying out so much money in 1993, before the cap came into effect, the 49ers left themselves considerable room to sign new players for 1994, year-one of the salary cap. In basketball - the other sport with an existing salary cap - teams have fallen foul of the league authorities with this kind of creative accounting, but in football, the wiggle room leaves plenty of scope for creativity. As Carmen Policy, president of the 49ers, put it: 'We wanted to be the hunters, not the hunted. We wanted to do what we could to manipulate the system, rather than have it control us.' After anchoring many of their best players to the team, the 49ers went hunting. They bagged several top free agents, including Super Bowl winners Ken Norton of the Dallas Cowboys and Richard Dent of the Chicago Bears, and veterans Rickey Jackson of the New Orleans Saints and Bart Oates of the New York Giants. It was no coincidence that all of the new signings were defenders, for the defence has been the chief weakness of the attack-oriented 49ers for the past few seasons. Some of the money needed to pay the newcomers came from the release of well-paid reserve players, including Steve Bono, the back-up quarterback who so often deputised for injured stars such as Joe Montana and Steve Young. Also, the 49ers chose to hire a lot of relatively cheap 'rookie' players fresh from university teams. The result is a well-balanced team, a favourite to reach the Super Bowl in January. The only likely obstacle is the defending champions, the Cowboys, who beat the 49ers in the last two National Football Conference finals. The Cowboys, however, have lost their coach, Jimmy Johnson and several leading players including Norton. Yet, the 49ers' policy of squeezing so much expensive talent under the salary cap involves a risk. Because the 49ers have let go so many veteran reserves and replaced them with mostly untested players, a team that was once renowned for its 'depth' now has little insurance if its stars get injured. And in the NFL, that is quite a gamble.</p>

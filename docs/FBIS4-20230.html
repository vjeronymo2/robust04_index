			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Juan G. Ibanez report: "Roca Warns Socialists That He Will </F> Withdraw His Support From Them Unless Corruption Is Thoroughly  Combated"]    [Text] Madrid -- Miquel Roca yesterday gave Felipe  Gonzalez the fuel for the government to carry on, but he warned  him that that assistance could end unless the Socialists are  able to use it correctly right now, namely to make every effort  to combat corruption. He held the government responsible for  success or failure in that task. CiU [Convergence and Union]  thus made it clear that it stands by its parliamentary pact with  the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party], but also that it  could soon be broken off if the Socialists do not regain their  credibility.    The CiU spokesman based his [Congress of Deputies] state of  the nation speech on confidence and hope -- confidence because  of the perceptible signs of economic recovery, and hope that the  Socialists will prevent corruption from handicapping recovery.    Roca confronted Gonzalez with evidence that the confidence  in  the government, which is essential for investments and job  creation, "has been seriously eroded." "In order to restore  that confidence," he told him, "you, Mr. Prime Minister, must  convince society that the struggle against any instance of  corruption will be led and directed by the government itself;  that you, Mr. Prime Minister, accept full responsibility for  this action."    Roca was very cautious in describing the current corruption  scandals -- "a disturbing and irritating phenomenon" -- but was  emphatic in his warning to the government about the Catalan  nationalists' support for the PSOE. When calling on Gonzalez to  regain day by day his now weakened credibility, he warned him:  "For this you will not lack the necessary stability, but you  could lack it if you do not achieve this."    Roca, who did not miss the opportunity to proclaim that none  of the improvements in the economic situation is unconnected  with CiU's initiative or cooperation, asserted the urgent need  for a new urban rents law and the urgent implementation of the  labor reform, and the need to amend the social security system  and to modernize and streamline the functioning of the  administration of justice.  <H5>  Slowness and Impunity </H5>   With respect to corruption, he said that slowness is a party  to impunity. Accordingly, he proposed that Congress define a  shortened legal procedure which, without detriment to legal and  procedural safeguards, would ensure rapid handling of corruption  cases. "Society should learn quickly whether or a not a report  is well-founded; it should know whether the report is untrue or  if corruption is a fact," Roca stated.    The CiU spokesman also proposed making it a requirement that  before taking office, those holding public posts of some  importance be examined by a parliamentary committee on their  professional and personal careers. Last, in view of the biased  leaks concerning the debates of the committees of enquiry, he  proposed that they cease to be secret.    Roca's speech was applauded by several Socialist deputies  and  received in silence by his group colleagues, which caused  laughter among the People's Party seats.</p>

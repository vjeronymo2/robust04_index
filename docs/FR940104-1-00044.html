As explained in the previous section, NHTSA anticipates specifying the test surfaces used in the test procedures in terms of peak friction coefficient. While the braking-in-a-curve test would have a PFC of 0.5, the split mu and transition tests would have the surface specified based on the relative PFC of each of the two portions of the surface. The braking-in-a-curve test surface represents a wet secondary road in poor condition, and the split mu and transition test surface represent roads with different coefficients of friction such as those with ice patches. What practicability concerns, if any, are raised by conducting tests on surfaces with both low and high coefficients of friction? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. Two different methods of applying brakes can be used when testing ABSs (and braking systems in general). One method is a ``full pedal'' application typical of how a driver might apply the brake pedal in reaction to a crash-threatening situation. This type of brake application can precipitate wheel lock-up and loss-of-control if the vehicle is operating on a slippery surface. A second method is a modulated ``driver-best-effort'' application in which the driver modulates the brake in an attempt to maintain stability and lateral control. This method enables stops that are as quick and short as possible while still maintaining stability and steering control. As with the heavy vehicle ABS rulemaking, the agency anticipates proposing a full pedal application because it is more representative of a typical driver's response to a real world crash-threatening situation. In addition, such an application is more objective and repeatable. In specifying the amount of brake application force in this test procedure, the agency anticipates that a pedal force of 200 pounds in 0.2 seconds would adequately represent a full pedal application for light vehicles. The agency requests comments about the best way to specify the brake application provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Varieties of ABS Permissible under Potential Proposals <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 17. Agency testing indicates that all-wheel antilock systems provide full steering control and lateral stability during braking. Real-wheel-only antilock systems do not ensure steering control during braking, but provide some measure of vehicle stability during braking. Should the proposed requirements be drafted so that light vehicles must be equipped with systems that provide ABS control on all wheels, or should the requirements be drafted to allow rear-wheel-only systems as well? What are the differences in benefits between rear-wheel-only and all-wheel systems? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

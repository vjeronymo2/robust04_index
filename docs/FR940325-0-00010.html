			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission does not agree that deleting the 7 year return frequency ``*&blank;*&blank;* runs the risk of returning the industry to pre-TMI levels of preparedness.'' The Commission is confident that this will not occur because the Commission has found that multi-sites states, when not fully participating in an exercise at a specific site will usually partially participate at a significant level of activity every 2 years at that specific site in order to support the participation of the appropriate local governments. The Commission has found that this level of exercise participation provides adequate emergency response training for State and local governments. The Commission believes that this rulemaking does not have an adverse impact on public health and safety because State emergency response personnel continuously respond to actual emergencies and experience has shown that states through a combination of full and partial participation exercises maintain an adequate level of response capability. A formal requirement for a State to return to a specific site every 7 years to participate in an exercise has proven to be unnecessary. Nonetheless, nothing prevents a State from returning to a specific site to participate in an exercise whenever it deems warranted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments suggested additional clarification to the emergency planning regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the Commission always appreciates suggestions on clarifying its regulations, the Commission at this time believes that all of the suggested changes would be inappropriate to include in this rulemaking proceeding because the suggested revisions are beyond the scope of this rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters noted that the proposed wording for the ingestions pathway exercise was not consistent with the FEMA requirement and could be interpreted differently than intended. They suggested the following requirement, ``A State should fully participate in the ingestion pathway portion of exercises at least once every six years. In States with more than one site, the State should rotate this participation from site to site.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission agrees with the suggested wording and has incorporated this comment in the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the current regulation has resulted in a relatively complicated description of the requirements for exercise participation by State and local governments who have offsite planning responsibility for more than one nuclear power plant. This final rule simplifies and clarifies this requirement. In addition, Appendix E is revised to reflect that the interval for an ingestion exposure pathway exercise be changed from at least once every 5 years to at least once every 6 years (FEMA's ingestion pathway exercise requirement is at least once every 6 years). The change in the interval would match the biennial frequency required for exercises of offsite plans. Further, Appendix E is also revised to eliminate the 7 year return frequency requirement because it has proven to be unnecessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule as well as being burdensome to states which are within the plume exposure pathway for multiple sites (FEMA does not have a return frequency requirement). Both changes assure compatibility with FEMA requirements and thus avoid confusion among licensees and State governments. Notwithstanding elimination of the 7 year return frequency requirement, the Commission believes that offsite authorities should rotate their full participation in exercises among sites if they are within the plume exposure pathway for more than one site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission codified the 7 year return frequency in the July 6, 1984  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (49 FR 27733), amendment to the emergency planning regulations. This amendment provides that at least once every 7 years, all States within the plume exposure pathway EPZ of a given site must fully participate in an offsite exercise for that site. In doing so, the Commission noted that ``the final rule is not totally consistent with FEMA's final regulation (44 CFR part 350). This inconsistency lies in the area of return frequency of multiple-site states as previously discussed. The FEMA position on return frequency is a significant departure from the NRC's proposed regulation of July 21, 1983 (48 FR 33307). The Commission believes that more study is needed before deletion of the return frequency requirement can be justified.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission now believes that sufficient experience has been gained in the observation and evaluation of emergency preparedness exercises at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nuclear power reactor sites to conclude that the 7 year return frequency should be deleted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

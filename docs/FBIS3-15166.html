			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by I. Nedyukha, candidate of technological </F> sciences: "Ukraine's Nuclear `Cheapness'"]    [Text] Here is information that was broadcast on 16  January on the "Ostankino" TV channel: "Ukraine will not  receive any other compensations except for reciprocal fuel  elements for atomic electric power plants." Proceeding from  this concise thesis, what advantages for Ukraine can one speak  about in general?    First, Ukraine will only receive $300 million out of the  $800  million allocated by the United States for the nuclear  disarmament of the CIS countries. This sum [$300 million] is  allocated for dismantling the world's third most powerful  nuclear arsenal that is much larger than those of, for example,  Belarus and Kazakhstan taken together.    Second, Ukraine will have to allocate several times that sum  from its own resources for the destruction of the missiles  themselves, their fuel filling, and especially launch silos. In  accordance with previous estimates, this will amount to at least  $3.2 billion. However, who will cover the resulting deficit of  about $3 billion for the service being rendered by Ukraine in  order to reinforce the national security of the United States  and Russia, something, which the leaders of those countries do  not deny. What about the advertised free market principles,  based upon a balance of demand and supply?    Third, if something really needs to be compensated for in  full, it is Ukraine's growing strategic vulnerability. In  accordance with the information issued by high-ranking  representatives of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense that was  broadcast on Ukrainian TV Channel One on 17 January, it may be  necessary to proceed to modern types of nonnuclear weapons,  something about which the Ukrainian president cautioned earlier.  This means that it will be necessary to take additional  enormous sums from the budget. However, due to the absence of  any prospects of resolving this problem without assistance from  the Russian military industrial complex, more specifically, by  crediting its functioning, this may only be done by lowering the  standard of living of the Ukrainian population.    Fourth, such crediting will, in fact, be done for Russia's  atomic industry. Russia has the possibility of selling the  Ukrainian part of uranium for hard currency and at world prices  and, at the same time, setting exclusive prices for those fuel  elements that will be supplied to Ukraine. Belarus has already  expressed its disagreement with Russia's thesis that the "lion's  share" of profits from the sales of uranium will go toward  covering the expenditure for destroying the missiles (IZVESTIYA,  19 January 1994.)    Moreover, at the news conference held by Colonel General Ye.  Maslin, main expert of Russia's Ministry of Defense, that was  broadcast by "Ostankino" on 18 January, a categorical demand was  made that all nuclear missile warheads be immediately  transferred to Russia as only then would reciprocal supplies of  fuel elements be made. As they say, the more you have, the more  you want.    On the whole, even from the point of view of the degree of  reliability of the highly advertised economic advantages that  Ukraine may get, all of this does not look as radiant and nice  as the numerous "advertisers" are trying to prove. At the same  time, the "Ostankino" TV channel asserts with confidence and  optimism that here, too, "Russia will in no way sacrifice its  own national interests." He asks: Can anyone say the same  thing about Ukraine?    This particularly applies to the problem of guaranteeing  Ukraine's national security, especially against the background  of the recent "optimistically probabilistic" statement by the  U.S. President who said there were "very good chances that  Russia will not become an expansionist state again and will not  threaten its neighbors." In simpler terms, this statement means  that the United States will certainly never get involved in  warfare with nuclear Russia, even if the latter does resume its  "old" practices.    What real guarantees for Ukraine can one talk about in  general, if the two formal presidential guarantees in respect of  the 14 January 1994 agreement will expire in three years time?    Regarding declarations about the beginning of a new  nonnuclear era, India has already dropped its "nuclear fly" into  the nonnuclear "ointment" of the American and Russian promises,  having declared that it was not going to proceed in the  "Ukrainian direction," also in view of all its accompanying  motivations. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that Ukraine  will remain the only standard-bearer of the movement toward a  radiant "nonnuclear" future. It is true, however, that we are  used to moving in "radiant" directions. In recent decades, we  have done nothing but that.</p>

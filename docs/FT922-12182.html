			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Observer: Holding on Ken Moses and Albert Wheeler, two British Coal old-timers, are just two nationalised industry types who must be heaving a sigh of relief at the election result. A few weeks before the election, both were offered the job of joint deputy chairmen of British Coal by John Wakeham, the outgoing energy secretary. However, with the election campaign in full swing and with Labour victory prospects rising, Wakeham decided to seek the endorsement of Labour's Frank Dobson, the shadow energy secretary. Dobson flatly refused because, he says, they were 'suitable only for a government that wants to run down and privatise the coal industry and close it down'. So the appointments were put on hold until after the election. Dobson's hostility to them was an echo of the 1984/85 miners' strike during which they played a robust role in getting miners to return to work. Both men have had a key hand in modernising the coal industry, but Dobson's savage response is a reminder that after 13 years of Tory rule it wasn't only politicians' jobs that were on the line if the voting had gone the other way.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OLVERA STREET PLAN OKD BY COUNCIL RIVALS  </P> <P> Away from the glare of the public arena, Los Angeles City Council members  Gloria Molina and Richard Alatorre have put aside personal differences and have  quietly settled on a unique concept -- a seven-member "authority" -- to govern  the deteriorating yet still-popular Olvera Street.  </P> <P> According to city staffers familiar with the talks between the two Eastside  politicians, the proposed El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic Monument Authority  has emerged as the best vehicle to jump-start the stalled $30-million  renovation of the Mexican tourist attraction, on the site where the city was  founded more than 200 years ago.  </P> <P> The idea, which has the tentative backing of Olvera Street merchants and a  group of Chicano historians and activists, is expected to be unveiled next week  with the blessing of Mayor Tom Bradley.  </P> <P> The agreement was forged out of pressure from a Latino leadership weary of the  political wrangling about Olvera Street. They felt that the street's  significance in the city's Mexican history should override personal animosities  between the two council members.  </P> <P> Still a sensitive issue, and one left unclear, is who would sit on the  authority's board of trustees, and how the agency would affect decisions  already made by the city, authorizing the creation of a Chinese museum and the  restoration of a community hall for Italian-Americans within the confines of  the El Pueblo park.  </P> <P> Numerous city officials, including spokesmen for Alatorre and Molina, declined  comment on these points.  </P> <P> "This is a carefully crafted thing and the deal could be blown if word would  get out about this person or that being considered, or if we start talking  about the specifics," one insider said.  </P> <P> Alatorre and Molina are reportedly trying to draft a list of nominees that the  mayor could select from, subject to council confirmation. Some Chicano  activists expressed concern that Alatorre's politically powerful allies could  be named to the board of trustees.  </P> <P> According to city officials, the authority is seen as having the best chance of  governing Olvera Street efficiently. The concept incorporates Molina's strong  desire for public scrutiny and Alatorre's desire to do away with an outside  developer to oversee the revitalization work.  </P> <P> At present, the only city-owned facility controlled by an authority board is  the Los Angeles Convention Center.  </P> <P> An authority's powers do not differ greatly from those of independent city  commissions. Alatorre and Molina agree that the city Parks and Recreation  Commission should no longer manage the street, an aging tourist attraction that  draws about 2 million visitors a year.  </P> <P> Alatorre, whose council district includes the area, favored the creation of a  private nonprofit corporation as the best entity to ensure the street's Mexican  authenticity.  </P> <P> Molina, who represented Olvera Street as a state assemblywoman, proposed a new  municipal commission to ensure public scrutiny of and participation in Olvera  Street's proposed revitalization.  </P> <P> In June, during the debate over the rival proposals, Molina accused Alatorre of  engineering a "back-room deal" to install his nonprofit corporation idea. And  he groused that Molina was grandstanding to curry favor with Latinos, who hold  Olvera Street in special regard as the Mexican link to the city's founding.  </P> <P> To end the bickering, the two began holding once-a-week talks that have  resulted in the agreement on a seven-member authority board.  </P> <P> "We're all interested in preserving Olvera Street, but public confidence was  lost (in the wrangling over the restoration mechanism)," said Al Avila,  Alatorre's chief deputy. "We're trying to restore public confidence."  </P> <P> Alma Martinez, Molina's chief of staff, agreed, adding: "There has been a  spirit of cooperation to get (the disagreements) behind us."  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW ROCKETS 31.79, CHEERED BY NEWS OF INFLATION SLOWDOWN  </P> <P> The stock market ran up another strong gain in heavy trading today, capping off  the best week so far in a rally that began more than two months ago.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 31.79 to 2,322.86, bringing its  gain for the week to 87.50 points.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 2 to 1 on the New York Stock  Exchange.  </P> <P> Big Board volume came to 254.87 million shares, against 212.25 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index gained 1.18 to 164.78.  </P> <P> Before the market opened, the Commerce Department estimated that the gross  national product grew at a annual rate of 2%, after adjustment for inflation,  in the fourth quarter of last year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fresh Evidence  </P> <P> The figure came in below most advance estimates on Wall Street and provided a  fresh bit of evidence for the case that the economy was slowing to a  sustainable, not-very-inflationary pace.  </P> <P> Bond traders welcomed the news by bidding up prices of long-term government  bonds about $5 for each $1,000 in face value.  </P> <P> That, in turn, provided fresh momentum for an advance in stock prices that has  already been gathering steam of late.  </P> <P> Brokers said a strong dollar in foreign exchange also helped stir up investors'  enthusiasm for stocks.  </P> <P> Bond prices headed higher in early trading today after the government's GNP  report/  </P> <P> The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 5/8 point, or $6.25 per $1,000 in  face amount, by midday. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell to  8.74% from 8.79% late Thursday.  </P> <P> Corporate bonds also made gains.  </P> <P> Still, analysts said the fourth-quarter data appeared to suggest that the  economy was slowing down a bit, thereby easing fears of higher inflation.  Bondholders worry that the Federal Reserve might push interest rates higher to  prevent the economy from overheating.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government  issues were up around 1/8 point, intermediate maturities rose about 5/16 point  and long-term issues gained 5/8 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial  information service.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Slowing Economy  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer,  increased 4.09 to 1,143.75.  </P> <P> In corporate trading, industrials rose slightly. Moody's investment grade  corporate bond index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with  maturities of five years or longer, increased 0.60 to 299.97.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.60% as the discount dropped 2  basis points to 8.32%. Yields on six-month bills were unchanged at 8.82% as the  discount held steady at 8.34%. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.94% as the  discount dropped 4 basis points at 8.29%.  </P> <P> A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the  annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the  percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at  maturity.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at midday at 9 3/16%, unchanged from late Thursday.  </P></p>

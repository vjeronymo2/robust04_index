			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Electric to pull out of mainframe computer production MITSUBISHI Electric, the Japanese electronics company, yesterday confirmed that it was planning to withdraw from mainframe computer production and concentrate on smaller machines amid a continuing downturn in the domestic computer industry. A further sign of the severe conditions facing Japanese electronics companies came with an announcement by Moody's Investors Service, the US rating agency, that it has placed the long and short-term ratings of NEC under review for possible downgrading. Meanwhile, the Japan Society of Industrial Machinery Manufacturers said yesterday industrial machinery orders fell 39.4 per cent in November, compared to a year earlier, while consumer electronics sales over the first 10 months of 1992 were down 17 per cent. Each of the announcements confirms the industry's fear that an expected recovery will not come until late this year. Moody's said the review of NEC follows 'concern that profitability, liquidity, and free cash flow may be impaired over a longer period than previously expected due to severe competition in its core businesses'. Over the next few weeks, Japanese electronics manufacturers and other leading industrial companies will review profit forecasts for the full-year to March, as many had counted on an early upturn in domestic demand. Mitsubishi reported a 73 per cent fall in first-half profits, NEC 71 per cent, and Matsushita Electric Industrial 51 per cent. However, demand is continuing to weaken. Production value of the mainframe computers was down 21 per cent over the first 10 months of last year, prompting Mitsubishi Electric to stop the development of new products, leaving Fujitsu, NEC, and Hitachi the remaining Japanese makers. 'It would cost us more than Y100bn to maintain our mainframe development. We didn't feel that we had gained sufficient market share to risk continuing in that market,' Mitsubishi said yesterday. The company is concentrating on computer systems between a workstation and personal computer in size, trying to keep a distance from the heavy discounting in the Japanese personal computer market. But Mitsubishi said 'our sector is difficult too'. Mitsubishi's decision to streamline its product mix is typical of other consumer and computer electronics makers. Video camera sales fell 30 per cent in the first 10 months last year, financial terminals 18 per cent, integrated circuit testers 38 per cent and telecommunications equipment 7.5 per cent.</p>

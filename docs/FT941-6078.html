			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Expensive treat for a poor relation: Major's trip to the US eased tensions, but shifts in the relationship are apparent Forget the cosy dinner in a Pittsburgh restaurant, the night spent in the Lincoln suite at the White House and the ride on Air Force One. Mr Bill Clinton played the gracious host in Washington this week. Mr John Major was an appreciative guest. But a series of photo-opportunities does not add up to a special relationship. That is not to say that the trip was a failure. Mr Major returned to London yesterday confident that it had taken much of the recent chill out of Anglo-American relations. The trip to Pittsburgh - home for a time of Mr Major's father and grandfather - was a corny but friendly gesture. So, too, was the invitation to the prime minister to return to Washington on the presidential jet before becoming the first British leader since Winston Churchill to spend a night at the White House. The US president was magnanimous also in his public comments. The phrase 'special relationship' never passed his lips. But at every opportunity he stressed that disputes over Bosnia and Northern Ireland had not undermined the solidity of ties with London. The relaxed format of the visit eased some of the personal tension between the two. If Mr Clinton is still irritated by the overt Conservative support for former president George Bush in the elections, he does not show it. That unfortunate episode is, in the words of one US official, 'dead and buried'. The whole event, though, looked staged. Good friends do not have to go to elaborate lengths to prove it. The prime minister's aides - continually emphasising the special treatment he was receiving - fell into the trap of mistaking form for substance. For the UK journalists shadowing the two leaders, this was often embarrassing. Mr Clinton appeared as the wealthy relative indulging a less fortunate cousin with an expensive treat. Britain may still be a special relation. It is also a poor one. The US media treated Mr Major's appearance with casual indifference. They did not, though, miss the happy coincidence that the Pittsburgh photocalls allowed the president to do some useful campaigning for Democrat candidates in the mid-term congressional elections. The most graphic image of the trip was that of Mr Clinton's brand new Boeing 747 towering on the tarmac over Mr Major's tiny, antiquated VC10. British prime ministers do not necessarily prove they have a strong voice in Washington by travelling on Air Force One. The substantive policy discussions the two leaders slotted in around the interminable photographs provided the British side with greater cause for satisfaction. The real poison in Anglo-American relations over the past year has been the two governments' differences over Bosnia rather than the awkward juxtaposition of a Democrat at the White House and a Conservative in Downing Street. Britain's consistent opposition to stronger western military intervention in the conflict and to increased support for the Bosnian Moslems has infuriated the US. The combination of last month's successful Nato ultimatum in ending the Serbian siege of Sarajevo and this week's visit has provided a partial antidote. Mr Major has accepted a more muscular stance by the United Nations forces on the ground to extend the success in Sarajevo to other beleaguered cities. Mr Clinton, with some success already, has raised the profile of the US in brokering a political deal between the warring Croats and Moslems, hoping the Serbs will fall into line. If this strategy fails, differences could well re-emerge. The president made it clear that in advance of an overall settlement he remains opposed to committing US ground troops to Bosnia. The UK prime minister did not press the opposite case only because he knew in advance that the answer would be no. But for the time being Mr Major was confident enough to declare: 'I think there is no doubt that we see the problems of Bosnia very much in the same light. Our policy is heading exactly in the same direction.' The trip also allowed a line to be drawn under last month's row over Northern Ireland. Mr Clinton did not apologise for allowing Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein and an apologist for the IRA's campaign of violence, to visit the US. But he did go out of his way to emphasise US support for last December's Anglo-Irish initiative as the only basis for a political solution to the violence in the province. In their private discussions Mr Clinton made it clear he would not allow Mr Adams another propaganda coup unless and until the Sinn Fein leader had renounced violence. The president and prime minister were also on common ground over Russia. Both have visited Moscow in the past two months. Both are now wary of investing too much of their own political capital in the personal success of Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president. But they agree that the west must continue to support the reform process and to buttress Mr Yeltsin's credibility by encouraging greater Russian involvement in Nato and the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. Standing on the White House lawn, Mr Clinton promised 'tangible' evidence of a much stronger partnership by the middle of this year. Mr Major nodded assent. Both men ticked off a range of other areas where the views of Washington and London coincide. They will press jointly for faster implementation of last year's Uruguay Round world trade accord. They sent a joint message to Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the leader of South Africa's Inkatha movement, successfully urging his participation in the country's first free elections. Mr Clinton offered important public support for Britain's plans to introduce greater democracy in Hong Kong before the colony's transfer to China in 1997. The list allowed the president to reaffirm 'the importance of our enduring partnership'. And to add: 'We must continue to build on it - economically, politically, strategically.' Mr Major stressed their shared instincts and interests on virtually every significant foreign policy issue confronting the west. This analysis could not be faulted as far as it went. But it was a superficial assessment. Neither the glitz nor the substance of this week's public reconciliation addressed a much more fundamental shift. Mr Clinton felt no need to. Mr Major could not afford to. The awkward truth is that the ending of the cold war, the move towards a more integrated Europe, and Washington's preoccupation with the economic power of Japan and south-east Asia have changed the framework of the relationship. Britain has long been a junior partner - despite the illusion of equality generated briefly by Lady Thatcher's close friendship during the 1980s with Presidents Reagan and Bush. The decisive shift in the 1990s has come from the ending of the strategic threat to western security from the former Soviet bloc. The US no longer needs Britain as its first line of defence against a potential attack from a powerful communist aggressor. It is running down the US air bases in the UK which provided the most powerful symbol  - and the real substance - of the special relationship. It is looking to the Pacific for its economic future and, increasingly, to Germany and France as much as to Britain to provide for the security of Europe. Mr Major can claim to remain a solid ally but there is no longer anything special about that.</p>

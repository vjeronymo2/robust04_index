			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Deadline looms on spending bills THE US Congress is likely to have to resort to its habitual stop-gap measures to keep the government running, after again failing to meet the September 30 deadline for passing new spending bills. Without new legislation, federal departments will run out of money when the US fiscal year ends at midnight on Thursday. Only one of the 13 spending bills, providing for Congress' own funding, has been passed, and congressional leaders expect they will have to resort to a 'continuing resolution' providing for spending allocations from 1993 to be rolled forward for two weeks. Continuing resolutions are a recurrent tool of Congress, but they always create a degree of nervousness because they must pass if the government is not to grind to a halt, and members sometimes try to exploit them by attaching other measures. Some spending bills have already passed both chambers of Congress and bills covering the agriculture and treasury departments, and perhaps also foreign aid, could pass before Thursday night's deadline. Delays are expected for the Dollars 240bn (Pounds 156bn) defence appropriations bill, the only one which has not yet passed the House. It has been held up as members were reluctant to vote for big military spending programmes before the Pentagon's own 'bottom up review'. The transport department's Dollars 13bn spending bill also faces delays and the interior department bill could be held hostage in the battle by western senators to block administration efforts to reform the running of federal lands and raise fees charged to ranchers who rent grazing from the government.</p>

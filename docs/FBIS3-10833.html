AD  Secretary of Organization Lewis Perez Daboin also was present at  the meeting.    Although it was said that the meeting was a social event to  welcome Munoz Ledo, who recently returned from vacation in the  United States, AD sources did not rule out the possibility that  this meeting could be part of an AD internal stratagem to  reorganize the party and recover some ground lost by the  political organization. [passage omitted on background material]    In addition, reports that Munoz Ledo will seek support from  the Pentagon for presumed coupist plans in Venezuela still  circulate. Of course, AD leaders, including Alfaro Ucero, have  denied those reports. Alfaro Ucero expressed his full support  for Munoz Ledo, describing him as a democrat.</p>

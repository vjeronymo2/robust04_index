			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A Delta Air Lines spokesman said that the carrier found emergency sprinkler  system wiring errors in two of its Boeing 757s, corrected the problems and  advised the Federal Aviation Administration. Similar problems in sprinkler  systems in the planes were reported earlier in another Delta-operated 757, one  belonging to Royal Brunei Airlines, two owned by Air Holland, and one operated  by the British airline Air 2000. Delta spokesman Jim Lundy said in Atlanta that  the problems would have prevented sprinklers from working properly in the event  of a fire in a baggage hold. Lundy said it was a similar crossed-wiring problem  found on a Delta plane before delivery from the Boeing factory that prompted  the FAA last week to order inspections.  </P></p>

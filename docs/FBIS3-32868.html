This means that our country will support the UN position  whether it is decided they will use planes to defend the Bosnian  areas under attack or conduct military operations against the  attackers.    The Argentine Foreign Ministry reported that Emilio  Cardenas,  Argentine ambassador to the United Nations, said so to UN  Secretary General Butrus-Butrus Ghali during a long meeting they  held on 8 February.    Following clear instructions given by Foreign Minister Guido  Di Tella, who is visiting three Caribbean countries, Cardenas  told Butrus-Butrus Ghali that President Menem's administration  will support the UN decision on air operations.    It has not been reported, however, whether Argentina merely  supports the operations or also will participate in them.    Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella explained to LA  NACION in New York: "It must be made very clear that Argentina  does not approve measures of force; all it did was offer full  support to whatever the secretary general may decide."    Cardenas told Butrus-Butrus Ghali that Argentina strongly  rejects attacks against Sarajevo's civilians. He insisted on  "the need to consider the possibility of using security troops"  from the United Nations who currently are controlling the region  and include Argentine units.</p>

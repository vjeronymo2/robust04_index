			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Listen to Peter Juhasz's report from Miskolc on  Gyula Horn.    [Begin Juhasz recording] Dr. Zoltan Katona, head physician  at  the Miskolc County Hospital, informed our editorial shortly  before midnight about the condition of Gyula Horn, who suffered  a car accident tonight. According to the report, the HSP  [Hungarian Socialist Party] chairman has suffered a fracture of  the cervical vertebra. Luckily the vertebra did not become  dislodged and no nerves have been damaged.    Apart from this, one of his wrists was broken and he has  facial injuries.    Gyula Horn lost consciousness at the moment of the crash but  he has now come round and is well considering the circumstances.  [passage omitted]    The examination into the cause of the accident is  continuing.</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (13): Investors go elsewhere  -Stock Exchange TURKS HAVE been living with high inflation for so long that they tend to take it for granted. Yet nowhere does the damage to the economy show more clearly than in the country's stock exchange at Istanbul. The market was set up in its present form in 1986 and, despite Turkish misgivings about unfettered capitalism, the bourse has established itself as a permanent feature of the country's business scene. Small investors quickly took to the idea that there are times when company stock can offer a better return than more familiar investments in gold, foreign currency, or one-year bank deposits. The number of companies whose shares are traded and the number of shares traded has also been rising rapidly. The average number of shares traded each day rose from 6,224 in 1990 to 18,345 in 1991. Despite the striking increase in volumes, the market's best days came as long ago as the summer of 1989 when it was one of the best-performing markets anywhere. The last notable rally was in February last year. For most of the first quarter of this year, the index has lingered around the 4,000 mark. In April, Turkey was stuck at the bottom of the emerging markets performance chart. Yet the country has obvious investor potential. Why the lacklustre performance? For much of the winter, political uncertainty was widely given as part of the reason for the market's sluggishness. But Mr Demirel and his team have turned out not to be foes of the exchange. Quite the opposite: the coalition government plans to raise more funds than its predecessor did through privatisation operations. The main reason for the market's dull performance is that local investors - most of them small short-term investors - have been putting their money into other investments, ranging from treasury bonds to foreign currency deposits, which offer a better return under present circumstances. Considering that Turkey had something of a recession last year in which manufacturing industry grew by only 2.6 per cent (a dire figure by the standards of the last two decades), things might be worse. There have been few share price collapses, but cement companies, the market star performers in 1991, have done less well recently, and food and beverage stocks have tended to lead the market. All this is fairly discouraging to foreign investors, at least for the time being. 'They are going to be loath to invest in Turkey until they see some sign of a sustainable decrease in the country's inflation rate,' says Mr Peter Bennett, portfolio manager of Morgan Stanley's Turkish Investment Fund which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. He believes that sooner or later, Turkey will have to follow most of the Latin American countries and take steps to bring down inflation and that until then the market will not be able to tap its full potential. That would mean a government decision to bring inflation well below 20 per cent: something which does not seem to be in prospect at the moment, even though some economists forecast a slight dip in Turkish inflation by the year end. Meanwhile the government has pushed through legislation which should help the market grow. Companies will be able to raise funds by issuing futures and asset-backed securities provided they have an approved rating. The Capital Markets Board will be given new powers to curb irregularities by brokerage houses, including the issue of forged share certificates. Abuses such as insider dealing will become punishable for the first time and independent auditors will be made responsible for any deficiencies in company accounts.</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nothing gifted about SDRs Sir, Peter Norman (Economics Notebook, July 25 ) stated that '. . . a general SDR increase would benefit wealthy industrialised countries more than the disadvantaged'. If this were true, the wealthy countries would surely have been more positively inclined towards issues of special drawing rights. In reality, it is false, notwithstanding the fact that allocations in proportion to quota allocate more SDRs to the wealthier nations. The mistake lies in a misunderstanding of what SDRs are. A newly allocated SDR is not a gift of money, rather it is the gift of a right to borrow money. The rate charged on such borrowings is a weighted average of money market rates in the five currencies that compose the SDR. The largest OECD governments can already borrow on the finest terms, so giving them extra rights to do so gives them nothing. Poorer countries cannot borrow on the finest terms, so it is the margin between what they would be charged and the SDR interest rate (times their SDR allocation) which is the size of their gain. In effect, the extra risk is spread throughout the international community, though there may be a net welfare gain from risk pooling. The error has been committed, since the invention of SDRs, to include SDR allocations in official reserves. We do not count unused credit lines in the money stock. Reserves should include only holdings of the SDR in excess of allocation. In short, the issue of SDR allocations should be seen as the allocation of a borrowing line at prime rates, rather than as a gift of new money.

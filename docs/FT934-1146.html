			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / People: McKillop takes over from Friend at Zeneca Changes are afoot in one of Zeneca's three divisions. While Alan Pink, chief executive agrochemicals and seeds, and Rodney Brown, chief executive specialities, are still with ICI's former bioscience operations, David Friend, chief executive Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, is taking early retirement. Friend, 59, is being replaced by David McKillop, Zeneca's Scottish deputy chief executive and international research and development director. McKillop (left), only 50, has a formidable academic record, gaining the top first in his year at Glasgow, a PhD, and a period at Centre de Mechanique Ondulatoire which is associated with the Sorbonne. He is well respected within the industry. The Scot emerged from the depths of ICI into the media spotlight after Hanson, the Anglo-American group, took a stake in the company. Media attention was heightened by ICI's split, which left the pharmaceuticals division as the group's most important earner. Initially media-shy, he has been a quick learner and has proved increasingly adept at communicating his enthusiasm for the group's development pipeline. McKillop will be running one of the UK's fourth largest pharmaceuticals groups and the world's 22nd largest, with annual sales last year of nearly Pounds 3bn. That will leave little time for him to improve his golf handicap - he plays off 14; reads books on maths, logic and philosophy, his preferred material, though at present he is reading a brief history of England because he says he knows too little about the country; or watch rugger - he used to be a handy player until a back injury stopped his career.</p>

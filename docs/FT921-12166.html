			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Arts: Today's Television Coming rather late to the Falklands War Replay Stakes, ITV begins a documentary series, In Time Of War (7.30), which, surprise surprise, begins with Governor Rex Hunt warning the islanders that they are about to be invaded. The standard of chairman on Assignment's occasional discussion programmes is being maintained: the excellent John Tusa is going (it was surprising that the managing director of the World Service ever did find the time) but is being replaced by the estimable Sheena McDonald. In her first programme (7.45 BBC2) the subject is the United Nations. At 8.00, Channel 4 shows the first of a six-part series, Class Action, on what we are are assured is a crisis in British education (when was there no 'crisis'?). In Without Walls (9.00 C4) novelist Saul Bellow has the first of five conversations 'exploring people's growing sense of unease as the world moves towards the year 2000'. Since the calendar is an artificial man-made concept it will be interesting to see what the fuss is about. BBC1's Inside Story Special (10.25) promises 'a dramatic new perspective' on Londonderry's 'Bloody Sunday' which occurred 20 years ago.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, Jan. 31, IRNA -- An Iranian English daily,  TEHRAN TIMES, today commented on the Friday attack of Turkish  fighters on Kurdish bases inside Iraq and suggested that a  permanent solution could be found through sincere and combined  political efforts of Iran, Turkey, Iraq and Syria. During the  attack, the fighters also fired on Iranian border villages,  killing and injuring 28 Iranian nationals.    The daily cautioned in its editorial that the Kurdish  problem  was becoming increasingly dangerous for the entire region.    "In recent decades the `Kurdish' card has been used by the  region's countries as a weapon to intimidate each other," it  said. This policy would have worked for a short while, the daily  added, "but the recent involvement of Western powers in this  affair will inevitably endanger the territorial sovereignty of  all the countries involved."    The daily recommended regional countries to set aside their  differences and work out a practical peaceful solution to this  common problem "whose main victims are the Muslim Kurdish  civilians."    "When the Turkish Government issues diplomatic passports for  Iraqi Kurdish leaders and supports them in their efforts to  disintegrate Iraq, then it should not be upset when other  countries help the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]," the daily  said. It stressed that Turkey could not solve its Kurdish  problem by "sending 50, or even 500 fighter bombers to massacre  the Kurds."    The editorial concluded by calling for an end to the "game  of  politico-military one-upmanship, played by the regional powers  using the Kurdish card."</p>

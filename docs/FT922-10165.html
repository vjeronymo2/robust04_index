			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DEALERS reported a calm session in stock index futures which nevertheless breached the 2,700 level for the second time this week, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE started the session at 2,685, a 24-point premium to the underlying cash market but quickly declined due to lack of interest to 2,675 by 9.20am. Then, a sharp turnaround was recorded and June advanced, boosted by a slight squeeze and talk of a cut in UK base rates, sending the contract to 2707 by midday. Real business remained slow with a mere 2,000 contracts traded by 11am. June ran into sellers in the afternoon and drifted lower to closie at 2,697, around 19 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18. Turnover was a poor 4,922 by the close. The traded options market also had a quiet session with turnover reaching only 26,093 lots. The FT-SE option traded just 3,623 lots while the Euro-FTSE recorded a mere 476 contracts in total. Asda was the top traded stock option recording a total of 4,130 lots, with the January 35 calls the busiest series. It was followed by BP at 3,424 and then by Allied Lyons in which 1,550 trades were dealt.</p>

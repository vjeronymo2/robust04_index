			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Solana takes heart from British 'An unholy alliance' is how Spanish ministers term their uneasy partnership with the UK in the Euro-voting rights crisis obstructing the entry of Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway into the Union. The 10 member states opposing Anglo-Spanish attempts to change the EU's majority voting formula are working hard to prise them apart - and leave the UK isolated. It will not be easy. Mr Javier Solana, the Spanish foreign minister, is playing both for his country and his own political future in the fraught argument. And he may have found an ideal vehicle in his partnership with Britain. At 51, he is one of only two cabinet ministers to have survived from the first Gonzalez government 11 years ago and last weekend regained a seat on the Socialist party's executive committee. With his eye on positioning himself as an eventual successor to Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, he has taken the lead in the enlargement talks from the veteran EU negotiator, the technocrat Mr Carlos Westendorp, state secretary for European affairs and taken the British to heart. 'Any solution (to the voting row) has to satisfy our two countries,' he said yesterday. 'It is very difficult to imagine a solution which would satisfy one country and not the other.' The mood is catching. An aide to Mr Gonzalez said Spain did not relish the idea of being out on a limb and arguing on grounds of vital national interests. 'It is better to flex our muscles as part of a combined veto rather than test whether we have a power of veto ourselves,' he said. There is also political pressure at home to stiffen Mr Solana's resolve. Although the Socialist government does not have to cope with a domestic anti-European lobby as does the UK government, the conservative Popular Party opposition has long accused it of being naive and weak in its dealings with the Union. Criticism from northern Spanish fishermen over the deal struck last week with Norway on fishing rights has increased pressure on Mr Solana to stand his ground over voting arrangements. Madrid has always seen this as the most important issue and it has remained united on it despite cool personal relations between Mr Solana and Mr Westendorp. Madrid is resisting changes to the voting formula because it does not want to be in a losing minority over questions such as Mediterranean products or structural funds. In addition, it has a deep-seated ambivalence about EU enlargement, part of the 'European project' to which Spain is ideologically committed but potentially detrimental to its own interests. It fears it could be marginalised as the EU's centre of gravity shifts northwards and eastwards. Nevertheless, the 10 are addressing compromise solutions more at Spain because they think Madrid is more likly to cave in than London. Madrid is seen as defending identifiable and circumscribed nat-ional interests such as Mediterranean agriculture, whereas the British government is seen as parading factional interests of the Conservative party.

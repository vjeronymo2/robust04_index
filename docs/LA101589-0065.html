			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONDO Q&amp;A: BOARD SPENT HALF OF RESERVE ON RENOVATION  </P> <P>  QUESTION: In the last six months, our board of directors has spent 50% of our  reserves in addition to about $50,000 that was in the checking account. The  board approved a major renovation of the lobby and hallways and paid for it  over several months to avoid having to get approval of the homeowners to spend  the money. The redecorating has changed our "Olde English Inn" decor to  cheap-looking contemporary. What recourse do I have?  </P> <P> ANSWER: The board has the right to use reserve funds for the repair,  replacement or improvement of the property. Your reserve study should disclose  when major expenditures are anticipated. When a large portion of the reserves  are being depleted, the board should have a plan for replenishing those reserve  funds.  </P> <P> Prior to the work being done, the board had an obligation to show that the  association could afford to do the remodeling without jeopardizing the overall  financial stability. If there are no other major repairs, such as roofing, that  will be needed in the near future, then the board may have acted properly.  </P> <P> I sense that you are more upset with the choice of decor than with the large  expenditures. I have never heard of a major improvement that 100% of the owners  supported. As an individual homeowner you have the right to be heard, but if  the majority of the owners like the improvements, what can you do? Now that the  work is completed, it seems unreasonable to expect that the association would  spend even more funds to change it.  </P> <P> When you purchase in an association, you are automatically giving a tremendous  amount of control to your board of directors. Most owners are glad to sit back  and let the board make these major decisions for them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> President Says He's Not Read the CC&amp;Rs  </P> <P> Q: I recently attended my association's board meeting and questioned a  decision. When I quoted certain parts of the CC&amp;Rs, the president's  response was: "I've never read them, so I take other people's word for what the  documents say." Doesn't the president have an obligation to read these  governing documents?  </P> <P> A: Of course, every owner should read the CC&amp;Rs and all of the governing  documents. Certainly, the board has an obligation to read and understand them.  If they cannot understand them, then they should consult an attorney. I assume  that the president thought the response was a clever one. I feel that if board  members haven't read the CC&amp;Rs, then they should not be serving on the  board.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attorney on Board Makes CC&amp;R Changes  </P> <P> Q: We currently have an attorney on our association board who is revising our  CC&amp;Rs. When I asked why this was being done, he stated that he is updating  them according to the recent changes in the state law.  </P> <P> I believe that our documents (written in 1973) may need updating, but I would  also like to know what the changes are and verify that they are legal and  proper. The attorney who is making the changes says the owners will not be  voting on this matter since the law mandates that these changes can be made  without a vote of the membership. What advice can you give us?  </P> <P> A: It appears that your attorney/board member does not specialize in common  interest development law, or perhaps you misunderstood his answer.  </P> <P> Some of the new legislation supersedes the association documents, in which  case, changing your documents would not be necessary.  </P> <P> On the other hand, certain phrases such as "unless the association's  declaration otherwise provides" appear in several sections of the law. This  means that the law does not supersede the association's documents.  </P> <P> Changes in the wording of your association's CC&amp;Rs must always be submitted  to the owners for a vote. The procedure for amending is explained in your  CC&amp;Rs.  </P> <P> If the amendment procedure is not explained, then you must refer to California  Civil Code, Section 1355(b), where it is spelled out in detail. If the proper  procedure is not followed, the amendment is not valid and would not be accepted  for recording by the county.  </P> <P> If your board wants to have the CC&amp;Rs revised, I recommend that you engage  another attorney who specializes in common interest development law to provide  further legal advice after your attorney/board member makes his recommendations  on changes in the wording.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trees Are Obstructing Owner's Ocean View  </P> <P> Q: Four months ago, I bought a condominium with a beautiful view of the beach.  Some trees are growing and obstructing my view. I have sent three letters to  the board president but nothing has been done. What can I do?  </P> <P> A: You do not state whether the trees are on a neighbor's property or on  association property. If it is a neighbor's property, perhaps the board has no  power to act or perhaps they have requested that the trees be trimmed and the  neighbor has not taken any action.  </P> <P> Let's assume that the trees are on association property. Depending upon the  size of the trees and the expense involved, the association may only trim the  trees annually. Also, the species of the tree may determine the best time of  year to trim for the good of the trees. In other words, there may be a valid  reason for the board's delay, but they do owe you a timely response.  </P> <P> I suggest that you attend the next board meeting to inquire whether the board  intends to take any action on your request, or write to the board again and  request a written response by a specific date. Since the trees are not on your  own property, you should not resort to trimming the trees yourself.  </P> <P> Bear in mind that unless your view is clearly protected in the CC&amp;Rs, with  specifications as to the acceptable height of the trees, the association may  not have a legal obligation to trim them. There may be other owners who value  these trees and do not want them trimmed. In that case the board will have to  try to work out a compromise.  </P></p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Top Fords most likely to be stolen HIGH-PERFORMANCE Ford cars are up to ten times as likely to be stolen as Nissans or Volvos, according to a 'car theft index' published by the Home Office yesterday at the start of National Crime Prevention Week, John Griffiths writes. Home Office officials are to meet vehicle manufacturers later this week to discuss ways of improving security. They said that high susceptibility to theft reflected a car's attractiveness and popularity as well as the ease with which it could be stolen. Statistics showed that 494,000 cars were recorded stolen last year. The thefts accounted for 11 per cent of all recorded crime, Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, said. He added that three quarters of people questioned in a survey would have been willing to pay more for built-in security features on cars.</p>

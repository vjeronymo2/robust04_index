			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / People: Keeping R-R's show on the road In the mid-1980s, to visit Rolls-Royce's car plant at Crewe, Cheshire, was to step back into a bygone, labour-intensive manufacturing age. Today the Vickers subsidiary is almost unrecognisable, with the old labour demarcation lines gone and heavy investment made to integrate manufacturing and engineering. At 39, Charles Matthews has the job of keeping this entire modernised manufacturing show on the road through his newly created post as director of manufacturing operations. Matthews, formerly Rolls' director of personnel and systems, assumes responsibility for manufacturing, engineering, purchasing, personnel and quality. A close familiarity with them all is seen as essential for an integrated manufacturing operation targeted at slashing the luxury car maker's break-even production to 1,400 cars a year. Last year, as recession bit deeper in its major markets, Rolls' sales fell by a further 20 per cent to only 1,348 compared with about 3,000 in the 1980s. Matthews' ride with Rolls has been an exciting one, his arrival coinciding closely with the collapse of luxury car markets worldwide and making an abrupt change from his three-year tenure at food group Nabisco, where he was factory general manager. However, Matthews is no stranger to the ups and downs of the car industry. The Nabisco sojourn was in fact his only foray outside car making in a career which began with the then-British Leyland back in 1975.</p>

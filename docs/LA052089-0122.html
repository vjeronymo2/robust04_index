			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A BERRY MERRY OXNARD FESTIVAL  </P> <P> It's "Strawberry Fields Forever" -- or at least for two days -- in Oxnard this  weekend when the sixth annual California Strawberry Festival unfolds today and  Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Oxnard, which produces 22% of the state's strawberry output on 4,000 acres, is  sanguine over its berries and eager, as always, to share lore and orders with  the outside world.  </P> <P> Activities and crafts, many of them berry-oriented, are planned: Among them are  strawberry-shortcake-eating contests, berry-stemming competitions and a search  for the festival's favorite strawberry blond (open to men and woman; tinted  locks and wigs acceptable).  </P> <P> A waiters' race (including dropping a strawberry into a glass of champagne),  family 2K and 10K runs and a petting zoo will occupy the active, while musical  entertainment, from pop and jazz to country and salsa, will be virtually  continuous. More than 150 booths will demonstrate and sell jewelry, toys,  sculptures, leather goods, prints and strawberries.  </P> <P> The festival is easily accessible via U.S. 101 (Ventura Freeway). Signs will  direct visitors to free parking areas, where a free shuttle joins the fete.  Admission is $3 for adults and $1 for seniors and children 5 to 12; under 5  free. For information, call (805) 984-4767.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Gianfranco Fini [leader of the National Alliance]  said: "I am happy that [Israeli Foreign Minister] Shim'on Peres  has said that there is no hostility on the part of the Israeli  Government toward the Italian Government, and I am convinced  that the concerns of [European Commission President Jacques]  Delors will diminish in a short time when everyone has  understood the values that are guiding both the government and  the National Alliance."    These are the values of "liberty, democracy, social justice,  and tolerance," Fini explained, "in which all Italians believe."  Fascism "ended in 1945 and cannot return," and "the National  Alliance is neither a fascist or neofascist force."</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Signal workers urge union to open talks: Breakthrough vote could herald end of dispute Striking signal workers voted yesterday to urge the RMT union executive to open talks with Railtrack in a breakthrough that could herald the end of the three-month dispute. The vote came at the annual conference of about 100 RMT signal workers' delegates in Great Yarmouth, which resisted calls to step up the action. A union official denied that the move was a climbdown, but until now the RMT leadership has insisted on an interim pay rise for the signal workers as a reward for past productivity gains before talks on restructuring could begin. The conference, which does not set policy, said it wanted parallel negotiations on both past productivity and future restructuring. It also recommended that any negotiated package be put to all signal workers in a secret ballot. The call for fresh talks will be discussed by the union's executive committee today and could lead to a meeting with the employers before the next one-day strike, due on Friday. Railtrack, the state-owned company that runs the track network, said it hoped the RMT executive would respond positively. 'We are prepared to talk about anything on the table if this signals a change in attitude.' Last night Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, said the conference decision was 'a serious and positive move to bring Railtrack back to real negotiations'. The union's chief negotiator, Mr Vernon Hince, added: 'This is a genuine attempt to get talks off the ground.' Pressure has been mounting on the union's 21-strong executive committee to reopen talks with Railtrack. Yesterday's unanimous vote on a resolution was drawn up at the weekend after the signal workers' leaders had tested the mood of the delegates. It rapidly became apparent that there was widespread desire among union branches for a quick return to talks and a settlement of the dispute that has already cost each signal worker more than Pounds 700 in lost pay. The RMT stressed last night that the signal workers' move was only 'a first step' on the road to a settlement of Britain's longest industrial conflict since the miners' strike 10 years ago. When the talks resume they are likely to be protracted. Initially Railtrack had hoped to spend about three months negotiating the restructuring package designed to transform working practices among the signalling grades. It is now hoped a deal can be reached by September 30 - the deadline for agreement if the signal workers are not to lose substantial benefits when the industry's pension fund is redistributed as part of the privatisation process. The signal workers' conference did not call for an end to the industrial conflict, warning that further stoppages might be necessary if negotiations failed. The delegates rejected arbitration as a way out of the dispute. They also stuck to their original 11 per cent pay claim for past productivity - the demand that led to the outbreak of the dispute. More than half the rail network is now open for services on strike days because of the use of managers and supervisors in signal boxes.</p>

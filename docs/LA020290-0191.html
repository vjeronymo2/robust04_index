			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS DROPS TO 4-YEAR LOW  </P> <P> Japan cut its massive trade surplus with the rest of the world by 28.4% last  year, the government reported today, but economists say the surplus will climb  again in the year ahead.  </P> <P> Record spending by Japanese abroad, higher oil imports and a strong dollar  helped cut the trade surplus in 1989 to its lowest level in four years.  </P> <P> Japan's current account, the broadest measure of trade in goods and services,  narrowed to $56.98 billion in 1989 from $79.63 billion in 1988.  </P> <P> Japan's invisible trade deficit, which includes the money Japanese spend as  tourists overseas, ballooned to $15.93 billion in 1989 from $11.26 billion in  1988.  </P> <P> With 9.6 million Japanese traveling abroad last year, Japan's travel deficit  amounted to a record $19.33 billion in 1989 and accounted for a large part of  the reduction in the current-account surplus, analysts said.  </P> <P> "Tourism was very, very important. Travel abroad has increased by 20% in each  of the last three years," said Matthew Berlow, an economist at Credit Lyonnais  Alexanders Laing and Cruickshank Securities.  </P> <P> A stronger dollar in 1989 was a major cause of the sharp decline in the trade  surplus, said Hidehiro Iwaki, an economist at the Nomura Research Institute.  </P> <P> A high U.S. currency depresses the value of Japanese exports denominated in  dollars and accounted for roughly 30% of the $18 billion reduction in the 1989  trade surplus.  </P> <P> Exports totaled $269.63 billion in 1989 against $259.77 billion the previous  year.  </P> <P> Slower U.S. economic growth and capacity limitations among some Japanese  manufacturers, mainly auto makers, triggered by robust Japanese domestic  demand, also curtailed exports.  </P> <P> "Some goods for export might have been shifted to the domestic market," said  Chiharu Sumita, an economist at UBS Phillips and Drew International.  </P> <P> "Capacity constraints put a drag on Japanese exports although they've started  to expand production capacity lately," Iwaki said.  </P> <P> Japan imported more oil at higher prices in 1989 and that gave imports a boost,  economists added. Imports last year totaled $192.50 billion against $164.75  billion in 1988.  </P> <P> Analysts cautioned, however, that progress in narrowing the trade surplus  further could stall out this year.  </P> <P> "We think the surplus for the full year will be somewhat larger in 1990 than it  was in 1989," Berlow said. He foresees a current-account surplus of $63.9  billion this year.  </P></p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (3): Of strong drink and kippers - Finance A DOMESTIC HISTORY OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND 1930-1960 by Elizabeth Hennessy Cambridge Pounds 60, 449 pages EDDIE GEORGE, the incoming anti-inflationary governor of the Bank of England, would be horrified to read a particular chapter of this absorbing book. It tells how the bank 36 years ago unwittingly added to pressures for rising prices by issuing a new highly-popular Pounds 5 note which overcame 'the traditional prejudice against the use of high sum notes.' The incident is one of many anecdotes sketched out by Ms Hennessy in her book, partly a story of an institution, partly social history and partly a record of the UK's decline as a world power after the second world war. The volume is distinctive for its appendix of the leading bank officials in the 30-year period it covers. Look out in particular for Humphrey Charles Baskerville Mynors, the bank's first economist, who took over in 1933, and for Lucius Perronet Thompson-McCausland, an adviser to the governor after the war. You can read about how bank employees used to stuff kippers down the spines of their huge ledgers during the 1930s and how many of them suffered drinking problems because the work was so boring. There are hints of tensions between bank and Treasury that are still evident today, as in 1947 when the two institutions fell out over methods for control of foreign currency markets. Readers can find out about an ailment called Whitchurch Throat - which employees evacuated to Whitchurch in Hampshire suffered from during the war on account of the dry chalky soil - and how one of the bank's first statistical treatises tried to entertain its readers by calculating the likelihood of someone being run over by a car on a wet night in London. The section on the bank's overseas department is especially worthwhile in illustrating the disdain with which the bank viewed virtually all foreigners.</p>

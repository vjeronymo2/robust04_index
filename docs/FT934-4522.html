			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Management: Coping with a high fertility index Maternity leave is one of the hottest issues at RCI Europe, a US-owned company struggling to cope with its own baby boom. RCI Europe, which acts as an administrative centre handling calls from timeshare holiday apartment owners seeking to swap their holidays, has grown rapidly in the past five years, creating 500 new jobs at the administrative headquarters in Kettering. Most of these, however, went to single women in their 20s, many of whom have since found partners and started families. According to Diane Taylor, head of human resources, the company has a 'high fertility index'. Women account for 78 per cent of the 500 staff and their average age is 28. 'Five per cent of the workforce are taking maternity leave this year or next. That's a large percentage for a medium-sized company such as ours to cope with,' she says. Taylor is examining ways to retain and help women who take maternity leave. Job-sharing has been introduced into a flexible shift system at the company. Taking a positive approach to maternity leave, says Taylor, has helped the company reach arrangements that have proved acceptable both to employees and management. 'We place a great emphasis on training and do not want to lose experienced staff,' she says. The company will conduct a cost benefit analysis next year to examine how training costs relate to the costs to the company of maternity leave. Taylor says the company is filling the maternity leave vacancies by assigning people from other parts of the UK company and from other offices of the US-based parent. In the publication department, where linguistic skills are important, two secondees are being drawn from overseas offices. 'This gives them the opportunity to broaden their experience within the company,' she says. Where a temporary managerial vacancy occurred, an employee at a lower level in the company is given the opportunity to fill the post temporarily as part of their work experience. Temporary staff will be engaged to fill some of the lower-level posts. Andrea Quick, 31, manager of the membership marketing department, plans to return part time after the birth of her child. 'I realise I will not be coming back to my current job because that demands a full-time commitment and is not suitable for job sharing,' she says. Sue Nimmo, an analyst who works at the company's holiday bank, has just returned to work after maternity leave. 'Economic circumstances mean that a lot of mothers are returning to work earlier than they might have done,' she says. Adds Malcolm Hewitt, managing director of RCI UK, also based at Kettering: 'Working in this area is complex for managers, but managers in the 1990s have to get used to complexity and have to deal with it in a positive way.' He suggests that service companies are adapting to changing working practices more readily than traditional industries where old ideas and prejudices persist. Staff on maternity leave are informed of company developments by newsletters. Next year the company plans to introduce a company network group so that mothers can share their experiences with expectant mothers. Meanwhile the company plans a booklet called 'Childbirth without tears,' with advice and the names and addresses of child carers.</p>

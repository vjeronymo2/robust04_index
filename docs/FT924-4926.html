			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Companies look beyond perks ruling: How a decision in the Lords will affect staff benefits BUSINESSES are taking a fresh look at the perks they give their employees following a landmark ruling in the House of Lords on Thursday. Most companies will be relieved because the judgment - much to the Inland Revenue's surprise - went in favour of the taxpayer. But much uncertainty over the implications remains. The case of Pepper vs Hart concerned 10 teachers from Malvern College who argued that they should be assessed only for tax on any difference between the reduced fees they paid for their own children to attend the school and the marginal or extra cost of providing this education - to cover books, laundry and food. The Revenue argued that tax should be paid on any difference between the fees and the average cost of providing the education. If the revenue had won there would have been big implications for employee benefits. The ruling has no effect on some perks which are dealt with under separate rules and guidelines, including subsidised staff canteens and company cars. But it has great significance for many, not least reduced-rate education for teachers' children at other fee-paying schools. Many London-based employers who offer subsidised or free sports facilities will be affected. So will travel companies and tour operators offering reduced-rate travel, lawyers providing conveyancing, manufacturers selling products at a discount, restaurants offering meals to staff and companies with executive dining rooms. Mr Maurice Parry-Wingfield from accountants Touche Ross says it might also have an impact on shareholders in some companies who receive benefits in return for their investment as though they were employees. A survey in October of more than 1,500 companies by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick showed that 18 per cent of employers provided goods or services as a benefit to their employees at less than average cost and that 16 per cent provided sports and social facilities. Ten per cent of the companies said they would withdraw some perks if Pepper vs Hart was decided in the Revenue's favour. British Airways offers staff concessionary travel for as little as 10 per cent of the full fare. It was one of a number of companies and professional firms to contribute to the fighting fund backing the Malvern teachers' appeal. Mr Clive Tulloch from Coopers &amp; Lybrand stressed that companies with benefits in which the marginal cost exceeds the average cost will suffer as a result of the judgement. That will include executives employing company gardeners or chauffeurs at anti-social times such as weekends, when they would be paid overtime above their normal rates. The law lords' judgment for the first time allowed ministerial debate before legislation to be considered alongside the letter of the law. That opens a new line of legal attack for appeals in many types of case, and has big implications for lawyers and accountants who will now have to consult Hansard as well as the statute book. But the ruling leaves many questions unanswered. The first question is whether there is any recourse for companies which, under pressure from the Inland Revenue, have used average cost as the benchmark. Mr Brian Friedman, head of Stoy Benefit Consulting, said: 'Those companies which have already settled are going to feel pretty sick.' The second question is the continued uncertainty of how to calculate marginal cost. BA - which recently reached a settlement with the Revenue on its fares until April - is uncertain how to work out the costs of these fares. The third and most important question is how long the new procedures will be in place. The Revenue appears to have been taken by surprise by the ruling. Now it must clarify its position. It may well consider new legislation is needed explicitly to require average costs to be used in future. Next year there will be two budgets when the Revenue could propose this. It has promised a statement shortly. No Revenue press release is likely to be scrutinised more closely.</p>

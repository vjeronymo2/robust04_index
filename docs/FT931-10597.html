			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Mr Smith's task AFTER AN inexplicable period of delay, and following much throat-clearing and shuffling of the feet, Mr John Smith has at last begun to lead the Labour party. His speech to Labour's local government conference in Bournemouth yesterday places him in the camp of the 'modernisers', those who believe that the party must find a fresh set of policies if it is to stand a chance of avoiding a fifth election defeat in 1996 or 1997. The 'traditionalists', have been given short shrift. Mr Smith has clearly learned the lesson of two national case-histories: in Britain Labour has lost four times in a row because it did not keep in tune with the aspirations of ordinary people; in the US the Democrats won last November because President Bill Clinton understood what those aspirations were, and shaped his campaign accordingly. It is plain that Mr Smith has drawn the correct conclusion. Parties that look as if they represent the old left do not stand a chance in either country; parties that restructure themselves and adapt their programmes to changing circumstances can still realistically hope to succeed. It is perhaps for this reason that Mr Smith used the words 'new' and 'renewal' no less than 25 times in his 37-minute speech. He signalled the abandonment of Labour's plans to renationalise some of the utilities. The party's acceptance of the mixed economy was given a new twist, with a call for partnership between 'dynamic markets and active government'. The needs of the individual were stressed; the powers of cabinets - the 'elective dictatorship' - were to be circumscribed by a series of reforms. 'Labour's goal,' said Mr Smith, 'must be about the advancement of individual people, about their ability to participate and their ability to prosper, which we believe can only be achieved in the context of a strong and supportive society.' One speech does not make a political resurgence. Mr Smith's Bournemouth address will fade from memory unless it is followed by radical deeds. Modernisation must begin with a restructuring of the party itself, to provide for one-member one-vote in all its counsels. Formal links with the trade unions must be severed. If nationalisation is to be abandoned, the relevant clause in the party constitution must be repealed. If a form of full employment is to be espoused even as a distant ambition, the 'new economics' of which Mr Smith spoke must be shown to be practical when Mr Gordon Brown spells out the details. To be convincing, a programme of constitutional change must include electoral reform. Mr Smith's new Commission for Social Justice must not be allowed to ponder for too long. The Conservatives have not lost their own capacity for radical change, as the government's long-term study of public spending shows. If Mr Smith is truly bold, a scheme to roll back the frontiers of the welfare state will emerge as a 'new Labour' initiative. The idea worked well enough for Mr Clinton's 'new Democrats'.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Jury selection began in the second trial of GAF Corp. and a senior executive on  stock-manipulation charges that grew indirectly out of the Wall Street insider  trading scandal. The first trial ended Jan. 10 in a mistrial after U.S.  District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe ruled that prosecutors had improperly withheld  information about a key piece of evidence from the defense. More than 100  potential jurors filled out questionnaires for the new trial and went home.  Prosecutors and defense attorneys planned to start questioning them  individually today.  </P></p>

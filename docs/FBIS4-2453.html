			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ron Gluckman and Chow Gee-inn] </F>   [Text] The arrest of several labour leaders last month may  well have been a stern message from mainland officials to  increasingly brazen worker activists. Many officials are  worried widespread strikes pose the greatest threat to stability  since the student democracy movement was crushed at Tiananmen  Square five years ago. However, the daring escape of one of  those activists sends an entirely different set of signals to  Chinese dissidents and the world. While Wang Jiaqi remains on  the run in China, his escape from custody underscores  suggestions of widespread corruption in the Public Security  Bureau and fuels speculation of mounting sympathy among the  ranks for a renewed dissident movement. Wang was arrested early  last month with three other labour organisers, apparently in  reaction to the publication of a charter for a new worker  alliance calling itself the League for the Protection of Working  People of the People's Republic of China.    One of the four men was quickly released, but prominent  labour activist Zhou Guoqiang and lawyer Yuan Hongbing remain in  custody.    While previously seen as the least prominent of the group,  Wang, a 34-year-old postgraduate law student at Beijing  University, has added to his dissident reputation by slipping  from sight late last month. He is reported to have escaped from  custody in Tangshan, a city in Hubei province, east of Beijing.    Official mainland media have carried no accounts of his  arrest or escape, which is not uncommon, according to a Beijing  source. "You'll only read about an escape at the time of his  recapture, since this is something they never publicise," he  said, terming the escape "an extremely rare occurrence".    However, former mainland prisoners told the SUNDAY MORNING  POST that despite the outside perception of formidable and  intensely fortified prison camps, escape is not too difficult.  "You have a very good chance of escape if you have the contacts  and the courage," said one former prisoner, who requested  anonymity. He said top officials, as well as prison guards,  were regularly bought off. Dissidents who have escaped,  including those who remained on the run for years on the  mainland, said with enough money and influential friends, a  wanted man might easily elude the authorities.    This recalls the extensive underground network by which many  Tiananmen figures were transported to safety outside the  country. Known as Operation Yellowbird, the network was believed  to have been financed and organised from Hong Kong.    "Escapes these days are fairly unusual, but not unheard of,"  said Sophia Woodman, of the United States-based group Human  Rights in China. "But I really don't think there is any real  organisation, no formal network. However, there are always  sympathetic people who will help." Worker actions have grown  widespread, with more than 10,000 reported last year by official  Chinese publications. Mainland officials have speculated that  worker unrest has been stirred up by an organised group of  activists. Several human rights groups have accused officials  of stepping up surveillance and detention of suspected worker  leaders. "They are out to stamp out all labour activity," one  source said. "This is far more threatening to the Chinese  regime than a group of students talking about democracy." He  explained the issue of workers' rights had far more appeal to  the peasant population than abstract notions of democracy or  human rights.    Little is known about Wang, and even less about his life on  the run. However, former prisoners and escaped activists can  provide some insight into what he might be expected to face.  Despite the risk, many strangers will be surprisingly helpful,  said Tang Boqiao, a student leader from Hunan who was arrested  in July 1989. While in custody he was severely beaten, and  persecuted by authorities after his release. He escaped to the  United States through Hong Kong in 1991.    While travelling from Guangzhou to Shenzhen, a university  teacher posed as his girlfriend to throw his pursuers off the  trail. Tang was able to elude authorities partly through the  help of friends in the Public Security Bureau and other  government offices. His sister was a member of the bureau but  was demoted and then dismissed after his escape.    Bei Ming and husband Zheng Yi were in hiding for three  years.  Both were prominent writers prior to undertaking a  100,000-kilometre journey through 12 provinces before finally  escaping to the United States in 1992. "When we were first  living in the underground we were very worried," she said.  "However, after a few months we became more relaxed. We just  thought that if we were to worry every day, we would go mad."    Bei said they regularly alternated between safe houses  always  wary of being apprehended. Nevertheless, they were able to  travel freely for much of the time, albeit in disguise.  "Everything had been arranged very well," she said.    However, Bei, like other dissidents, expressed doubt the  same  resources and community sympathy would be available to Wang.  She said that following the Tiananmen crackdown, "many people  were angry. The Government had just shot people and many people  wanted to help. Times have changed. Now, many people do  nothing. They have forgotten what happened."    However, a new mood of protest seems to be brewing and Wang  has become part of it.</p>

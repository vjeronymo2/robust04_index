			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Letter: Environment not always harmed by making paper from pulp Sir, At last a more reasoned approach to paper manufacture and the environment (Survey of Pulp and Paper - 'The green conundrum', December 14). May I comment on just three points? First, most of the timber used for paper manufacture comes from thinnings, so is a waste product of an environmentally beneficial process planting and growing trees. Second, although there is genuine cause for alarm at the short-term exploitative forest activities overseas, here in the UK due regard is now paid to the interaction with fauna and flora. Finally, if from January 1 1993 no more trees were cut down to make paper or board and most paper and board products were recycled every month, by April production would only satisfy half the world consumption and not a single sheet would be available by the summer. It is our judgment that paper from virgin pulp is good for the environment and should take its place alongside recycled paper on the shelf.

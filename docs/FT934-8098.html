			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Observer: The wrong occasion Imagine the panic. Britain's prime minister, now preaching a return to 'basic values', had agreed to unveil a plaque commemorating 'the occassion (sic) of the centenary of Battersea Town Hall' last Friday. At the last moment the spelling mistake was spotted but not in time to order a new plaque. Should the ceremony go ahead without an unveiling? At the town hall - now inhabited by BAC, a fringe theatre group - it was decided that the show must go on, presumably in the hope that the PM would not notice and the error could be corrected later. Such spelling slackness might be permissible in a supposedly loony left borough such as Lambeth but surely not in an organisation funded by Wandsworth, the Government's favourite London borough?</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Why Japan's Socialists had to drop their political baggage of the 1940s: It is the latest step in erosion of the old political structure Japan's Socialists yesterday completed a belated high-speed turn to the right, having taken just a few weeks to cover the same ideological ground as their European counterparts did in decades. Their conversion to the centre ground was perfected when the cabinet of Socialist Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, a profound pacifist, agreed to send troops, albeit lightly-armed ones, to help Rwandan refugees in Zaire. This is the same man who only two years ago led his party in an 'ox-walk' on the floor of parliament, waddling up to the ballot box at snails' pace to delay a vote on sending troops to assist the UN in Cambodia, the first overseas mission by Japan's military since the second world war. The Social Democratic party's change in strategy was made official at an extraordinary party convention two weeks ago, in which members dumped the party's traditional insistence that Japan's military action was unconstitutional, and abandoned the party's formal wish to tear up the US-Japan security treaty. It is the latest step in the erosion of the old structure of Japanese politics over the past year. The immediate aim of the Socialists' about-turn is to fit closer with the conservative Liberal Democratic party, the government coalition's senior partner. The LDP was the SDP's adversary for nearly 40 years until they joined forces at the end of June. But irrespective of the exigencies of running a coalition with the conservatives, the SDP's outdated policies had been overdue for change. Its ideology had remained more or less the same since the 1947 administration of Mr Tetsu Katayama, Japan's only Socialist prime minister until Mr Murayama won power by uniting with his old foes, the LDP. The SDP's pacifist anti-US formula has held decreasing interest for Japan's electorate since the end of the Cold War. In Mr Katayama's day, the then Japan Socialist Party had 143 seats in the lower house of parliament, down to 136 by the turn of this decade. Last year's general election, in which the LDP lost power, nearly halved the Socialists' parliamentary seats to a mere 70. Union membership has similarly slid, from 56 per cent of the workforce in 1949 to 24.4 per cent in 1992, well below European levels. Union leadership has been thrown into turmoil by the recent resignation of Mr Akira Yamagishi, founding father of Rengo, the union con-federation. Yet the Japanese Socialists' transformation has been quite different to the swing to the centre over the past decade by its European counterparts. Unlike in Europe, social policy has played no part in the change. Japan's SDP has always laid more emphasis on foreign and defence matters and less on social policy than European socialists. The Socialists have never taken the initiative in traditional left-wing subjects, such as social policy, consumer affairs or environment. Social affairs have tended to be the preserve of the LDP. This may be because Japan's SDP, unlike the conservatives, lacks well-funded think-tanks. Until becoming a member of the government a year ago, the SDP did not need such things, because its leaders had become used to a comfortable working relationship with the LDP during Japan's long period of one-party conservative rule. SDP and LDP politicians informally overcame differences in a little-known parliamentary body, the oddly named 'counter-measures' committee. In this forum the Socialists were able to push for important legislation on pensions and medical insurance, adjusted and adopted by the LDP as its own. So it is little surprise that the LDP is today taking the lead on the biggest social issue facing Japan: how to provide for the growing number of pensioners. Here, the SDP is following social policy of a kind by opposing the finance ministry's plan for a rise in sales tax, designed to cope with the 'grey wave' but also likely to hit the low-paid. The LDP is sympathetic to the finance ministry line, that a rise in indirect tax is needed to compensate for the fall in the income tax base caused by an ageing population. The tax debate shows that despite the abandonment of its other policies and the disarray of the union movement, the SDP is not on the brink of disintegration. 'The SDP is behaving like a sponge, just absorbing the shocks,' says Mr Takashi Inoguchi, professor of politics at Tokyo University. Its other strength during the turmoils of the past year has been to maintain the party's unity just enough to provide the swing votes that dictate the balance of power. The SDP made it possible for Mr Morihiro Hosokawa and his allies to put together the first non-LDP government since 1955 last year. In June, the Socialists' decision to ally with the LDP brought down the ensuing coalition of Mr Tsutomu Hata. Yesterday's evidence that the SDP is getting more capable of operating as a government party means its odd marriage with the LDP may last longer than first seemed likely. Analysts think the government may be able hold off the next general election for a year or more. The SDP's success in throwing off its old policies means Japanese politics may be passing from upheaval to relative stability.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cao Min: "Code Rates The Work of State Employees"] </F>   [Text] The Personnel Ministry has issued China's first  code to appraise government workers.    And it lays down grades for regular checks on their  performance which may lead to promotion, demotion or the sack.    The code, titled "Provisional Regulations on Appraisal of  State Civil Servants," aims to improve the performance of State  employees.    Appraisals will include day-to-day evaluations and an annual  examination and they will rank civil servants in three glades --  excellent, qualified and unqualified -- according their  integrity, ability, dedication and service record.    The new code says no more than 15 percent of civil servants  should receive "excellent" rankings.    Appraisal committees are to be composed of department heads  and staff representatives elected by workers.    Employees must comprise at least a third of the selection  group.    "Excellent" workers get cash rewards equivalent to one or  two  months extra pay, while "qualified" ones get an extra month's  salary.    Those who receive the top two grades for two consecutive  years will be promoted.    Those deemed unqualified get demoted in their first year and  dismissed if they are found to be unproductive a second year.    Since the civil service was set up October 1 last year, more  than 40 ministries have trained workers or organized courses to  publicize the system.    Several provinces, including Hainan, Guangdong, Shangdong,  Anhui and Jilin, have taken steps to set up the new civil  service.    The Ministry of Coal, which was set up in the first half of  last year, has shed about 900 -- 75 percent -- of its workers.    Provincial governments are focusing their attention on  solving problems arising from the implementation of the new  system.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Crimea must be given the maximum of economic  independence. This is a condition for settlement of the Crimean  issue, said Vladimir Lanovoy, who is a candidate for the  Ukrainian presidency.    Lanovoy said during a meeting with the Economic Council  under  the Crimean president that most tax revenues must remain in  Crimea and be used for local needs.    During his visit to Crimea Lanovoy met with representatives  of the Crimean-Tatar parliament and discussed the issue  concerning compensation for the damage caused by the state to  the deported and oppressed peoples returning to Crimea.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Otsenko: "The Field Is Left without </F> Fertilizers"]    [Text] The whole fall and winter, the government nurtured  the villagers with promises: supposedly, from day to day the  state will pay for the production supplied, it will take care of  the supply of fuel, of mineral fertilizers, and other resources,  before the beginning of field work. And now the time for going  into the fields on a mass scale has begun. Through the lack of  fuel in the winter a very small amount of organic fertilizers  has been prepared. Perhaps it will be made up with mineral  fertilizers.    "The situation with them is also critical," says V.  Tyshkevych, the assistant head of the "Ukragrokhim" association.  "In past years, the farmers and our staff began to prepare  mineral fertilizers for spring field work in November. In the  winter, all the problem areas were worked out. Everything got  done without emergencies. Now things only get started at the end  of February. There was not such tension and difficulty..."    Because of the state's delay in payments for plant and  animal  production, the farms did not have anything with which to  acquire fertilizer. As a result, many enterprises held back  their production, or sold their production to purchasers who  were able to pay--to commercial structures and foreign firms. At  an inappropriate time, on 11 February, the state decided to  allot credits to the countryside. Even if all our mineral  fertilizer plants work at full capacity, the demand for nitrogen  fertilizers will be satisfied by May only at the 70 percent  level, phosphorous at 50 percent, and potassium at 18 percent.    Many farms, especially in the western region, will not be  able to renew winter grain in time and to the fullest extent. A  large deficit in the harvest will mean a four month halt for the  Rivne production association, "Azot." It was paralyzed by a lack  of funds to pay for gas and electricity. Only at the start of  spring, they got going here one aggregate for producing ammonium  nitrate; the rest are standing still.    The farms in the south began field work first. However, the  Horlivka production association, "Styrol," which services this  zone, also will not help the farmers much. Of the 35 billion  karbovantsi of state credits transferred to it, only 3 billion  have been issued.    The enterprises which produce for Ukrainian farms are  supplied with mineral fertilizers, gas and electricity at lower  prices. Unfortunately, many plants often do not use the energy  resources for what they are intended. For example, the northern  Don production association, "Azot," every day produces fifteen  hundred tonnes of ammonium nitrate, but the warehouses are  empty. The fertilizers intended for spring fields go for export.    The Cherkasy production association, "Azot," and the Rozdol  enterprise, "Sirka," unload oils for the countryside in  unsatisfactory fashion.    Raw material for phosphorous fertilizers were purchased in  Russia for 18.3 billion rubles, but the Sumy association,  "Khimprom," the Rivne "Azot," the Vinnytsia "Khimprom," and the  Kostiantynivka chemical plant, are not hurrying to take care of  the production of these fertilizers.    The irregular natural of mutual financial payments at the  intragovernmental level has left the farmers of Ukraine without  potassium fertilizers. The production association,  "Biloruskaliy," has broken off relations with Ukraine. The  Kalush "Khlorvinil" and the Stebnytskyy potassium plants are too  small, and the potassium fertilizers produced by them are of  significantly lower quality than the Belarusian.    The impression has been created that it is not Ukrainian  bread that railroad officials are planning to eat; otherwise,  they would not behave toward the countryside in such a way, like  racketeers. First, they began to demand payment raised several  times for a carload, since supposedly it had not been reserved  45 days in advance. Then they seemed to relent, but having  loosened the reins in one case, they skinned them for other  services. For example, they refuse to extend the railroad tariff  which had applied up to 5 December of last year for the period  of spring field work. Now, to ship fertilizers it is necessary  to pay five times more. The department did not agree to  establish the time for unloading cisterns with ammonia up to  five days, as was the case earlier. With a lack of fuel and  broken down auto transport, the farmer has to do this right  away. Otherwise, there are fines. The extortion by the railroad  men leads to mineral fertilizers, and in the final analysis  prices for agricultural production, becoming much more expensive.    We have reached spring. The country's chemical enterprises  has to send to the countryside, every day, 18,500 tonnes of  oils, and are unloading only a third. Last year the Almighty was  merciful and gave us a harvest. What can we hope for now?</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Brittan appeals to Clinton administration not to complicate Uruguay Round SIR LEON BRITTAN, the EC external trade commissioner, yesterday warned the US against cluttering the Uruguay Round of world trade talks with new issues and fresh conditions, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. But the European Commission welcomed President Bill Clinton's call, in his State of the Union address on Wednesday night, for an expansion of world trade and a successful conclusion of the talks. Speaking in Cheshire in Britain last night, Sir Leon said Mr Clinton had given 'a clear lead' to the final stage of talks, when he announced last week he would ask Congress to extend the administration's 'fast-track' negotiating authority. Sir Leon met Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, for the first time in Washington last week, and described him yesterday as 'an open, agreeable, but tough negotiator'. He said any extension of the Clinton administration's negotiating mandate should be short and free of fresh conditions. 'If new issues are now being suggested, they should not be the pretext for delaying or complicating the present Round,' he said. 'The newly identified issues of today can readily be put on the agenda for discussion in the immediate aftermath of the present Round.' Sir Leon repeated that he was confident of a Gatt agreement, but warned that there was 'a difficult end-game ahead', and said negotiators should expect 'a period of turbulence' before any deal was struck. 'But getting there will require persistence, resolution and determination.' The commissioner said the US should resist the temptation 'to seek protectionist short cuts to economic recovery', and he said bilateral difficulties in trade between the US and the EC - for example, on steel and public procurement - should not be tackled unilaterally.</p>

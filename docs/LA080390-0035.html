			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY'S DEFENSE COSTS SURPASS $750,000  </P> <P> The cost of Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's legal defense in a series of  conflict-of-interest investigations has surpassed $750,000, according to a new  report released Thursday.  </P> <P> The report on fund-raising activity by a committee set up to pay for the  mayor's legal defense showed that Bradley still owes about $310,000 to a team  of lawyers from three Los Angeles firms.  </P> <P> In the first six months of this year, Bradley took in $140,000 toward his legal  defense. He has raised a total of $560,000 since the scandal surrounding his  Administration erupted last year.  </P> <P> Bradley's spokesman, Bill Chandler, announced that another $150,000 is expected  to be raised for the fund during a reception this month. He said the event is  sold out, "a sign of continuing strong support for the mayor."  </P> <P> Records show that much of the money collected has come from prominent city  lobbyists and Bradley's political appointees, or from special-interest groups  that have business dealings with the city.  </P> <P> Among those contributing $1,000 in recent months -- the maximum permitted --  were CH2M Hill California, an engineering firm with large city contracts; City  Centre Development, a real estate partnership developing a huge downtown  project, and H.J. Russell, Felker Ward and Jesse Hill, a trio of Atlanta  businessmen with interests in various airport concession contracts.  </P> <P> The report also reflects how the nature of the Bradley investigation has  shifted in the past several months.  </P> <P> Last year, the bulk of the mayor's legal expenses were run up by the criminal  defense firm of Fogel, Feldman, Ostrov, Ringer &amp; Klevens during a period  when the city attorney was probing the mayor's ties to local financial firms.  That inquiry ended without criminal charges, although Bradley agreed to pay a  $20,000 fine for not properly disclosing personal investments.  </P> <P> This year, most of the legal expenses have shifted to the firm of Miller &amp;  O'Connell, specialists in securities cases who are representing Bradley in an  ongoing U.S. Justice Department probe of the mayor, including possible insider  trading violations.  </P></p>

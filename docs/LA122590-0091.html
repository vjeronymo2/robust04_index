			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> FAMILY PRIDE CAN BE BURDEN ON THE COURT  </P> <P> The news conference was over and the Forum press lounge was near empty, but not  for long. Quickly, a father's pride filled the room.  </P> <P> "Three years ago, I predicted Michael would be the one to bring home the Davis  Cup," said Joe Chang, beaming as he leaned against a Kings trophy case. "That  was in 1987, when I was talking to a tennis writer about the state of U.S.  men's tennis, which was very bad at the time. There wasn't anyone. That year,  Michael won one match at the U.S. Open and it became a very big story -- this  American kid won a match.  </P> <P> "But I say, 'Look at three years down the road. Michael's a good all-surface  player. He should be ready by 1990. He will be the one to bring back the Cup in  1990.' "  </P> <P> The prophecy was realized three weeks ago and Joe Chang continues to bask in  the glory.  </P> <P> "It's been published all over the world," he said. "The other day, someone sent  me a story from India that said, 'Michael Chang's father predicted he would  win.' "  </P> <P> Deep down, Michael wishes these people would stop sending Joe newspaper  clippings. It only encourages him.  </P> <P> "I think he was crazy for saying that," Michael said sternly. "I think he's  very lucky it turned out that I was able to contribute this year. . . .  </P> <P> "I've been cautioning him more and more not to say things like that, because it  puts more pressure on me and if I don't come out and do something like that, it  makes me look bad and it makes him look foolish. I think that's something you  should keep to yourself."  </P> <P> Michael and Joe have talked about it, but you know Joe. He's not about to quit  while he's ahead. Soon, the topic turned to the tennis year of 1991 and soon,  Joe was up and at it again.  </P> <P> "I think he'll do well, because of the new ranking system," Joe said. (Players  will be ranked in 1991 by their comparative performance in events also played  in 1990.) "Last year, before the French Open, he had won no matches. If he does  anything early next year, he'll be ranked very high.  </P> <P> "Who knows? By May, he may be at the top."  </P> <P> Uh oh.  </P> <P> Actually, Joe's math is a bit askew. Michael went 2-5 in pre-French Open  matches, but that included going 0-4 at Memphis, Munich, the German Open and  the Italian Open.  </P> <P> Either way, the point remains the same. Because the first third of Michael's  1990 season was a wash -- he had a fractured hip, made a premature comeback,  then went into a subsequent retrenchment -- he stands to clean up during the  first third of 1991.  </P> <P> "It's been an up-and-down year," said Michael, who has seen his 1990 world  ranking yo-yo from No. 5 to 24 to 10 to its current residence at 15. "But  overall, it's been a good year, considering the circumstances -- winning the  Davis Cup and reaching the semis in the Grand Slam Cup."  </P> <P> The hip injury is a big thing to be over. This time last year, the consensus  was that Chang, the 1989 French Open champion, would never be the same. It was  a rare injury -- a break in the hip socket, extremely unusual in sports -- and  Chang's run-till-the-other-guy-drops game depends mightily on two fully  functional hip sockets.  </P> <P> "I never thought it was totally career-threatening," Chang said, "but during  the first six months, I had these thoughts that go through your mind -- about  Jimmy Arias and Tracy Austin, great players who were so injury-prone, it really  hurt their careers."  </P> <P> He wobbled through the opening months of the year and by the French Open in  early June no one was expecting anything -- except, maybe, Joe Chang. But  Michael reached the quarterfinals at Paris. Chang's game became hip again. He  made the semifinals in Washington D.C., the final in Los Angeles and won the  Canadian Open.  </P> <P> Later, it was on to Vienna and St. Petersburg, Fla., for Davis Cup rounds III  and IV and the gospel according to Joe Chang. Strange but true: Joe tried to  talk Michael out of the matches against Austria because they were played on  clay during the middle of the hardcourt season -- another chance for Michael to  slip out of sync.  </P> <P> This time, though, Michael won the debate.  </P> <P> "For me, I knew that to go to Austria, win or lose, would be exciting. It was  an experience I might only get once in my lifetime," Michael said. "We just  tried to think of all the pros and cons and we decided that maybe this would be  a good time to go.  </P> <P> "It was on clay, my best surface, and I had never played (a Davis Cup match)  away, so this would be another new experience for me.  </P> <P> "I think, the way it turned out, it was a very positive experience."  </P> <P> He might say that. Joe, of course, goes further. Father still marvels at the  way son hung in during his winner-take-all match against Horst Skoff, which  lasted two days and required Michael to rally from a two-set deficit.  </P> <P> "It was right after (Thomas) Muster beat (Andre) Agassi to tie it and the  emotions in the stadium were running so high," Joe said. "Skoff came in, ready  to win it. With that crowd, he seemed unstoppable.  </P> <P> "But the funny thing is, Michael never seemed nervous. When he won the fourth  set, they had to suspend the match because of the lateness of the hour and  that's when it turned around. Skoff had a whole night to think about it and  right after Michael won the fourth set, I remember the Austrian captain saying,  'Oh no, he always wins the fifth set.'  </P> <P> "He knew Michael had won his last seven five-setters."  </P> <P> Eight would prove too much for the Austrians, sending the Americans home to St.  Pete, where Chang and Agassi and the Rick Leach-Jim Pugh doubles team would  prove too much for the Australians. Davis' trophy was America's cup again, just  as Joe said it would be.  </P> <P> Now, 1991 beckons and with Phil Dent enlisted to bulk up Chang's  serve-and-volley approach, Michael believes more strides are within reach.  </P> <P> "I feel like I'm in a good position," he said, "to go into 1991 strong, but  quietly."  </P> <P> As long as Dad's around, quiet could be tough.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A new round of Moldovan-Russian negotiations  regarding the status of the 14th [Russian] Army began yesterday  in Chisinau. The talks were attended, in the status of invited  party, by the representatives of the self-proclaimed Dniester  Moldovan Republic. Our correspondent reports that the observers  of the CSCE mission to the Republic of Moldova are not attending  the negotiations.    According to a statement made by the leader of the Moldovan  delegation, Anatol Taranu, the previous rounds resulted in the  elaboration of a number of documents that could serve as a solid  base for the establishment of the status of the 14th Army.    The positions of Moscow and Chisinau diverge regarding the  deadline of the pullout of that army, Radio Moscow reports,  adding that the Russian party considers that the pullout could  be carried out solely after the Dniester region is granted a  special status. According to the same source, the leadership of  the secessionist [Dniester] republic fears that Moldova might  eventually unite with Romania.    According to a report broadcast by Radio Moldova, the  situation of the [Ilie] Ilascu group [imprisoned by the  authorities of the Dniester republic] has become alarming. Ilie  Ilascu has been put under an informational blockade, as he is  not allowed to receive newspapers or possess a radio set, while  his wife has been again denied access to the prison. According  to the same source, the personal safety of the other four  members of his group is endangered, as other detainees have  access to their prison cells and they are assaulting them. The  health condition of the entire Ilascu group is also precarious.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EX-AIDE ADMITS GIVING NORIEGA DRUG MONEY  </P> <P> A top co-defendant in the Manuel A. Noriega case today pleaded guilty to giving  drug payoffs directly to the deposed Panamanian leader.  </P> <P> Luis del Cid, a former lieutenant colonel under Noriega, entered his plea this  morning before U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler, capping almost a year  of plea negotiations with the government.  </P> <P> "Yes, I transported the money, but, well, I am repentant of having done so,"  Del Cid told the judge. "What I was doing was following orders of a superior  officer."  </P> <P> Del Cid acknowledged making at least three separate cash transactions for  Noriega. He admitted the government's contention that he gave Noriega $100,000  in cash from drug pilot Floyd Carlton Caceres in November, 1982. He also  delivered an envelope with $150,000 cash from Carlton and later picked up a  suitcase stuffed with cash -- all of which was delivered to Noriega.  </P> <P> Del Cid was an aide to Noriega at the time of their capture after the U.S.  invasion in 1989. Prosecutors have charged that he acted as a liaison and money  courier between drug traffickers and Noriega.  </P></p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / EC sticks to policy as trade talks begin AS ministerial-level farm trade reform talks between the US and the European Community were starting in Chicago last night, the EC reiterated that any deal would have to protect the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), agreed in May. The meeting - of Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, and Mr Ed Madigan, his US counterpart - is seen on both sides as the last chance to avert a trade war, and to salvage hopes for wide-ranging trade liberalisation under the Uruguay Round, which has been stalled for two years by the row over the EC's subsidised food export regime. Top EC negotiators believe agreement can be reached with the US, but are voicing no public optimism because Washington has left this meeting until hours before Americans vote in presidential and Congressionalelections tomorrow. US trade officials also say there was little optimism that the new talks would provide a breakthrough. The EC's absolute and final determination to stay within the framework of CAP reform has been clear to the US since early last Tuesday morning, officials say. After two weeks of intensive diplomacy, compromise agreements appear to have been forged in all areas except that of trade in oilseeds. A White House meeting last week agreed to announce sanctions against the EC on oilseeds on Wednesday, if a settlement has not been reached by then. US farmers have been complaining for five years that the EC's oilseed subsidy regime has harmed them. Two dispute panels of the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) have endorsed their claims. A Gatt council meeting, planned for Wednesday, could be used to win multilateral sanction for the US to impose punitive tariffs on EC farm exports. France - Europe's main farm exporter - is said to be the main target of the tariffs. Senior officials in Brussels fear that Washington delayed the Chicago meeting in the hope this would boost President George Bush's chances of re-election. Another fear is of an eve-of-poll ambush, in which the Community might be blamed for having blocked the benefits to the world economy of a deal through the Uruguay Round. EC officials say the new CAP's cuts in subsidised farm prices and production, passed into Community law at the beginning of July, can deliver all but the tiniest wrinkles on a global Gatt agreement. They are adamant about the need to stay within the framework of the reform, arguing that, if they put one foot outside the CAP, they would be unable to prevent opponents - principally in France - from unravelling the entire package. Mr MacSharry has so far built majorities inside the European Commission and the member states to beat back France's attempts to scuttle a Gatt deal. Yet, if no agreement is reached, a rapidly expanding trade war and litigation through the Gatt could undo the new CAP anyway. In addition to levying punitive tariffs on EC exports, the US would certainly try to build on its two successive Gatt judgments against the EC's oilseeds regime. Further challenges to the EC farm regime would come from Australia, New Zealand and Argentina, already preparing cases against the EC's subsidised wheat and beef exports to put to Gatt adjudication.</p>

			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> MOORE PLEADS GUILTY TO 5 COUNTS  </P> <P> Former West Virginia Gov. Arch Moore today fulfilled an agreement with federal  prosecutors by pleading guilty to a five-count corruption indictment.  </P> <P> The maverick Republican, the only West Virginia governor to serve three  four-year terms, entered his plea before U.S. District Judge Walter Hoffman,  brought in from Baltimore because federal judges in the state asked to be  excused.  </P> <P> Moore faces up to 36 years in prison and fines totaling $1.2 million.  Sentencing was set for July 10. U.S. Atty. Michael Carey said the government  agreed to make no sentencing recommendation.  </P> <P> Moore, 67, agreed April 12 to plead guilty to extortion, mail fraud, tax fraud  and obstruction of justice after federal prosecutors revealed they had secretly  recorded a meeting in which Moore allegedly admitted receiving illegal cash  donations in his 1988 campaign. The recording also allegedly showed he planned  to hide information from federal investigators.  </P></p>

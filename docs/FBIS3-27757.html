It goes without saying that the buildup of the combat power  of the U.S. Forces in the ROK is aimed at North Korea.  Therefore, the fact that our government has agreed to improve  the combat capabilities of the U.S. Forces in the ROK can be  explained in two ways. First, the government has figured that  it may be of use in putting psychological pressure on North  Korea to once and for all come to an agreement with the  International Atomic Energy Agency for the early settlement of  the nuclear issue. Second, it is out of necessity to  substantially prepare against a possible "crisis on the Korean  peninsula" that may be caused when North Korea changes its  system on its own.    The ROK and the United States have reportedly worked out  such  measures from the time North Korea declared its withdrawal from  the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty and the U.S.-North Korean  dialogue started. It was also learned that General Gary Luck,  commander of U.S. Forces in Korea, pointed out problems in  deploying reinforcements dispatched from the mainland for actual  combat purposes in case a war breaks out and strongly requested  the deployment of Patriot missiles late last year to break the  brunt of the enemy's attack.    In connection with these moves, relevant government official  on 27 January said "North Korea has recently shown signs of  breaking the power balance on the Korean peninsula by developing  Nodong-1 and -2 missiles." He added that "We think it is time to  reexamine the defense system of the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces  Command." Stressing that Patriot missiles are only defensive  weapons, he went as far as saying that "the Patriot missiles  deployed in the ROK will be for `display' unless North Korea  launches Scud missiles toward the ROK."    Meanwhile, some in the Foreign Ministry hold that the rapid  buildup of combat power of the U.S. Forces in the ROK, including  the deployment of Patriot missiles, may provide a new excuse for  North Korea to assume a hard-line stance on the nuclear issue.  North Korea has, in fact, urged both the ROK and the United  States to suspend the Team Spirit joint military exercise--a  defensive exercise--maintaining that the exercise is aimed at  attacking North Korea. Therefore, this may give North Korea  enough room to persist that the recent "complementary measures  for defense combat capabilities" of the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces  Command also pose a threat to North Korea.    It is worth noticing that China expressed its position  through its Foreign Ministry spokesman by commenting that "we do  not approve a conduct that undermines stability and peace on the  Korean peninsula." In addition, some go as far as pointing out  that the recent decision on building up combat power stemmed  from the U.S.' domestic problems. Their rationale is that there  is no reason for the United States to strengthen the ROK-U.S.  Combined Forces Command by provoking North Korea at a time when  the nuclear issue seems to be finding its way out through  dialogue. In other words, it may be an adroit strategy hatched  by the U.S. Administration designed to eventually sell the U.S.  Forces weapons to the ROK Army.</p>

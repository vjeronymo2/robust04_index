			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Observer: Too hot to handle Alarm bells are sounding at The Independent as the move to Mirror Group Newspapers' Canary Wharf Tower approaches. Tucked away in a job description questionnaire being circulated to Indy staff is a query about whether the person filling in the form is sitting at their own desk. The question is not as innocent as it sounds. The Indy has around 370 staff, and the word is that there is only room for around 320 desks in the paper's new premises. Apparently, Mirror chief executive David Montgomery is a great believer in the 'hot desk' theory where staff find their desks on a first come, first served basis. It's said to be a good way of insuring that they turn up on time.</p>

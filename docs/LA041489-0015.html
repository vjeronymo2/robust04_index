			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT  </P> <P> In response to your front-page article "Court Limits Risk on Home Damage: State  Justices Rule That Companies Must Pay Only When Policy Covers Primary Cause of  Loss," March 31:  </P> <P> It is blatantly obvious (now) that every time the insurance industry asks this  court for a loaf of bread, the justices give them the entire bakery. On the  other hand -- "We the people" ask for a loaf of bread, and this court gives us  a few crumbs from the crust -- fully baked, and unable to rise to the occasion.  James Otis (1725-1783) once said, "Taxation without representation is tyranny."  And I say, "Taxation with representation is very much tyranny, at least in the  California Supreme Court."  </P> <P> DEWELL T. CREWS  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

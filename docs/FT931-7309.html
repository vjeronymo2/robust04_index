			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Cox Cable Communications and Southwestern Bell in joint venture COX CABLE Communications of Atlanta and Southwestern Bell are considering a joint venture to buy and operate cable systems in the UK. The talks follow Southwestern Bell's decision last week to buy a US cable TV network for Dollars 650m (Pounds 458m). The deal will represent Cox's second move into the UK. The media group is a significant investor in UK Gold, the satellite channel specialising in re-runs of classic programmes. The UK cable market is attracting attention from US companies as much for the opportunity to offer telecommunications services as for the chance to operate television channels.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Property fraud charges imminent WEST MIDLANDS police will soon charge with fraud at least 10 and possibly 12 businessmen - including company executives, solicitors and property valuers  -who allegedly set up a series of illegal commercial property transactions in Birmingham and the Black Country. Deals valued at about Pounds 50m have come to light during a nine-month inquiry by the West Midlands commercial fraud squad, helped by the fraud investigation group of the Crown Prosecution Service. The investigation is concentrated on the purchase and sale of 15 properties where loans of Pounds 6m have been taken out. Five people have been arrested, though no charges have been brought. Further arrests are expected in the next two months. The properties - offices, pubs and warehouses - changed hands as the first cracks started to appear in the commercial property market during 1989-90, when credit was still readily available. The deals allegedly had elements in common, and were made as follows: A property would be bought legitimately. It would be given a new, but inflated, professional valuation and sold on sometimes once, sometimes twice, to companies associated with the original purchaser. Loans would be raised on the authority of the inflated valuation. But loans were not repaid and companies taking them out went into liquidation. The companies involved were thus able to obtain money at two levels, from the difference between the original purchase price and the inflated resale price, and from the loans. West Midlands police became alerted to the possibility of a commercial property ring from two sources: first, when they were investigating a series of residential property mortgage frauds, and second, through concern by the yet unnamed lending institutions. It set up an inquiry team of 10 officers, which narrowed its investigation to specific transactions.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Ms Nice Guy on City offensive: Mo Mowlam talks to Ian Hargreaves about regulation, corporate governance and mergers On the terrace of the House of Commons it feels like the first day of spring, and that season's first fly has made the fatal mistake of tiptoeing across Ms Mo Mowlam's side of the table. 'We don't take hostages,' she says, with one swat. This action is not wholly consistent with her Ms Nice Guy image in the City of London, where she has spent much of the last year 'eating for Labour' in the party's City charm offensive. 'I can go to Brooks's in St James Street and I know the guy that waits on table,' she says. Ms Mowlam, 42, has indeed become a familiar and courted figure in the Square Mile, although in 1989 she was a surprise choice for Labour's City and corporate affairs portfolio. An MP only since 1987 and sponsored by health service union Cohse, her pedigree has plenty in it to alarm your average merchant banker: degree in social anthropology, former college lecturer and administrator, member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, research assistant to Mr Tony Benn, constituency in the industrial north-east and no previous contact with City affairs beyond buying car insurance. She says a spell working with Mr Alvin Toffler, the American futurologist, burnished her social resilience. 'My starting point was that both sides had a view frozen in time of what the other was about. We had changed, I'm not sure the City had.' She also set about learning her brief in a detail that has amazed many. It is not that she never gets things wrong; an impulsive thinker and high-speed talker, she does. Her sparky style contrasts with the well-oiled gravity of her boss, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow industry secretary, with whom it is said she has a touchy relationship. But she rattles off acronyms of City regulatory agencies as if they were the names of pet dogs, scribbling in a notepad to remind her of further detailed points later in the interview. Politically, she is freshly minted late-1980s Kinnockite - 'a degree of market forces with a degree of social responsibility' - and hungry for power. She is 'sick of having people cry on my shoulder and not being able to do anything'. Asked to encapsulate what Labour would aim to achieve in City affairs in a first five-year term of office, she makes two points. 'I want our industry to be in a lead position in Europe.' Pointing to the German chancellor's recent interventions on behalf of Finanzplatz Deutschland, she says: 'What Kohl is doing in relation to banking, that's what we should be doing.' Mr John Redwood, her opposite number in government, has not just failed to level the playing field, 'he sends too many industries out without even a goalie'. Her second point concerns consumers of financial services, whom she says have had a raw deal from the Financial Services Act. She thinks the act has produced a top-heavy system of regulation which few can understand. There should be at most two regulators - one for wholesale, one for retail investment business. 'There is a strong case for simplification at the retail end. But I'm happy to leave the wholesale end looser, if they behave slightly more intelligently.' On many topics, she pledges close attention to expert views and committees of inquiry. She does not think Labour would bring in a financial services act in its first year, 'but after that, there are changes that will need new legislation'. The agenda for a legislative framework - disclosure of information to investors, commissions, compensation arrangements, mechanisms for consultation - is clearer than the proposed solutions. She rejects the idea that Labour would favour a primarily statutory framework of regulation rather than the essentially voluntary system now in place, just as she declines to headline her approach as backing an American Securities and Exchange Commission-type solution. 'What I want is a system that works. To use this sort of shorthand doesn't help.' She thinks the Securities and Investments Board may need recasting, perhaps as the kind of 'autonomous' agency now multiplying in the British public sector under the 'next steps' programme. 'That would give you freedom of pay structures and freedom to appoint outside, but clear objectives and clear accountability.' She adds, however, that others are advising 'something more quangoish, like the Office of Fair Trading'. She is still listening. Labour sounds equally undecided about reforming the City's defences against fraud. She thinks the Serious Fraud Office 'has done a reasonable job, but has had a resources problem'. The law on disqualifying directors should, she says, be deployed more vigorously. Labour's ideas on corporate governance have been thought through in more detail, in the party's evidence to the Cadbury Committee. Ms Mowlam warns that 'another well-meaning document which says this is good practice and it would be a terribly good idea if you chaps adopted it, would be a waste of paper'. Included in Labour's policy is a fiery line on executive pay awards. 'I just enjoy attacking Mick Newmarch, (the Prudential's chief executive),' she says. Ms Mowlam has also played a prominent role in the Lloyd's saga, defending the interests of Names, which is perhaps curious given the likely political sympathies of those involved. She justifies her actions mainly on the grounds that insurance is a big industry in which Britain needs to be modern and competitive. 'With deregulation, the club can no longer regulate itself. We have a competitive problem on our hands and we have to react.' On mergers and acquisitions policy, she struggles to make sense of Labour's proposed introduction of a 'public interest' test for mergers. This would involve not a change in the law, but a reversal of the so-called 'Tebbit doctrine' specifying that only pure competition issues should be admitted in takeover rulings. Labour, she says, 'has a group of people looking at the detail'. But what kinds of merger would she hope to stop? 'I'm not going to answer that.' Hanson-ICI? 'Yes.' Why? Because of Hanson's 'track record on investment and R&amp;D'. Does that mean companies like Hanson should never be allowed to take over any well-run manufacturer? What about BTR's takeover of Hawker Siddeley? 'We're not about stopping takeovers, sometimes they're needed to improve efficiency,' she ripostes. 'But in the 1980s, we were the takeover capital of Europe and that's not constructive.' She then agrees that, unless Labour can clarify its position on public interest in mergers, 'that would be as counterproductive as what we had in the 1980s'. In Labour's approach to the City, one swatted fly does not make a summer.</p>

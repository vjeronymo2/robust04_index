			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US bank files claim for Dollars 200m on CIS grain loans A US co-operative bank that represents farmers, utilities, and other business in rural America has filed claims to recover Dollars 200m in failed loans for exports to the former Soviet Union. Russia has made only one payment on its US grain loans since late November and was Dollars 526m in arrears this week. While Chicago wheat prices have rallied sharply since Monday on hopes that the US and Russia might reach a bi-lateral debt accord to reschedule the grain loans, the huge claim by CoBank shows that bank, at least, has lost faith that the debt problem will quickly be resolved. CoBank, a Denver, Colorado-based financial co-operative with Dollars 12bn in assets and 3,000 rural shareholders, is the Commonwealth of Independent States' largest creditor in the GSM-102 programme for government-guaranteed grain loans. CoBank holds Dollars 1.7bn guaranteed loans to the CIS, or about 40 per cent of the Dollars 4.2bn in grain loans written in the three-year programme. Mr Jack Cassidy, CoBank's senior vice president for corporate relations, said the bank delayed filing its claims on the CIS loans for as long as possible. 'Our view was the Russians have the willingness, desire, and capacity to repay over the longer term.' He added, however: 'It has become obvious that the US government is unwilling to reschedule the debt unilaterally'. Despite high-level talks between US and Russian officials on the grain debt two weeks ago, and several hints by Mr Mike Espy, US Agriculture Secretary, that a Russian grain programme was being planned, there has been no movement on debt rescheduling. The US Department of Agriculture seems to prefer outright grain donations, which farm interests believe are no substitute for re-opening the Russian export market. 'Our primary interest in this is moving grain for our shareholders,' said Mr Cassidy. 'We would like to see that market re-open.' Russia, he said, was up to date on its loan payments to CoBank. However, the US loan programme also holds Russia responsible for all the debts of the FSU.</p>

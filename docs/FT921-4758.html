			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Lamont begins the triple whammy - Serious Money THE PHRASE 'double whammy' made it into the electioneering headlines this week but it is a 'triple whammy' which will concern most investors this weekend. A combination of the Budget, the end of the tax year and a general election, all within the next five weeks, will force many into some hasty decision-making. The temptation is to rush into investments in an effort to avoid tax, particularly at the higher rates for higher earners which will be imposed by a Labour government. The snag, which we have been trying to emphasise for the last few weeks, is that tax shelters rarely come without a penalty. Either the investor has to tie up his or her money for a long period, or receives no income, or faces charges which might outweigh the tax savings. Worst of all, he might lose a good proportion of his money. Better to pay tax on a profit than to make no profit at all. There are plenty of other caveats. It would be pointless to lock away your savings for a long period if you then find that higher tax rates make it difficult for you to make ends meet on your income. You could find yourself requiring instant access to your savings. And a Labour government might not be elected, so you might tie up money without good cause. Also remember, that if the Conservatives call an election next week, Tuesday's Budget would only be implemented if they won at the polls, so take care before rushing out to take action after you hear Norman Lamont's Budget speech. Private investors should think hard about their individual needs - and only then see if any tax-efficient investments meet those needs. There are some obvious points - such as tax efficiency within the family. Husband and wife each have personal income tax allowances of Pounds 3,295 and a tax-free capital gains allowance of Pounds 5,500. One may be taxed at 40 per cent and the other at 25 per cent. Efficient use of these allowances and differential rates can save a good deal of tax. If the top rate of tax under Labour rises to 50 per cent (plus 9 per cent NI), then it is likely to make sense to use savings to pay down that part of your mortgage which is over the band for tax relief (currently Pounds 30,000). Otherwise you will be paying interest out of heavily taxed income and then facing the same taxes on your savings income. With mortgage rates currently at 10.5 per cent, then a top rate taxpayer would need to earn a gross return of more than 21 per cent from his savings under Labour to be better off not paying down the loan. And those who face the investment income surcharge on top would need to earn a staggering 25.6 per cent. A Tessa (Tax Exempt Special Savings Account) offers the chance for tax-free interest. If you pick a Tessa without transfer penalties, there are no real disadvantages. Although the tax break only arises if you keep the capital within the Tessa for five years, all that happens if you withdraw your money is that you pay income tax. You would have done that if had you left the money in the building society. And rates on Tessas are in many cases better than those on conventional building society accounts. Those who are sure that they can survive without their money for five years should also consider the attractions of National Savings certificates, which offer per annum rates of either 8.5 per cent fixed or 4.5 per cent plus inflation. An individual investor could this year accumulate as much as Pounds 23,000 in Tessas and National Savings certificates - and get tax free returns without any risk to the nominal value of their capital. Again, those who are worried about capital loss, might find attractions in an offshore roll-up fund, which would allow them to postpone tax (see Page V). Here again, the snag is that you also have to postpone receiving your income. The tax-free capital gains offered by indexed-linked gilts may also appeal, especially if you believe that a Labour government will mean higher inflation. Other tax breaks, which are more heavily marketed, need extra care. Some would argue that you can never make too much provision for your pension, but there is a danger at the moment that too many people are switching out of good company schemes and into personal pensions. Remember that money put aside for a pension is 'lost' until you retire and that the charges on a regular payment pension plan are heavy in the early years. If you get fed up with your pension manager and want to switch, the transfer value may be much lower than the amount you paid in premiums. And personal equity plans are fine for those who have large equity portfolios, and are long term investors. But for a basic rate taxpayer with Pounds 7,000 in the building society, to put Pounds 6,000 in a Pep makes little sense. He will probably pay 5 per cent or more in charges, which at current tax rates and equity yields will take several years to recover. And if he suddenly needs the money for a new car next year, he may not get his capital back. The tax attractions of a Business Expansion Scheme (see page V) are among the most appealing of all, but again caution is needed in selecting a scheme. Getting your money out again after the five year period is up is often the trickiest part of the investment. Good independent financial advice is essential in these matters.</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE GAME WE KNOW NEEDS NURTURING  </P> <P> One warm, blue-skied day soon, with the last frost behind us and while the air  is still crisp and alive, we are going to have to talk about baseball.  </P> <P> We have to, because for a generation or so, the game has been changing. As have  we all.  </P> <P> Those of us who remember have an obligation to talk about baseball, about the  game we knew, because much of it still exists. It needs to be dusted off and  nurtured.  </P> <P> Money has changed the game, but money has changed us all. Saying the players of  yesteryear weren't concerned with salaries is like saying each of us would be  willing to go back to that first job out of college and live on what we made  then.  </P> <P> Once, it seemed a lot of money. Once, it probably was.  </P> <P> But in 1990, Will Clark's agent will make more money than Ted Williams earned  in his career. And the New York Yankees have a 12-year cable television  contract worth $485 million.  </P> <P> We need to talk baseball before we begin to think of it as just another  American industry. And before our children do.  </P> <P> We need to talk baseball before batting gloves. Before baserunners wore sliding  gloves.  </P> <P> We need to remember baseball when Pete Rose hustled on the field, not off. When  all stadiums were outdoors and all grass was real.  </P> <P> We need to talk baseball without Fehr and loathing, because what is happening  now isn't the fault of the game. And when today's owners and today's players  are gone, the game won't be. Not if enough of us remember it. And talk it.  </P> <P> Talk baseball when Bob Gibson threw a purpose pitch and when Frank Robinson got  back up, dusted himself off and stood in the box glaring at the mound, bat  high.  </P> <P> Talk about a game with players like Yogi Berra, who took comic books on team  trains, loved kids and thought most of a newspaper was something to wrap the  sports section in.  </P> <P> Once, the uniforms were flannel and so baggy a man might get blown off base in  a good strong wind.  </P> <P> Once, Don Drysdale went into Buzzie Bavasi's office to talk contract figures --  and Bavasi wrote down different figures on scraps of paper, then told Drysdale  to pick one.  </P> <P> Drysdale did and went away happy.  </P> <P> Talk about baseball before trading cards were investments, when they were  collected because a guy had a great sounding name, or just because he played  for Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Talk about the baseball that drew men, women and children to its parks wanting  to watch the game, not drink beer. When a kid in the upper deck wouldn't hear  words he'd have to have explained.  </P> <P> We live in complex times, and that has been hard on a simple game. Greed isn't  new. Nor obstinacy.  </P> <P> And perhaps what we see at baseball's bargaining table these days is merely  what we see elsewhere. Greyhound buses are being shot at -- with a lot less  money at stake.  </P> <P> And perhaps that is why we need to talk baseball. To get the game back where it  belongs, in our imaginations, our memories.  </P> <P> We need to honor a game and forget, at times, those who dishonor it. With luck,  baseball will survive commissioners without courage, owners who feel they  answer to no one and players who want a lifetime of opulence for a few years of  work.  </P> <P> We should talk baseball, because in remembering what was, perhaps we will see  that much of that same magic remains.  </P> <P> Eventually, baseball will return. And if we view it the way owners and players  are viewing it now, the game will have lost more than a few months. It will  have lost all those reasons we ever talked baseball.  </P></p>

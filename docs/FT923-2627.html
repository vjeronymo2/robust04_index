			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / International Company News: White Martins earnings buck trend with 9% rise WHITE Martins, a publicly quoted Brazilian chemical company controlled by Praxair of the US, posted net profits of Dollars 36m for the first seven months of 1992. Last year the company earned Dollars 33m over the same period. Mr Julio Cesar Cassano, director of legal affairs and market relations, said the group - which controls 70 per cent of the Dollars 650m Brazilian market for industrial gases - was able to buck a 'negative' trend in Brazil. He cited cost reductions and increased sales from a plant opened in March to supply Copene, a petrochemical company in Bahia state. White Martins recently paid Dollars 13m for a controlling interest in Fracchia Hermanos, an Argentinian producer of industrial gases, starting what Mr Cassano called the company's 'strategy for Mercosur', the proposed common market for Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. By investing Dollars 30m, the group hopes to boost Fracchia Hermanos' share of the Dollars 100m Argentinian market from 15 per cent to 25 per cent in five years.</p>

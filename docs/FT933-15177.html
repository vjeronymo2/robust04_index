			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Portuguese government seeks Es3,500bn from EC The Portuguese government will seek Es3,500bn (Dollars 21.7bn) in structural funds from the European Community for the period 1994 to 1999, Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister, has announced, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon. The request, which will be submitted to Brussels in the near future, is thought to have been prompted as an early move in the face of the Irish rejection of the planned division of EC structural funds among the four poorest members states, Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain. Mr Cavaco Silva said the EC funds would mobilise Es6,580bn in investment, representing 28 per cent of the total investment in the Portuguese economy over the next six years. This would mean public investment growing at a rate of 8 per cent a year and private investment at 5.5-6.5 per cent a year.</p>

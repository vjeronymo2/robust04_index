			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / US court rejects Westinghouse appeal A US FEDERAL court has rejected an appeal by Westinghouse Electric to drop bribery and corruption charges against it over a nuclear power project in the Philippines. Westinghouse and Burns &amp; Rose, consultants to the deal, will as a result have to face a jury trial in Newark, New Jersey, to start on March 2. The decision is a blow to Westinghouse, which last month made a final attempt to quash the allegations brought more than four years ago by the Philippine government and the National Power Corporation (NPC), the state power company which signed the initial contract in 1976. The original deal, negotiated under the former regime of President Ferdinand Marcos, called for construction of a 620 megawatt nuclear power station on the Bataan peninsula. The plant was completed in 1986, but was mothballed before start-up by the government of Mrs Corazon Aquino following Mr Marcos' exile. The NPC and government filed suit in the US in December 1988, claiming the contract was won as a result of Dollars 17m in bribes paid to Mr Marcos. The alleged bribes took the form of a Dollars 17m special sales representative consultancy payment to Mr Herminio Disini, a Marcos associate, who now lives outside the Philippines. Many of the technical counts connected with the deal were referred by the US court to the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in Geneva, while the US court, presided over by Judge Dickinson Debevoise, committed the companies to a jury trial on the bribery and corruption allegations. In late December, the ICC issued a preliminary finding that there was no evidence that bribes were paid to win the contract. It is still deliberating the technical issues. On the basis of the ICC ruling, Westinghouse lawyers sought to invoke the doctrine of collateral estoppel, a legal term meaning that the ICC ruling should apply to the US case. On this basis, they called for the US case to be dropped. After reviewing arguments by both sides, Judge Debevoise refused to bow to the ICC ruling. While 'having no quarrel with the ICC,' he nevertheless found numerous faults with the judgment. Chief among these was that the ICC was operating on extremely narrow parameters in which only the most overt evidence of bribes to Mr Marcos would have persuaded the tribunal of the defendants' guilt.

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Dalepak shares drop on warning Shares of Dalepak Foods, the frozen foods and ready meals manufacturer, slumped 45p to 125p yesterday after the company warned it expected to break-even in the six months to October 31. In the same period last year pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.6m. It said it expected to make a profit for the year, but would not maintain its dividend at last year's 6p. The group had already been under pressure, warning in March about profits for the April year-end, which were down at Pounds 2.21m (Pounds 3.93m). It said yesterday that sales volumes and margins had fallen further since then. In an attempt to counter that it was pushing up prices and cutting costs. It said its new freezing plant, which had suffered commissioning problems, was now working satisfactorily.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Greggs advances 27% to Pounds 3.66m Greggs, the manufacturer and retailer of bread, confectionery and savoury products, yesterday reported pre-tax profits up 27 per cent from Pounds 2.89m to Pounds 3.66m for the 24 weeks to June 18. A 7.5 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 51.9m, against Pounds 48.3m, included an increase of 1.5 per cent in core volume. Earnings per share were up by 26 per cent from 17p to 21.4p and the interim dividend is increased by 17 per cent to 7p per share, compared with 6p. The interim results cover the period immediately before Greggs' acquisition of the Baker's Oven business from Associated British Foods on June 19. This boosted total outlets from 505 to 929, making Greggs Britain's largest retail baker, trading from Pitlochry to Southampton. Mr Mike Darrington, managing director, said the priorities now were implanting Greggs' decentralised structure into Baker's Oven, improving the acquisition's quality and efficiency and addressing its continuing core volume decline. He said several years' hard work lay ahead to realise the full benefits but it would cover its financing costs from the outset. Some benefits were already being felt, including better buying for the enlarged business. At the period end Greggs had net cash of Pounds 12.6m. Year-end borrowings are expected to be less than Pounds 5m despite the Pounds 12m net acquisition cost of Baker's Oven, and a record Pounds 16m capital expenditure programme. Mr Darrington said he expected a satisfactory result for the whole year, but predicted slower profit growth in the second half, partly due to the start-up costs of new bakeries in London and Birmingham. Recent hot weather was also a factor, denting sales of pastries, cream cakes and sweet cake lines.</p>

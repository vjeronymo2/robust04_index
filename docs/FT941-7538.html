			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Observer: Wobbly chair Whatever happened to Alan Wheatley, the former senior London partner of Price Waterhouse? Yesterday should have been his big day. Final confirmation came that 3i, the venture capital giant, is to be floated on the stock market and Tring, the budget CD company, made its stock market debut. By rights Wheatley should have been chairman of both companies. However, Wheatley quit as chairman of 3i last April, after less than a year in the job, because 3i's planned stock exchange flotation had been delayed. In October he was tipped to be chairman of Tring, a budget CD and cassette group, which was planning to come to the market. Once again the flotation was delayed he got cold feet. No doubt Wheatley - a non-exec of Forte, Babcock and Legal &amp; General - had good reasons for standing down. But if he really wants to make a name for himself as a company chairman, he needs to stick with his charges through good times and bad.</p>

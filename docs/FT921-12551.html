			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Let's hear it for the buskers: Fran Kaplan argues in favour of entertainment on the Underground THE JOB description: Be your own boss, get paid cash, plenty of opportunities to meet people of all different nationalities (be they snap-happy Japanese tourists or Belgian tap-dancers.) NB: A love of travel is useful. The job: busking on the London Underground. To a student unable to find summer holiday work in the present economic climate, busking presents an attractive option. People-watching is a favorite pastime, and what better place to do it than at the bottom of an escalator where I get paid for singing Italian opera. With such an occupation, I am inviting some reaction. No reaction is unusual. Raised eyebrows, looks of absolute horror, an occasional Pounds 5 note for showing such guts and too many foreign coins come my way. In the summer, Italians, who tend to travel in swarms, hover and are quick to interrupt if my pronounciation of their language does not satisfy them. Silver-haired old ladies, with hands veined like old china, stop to chat and try to save me from the street. 'My son's with the London Sinfonietta, you know.' Yes, and I'm Nigel Kennedy. Ask buskers how much they take in an hour and you will receive some colourful accounting. I started singing on the Underground in 1988. Fellow-performers were earning Pounds 10 to Pounds 25 an hour (tax-free), depending on their originality. Beaten-out metal drums from the West Indies were popular, and the tap dancer who requested commuters to stop talking in 'his' theatre also gained quite a following. But the recession has had an effect. My own experience is that income per hour from busking in the City, London's financial heartland, is considerably less than in the West End. Or, to put it differently, City commuters are stingy] Besides which, how do they know I won't be the next La Stupenda? It is accepted in the trade that there are 'generosity groupings.' Single women tend not to give, especially to female performers. I find Asian and African men are fascinated by the opera and often dig deep into their pockets, while couples are either embarrassed by my amorous songs or feel threatened and suddenly find the tiled floor more interesting. Middle-aged businessmen will give to guitarists only rarely - there are simply too many strumming out the same tunes and these men are hardened Tube travellers. When together, however,they are eager to show their liberal-mindedness and appreciation of music (particularly if it is classical) and donate their change graciously to 'those poor students.' I must concede that some of my fellow-buskers harass passengers. Buskers who perform in the actual carriages often intimidate people into giving them money. These buskers may be dressed aggressively or have a 'bottler' with them - an accomplice who does the collecting. This is simply a form of mugging. Posters asking passengers not to support buskers have been put up but, unfortunately for entertainers like myself, they do not specify who are the buskers who entertain and who are the ones who intimidate. If the profession gets a bad name my take-home pay is reduced, so I would welcome harsher fines for these 'performers.' In other countries, the authorities seem to deal better with Underground players, often letting the generosity of the commuters decide their fate. In Moscow, where the subway is a tourist attraction, seven-piece jazz bands may be found in the station forecourts and the long underpasses. But although these attract large crowds, people's generosity is fading fast in the present political and economic climate. Regie Autonome de Transporte Parisian (RATP), the company which owns the Paris Metro, has legislated on busking, encouraging performers who entertain but clamping down on those who block passages and present safety hazards. Paris is the busking capital of the world and, because of increasing competition for prime 'pitches,' players must pass an audition with the Musicians' Union in order to receive an official pass. Buskers without one are moved on or arrested and may even have their instruments confiscated. Some may argue that Tube music cannot be avoided (and so imposes a social cost on passengers, adding to the rising cost of public transport), But rarely can a performer be heard on the platform. The passengers reserve the right not to show their appreciation. The irony of the situation is that London Underground Ltd believes it acceptable to play music through the public address system. If you have managed to persuade a wall in the station to accept your money and give you a ticket, and you have escaped the clutches of the automatic rottweilers (ie, the new ticket gates), the soothing tones of Italian opera or the breathtaking skill of three bongo drummers will reassure you that, whatever LUL thinks, you are a human being and not ticket-machine fodder.</p>

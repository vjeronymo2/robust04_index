			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview of Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs by Valdis </F> Bekeris: "`The Budget is the Nation's Policy in Figures...'"]    [Text]    [Bekeris] You agreed to this interview, Mr. Prime Minister,  a  few days after the Latvian government basketball team decisively  defeated a Lithuanian team of no lesser standing.    [Birkavs] Yes, this victory places upon us the  responsibility  of seriously preparing for the next meeting, for the Lithuanian  government anticipates holding this next sports meeting in  Kaunas, in the famous arena where the "Zalgiris" team normally  plays before five thousand spectators. In addition, the head of  the Lithuanian government said that they will now begin serious  training. If we are talking about the significance of the recent  game, then, it seems to me, it very much strengthened our  informal contacts with the Lithuanian government.    [Bekeris] How did you do personally in this game?    [Birkavs] I didn't even notice how quickly I received the  five personal fouls. But I had the honor of tossing in the  second and third baskets in the beginning. Then the [Economics  Minister Ojars] Kehris and [Internal Affairs Minister Girts]  Kristovskis offensive started.    [Bekeris] In your New Years speech, heard by all the people,  you picturesquely spoke of, cited, "the golden sands of the  economy, which will not pour into our own hands because they are  found in the bottom half of our hour glass. The structure of the  national economy must be turned to its proper position so that  the sands can pour into Latvia's granaries." The new year, as  they say, is moving along, but the old one leaves its own  legacy. What is that?    [Birkavs] Perhaps, examining it superficially, it appears  that nothing in particular is happening with the economy. But in  reality we already in the previous year have put in place and  also this year are putting into place, the foundation that will  will permit the economy to recover. Statistics indisputably show  that this process has begun. Of course, it has not been as rapid  as we would like, not as grand, and yet the volume of production  grows larger and the consumer price index confirms that this  recovery process also influences prices. In principle, the  process to a greater or lesser degree happens in accordance with  our projections. What sorts of tasks must the government  complete this year? We must reduce interest rates on loans,  although in regard to this a completely clear future is not  apparent. The privatization process must be sped up. I hope that  the package of bills will be adopted immediately. It will speed  up this process even more and provide the opportunity to  restructure production. That is why there is a basis for the  economic projection of five percent growth in total production.  That is a significant indicator, but it is "large" only because  we have "fallen greatly". This year Latvia will receive the most  investment in Eastern Europe: a total of $600 million. Other  investments will accompany this. The conditions which were  placed on all investments are skillful and economical  utilization of our local human resources and factories.  Therefore the determining factors for economic recovery are  investment, privatization, and a decline in borrower interest  rates. In the future they will be the steps that will turn the  structure of the economy in the right direction.    [Bekeris] The Saeima has passed on its first reading the  government's budget proposal. But if this proposal is thrown out  or derailed....    [Birkavs] Even the strongest structure can be derailed, but  this budget is still not the "strongest structure." It is only  balancing the fragile. In the course of discussions a whole  range of emphases appeared, quite essential supplements and also  new priorities, including defense policy, which require greater  financing than we had anticipated. Therefore everything depends  on how precisely we will be able to work these new demands into  the budget by the second reading. I do not think that it is  possible to improve the budget significantly. We have maximal%w  increased revenues, maximally sought to balance the budget's  social part with expenditures.... The vote on child subsidies  placed an immense supplemental load on the CM [Cabinet of  Ministers]. In fact it will not resolve the problems of the  "poorest," but more likely of the "most prosperous." Still, we  have found an option, putting forth an amendment to resolve this  problem. Indexing pensions also requires supplemental  expenditures. That is why we must carry out some very difficult  jobs by the second reading, and I hope that we will succeed in  establishing an economic structure which the Saeima will not be  able to destroy.    [Bekeris] Would the complete rejection of the budget  proposal  threaten the resignation of the government?    [Birkavs] I passed Mr. Kirsteins on my way back to my seat,  after I gave my "budget speech," which I closed by saying that  by not accepting it the Saeima invokes Article 7 of the Cabinet  of Ministers system: an expression of no confidence in the  government. Mr. Kirsteins said to me, "But that could not happen  on the first reading. We must wait for the second."    In essence we announced the budget policy with the first  reading. With the second reading of the budget, if it is amended  to the point that it no longer corresponds to government policy,  if it is "harmonized" so that it no longer corresponds to our  priorities, then I will simply resign. But it would be much  easier for me to resign, and I have emphasized it many times, if  our opposition had drafted an alternative budget. Then I would  have a clear conscience, for I would know who was coming after  me and with what sort of political outlook. Right now I will do  everything so that the budget is adopted and the government's  priorities are accepted, and therefore I will not resign. But,  if this budget is voted down, then, as I already said, Article 7  will go into effect and my "easy life" will begin.    [Bekeris] The previous government was not threatened with  this "easy life."    [Birkavs] No. In no way. We worked out that article  ourselves. The Cabinet of Ministers discussed this rule, for the  budget is the government's and the nation's policy in figures.    [Bekeris] What have been the consequences of the  "significant" new year's date, the events of 10 January? Did  Vidzeme borough council chairman Andrejs Rucs really cause a  crisis situation? And another related question about this  situation, which was predicted to have far-reaching  consequences: Why was Supreme Court chairman Gvido Zemribo the  first to react with his statement, rather than the government?    [Birkavs] I think the the government reaction was  sufficiently active, clear and unambiguous. I must say candidly  that the world has evaluated it positively. That is also  discernable from the side of Russia, for our bilateral  negotiations have not been interrupted. But still, we  encountered two impediments right after these events. That is  the Northwestern Army Group's declaration about shooting if  their installations are threatened, and Russian Foreign Minister  Kozyrev's declaration that the Baltic states belong within  "their" sphere of interest. Even if we ignore the later  retraction of this declaration, we must be extraordinarily  careful and capable in our actions. Our capacity for action  became clear even before Kozyrev's declaration: We announced  that national security is our priority number one. The actions  of Rucs were the catalyst and to a large extent laid bare the  situation. It threw us back considerably in our negotiations  with Russia, significantly limiting our ability to maneuver in  these negotiations. I must say that although Rucs demonstrated  completely apolitical action, it still expressed that popular  desire, to wit, that it is high time for the Russian army to  leave. There can be no more procrastinating, for the coatrack is  full and patience is almost at an end.    [Bekeris] The Vidzeme borough municipal deputies corps has  demanded that Rucs be allowed to return to his former position.    [Birkavs] I would not want to read tea leaves. Rubiks was  elected to the Saeima, Siegerist was elected. The viewpoint of  the public is a sacred thing. If there is no legal hurdle, of  course, Mr. Rucs will be able to return to his former post. But  I think that this event illuminates for us also the necessity  for regulating relations between municipalities and the  government more precisely, for until now the status of municipal  deputies has been higher than the status of Saeima deputies. If  a Saeima deputy has committed an offense, he can immediately be  detained, but municipal deputies may not be. I do not assume  that deputies are criminally inclined, but offenses as such  create an exclusive situation in which it is necessary to act.  This kind of situation must be precisely reflected in law.    [Bekeris] The Russian Foreign Minister's declaration has  been  heard throughout the world. After it was made the thoughts were  expressed that it was incorrectly understood and translated. Did  you perceive it in the same way?    [Birkavs] Nothing was misunderstood. That is Kozyrev's  style:  First to express himself very strongly, then to turn around  completely, see what the reaction will be, and after that to  say, 'I was not even thinking that.' Let's remember his  Stockholm speech. In essence it was a professional overture, how  far can Russia permit herself to go in her statements and  actions, especially after the meeting between Clinton and  Yeltsin. There were no misunderstandings or inadvertant word  games, but rather a deliberate action by Kozyrev to explain what  the reaction will be.    [Bekeris] What, in your opinion, is the status of the  Latvian  army? Can this force be viewed as a guarantor of national  security?    [Birkavs] The guarantor of Latvia's independence and  security  are the Latvian people themselves. The Army only carries out  certain functions in order to enforce this guarantee with  weapons in hand. Today (21 January) I had my regular meeting  with Defense Force leaders. We must seriously turn to defense  questions so that with minimal resources we can acquire a  maximally organized and battle ready defense system. People must  have faith in the army and must feel secure. I must admit that  until now we really have not addressed the army's problems--I  will not mince my words--we have neglected them. If security  becomes priority number one, then we must guarantee normal  supplies of weapons and ammunition for the army. But we cannot  become involved in some sort of arms race which would leave us  naked and impoverished. We must evaluate our options, but we  cannot pursue them at the cost of the educational, cultural or  social spheres.    [Bekeris] How has the situation with the intelligence  services developed? The veil of ignorance and secrecy  surrounding them gives rise to malicious rumors and gossip.    [Birkavs] The situation with the intelligence services is  unsatisfactory. I think that that will not continue for long.  The Cabinet of Ministers has prepared a restructuring program  for the intelligence services. The new order will bring all of  these systems into mutual harmony. Each worker will receive  precise, certain duties. Everything will be done so that the  country is better supplied with information, timely analysis and  everything else that is necessary for her security. The Cabinet  of Ministers adopted article 81 of the counter-intelligence  rules, which the Saeima did not accept. Therefore the government  will put forth an initiative asking that the Saeima accept them  on an urgent basis, for the rules heretofore do not satisfy me  personally.    [Bekeris] Will we soon be able to produce goods, both  manufactured and agricultural goods, marked "Made in Latvia" for  the world market and really ensure coverage of the lats? Right  now there is talk of a stable lats being an illusion,  emphasizing that the lats is competing with the dollar in an  uneven battle, unsuccessfully seeking to conquer stable foreign  currency.    [Birkavs] Latvian goods will never make it to the world  market if they are oriented only toward the Eastern market. On  the other hand, if these goods are oriented toward that sphere  which in which it is very difficult to compete right now, toward  the Western market, then they will always be able to compete in  Russia's market also. That is why, it seems to me, we must think  about what direction we want our economy moving in. We can go to  the Eastern market, renewing our old economic connections and  not especially renovating our technology. But let's take into  account that there is no foreign capital in Russia either, and  that that country too, with the free market regime Western goods  are flooding in. This market is large, and within it also there  stands a high capacity for competition. That is why it is better  to orient ourselves to the West, but always, knowing that we can  go to the East, it is not necessary to orient ourselves  completely to this market. As pertains to the illusory stability  of the lats.... Its actual stability will alway depend upon the  [central] bank's economic monetary policy connection with all  national economic policy. If monetary policy is just as isolated  from national economic policy as it has been until now, then the  stability of the lats may be threatened. But they may not  interfere in administrative undertakings; in this well  considered cooperation is essential.    [Bekeris] Did the rapid decline in production of  manufactured  goods and the accompanying unemployment, cause you to worry?    [Birkavs] Obviously the chief problem this year will be the  increase in unemployment and the accompanying expenditures for  retraining the unemployed. But it is better to invest money in  unemployment benefits and training than to maintain enterprises  which produce goods for warehouses and produce them for a higher  price than anywhere else in the world. As enterprises go  bankrupt and close the next action must immediately follow: New  jobs must be created. Toward this end either private companies  must take over the factories, or foreign investment must flood  in, or the appropriate state policy must be implemented with  investment. That is one of the heaviest issues which, I think,  we will be able to resolve positively this year; utilizing  domestic accumulation for investment. Currently we are chiefly  financing future technological projects on the basis of foreign  credits. Domestic investment reserves are small.    [Bekeris] The rate of inflation keeps going up. How long  will  that continue?    [Birkavs] Inflation has its own laws. After the introduction  of the turnover tax the anticipated increase in the rate of  inflation reached its maximum in December and November of last  year. Now the prognosis is stronger: the rate has a tendency to  slide downward. In relation to the increase in the turnover tax,  I made this prognosis precisely at that time; the talk was of  three or four months in which an increase in inflation was  inescapable, which would worsen the economic situation. Just as  inescapable is a further decrease in inflation and the  stabilization of the situation. The appropriate economic policy  is being maintained, as confirmed by international experience.    [Bekeris] The current bureaucracy is being critized. Under  the influence of the law on civil service a new, and, we must  hope, progressive and intelligent "bureaucratic apparatus" will  be established. What are your thoughts about that?    [Birkavs] An interesting phenomenon can be observed: They  strongly criticize the bureaucracy, but do not want to establish  a new bureaucracy. I undoubtedly evaluate positively the new  reform of the bureaucracy. That is one of our programmatic  assignements: to bring order to the bureaucracy and train them.  The new bureaucracy reform is receiving no small amount of  criticism, but I am satisfied to a certain extent because  currently the existing bureaucrats very fearful of these  changes. I think that no honorable or forward-looking bureaucrat  is afraid of the reform. I could argue over whether this  bureaucratuc reform must occur at such a fast tempo. But  bureaucracy is a basic element of every country's mechanism. It  is important that bureaucrats serve the public. Right now we are  all dissatisfied with the bureaucracy. That is why we should not  be stingy with work and resources in this area. I do not see a  different road. Right now many of the more capable and smarter  people are leaving the bureaucracy, going to work for private  companies. We cannot pay bureaucrats high salaries, but we can  compensate for this work with the greatest demands of the  bureaucracy, which are related to sufficient social guarantees.  Thousands of people want to work securely, not to feel  threatened, to serve the country, to serve the people. The law  on the bureaucracy is vitally essential.    [Bekeris] The current bureaucracy is connected with bribe  taking and bribe giving. I would like to mention another one of  your public pronouncements, when your were speaking of a  specific example of bribe giving. The state reform minister  Maris Gailis became a sacrifice to that. But by starting with  holding the bribe givers responsible, is not the corruption  problem being resolved from the wrong end? They say that if  there were no bribe takers, then bribe givers would not arise.  Of course the reaction of Maris Gailis was sharp and dignified,  as becomes a high-ranking official.    [Birkavs] Information about a person who takes bribes is  broadcast rather quickly. They give to those who take, but they  do not even make offers to those who do not take and they try to  find alternative ways around them. The needed information about  those "takers" disappear into the sand, for there is no one who  will point a finger, 'See, this official takes bribes.' And only  recently special operations have been carried out on the  borders, where customs agents were arrested for taking a $2,500  bribe, a concrete fact was demonstrated. Or in the Riga Central  Market, when several security police workers were arrested for  demanding bribes from illegal liquor sellers. Only when special  operations are conducted or preparing a special professional  provokation to catch a guilty one, then bribe givers or bribe  takers can possibly be caught. In corruption both parties, the  taker and the giver, are interested in hiding the crime. In  these crimes the so-called likelihood is the highest. There are  crimes in which both parties are interested in finding the  criminals, let's say murder. Representatives of state justice  protection services and the victim's loved ones are direclty  interested in rapid, operational investigation of the crime. You  will be more interested in the apprehension of a pickpocket if  you are one of the victims, for the state's interest in these  crimes is determined, if only because the police cannot cope  with all the pickpockets. But crimes in which both parties are  interested in hiding the transgression, such as bribe taking and  taking, are the most difficult to investigate. The battle  against corruption must be waged with special actions; those who  carry it out must be given special rights and assignments.    [Bekeris] Are you still leading the Jurists Association of  Latvia?    [Birkavs] Still. Although I have passed down my authority  and  given it over to the association's four vice presidents. But I  have remained in this post formally and just recently I attended  the association's five year anniversary party. I also  participate in the association's council meetings. The  Association of Lawyers is helping me greatly in terms of  implementing the judicial reform by providing me with specific  proposals.    [Bekeris] Doesn't the decreased financing of the justice  system threaten their independence, and perhaps for that very  reason it is difficult for it to lose its political coloring, to  better carry out juridical, that is law enforcement duties?    [Birkavs] I do not want to agree that the justice system is  melting away on account of financing. This year to this end we  developed a financial foundation. Last year I personally  obtained a salary increase for judges, which, because of  inflation, unfortunately, was ineffective. Salaries in the  procuracy were also increased, but we must acknowledge that it  has all been insufficient. Now we are ensuring a judicial reform  with a financial basis. Have the courts been politicized? In my  opinion, this time has already receded into the past. Judges  and, I hope, also all the other justice system institutions are  depoliticized in point of fact.    [Bekeris] What sort of evaluation could you make as a lawyer  of the actions of Justice Minister [Egils] Levits, when in his  institution, in reducing its status, he nevertheless was forced,  by a legal order, to rehire the laid-off workers into their  previous posts?    [Birkavs] The answer to your previous question is hiding  here. Notwithstanding that this was the Justice Minister, the  court rehired the laid-off workers. This affair could also have  been "approached politically." The court fulfilled its duty to  the blind goddess of justice.    [Bekeris] How do you assess the activities of emigre  Latvians  who have returned to their homeland to work in responsible posts  in the Latvian state?    [Birkavs] There can be no general analysis. All of the  emigre  Latvians cannot be measured on one criterion. Mr. Siegerist is  also Latvian by ancestory. Everbody is different, more or less  professional in their actions, every one of them has made their  own path in life. And I think that they enrich our lives to a  large extent with their worldly experience. I would not want to  say that they are not needed here. These are people who are  developing into a part of our people, who are Latvians just like  us, only with a different education and life's experience. I  would not permit myself to judge any of them as higher or lower.  Under no circumstances would I distinguish the emigres over our  own folks, who lived for so long "in the Soviet regime," or vice  versa: distinguishing "our own" above "them." Everyone has their  own individual shortcomings, pluses and minuses. In my opinion  if someone is irresponsible in his position, then he must be  relieved. A local can be just as irresponsible in his assigned  post as can be an emigre Latvian.    [Bekeris] Still, the emigres do not have our real life  insights.    [Birkavs] Of course. But now that they have arrived in the  homeland they are beginning to have better insights, they are  running into the same negations with which we "locals" grapple.  But the fact that they perceive it differently enriches our  mutual insights.    [Bekeris] What is your view of adoption of the citizenship  law? Isn't it a sort of a frontier barrier, a trench which we  move away and move away, fearing to take the fateful leap, for  we might blunder, break a leg or, in the worst case, even the  backbone?    [Birkavs] Your comparison is truly unique and graphic. Also  not without basis. This jump could have been made long ago,  without fear of anything. I had hoped that this law would be  adopted last year. I still think that worries and the many  arguments have a strong basis, for the talk is not merely of  citizenship, but also about the fate of the nation. Two  classical approaches are evident. The radical position, which is  dominated by the survival and protection of the nation, and the  second position, which is dominated by the development of the  nation. This approach can be characterized by the prohibition,  that nothing should be adopted. Or also that this law should be  maximally narrowed. Truth is to be foundin the unification of  the principles of national survival and national development.  Now the first step has already been taken, to be followed by the  second, third and fourth. Obviously there will be a referendum.    [Bekeris] Do contacts between the Prime Minister and the  President continue to be good? Mr. Ulmanis emphasized the  significance of understanding in his New Year's interview with  RIGAS BALSS.    [Birkavs] I think that we have an understanding. In my view  the chief assignment from my side is to ensure stability.  Understanding from one side, stability from the other; that  would the most important thing.    [Bekeris] Does your mutual relationship also include  arguments?    [Birkavs] I haven't noticed any real arguments. But, taking  into account that the institution of the Presidency is renewed  and new, on many ocassions there arises the necessity to meet,  not to resolve misunderstandings, but to make more precise our  actions in conformance with the Constitution. We each see common  goals from our own positions. Here arises that prerogative, if  the President emphasizes a question of understanding, then I, as  the Prime Minister, with the executive agencies must ensure this  understanding.    [Bekeris] How do you evaluate the press? What is your  attitude toward "angry" journalists, who often are accused also  of destructive activities?    [Birkavs] I think that words must be free, but words may not  destroy the state. And, if this boundary is transgressed, then I  would like to work very actively.    [Bekeris] And again, Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to  hold  you to your words, which you have spoken publicly. Specifically,  that journalist who is able to offend you in the press will be  granted an award from your personal salary. Does this promise  provide proof of the distinguished self-critical abilities, or  also do you as a person feel that your unconqerable sense of  humor is being trampled down?    [Birkavs] My colleagues warned me that journalists may now  begin a contest to make me look as black as they can. But I bear  no ill will either toward people or journalists. I assess people  according to their material qualities and according to what  orients them. If people are oriented toward evil, then action  must be taken. If people are writing malicious things because of  lack of understanding, then we must talk to them and explain  things. If they are mistaken, then they must be forgiven. But,  if they, in doing their jobs, strive and make my nose appear  bigger than it is, then that is really nothing, so why should I  be angry with it?    [Bekeris] How do you evaluate the judicial process, where we  have cases of insulting honor and reputation, and the  publication is the defendant?    [Birkavs] The most recent information I have received is  that  the journalist Gailums was fined 1,000 lats. I thought to  myself, first of all, where will Gailums get that kind of money?  And the second thing that came to mind, doesn't this judgment  muzzle journalists? And such a situation could be much more  significant than the material difficulties that have been  applied to Gailums. We must establish normal relations between  the press and the courts. That is a fine matter. The freedom of  the press is absolutely necessary in a normal country. There are  a few signals that bother me a bit. What is the journalists own  responsibilities regarding the information he disseminates? For  what and where should be held responsible? Those are the nuances  which in conditions of a lasting free press are polished  filigree, but we have not done that.    As we end our discussion, I will use the opportunity in this  first month of the new year to wish the readers of RIGAS BALSS  that they not lose their optimism, for optimism is the  foundation.    [Bekeris] Thank you.</p>

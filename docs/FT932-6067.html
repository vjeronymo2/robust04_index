			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: To Paradise in the limousine lane - Private View WE SAT on the bishop's well-trimmed lawn discussing camels and needles while the birds trilled away in the evening sun. The three English counties which make up the Anglican diocese of Oxford contain more rich people than any other part of Europe, said the bishop, adding sadly: 'We see very few of these people in church.' Perhaps they would come to church if the Church told them more plainly what their obligations were, I said. 'Well, I mean, that may be so. Maybe we have failed in some way.' Richard Harries, bishop of Oxford, is a decent sort, a product of Wellington College, Sandhurst and Cambridge. He is a well-dressed, good-looking theologian who has defended the nuclear deterrent and attacked the Church of England's investment policy. His latest book is called Is There a Gospel for the Rich?. Reviewers found it scholarly, but bland. Is it harder for the rich to get to heaven? Or was Jesus exaggerating? 'Yes, it's certainly hard. Even allowing for what they call Oriental hyperbole, Jesus clearly thought it was difficult and I think there is a difficulty, yes.' What is the difficulty? 'First of all, wealth can lead to complacency and self-satisfaction. I take it that at the heart of healthy religion is a sense of gratitude, as Wordsworth once said. Secondly, I think that wealth can cocoon one from the harsh reality in which so many people live their lives. The classic parable of course is the one of Dives and Lazarus.' Wealth and possessions could become a psychological trap, he continued, which was why the poor were often more generous than the rich. He recounted the story of a fellow-bishop whose parishioner, an heiress, kept complaining of financial hardship and reducing her covenant to the church. 'He realised it was a spiritual problem and brought it home to her that she was in the grip of her money. He persuaded her to give away a very substantial amount in order to find some inner liberation - and it really worked.' During the 1980s it became fashionable for some churchmen, encouraged by Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher and her adviser Brian (now Lord) Griffiths, to quote the more tolerant Judaic tradition in order to 'affirm' capitalist wealth-creation for Christians. Why, they argued, should bankers and bond traders not feel members of God's elect? The bishop takes a similar line. 'In the Old Testament it is quite clear that God's purpose is that human society should prosper . . . the corn, the wine, the oil. It's interesting that Jewish people have a rather less complex and less tortured attitude to wealth. They regard it as a good thing and many of them are extraordinarily generous.' Yes, I said, because they have strict rules about giving it away. 'They do. Jewish people will say it's good to make money, and it's even better to give a lot away.' But Jesus didn't say that. 'No. Jesus brought in all these complicating features like 'blessed are the poor' or 'blessed are the poor in spirit'. All I'm saying is that we need to take Jesus' sayings against the background of the Old Testament. I mean, he was a Jew, and of his time.' I thought the bishop was going to say we should take Jesus' sayings against the background of modern mixed-economy capitalism. I asked him whether the fashion for 'affirming' wealth-creators had not muddied the church's teaching. 'The church still has a lot to do to underline the importance of business. It still has very negative view.' But why should the church need to underline the importance of business in the first place? 'Because we all depend on business one way or another; the whole of society does. Secondly, many Christian people are working in the financial and commercial worlds and unless they can see their vocation as having some kind of legitimacy what on earth are they doing there?' You can choose not to be in the City making a dubious turn, I said. 'Some people are drawn to the financial sector. If it is necessary to the working of a modern economy it may be that people find a perfectly proper legitimate vocation in that field.' The church's ban on usury was due to a misreading of scripture, he added. 'Originally it was a ban on loading the poor with debt. This is vitally relevant today in relation to Third World debt. It doesn't apply in a modern market economy, where there is lending between financial equals. 'My worry from the church's point of view is that so many people are schizophrenic. They confine their values to the domestic sphere and personal relationships. They get into the world of work and are not sure how to feel about it.' In short, Richard Harries says you can be poor in spirit if you cannot bear to be poor in fact. 'People should open up their moral bankruptcy, their spiritual need.' So they can still drive a Rolls-Royce? 'Well . . . ' He hunted for an answer. 'They can begin to grasp what the gospel is about even driving a Rolls-Royce. As they begin to imbibe the gospel more deeply, they come to question a very great deal of their lifestyle and perhaps their political commitments. 'I mean,' he added cheerfully, 'there's nothing wrong with a Rolls-Royce. It is an extremely finely-made car and I don't think Jesus was opposed to quality. Jesus liked well-made things.' He quoted the story of Zacchaeus the tax-collector who had volunteered to repay those he had defrauded and had given away half his assets. 'If then Zacchaeus had kept his Rolls-Royce I do not see Jesus blaming him', the bishop said. But he told another rich man to sell all, give to the poor and follow him, I said. That seems pretty explicit. 'Certainly some people feel they are directly addressed by that and they become monks and nuns . . .' You mean it's not an obligation? 'I feel all Christian people should quite properly be troubled by that statement. How does it impinge upon us? What does it really mean today? And the answer I give is a kind of inner spiritual poverty. But I go on to say it does mean some real solidarity with people who are powerless and vulnerable in the world.' Why are you afraid to say that everyone should make the supreme sacrifice, or get as close as they can to it? 'I'm not saying we shouldn't get close to it. We do believe we ought to give away a percentage of our money: the Bible teaches a tenth - and that does not include taxes. 'That in itself is a salutary discipline. The Church of England is only just beginning to wake up to this. We've lived on inherited endowments so long: the fact that the Church is short of money is forcing us to look again at our Christian commitment.' Do you give money away? 'I try to, yes. I try to practise the Christian discipline of the tithing.' (The bishop is paid about Pounds 23,000 a year in addition to his rent-free house and expenses). What do you do when you meet beggars on the street? 'I don't believe in giving to most of the people one meets because most of them are . . . alcoholics and so on. No, I try to give through covenants - not to beggars because I don't think they should be encouraged to be there. It's better to support projects.' After giving his tithe, the rich man's next step should be to make sure the rest of his wealth was constructively employed, perhaps in creative risk-taking, 'not hoarded for comfort and aggrandisement.' Which rules out the Rolls-Royce, I said. 'Not necessarily. I am less interested whether a person has one Rolls-Royce or two than what they are doing overall with their life.' Why won't you say a Rolls-Royce is just not on for a good Christian? 'What we haven't touched on is the political issues. Suppose you have somebody with a Rolls-Royce but whose life is dedicated to good causes and who works in order to better the lot of poor people in this country and abroad.' (Was he thinking of the Princess Royal?). 'I'd far rather have that kind of person than one who rode around in a second-hand car and did nothing else. 'One of the great jumps that wealthy people have to take is to recognise that although they themselves may benefit from certain political and economic policies they may have not only to vote but also work for other policies.' So millionaires should vote Labour, by and large? 'Millionaires should always test every policy by the question: what will the effect of this be upon the poorest and most vulnerable members of society? The point about the rich is that they have power, they have influence, they can get things done. That's what matters. Wealth really is secondary to power. So I'm concerned with how they are using their power and influence.' Is the answer to the question on your book's front cover Yes or No? 'The short answer must be Yes. There is a gospel for the rich.' What does it mean to say that? 'The word 'gospel' means good news. There is good news for the rich.' And the good news is they can get through the eye of the needle? 'The good news must be that there is God, that there is a wise and loving power behind this universe . . .' Surely that's good news for everybody. 'But the rich also need to hear this good news, because a lot of the teaching of the gospel seems to be rather bad news for the rich, doesn't it? So there is a spiritual message, but there is also a very great challenge. I don't think you can hear the good news without hearing the challenge.' If he took up the challenge, I observed, a rich man might well get to heaven faster than a poor one. 'Well, getting to heaven depends on the grace of God, not on one's own merits. But I entirely agree that you do have opportunities for doing good which may not be open to other people. 'My position, which would be sharply differentiated from a number of other Christians', does have an inescapable political dimension. My worry is the pietism which accepts the status quo.' By stressing the political obligations of the rich, the bishop of Oxford puts himself at odds with Conservatives who say the church should keep its nose out of social policy. I asked him: was that why you didn't get to Canterbury? 'I didn't want to get to Canterbury,' he laughed, almost convincingly. Is There a Gospel for the Rich?; Mowbray, 1992. Now in paperback.</p>

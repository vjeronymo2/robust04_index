The five-tongue programs take up eight hours a day. They  include the languages of the Dai nationality in Dehong  Prefecture and Xishuangbanna Prefecture, Jingpo nationality,  Lahu nationality and Lisu nationality.    Yunnan Province has 25 minority nationalities, with 12.34  million people, accounting for one third of the total population.    Since the 1970s, the minority nationalities in Yunnan  Province have come to realize the connection between raising the  quality of life and carrying out family planning policies.    According to the fourth national census in 1990, in the  eight  years from 1982 to 1990, the growth rate of the minority  nationalities in the country was 34.8 percent, but the rate in  Yunnan Province was about 19.6 percent.    Dong Xiuying, a chief editor at the Department of Minority  Nationalities of Yunnan broadcasting station, who is herself  from the minority Va nationality, said that many of the ethnic  people do not understand the Han language and it was necessary  to start broadcasting these programs in their own languages.    There are eight autonomous prefectures of minority  nationalities in Yunnan. The broadcasting stations in four of  the prefectures, including Dehong, Xishuangbanna, Nujiang and  Diqing, also started ethnic language programs.</p>

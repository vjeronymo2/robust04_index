			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / India to offer foreign stakes in state groups The Indian government has announced partial disinvestment in seven state undertakings, including two oil groups and a telephone services company, as part of its continuing disinvestment programme. This will allow foreign investors to bid for shares in public-sector enterprises for the first time. Private companies, banks, financial institutions, mutual funds and registered brokers have been invited to bid for equity ranging from 2 to 20 per cent in some of India's leading public-sector companies. Indian Oil Corporation, which owns six petroleum refineries and has a 3,850km pipeline network to distribute its petroleum products, will disinvest 5 per cent of its capital, or 18.4m shares. The cash-rich Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, which has had a monopoly of oil exploration and drilling in India for decades, will disinvest 2 per cent of its capital. Five per cent or 30m shares of Mahanagar Telephone Nigam, which controls telecommunications services in Bombay and Delhi, 5 per cent or 199.3m shares of the Steel Authority of India, which owns four integrated steel plants, 10 per cent or 28.2m shares of the Shipping Corporation of India, 20 per cent or 12.9m shares of the Container Corporation of India and 10 per cent or 49.1m shares of National Fertilisers would also be on offer. A government notification said sealed tenders for the purchase of shares for a minimum amount of Rs25,000 (Pounds 500) would be accepted by the Department of Public Enterprises in the Industries Ministry between October 5 and 17. Earlier rounds of disinvestment have had limits of Rs20m for minimum bids, deterring potential bidders. Foreign institutional investors permitted by the Securities and Exchange Board of India to buy and sell shares in India will be eligible to bid, provided they fulfil conditions of purchase and ownership stipulated by the Securities Board. Non-resident Indians and overseas corporate bodies are also eligible to apply. The government plans to disinvest up to 49 per cent of state-owned enterprises, and is doing so in phases, hoping to raise Rs40bn (Pounds 800m) in 1994-95. It raised Rs72.4bn in six rounds of disinvestment of public-sector companies between April 1991 and March 1994.</p>

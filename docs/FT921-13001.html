			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Agreed Pounds 5m offer for Trevian TREVIAN Holdings, the USM-quoted property investment, development and trading group, has recommended an offer from fellow property group Frogmore Estates. The bid follows the sale by Mr Lewis Davis, Trevian managing director, of his 12.9 per cent holding to Frogmore, which as a result owns 42 per cent of Trevian. Frogmore is offering 45p cash for each of the outstanding shares, thereby valuing the company at about Pounds 4.95m. Mr Lewis yesterday resigned from the boards of Trevian, its subsidiaries and its associates. The offer represents a premium of about 12.5 per cent over the mid-market quotation of ordinary shares at the close of business on Tuesday. Trevian's shares yesterday closed up 3p at 43p while Frogmore finished down 2p at 320p. Trevian also reported pre-tax losses reduced to Pounds 341,000 (Pounds 423,000) in the six months to October 5. This figure incorporated provisions against certain trading properties. Turnover rose to Pounds 490,000 (Pounds 410,000) and losses per share were cut to 3.6p (4.1p).</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / International Company News: TWA may swap debt for cash TWA, the heavily-borrowed carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn, said yesterday that 'it is exploring the possibility of a cash tender offer for its debt' next week, writes Nikki Tait. The company declined to be more specific about what debt - some of which is traded publicly, and some of which is owned by Mr Icahn himself - it might try to buy, or how the current negotiations with debtholders and lessors over the possible restructuring of the group's parlous finances were progressing. Debtholders advisers, however, were sceptical of matters moving significantly within a week. There is, however, little doubt that any such offer would be at a very heavy discount to the face value of the debt. With suggestions circulating that TWA might offer 13.5 cents on the dollar for some issues, the airline's 12 per cent junior subordinated debentures due in 2001 rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 13 1/4 , while the issue due in 2008 gained Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 13 3/8 . TWA's announcement came shortly after the airline said that it had reached an 'interim agreement' with the union representing its machinists, under which TWA promised not to make any principal or interest payments to debtholders while the two sides negotiate. These labour talks, it claimed, could extend for 'several months'. TWA has defaulted on a variety of debt and long-term lease payments this year.</p>

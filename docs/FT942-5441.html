			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / International Company News: Dividends in sight at DG Bank The DG Bank, the central bank for Germany's 2,900 co-operative banks which has been restructuring since 1991, will be in a position to pay a dividend next year, according to Mr Bernd Thiemann, chief executive. Mr Thiemann said that 1994 should be seen as a bridge-year leading to a lasting improvement in the bank's profitability. The turnround could only be described as complete, he explained, when the bank was generating big enough profits to finance a pay-out to shareholders. That was unlikely to be until 1995, Mr Thiemann said, although profits for the parent bank during the current year were likely to be in the same order of magnitude as in 1993, when the bank made total operating profits of DM364m (Dollars 217.9m) before provisions for bad and doubtful debts. Group partial operating profits before provisions rose 7.2 per cent to DM1.18bn last year. In the first quarter of the current year, partial operating profits - excluding trading profits - were DM60m, slightly ahead of last year.</p>

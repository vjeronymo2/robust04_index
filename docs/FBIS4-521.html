			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Newswrap" program] </F>   [Text] The government has strongly condemned the  involvement of South Africans in the Angolan civil war. Foreign  Minister Pik Botha told Lillian Straubach that the situation  could endanger the country's international relations.    [Begin recording] [Botha] The government is in principle  against the recruitment of South Africans for participation in  war or conflict in other countries. There is no way that the  citizens of a country will not be associated with that country,  and very often with the government. That means that, without  the government having had the opportunity to decide what is in  its interests, in the country's interests, citizens are  recruited, and those citizens then participate in a conflict  within another country, between parties in that country, which  is that country's problem, and it naturally endangers relations.    [Straubach] Now is the government doing anything about this?  Can the government do anything about the situation?    [Botha] Yes, we issued, regularly, statements. I remember  quite a number of statements last year, and even the year  before, when we were accused of either, you know, acquiescing in  secret flights, supplying UNITA [National Union for the Total  Independence of Ango?a] with equipment and fuel. I remmember  what a lot of headaches we had to endure as a result of  suspicion that we were continuing to supply UNITA with arms and  equipment, fuel and ammunition. The matter was raised, at one  stage, by the Angolan representative to the United Nations, and  I had to do a lot of explaining, and my department called  together all the private sector aircraft companies in this  country, and instructed them and requested them not to engage in  any activity of that natu?e.    [Straubach] Now this bunch seems to be supporting the MPLA  [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola].    [Botha] Yes. We are even-handed. We are against  participation by South African citizens, or we are against the  use of South African territory for launching any activity in any  of the states surrounding us or, for that mattter, any other  state in the world with whom we have relations.

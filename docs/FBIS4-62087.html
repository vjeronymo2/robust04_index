			<p>BFN     [Text] The volume of currency interventions carried out by  the Central Bank of Russia during the first quarter of 1994 was  a little more than one billion dollars. This was announced to  the Financial Information Agency by sources in the Central Bank  of Russia today.    The same source said that initially the sum of currency  interventions by the bank had exceeded the total volume.  However, by the end of the quarter the Central Bank of Russia  bought back a part of the hard currency on the currency market.    Currently, the Central Bank of Russia is pursuing a  moderately tough policy aimed at lessening the fluctuations of  the dollar, the source pointed out. The same source suggested  that more energetic or decreased influence on the currency  market was determined mostly by economic reasons and the  exchange rate of the dollar.    In early 1994 the Central Bank of Russia officially stated  that during the first three weeks in January it had spent more  than one billion dollars for currency interventions. According  to the Central Bank of Russia, the total volume of its currency  resources sold on six Russian stock exchanges last year was 14.7  billion dollars (2.8 billion dollars in 1992). For late 1993  the resources of the Central Bank of Russia amounted to 4.4  billion dollars. At that moment the currency resources of  Russian commercial banks were put at 12 billion dollars.    Chairperson of the Central Bank of Russia, Viktor  Gerashchenko, announced during the parliamentary hearings in the  State Duma that the bank planned to increase its currency  resources from 4.5 billion dollars to 9.5 billion dollars by the  end of 1994. He stressed that the bank had begun to carry out  moderate interventions on currency market instead of the  intensive ones. Thus, the Central Bank of Russia intends to  lessen the difference between the inflation rate and the  exchange rate of the U.S. dollar on the stock exchanges.</p>

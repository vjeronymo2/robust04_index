			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (12): The debate hots up as sales rise - Motoring's growth stock in Britain in 1993 was unquestionably the diesel car Initial industry forecasts of 200,000 sales for diesel cars in the UK last year were rapidly overtaken by events. In the end, 340,500 diesel cars were registered for a market penetration of 19.1 per cent. But can the bull run in diesel cars continue? The answer is almost certainly 'yes' though the signs are confusing. In the first three months of this year diesels took 21 per cent of registrations. Yet in March one of the leading contract hire companies, Leasecontracts, made some feverish public statements that spoke of 'utter diesel madness' and forecast crashing residuals that would lead to 'terrible financial pain.' So who is right? The doomsters or the companies who continue to vote with their feet by telling employees - from junior rep to managing director - that in future, like it or not, they are going to have to drive diesel cars? It is fair to point out that similar doom-laden forecasts were made a year or two ago by people in the contract hire business whom one expected to know what they were talking about. They turned out to be totally unfounded. Expert forecasters were embarrassed. Technology has transformed the performance and refinement of today's diesel engined cars. Business motorists who reckon they are noisy, sluggish and smelly are either parading their prejudices or have never driven one. It is true that most diesel cars still sound a bit gruff when they are started up from cold. Once they are driven off, though, even a trained ear finds it difficult to tell the difference between the best of them and a petrol-engined car. The strongest cards in the diesel's suit have always been reliability (there is no electric ignition to go wrong) and economy (up to 30 per cent lower fuel consumption is achievable in real world driving conditions). They are still winning cards - but are diesels as environmentally friendly as their advocates claim? The cold, hard facts say they are actually cleaner than petrol cars with the most elaborate kind of exhaust catalyser. But logic has to struggle with emotion: when clapped-out urban buses and ill-maintained, often overloaded lorries are seen to be spewing out stinking smoke, diesel cars become tarred with the same brush. Flawed and superficial reports from bodies like Quarg (Quality of urban air review group) muddy the waters further. Earlier this year, Quarg expressed concern over the rapid growth in diesel car sales 'unless problems of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions are effectively addressed.' In fact, although diesel cars emit twice as much NOx as petrol cars when new, they then improve while petrol cars get worse. Over their entire working life, total NOx emissions are no different. On short journeys after cold starts, diesel cars produce one-tenth of an equivalent petrol engine's pollutants. And catalysers wear out or are damaged in service to a much greater extent than most motorists - and environmentalists - appreciate. Cowie Interleasing reported recently it had had to replace 75 catalysers on the relatively small number of cars so equipped in the large fleet it manages for corporate clients. Managing director Neill Pykett says the replacement rate for catalysers  - 'one of the modern motor car's most delicate and expensive components' - was 'unacceptably high.' Catalytic converters can shatter even in a low-impact collision and were liable to be damaged by driving too fast over a traffic 'hump' or mounting a kerb. But about 35 per cent fail 'for quite inexplicable reasons,' he says. One car manufacturer had advised Cowie Interleasing to make maintenance provision for one 'cat' replacement per vehicle per three-year contract. As they cost between Pounds 300 and Pounds 900, this could hit private motorists hard. It could also make the gloomy forecasts of a meltdown in diesel residuals look wide of the mark, if only because auction prices for three or four year old ex-fleet cars from about 1996-97 must reflect the cost of possibly imminent catalytic converter replacement. As for the diesel cars themselves, they simply improve all the time. The French PSA Group (Peugeot-Citroen) made the running for a number of years. Though its products - Citroen AX, ZX, Xantia and XM and Peugeot 106, 306, 405 and 605 - are as good as ever, they no longer enjoy a monopoly of excellence. PSA's 12-valve, 2.1-litre engine used in the Citroen XM and Peugeot 605 is about to be enlarged, which will give these large, comfortable and economical executive-class cars a mid-range performance boost without significantly increasing fuel consumption. The 2.1-litre unit would drop nicely into a Citroen Xantia because it is based on the same block as the 1.9-litre XUD engine. With automatic transmission, this could be the compact, elegant and high-performing diesel many a business motorist - whose employer's budget does not extend to a BMW or Mercedes - is waiting for. Mercedes-Benz offer super-smooth, four valves per cylinder diesels with four, five or six cylinders in the C-Class and E-Class. In power output they are outranked by BMW's superlative, in-line 6-cylinder diesels which come with turbo-charging and intercooling; the naturally aspirated Mercedes engines are stayers rather than sprinters. Vauxhall (Opel) buys smooth yet muscular four-cylinder turbo-diesels from its Isuzu associate and the new Omega diesels have in-line six-cylinder engines bought-in from BMW. These Omega diesel saloons and estates, which can be had in the most luxurious trim levels, with air conditioning and automatic transmission, will be pace-setters among executive diesels at down-to-earth prices. Before long, Rover, which currently buys four-cylinder engines from PSA for its smaller diesel cars, will be offering a diesel version of the 600 with the ultra-economical direct-injection engine, jointly developed with Perkins. Rover pioneered the direct-injection car diesel engine. Audi and Fiat have them too, though the Fiat DI is not sold in Britain. Other makers will be taking the direction-injection path to even better fuel economy than is offered by the indirect-injection engine. Injection equipment capable of delivering the very high pressures needed by the small, high-speed DI engine has been developed by Lucas and other suppliers and is now in volume production. So far, the Japanese manufacturers have been less enthusiastic about selling diesel cars on the UK market than their mainland European competitors. An interesting development is Mazda's decision to introduce a diesel version of the 626 to Britain with a belt-driven supercharger rather than the otherwise universal exhaust-gas driven turbocharger. The main benefit of belt-driven supercharging is that the extra power and torque is on tap at very low engine speeds, whereas a turbocharger does not have much effect on performance below about 2,000 rpm. The technique is well known; Opel had a supercharged diesel version of the Senator some years ago. It made the elderly and unrefined 2.3-litre engine much better, but not good enough to match the more sophisticated engines then available in Mercedes-Benz diesel cars. Mazda claims the 626 supercharged diesel goes exactly like a petrol car under all driving regimes. Competing manufacturers will be keeping a close watch on developments.</p>

Washington recently announced that it wants to gather Latin  American and Caribbean heads of state and government in the  second half of 1994. However, it has already suggested that  political considerations will be applied regarding who will  participate in this summit.    The conditions and the agenda for the meeting are still  unknown, although various spokespersons for the Clinton  Administration rushed to deny that Cuba was on the list of  participants which is being drafted by the State Department.    Cuban President Fidel Castro was the first one to criticize  this attitude during the closing recently of the Fourth Latin  American and Caribbean Conference. Many organizations and  prominent persons from Latin America and the Caribbean came to  Havana to attend this conference. They expressed their  solidarity with Cuba and rejected the U.S. blockade against this  nation.    Castro downplayed the validity of a meeting of this type  called by an outside power, which not only wants to decide the  details of the agenda but also veto the attendance of those  nations whose governments it dislikes.    Actually, according to local analysts, calling for a new  presidential summit appears increasingly as a plan to counter  the recognition obtained by Havana within the framework of the  meetings with Latin American heads of state and government held  during the past years and the obvious broadening of Cuban  relations with many countries in the region.    By trying to exclude Cuba, it is ignoring recognition  received by the island, improved relations between Cuba and  members of the Caribbean Common Market, and important votes  obtained in the United Nations against the isolation measures  promoted by the United States for the last 35 years.    Summarizing local criticisms, the newspaper GRANMA, which is  the official publication of the Cuban Communist Party Central  Committee, emphasized that Washington plans to hold the  so-called summit in Miami, home to the most aggressive  anti-Cuban organizations.    GRANMA says that if at this point the Yankees want to use  their "summit" against Cuba, they are too late and in bad shape.  All the unipolarity in the world could not achieve such a big  goal, one that is anachronistic as well as embarrassing.    In conclusion, the U.S. invitation remains the object of  rejection and criticism by those who view it as an attempt to  basically thwart the regional integration trend, which has made  serious progress in the current decade.</p>

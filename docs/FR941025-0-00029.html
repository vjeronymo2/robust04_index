			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since a situation exists that requires the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice and opportunity for public prior comment hereon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are impracticable, and that good cause exists for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Invited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although this action is in the form of a final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule that involves requirements affecting immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to comment, comments are invited on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule by submitting such written data, views, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arguments as they may desire. Communications should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triplicate to the address specified above. All  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communications received on or before the closing date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for comments will be considered, and this rule may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended in light of the comments received. Factual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information that supports the commenter's ideas and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional rulemaking action would be needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Comments are specifically invited on the overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. All comments submitted will be available, both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before and after the closing date for comments, in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report that summarizes each FAA-public contact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Rules Docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of their comments submitted in response to this notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must submit a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;21&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The regulations adopted herein will not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial direct effects on the States, on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship between the national government and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, or on the distribution of power and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities among the various levels of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The FAA has determined that this regulation is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency regulation and that must be issued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this action involves an emergency regulation under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency regulation otherwise would be significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Rules Docket (otherwise, an evaluation is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required). A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the Rules Docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

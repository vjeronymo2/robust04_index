			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mutsuki Kato, minister of agriculture, </F> forestry, and fisheries, by unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN  correspondent; place and date not given; from the "Interview  With Hata Cabinet Members in Charge of Economic Matters" series;  one of two interviews comprising second part of series: "Public  Debate on Rice Prices"]    [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Following the recent uproar  over rice, the people have intensified their criticism of the  current food control system.    [Kato] But I think the food control system helped settle the  confusion at an early date. It seems the concept of staple food  is not common in the United States and European countries. I  think it is Japan's characteristic concept. The recent uproar  was the event which made us reaffirm the importance of a stable  supply of rice. Because rice is storable, I would like to  promote arguments about storing rice from now on.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] When you were farm minister in 1986,  you asserted that the essence of the food control system be  maintained.    [Kato] I would like to back down a little from that position  and say the basis of the food control system should be  maintained. Japan has accepted minimum access of rice (minimum  import quota); as such, we do not say no to everything. I will  think things over by taking a different position from that which  I took before.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you mean you will promote reform  of the food control system?    [Kato] I would like to promote agricultural administration  in such a way that it benefits the people. On the other hand, I  have to consider two issues, which are, ensuring a stable food  supply and heightening farmers' will to farm. We are now in  difficult times, far more difficult than when I was farm  minister before. Also, because the Hata cabinet is a minority  government, it is certain to have tough times.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What is your opinion about rice  prices?    [Kato] The government-purchased rice is priced at 300,000  yen per ton, while Thai-grown rice is sold at about 40,000 to  60,000 yen in Thailand. Because the people now eat  foreign-grown rice, they know about this. The government needs  to discuss rice prices with the people, while taking into  consideration rice growers and agricultural organizations.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you not think the imported rice  sold in Japan is high priced?    [Kato] Certainly, it is priced a little high. But because  the government imported rice as an emergency measure to fill the  shortage of rice caused by a poor crop at home, high prices are  inevitable.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Is it possible to reduce the price of  rice, which is to be imported next year and beyond, in  accordance with the minimum access agreement?    [Kato] This is a difficult issue. We will have in-depth  discussions on this issue.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There are many farmers who sell their  rice on the black market, where rice is traded at high prices.    [Kato] They should think about how long the current high  prices will be maintained. In the near future, the rice crop  will be average. I hope farmers will realize this.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The Hata cabinet backed by a minority  ruling coalition will have to have the Uruguay Round agreement  ratified by the Diet this autumn.    [Kato] We intend to have the agreement ratified by all  means. This issue concerns Japan's role in the international  community. Diet members will be asked to act sensibly, and not  be bound by their positions as ruling and opposition parties.</p>

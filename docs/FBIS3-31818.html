			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Sixth and final installment of Foreign Minister Josef </F> Moravcik's "Report on the Fulfillment of Tasks of the Slovak  Republic's Foreign Policy" presented to the Slovak parliament on  2 February: "Slovakia in the World"]    [Text]  <H5>  4.3 Sphere of Human Rights and Minorities </H5>   In the very first months of its existence, the Slovak  Republic avowed its allegiance to documents, by which the CSFR  had been bound, and resolved the issue of continuity of its  commitments by means of succession to international treaties  dealing with human rights issues on UN premises. We accept the  highest standard achieved, consisting in the right of the  individual to submit a complaint against his own state for the  violation of a right laid down in a contractual document  (Optional Protocol to the Pact of Political and Civic Rights).    The most significant event of the year 1993 was the World  Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, which was attended by a  delegation of the Slovak Republic headed by President Michal  Kovac. The conference confirmed the principles of the  universality and indivisibility of human rights. The Slovak  Republic, like other democratic states, endorsed the idea of  establishing the post of High Commissioner for Human Rights  under the UN. The range of duties entrusted to the newly formed  UN office will be highly important. The Slovak Republic will  participate in the formulation of documents associated with this  office.    The activity of the Slovak Republic in UN bodies rested in  its participation in codifying work. The draft Optional  Protocol to the Convention on Torture Prevention is being  prepared at present. The participation of the Slovak Republic  in the work of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva and of the  Third Committee of the UN General Assembly also plays an  irreplaceable role. It is important from the viewpoint of  making the Slovak Republic more visible on UN premises that the  aforesaid Third Committee is chaired by a representative of the  Slovak Republic. Improved cooperation with the UN and promotion  of human rights are also expected from the [UN] Center for Human  Rights [to be opened] in Bratislava.    In the course of the World Conference on Human Rights, a  seminar was organized in Bratislava on the initiative of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic, in  cooperation with the Ministry of Justice of the Slovak Republic,  on the role and tasks of national centers for human rights. The  seminar was attended by delegates to the World Conference on  Human Rights.    Of exceptional importance for the young Slovak Republic was  its admission to the Council of Europe, the basic criterion of  which is respect for human rights. A prerequisite for acquiring  Council of Europe membership is the signing of the European  Human Rights Convention, which, owing to its control mechanism,  represents today the most progressive system of human rights  protection. The Slovak Republic at the same time accepted the  authority of the European Commission for Human Rights to receive  complaints from individuals and the jurisdiction of the European  Court for Human Rights. In connection with our Council of Europe  membership, a number of new tasks has arisen -- the  harmonization of the legal system of the Slovak Republic with  the European Human Rights Convention and supplementary  protocols, the gradual accession to conventions concluded on  Council of Europe premises (of which there are about 150), and  participation in codifying work (work is currently being wound  up on the 11th supplementary protocol, which deals with the  reform of the control mechanism). Another important task is to  establish the office of the Slovak Republic's legal  representative (agent) in proceedings before the European  Commission and the European Court for Human Rights. In  connection with these new tasks, the Slovak Republic adopted a  specific timetable of work, which is being adhered to. The  Slovak Republic also has its representatives in the European  Commission and the European Court for Human Rights.    Another important international forum that is devoted to  human rights and where the Slovak Republic presents its  positions is the CSCE. Within the framework of CSCE seminars on  the human dimension, the Slovak Republic took an active part in  discussions and exchanges of views with the aim of providing an  accurate picture of the state of human rights observance in the  Slovak Republic. Continuation in this active participation  should forestall in the future the dissemination of evaluations,  based on unverified facts, such as the report prepared by the  U.S. Congress Helsinki Commission. The Slovak Republic supports  a coordinated and cooperative course of action by the CSCE, the  Council of Europe, and the United Nations with a view to  preventing duplicity and negative rivalry in the sphere of the  human dimension. It welcomes recent activities by the highest  representatives of the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and the  United Nations aimed at the institutionalization and  formalization of this cooperation. It is also possible to  assess as positive the Slovak Republic's cooperation with the  CSCE High Commissioner for Ethnic Minorities.    The issue of protecting the rights of ethnic minorities,  which has recently moved into the foreground of attention of the  international community in the United Nations, the CSCE, and the  Council of Europe, is a chapter in itself. This manifested  itself fully during the admission of the Slovak Republic into  the Council of Europe when the attention of Council of Europe  Parliamentary Assembly reporters focused on the Slovak  Republic's minority policy, which resulted in clearly formulated  recommendations. These recommendations are being gradually met  by the Slovak Republic. Another important task was  participation by Slovak Republic experts in the preparation of  legally binding documents dealing with the protection of rights  of members of ethnic minorities. In view of the newly adopted  procedure for monitoring new Council of Europe member states'  compliance with their commitments, a mission by Council of  Europe Parliamentary Assembly reporters took place toward the  end of 1993. It will be necessary to evaluate the results of  this mission and to adopt the appropriate measures if necessary.    A serious problem of our foreign policy that has become  clearly crystallized in the first year of the Slovak Republic's  existence [as an independent state] lies in the Hungarian  Republic's approach to the minority issue. With varied success,  the Hungarian Republic casts doubt on the minority policy of the  Slovak Republic. This is also contributed to by the Slovak  Republic's frequently uncoordinated course of action and the  inability to present to the international public the fact that  minorities in the Slovak Republic have had, and continue to  have, rights going beyond the framework of the relevant  international documents, such as the CSCE document of  Copenhagen. As a result, our position last year was rather  defensive and, instead of launching our own activities, we more  often reacted to external prodding.    At the beginning of the year, negotiations started on the  premises of the Central European Initiative on a document on the  protection of ethnic minority rights. From both the formal  viewpoint and from the viewpoint of its contents, the text of  the aforementioned document was from the beginning unacceptable  to the Slovak Republic. Representatives of the Slovak Republic  had to spend much effort to achieve that, by means of  negotiations, the document gradually assumed a shape that was  acceptable to the Slovak Republic.    In the period under review, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  cooperated also with other government departments. This  cooperation was assisted also by the formation of a new  independent section dealing exclusively with the issue of human  and minority rights.  <H5>  4.4 Sphere of Migration and the Refugee Problem </H5>   From the very start of its independent existence, the Slovak  Republic has been paying great attention to the migration issue,  which has come to the foreground recently throughout Europe.  This arises from the geographic location of the Slovak Republic  as a country of transit. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the  Slovak Republic participated in the implementation of many  projects in this area, in cooperation with other Slovak  Government ministries. In November 1993 the Slovak Government  approved the "Principles of Migration Policy of the Slovak  Republic," which are binding also for the newly established  Migration Office operating under the Slovak Ministry of  Interior. A total of 2,483 persons, most of them from  ex-Yugoslavia, are currently in the care of this office. In  1993 247 ethnic Slovaks from the Chernobyl area were resettled  to Slovakia.    The Slovak Republic obtained the status of observer in the  International Organization for Migration (IOM), retroactively  from 1 January 1993. The Slovak side has demonstrated its  interest in involvement in the project of monitoring migration  in Central and Eastern Europe (MIU) [expansion unknown]. In  October 1993 the Migration Department of the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs of the Slovak Republic organized a visit by an IOM  mission to the Slovak Republic. Working negotiations aimed at  evaluating the migration situation on the territory of the  Slovak Republic were held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of  the Slovak Republic and at the Ministry of Interior of the  Slovak Republic and an agreement on specific cooperation within  the framework of the Migration Information Program and in the  area of training and educational programs and seminars was  reached. The Slovak Republic expressed its interest in becoming  an IOM member state. The draft of an agreement on cooperation  between the IOM and the Slovak Government was presented to the  Slovak side, which comprises the agreed areas of cooperation and  assistance to the Slovak Republic, as well as the opening of an  IOM branch in the Slovak Republic.    Within the framework of activities carried out in the  Council of Europe with regard to migration, the Slovak Republic  participated in several meetings of working groups set up on the  basis of the so-called Vienna process, which is at present the  only discussion forum for countries most severely affected by  the migration problem in the East-West context.    Cooperation with the leadership of the CDMG -- the Council  of  Europe's European Committee for Migration -- also started to  successfully develop in 1993. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs  of the Slovak Republic participates in the implementation of  many projects, in cooperation with other Slovak Government  departments. A delegation of the Slovak Republic also took part  in a meeting of CAHAR -- the ad hoc committee of experts on the  legal aspects of territorial asylum, refugees, and stateless  persons.    Within the framework of activity of the Central European  Initiative, a meeting of the Central European Initiative Working  Group for Migration took place in June 1993, in which the Slovak  Republic participated.    The activity of Slovak humanitarian and charity  organizations  (Slovak Red Cross, SHR [Slovak Humanitarian Council], Slovak  Catholic Charity) in the period under review can be assessed as  highly positive. Most shipments were sent to the republics of  former Yugoslavia, Romania, and the Commonwealth of Independent  States. The Slovak Republic also arranged the recreational stay  of children from Chernobyl on its territory.    With regard to the refugee problem, the Slovak Republic  secured its succession to international contractual documents  pertaining to the status of refugees (Geneva Convention of 1951  and New York Protocol of 1967). Right at the beginning of the  year 1993 the Slovak Republic established close contacts with  the Geneva headquarters of the United Nations High Commissioner  for Refugees (UNHCR), a result of which was the opening of an  UNHCR branch in Bratislava in April 1993. The founding of this  branch helped to deal with the problems of refugees on the  territory of the Slovak Republic, especially by organizing  training courses and seminars based on international experience  in this area, including a solution to the problem of the  refugees' legal protection. The UNHCR has presented to the  Slovak Republic the draft of an agreement on cooperation between  the UNHCR and the Government of the Slovak Republic, which will  be assessed at a government meeting.    The most important activity with regard to the refugee  problem was the Slovak Republic's participation in the 44th  session of the UNHCR Executive Committee Program in Geneva  (October 1993). Within the framework of this session, a working  meeting took place with Mr. J. Horekens, the new director of the  UNHCR European Office and an agreement was reached on  cooperation in drafting projects of assistance to the Slovak  Republic and in accessing the UNHCR data bases. The offer was  also extended to us to receive Slovak trainees in the UNHCR  headquarters. At this session the Slovak Republic acquired the  status of observer, which will allow it to participate in  meetings of subcommittees and in other informal sessions of the  UNHCR Executive Committee.    Overall, it is possible to state that the Slovak Republic's  cooperation with international organizations dealing with the  migration and refugee issues brought satisfactory results in  1993 and has achieved a high standard.  <H5>  5. Presentation of the Slovak Republic Abroad </H5>   Even though the situation with regard to the presentation of  the Slovak Republic abroad improved in 1993, it needs to be said  that a relatively low level of information on the Slovak  Republic persists among foreign professional, political, and  economic circles as well as among media workers and the general  public. The interest of foreign mass media, political  representatives, and experts is focused predominantly on  expediently [ucelove] selected ranges of issues -- the situation  regarding the protection of ethnic minority rights, freedom of  the press, the problem of conversion of arms production, the  status of the Romany ethnic community, and the like.    The main orientation in the activity of the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs was therefore focused on preventive measures.  The point of gravity of efforts lay in the compilation and  distribution of basic information about Slovakia. A number of  documents and books were issued (History of Slovakia and  Slovaks) in the course of the year, or their re-issue is being  prepared (Slovakia's Five Shapes, and others). Among the major  publishing feats, it is necessary to mention the representative  encyclopedia "Slovakia in the World -- World in Slovakia," being  prepared for the first anniversary of the founding of the Slovak  Republic.    Some justified reservations notwithstanding, the start of  the publication of the English-language monthly SLOVAKIA can be  considered a positive step. In 1993 we launched cooperation  with the Babylon agency aimed at publishing a quarterly in  Arabic, called SLOVAKIA TODAY.    In cooperation with the Slovak Government Office and other  state administration bodies, foremost attention was devoted to  the sphere of trade and economic cooperation. Emphasis was laid  on our interest, and the Slovak Government's systematic  activity, in establishing conditions for the influx of foreign  capital and investments.    From the territorial viewpoint, the activities centered  primarily on the neighboring countries, chiefly Hungary and  Austria. Despite maximum efforts, with regard to the  Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric power project we did not  succeed in eliminating to the full extent the consequences of  the Hungarian mass media activities directed against the Slovak  Republic. The activities of the Slovak side were confined  almost exclusively to standard methods (news conferences,  publications, and the like) and very little or no use was made  of offensive forms of mass media activities (appropriate  cooperation with selected mass media prior to the adoption, or  publication, of the Slovak side's relevant decisions).    In spite of an endeavor to do so, we did not succeed to the  full extent in securing the publication of ad hoc materials on  key foreign policy steps and activities of the Slovak Republic  and on important domestic political events (such as statements  by constitutional officials of the Slovak Republic).    An important role was played in 1993 by cooperation with  foreign companies involved in shaping and influencing public  opinion, particularly in the United States and the most  important countries of Western Europe. Experience with the firm  MWW/SC [expansion unknown] confirmed that it is essential to  thoroughly prepare agreements on cooperation and to set aside a  sufficient number of staffers assigned these public relations  tasks. In view of the financial costs, it was not possible to  make use of the aforementioned form of activity in the period  under review. This type of cooperation clearly requires a  coordinated course of action at the highest level and an  adequate pooling of resources of all interested government  departments.  <H5>  6. Building the Diplomatic Service </H5>   As of 31 November 1993, 415 employees worked at the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs in Bratislava, 189 of them in diplomatic  posts and 226 as desk officers in administrative and technical  jobs. In the course of 1993, 120 university graduates and 87  people with secondary and basic education took up work with the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    The Slovak Republic maintains abroad 54 embassies, 6  standing  missions, and 3 general consulates, at which operate 219  diplomatic staffers (60 of which, those working at trade and  economic sections, are under the methodological guidance of the  Ministry of Economy, 1, working at the Food and Agriculture  Organization in Rome, under the methodological guidance of the  Ministry of Agriculture, and 1, working at the standing mission  at Brussels, under the methodological guidance of the Ministry  of Finance) and 200 administrative and technical staff. In the  course of 1993, 42 diplomats and 53 administrative and technical  staffers were dispatched into foreign service. A total of 10  diplomats and 2 administrative and technical staffers are  currently undergoing preparation prior to being sent abroad.    A total of 26 diplomats operate in the rank of ambassador;  another three diplomats have been approved as ambassadors by the  government and the president of the Slovak Republic and are  ready to depart for their post; two have been approved as  ambassadors by the Government of the Slovak Republic and their  nomination has been submitted to the president of the Slovak  Republic for approval; and four proposals for ambassadorial  appointments have been submitted to the Government of the Slovak  Republic for approval.    Building the diplomatic service of the Slovak Republic in  1994 made it necessary not only to supplement the apparatus of  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with new personnel, but also to  adapt its organizational structures and to draw up internal  guidelines for the activity of both the Bratislava headquarters  and representative missions abroad. Attention was also devoted  to the problems of information flow, communications, and other  technical and organizational problems of building the Slovak  Republic's diplomatic service. Emphasis was placed, in  particular, on the establishment of a basic technical platform  for the Foreign Affairs Ministry's information system, on the  drafting of a concept for the development of the  telecommunications network, and on an effective substitution and  completion of communications devices, including means of special  communications. The set tasks have been fulfilled without any  serious shortcomings, in defiance of complicated conditions  caused, in particular, by the state of the installations  inherited from the division [of federal property].</p>

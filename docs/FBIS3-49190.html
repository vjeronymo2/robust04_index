			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Competing With the Parties That </F> `Boast About Being Hungarian'--on Tuesday's Function Organized  by the Democratic Association of Hungarians in Vojvodina"]    [Text] At Tuesday evening's Nyitott Ajto [Open Door]  program the audience paid its respects to the memory of  Hungarian head of government Jozsef Antall by standing silently  for one minute. This was followed by VMDK [Democratic Community  of Vojvodina Hungarians--DZVM in Serbo-Croatian] Vice Chairman  Karoly Dudas reminiscing about the 1991 meeting of Hungarian  head of government Antall and Yugoslav head of government  Markovic in Szabadka [Subotica]. Dudas pointed out the great  loss Antall's death meant to the Hungarian people, and expressed  hope that in the person of head of government-designate Peter  Boross, slated to take Antall's place, the Hungarian people  would have someone equally supportive of the VMDK endeavors.  Thereafter Dr. Csaba Sepsey, the chairman of the VMDK Szabadka  organization, reported on the contents of a letter by Andras  Agoston to the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum] dispatched a few  hours after Antall's death. This was followed by a debate over  election preparations. On Saturday, the VMDK Board also analyzed  the related activities that have taken place thus far. Since the  VMDK election campaign concentrates on visiting the various  areas, the first visits by people from the Szabadka organization  were paid to Hungarian-inhabited villages in the Banat region  last week (including Kisorosz, Toba, Torda, Magyarcsernye [Nova  Crnja], and Debelyacsan). They were received with great  enthusiasm. On this occasion, too, Dr. Csaba Sepsey did not fail  to criticize MAGYAR SZO, asserting that its mast head should  state "The daily newspaper of the Democratic Reform Party"  instead of saying that it is the daily newspaper reflecting the  democratic public opinion. He said this because voters belonging  to the VMDK--Hungarian readers--were unable to learn from the  newspaper about the 20-25 [as published] VMDK grand meeting last  week, but instead could read much more about presentations made  by the Vojvodina Democratic Coalition.    "Parties supportive of Great Serb nationalism agree in one  respect: Hungarians must be divided. For this reason they  nominate Hungarians to winning slots on their slates," Dr. Csaba  Sepsey said. Karoly Dudas claimed that the real opponent of the  VMDK in the elections is not going to be Milosevic's Socialist  Party, but parties and coalitions which profess to be  democratic, and which "boast about being Hungarian." At this  meeting, too, Dr. Tibor Varady was the subject of repeated  criticism; in last year's elections he headed the VDRP's  [Democratic Reform Party of Vojvodina] slate.</p>

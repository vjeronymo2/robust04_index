Fighters of the Tajik opposition based in the Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan are subjecting border posts as well as  villages near the border to mass shelling. They are even using  rocket projectiles.    In connection with this the Republic of Tajikistan Ministry  of Foreign Affairs has lodged a protest with the Government of  the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in which it says that the  Tajik side reserves the right to act, even to the extent of  destroying fire points of the Tajik opposition fighters on the  territory of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan if the  Government of this state does not take the necessary measures.  [video cuts from studio shot of Mirsaidov to show Colonel  General Boris Pyankov, commander of the collective CIS  peacekeeping forces in the Republic of Tajikistan, being  interviewed by an unidentified reporter]    [Begin Pyankov recording] Today we cannot permit artillery  and mortars to fire for half an hour with the aim of destroying  a border post, a kyshlak [village], or other positions. We  cannot remain inactive so it is precisely at this point that the  danger arises of our forces, including the peacekeeping forces  -- the Russian border guards and subunits of the Armed Forces of  Tajikistan -- being drawn into battles with subunits and their  firepower--to put it simply, the enemy forces on Afghan  territory. All of this can further complicate the  situation--and I stress complicate the situation--and nothing  more. There cannot be any new major war, any new large-scale  killing ground or new large-scale action. [end recording]    Regardless of the difficult situation in which our country  finds itself, the people of Tajikistan look to the future with  optimism. Enlivenment of the social and political life indicates  that with every passing day the people are becoming even more  optimistic.</p>

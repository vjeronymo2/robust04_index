			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wing Kay-po] </F>   [Text] The Government is confident it can muster sufficient  support in the Legislative Council (Legco) to pass its electoral  reform bill at the end of the month.    The confidence is due to the growing likelihood that the  Liberal Party and independent members will have difficulty  pushing through their package of amendments to water down the  original government proposals.    Last night, a government official said although "a lot may  happen" before June 29 when the electoral reform legislation  would be debated in Legco, the government bill would be passed  by a "reasonable majority". The official would not say how many  votes the Government had secured but he said it was "confident  enough" the bill would go through Legco intact.    The draft legislation is based on the original electoral  reform proposals first announced by the Governor, Chris Patten,  when he arrived in Hong Kong in 1992. The proposals, which  would extend the electorate in the functional constituencies to  cover the whole working population and establish an election  committee made up of directly elected District Board members,  provoked the wrath of China and started the long running  Sino-British row.    A Liberal Party legislator, Selina Chow, would not say how  many votes her party had secured for the package of amendments  as they were still discussing this with some independent  legislators.    Chow said there were still "many variables" affecting  whether  legislators would support their package.    The amendments --now known as the 1994 package-- proposed by  the Liberal Party and independent members is designed to reduce  significantly the electorate in the functional constituencies  from the original proposals.    Its proposal for the election committee also differs from  the  Patten package and is modelled on a four-part committee  --comprising the professions as well as municipal council  members-- as stipulated in the Basic Law.    Some independent members who are vital to the outcome of the  vote believe the 1994 amendments have only a "slim chance" of  success.    It is believed the deciding factor will be the way  legislators who are close to Beijing cast their votes. "The  package would be a dead duck if they abstain", one member said.    Another legislator said that unless the Chinese side changed  its stance and supported the diluted proposals, there was little  chance they would be passed. China has said whichever package  is passed on 29 June, it would not be able to straddle 1997.    "In that sense the 1992 [Patten] package and the 1994  package  have equal status", he said.    Yesterday, the secretary for the pro-China Democratic  Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), Cheng Kai-nam,  said his party still had to decide whether DAB's representative  in Legco, Tam Yiu- chung, would support the 1994 package. Cheng  said they still had to wait and see what the Liberal Party's  final position would be.    "They said one thing one day, another thing the next day.  One time it's even been said that they would support Emily  Lau's bill to have 60 directly elected seats.    "We can't say until we're sure what they're really up to",  he  said. Another member said the Government's attitude would be  the deciding factor in whether the 1994 package would be passed.    "We don't know how keen the Government is to push their own  proposals through; there hasn't been much lobbying so far.    "Perhaps the British have their own agenda -- to mend the  fence with China by letting the watered-down version pass", he  said.    The government official denied the Government has been slack  in lobbying legislators. He said the Government was lobbying  legislators of "all shades of political opinion" to endorse its  proposals.    "Both the Governor and senior government officials have been  arguing intensely both in public and in private that the  government proposals are the best for Hong Kong", he said.</p>

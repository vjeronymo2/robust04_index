			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul, June 9 (A.A.) -- NATO does not foresee  any basic changes in the Conventional Forces in Europe [CFE]  Reduction Treaty, except in a number of flexible articles of the  agreement, it was reported on Thursday [9 June].    Sources said that Russia would be involved in `far-reaching'  but informal cooperation going beyond a simple Partnership for  Peace accord.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher earlier said this  was natural given `Russia's size, broad interests, resources and  military capabilities.... Russia is and will remain a vital  actor in European security affairs.'    `But Moscow must first sign a Partnership for Peace accord  which 18 of its Cold War allies have already signed,' he added  in his address.    The allies agreed to promise Russia cooperation and  consultations outside a Partnership accord, notably nuclear  safety and disarmament issues, sources said.    The allies invited Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  to  sign a Partnership accord soon at the NATO headquarters in  Brussels, Belgium. Simultaneously, the two sides would then  issue a declaration spelling out in detail their future  cooperation, officials said.    Thursday's meeting opened with a promise to NATO's immediate  neighbors to the east that the alliance has no plans to use  Moscow to draw `new dividing lines across Europe' as happened at  the February, 1945, Yalta conference by Russia, the United  States and Britain.    NATO Deputy Secretary-General Sergio Balanzino said Russia  `is and will remain the single most powerful nation in Europe.'  But NATO has no intention to cooperate with Moscow `in  so-called Yalta-2,' he added.    British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said better relations  with Moscow was `a matter of huge importance' as NATO seeks to  craft a new European security order after the cold war.    The Partnership for Peace provides for broad political and  military cooperation, including joint maneuvers. NATO will also  help the East European nations draft defense budgets and convert  arms industries to civilian purposes. It stops short of  providing any security guarantees, but will allow for eventual  NATO membership for some East European countries.</p>

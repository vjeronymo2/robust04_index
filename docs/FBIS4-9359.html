			<p>BFN     [Text] Would your party be willing to lay down the  unchangeability of current borders in basic treaties with the  neighboring countries? If not, then with which country would  you refuse to do this?    Gyorgy Fabri, Agrarian Federation: "Good-neighborly  relations with the states of the east European region and the  establishment of a viable system of relations is a distinctly  important goal of our foreign policy concept. With this in  mind, we are willing to lay down the recognition of the current  borders and their unchangeability in basic treaties with all  neighboring countries."    Karoly Herenyi, Hungarian Democratic Forum: "The term  `unchangeability' actually means a ban on all changes. The  international agreements in force do not suggest and do not even  allow any such categoric bans. Together with the other  democratic parliamentary parties, we also claim that, in  agreement with the international norms, the given populations,  the given countries, and the international community, border  changes are theoretically possible. It is a different matter  that, rather than at border changes, Hungary's political  endeavors are directed at achieving that all national minorities  be able to live within such an institutional and political  framework that makes it possible for them to survive within the  current borders. The establishment of such circumstances also  guarantees the security of the states, and the inviolability and  stability of borders. We would like to have these included in  the treaties with our neighbors."    Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]:  "According to the SZDSZ, Hungary will not need to initiate any  kind of border changes in the future, either. We support the  inclusion of this in basic treaties with all our neighbors,  however, the signing of a basic treaty is a political gesture  that also has to settle other important areas of bilateral  relations, including the situation of the national minorities,  and the expansion of economic and cultural links."    Lorant Benedek, Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP]: "As  various international agreements -- including the Paris peace  treaty and the Helsinki agreement -- lay down the  unchangeability of the current borders when the interested  parties cannot both agree, the MIEP considers further such  agreements completely unnecessary. In fact, more treaties like  these would only serve the purpose that the neighboring  countries that advocate this will be able to support their  obviously false propaganda claim according to which the  Hungarians are intending to aggressively conquer territories,  and this is why these countries need to coerce Hungary to sign  such treaties."    Laszlo Urban, Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]: ``In  the Fidesz's view, the basic treaties are suitable for settling  the situation of national minorities living beyond the borders.  Therefore, it supports the signing of these treaties, especially  with those neighboring countries where Hungarian minorities are  living. However, negotiations on the Romanian and Slovak  treaties have been suspended. Both these neighbors insist that  Hungary again declare in the treaty that it does not want any  border changes (neither in violent nor in peaceful ways). On  the other hand, Hungary wishes to receive institutional  guarantees in the basic treaties on settling the situation of  national minorities.    ``Hungary does not want to change the borders through either  violent of peaceful ways. The Fidesz cannot see any obstacles  to including these in the basic treaties. At the same time, it  considers it important for the basic treaty to also contain a  section on national minorities. The views of the Hungarian  minority have to be taken into consideration when drawing up  this section.    ``The Fidesz urges the signing of basic treaties with the  neighboring countries as a culmination of good-neighborly  relations. However, it is important to establish a system of  diverse bilateral agreements because, without these, the basic  treaty would be a formal act without any content.''    Gyula Thurmer, Workers Party: "The Workers Party wishes to  base our relations with the neighboring countries on three  pillars. We are offering a treaty in which we first declare that  we do not want to change the borders. Second, we mutually  ensure the rights of national minorities in accordance with the  European norms and the possibilities of the affected countries.  Third, we put down in writing that we cooperate in all areas."    Gyorgy Janosi, Hungarian Socialist Party: "It is expedient  to sign the basic treaty with Slovakia and Romania as soon as  possible. In the documents, the current borders have to be  confirmed, and the guaranteeing of national minority rights in  accordance with the European norms has to be stipulated. After  the the South Slav crisis is settled, we will immediately have  to begin placing our relations with Yugoslavia and Serbia on new  foundations. Using the opportunities that will arise from  signing the basic treaties, we further have to expand our  relations with Croatia, Slovenia, and Ukraine. Also bearing  Hungary's security policy interests in mind, there is no  alternative to historical reconciliation."    Marica Korondy, Mrs. Balla, Independent Smallholders Party  [FKGP]: "According to the FKGP's foreign policy program, the  Hungarian Republic has to observe the Helsinki Final Act that  was also signed by the Hungarian Government. Hungary is not  intending to change the borders, and it sees Central and Eastern  Europe's stability and security in recognizing the region's  national minorities as political entities. It is unnecessary to  surrender our future rights in the basic treaties with the  neighboring countries. At the wish of the Hungarians in the  neighboring countries who were forced into a minority situation  as a result of the Paris peace system, a system of viable  autonomies has to be established, and this way, the transparency  of borders can be achieved when the border issues will no longer  need to be raised."    Zoltan Kiraly, Social Democratic Party of Hungary [MSZDP]:  "If the MSZDP gets into a position to make decisions, then it  would be willing to lay down the unchangeability of the current  borders in basic treaties with neighboring countries."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Marian Krzaklewski, chairman of the </F> Independent Self-Governing Trade Union Solidarity, by Piotr  Adamowicz; place and date not given: "We Are Ready for a  Compromise"]    [Text] [Adamowicz] Minister Pol has reminded all of us  that last fall Solidarity ["S"] declared that it would strive to  overthrow the new government by all available legal means.    [Krzaklewski] It was the government that came up with the  notion that the current strikes are of a political nature. What  the government is saying is false; we have not put forward any  political demands. It is possible that the coalition fears  that, if it does not manage to act on the compromise, the  consequences will be very bad. It is worth recalling that "S"  demands the implementation of solutions that were agreed upon a  long time ago. The strikes are legal because we are in  collective bargaining with the government concerning the  following: compensation for increased maintenance costs and  nonimplementation of the "Pact on Enterprise."    The new governing elite is arrogant, displaying  democratic-hegemonic tendencies. Minister Pol says that he will  not yield to any pressure because the government has a definite  majority in the parliament that was elected in parliamentary  elections. He forgets that the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]  and the Polish Peasant Party were supported by 20 percent of the  people. All the same, he speaks of a majority. He is delaying  the implementation of the "Pact on Enterprise" because he does  not want clear rules of the game with the union, he does not  want to have a strong partner. The introduction of the  principle of the representatives of the unions would prove that,  for most enterprises, the representative union is "S" and not  the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement. The government is  violating the law; it does not want to admit that the union is  right because such an admission would be an "S" success, which  is not a desirable thing for the government. The coalition  accepted the doctrine of a fight with the union; it says "Let  them bleed until the end." I know about direct pressure by the  prime minister and the ministers, who insisted that such and not  other information on the union's activities and on the strikes  be broadcast on television and radio. A few days ago, an  interview with me was not aired on the first program of the  Polish Radio Network.    [Adamowicz] It seemed that you were understood by Prime  Minister Pawlak.    [Krzaklewski] I am wondering whether Prime Minister Pawlak  is playing a game or if he is unable to implement certain  solutions because of the opposition of the ministers and the  SLD. When we are talking, the prime minister declares  understanding, he states that he accepts our demands. Experts'  committees work on the schedule of the implementation of the  demands. It must only be approved by the government, which  delays things. However, I do not speak with the prime minister  in a cafe, but in the Office of the Council of Ministers.    Then we sign a joint communique. Therefore, I am wondering  whether the prime minister is playing a game or the SLD and the  ministers are forcing him to give up his promises. This would  mean that his position is weak.    A day before the strike at Belchatow, I spoke with the prime  minister. I said that, if the government submitted ways of  resolving the demands, the strike might be expected to be  suspended at the rally. Then the prime minister signed a very  general letter, which was hooted.    [Adamowicz] Do you predict a black scenario?    [Krzaklewski] We are ready for a compromise! We are waiting  for the reply until 2000 on Thursday [28 April]. The Council of  Ministers is convening; let them say what the scenario of our  further demands will be like. The government cannot say that we  are placing it on the wall! It has known our demands since  November. "S" has displayed its ability to reach a compromise  by increasing coal supplies to the power plant. When the  Council of Ministers gives a specific answer on the schedule, a  mixed government-union commission may convene that will work out  the details and the demands of the branches.    [Adamowicz] However, a compromise requires both sides to  make concessions.    [Krzaklewski] So far, the government has not proved that the  implementation of some demands is impossible because of the  economic capabilities of the state. If it proves this, we will  accept it. We can speak about deferring the implementation of  some of the demands. However, we will not give up the  priorities: curbing the decrease in families' incomes--that is,  lowering the energy prices, introducing a profamily tax system,  and abandoning the new popiwek [tax on excessive wage  increases]. We will still demand immediate implementation of  the "Pact on Enterprise" and the giving of ownership rights to  citizens. Because the government is speaking about a strong  coalition, because the new popiwek law was adopted within a  half-hour, it may take the coalition 48 hours to adopt the  "Pact," which was prepared a long time ago.    [Adamowicz] In the meantime, the new popiwek law has gone to  the senate.    [Krzaklewski] If the senate adopts this law, it will limit  the room for compromise. "S" will turn to the Constitutional  Tribunal because the law will be violated. The law cannot be  retroactive; the unions were not consulted on the bill; it is  also contrary to Article 68 of the Constitution, which pertains  to the relationship between the wage level and the quantity and  quality of work, where the principles of social justice should  be taken into account. We will also ask the president not to  sign this law. The president seems to be seeking closer  relations with the union. Therefore, he will have a chance to  show his attitude toward the problems of employees and "S."    [Adamowicz] Unless the government submits the schedule, "S"  threatens a general strike. Opinion polls suggest that the  popular acceptance of strikes is poor. Even the greatest  radicals, such as Maciej Jankowski, stated two weeks ago that  "there is no atmosphere for strikes."    [Krzaklewski] A general strike is possible when the  authorities start shooting at people. It will be a strike of  the nationwide union organization. We conducted referendums in  several thousand enterprises, and our action is legal. The  active strike will be joined by the enterprises of the  metallurgical, arms, and cement-and-lime industry, as well as  mines and railways. I am not saying that the action will be  unlimited because, if the government does not submit a clear  schedule of the implementation of our demands, it will mean that  it is a fight for months or even years.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson alert International conglomerate Hanson retreated 6 1/2 to 275p on turnover of 10m shares as the group announced that it was raising Dollars 1bn through one of the largest ever convertible bond offerings. There was concern that the move could be a disguised rights issue carried out in order to build up Hanson's war chest. And some analysts said the deal might ultimately increase the amount of equity in issue by around 3.5 per cent, thus diluting the value of existing shares. US reluctance to buy the shares yesterday was, in fact, said to be in order to take advantage of the issue, which one analyst described as 'extremely clever'. Hanson is offering bonds which can be converted into shares at approximately a 20 per cent premium to yesterday's price. Most analysts argued that the conglomerate had managed to lock itself into a low rate fixed for seven years at a time when US rates seem poised to rise. The announcement coincided with Mr Alan Greenspan's warnings on US rates. Big restructuring charges at Unilever saw the shares retreat sharply and remain under pressure for most of the session. The stock ended 37 down at 1162p after 4.6m traded. Rumours of provisions had overhung the shares recently, but yesterday's Pounds 490m took the market by surprise. Analysts also remarked on the weaker than expected volumes and the slightly cautious tone taken by the company at the results meeting. There were still some different interpretations of the outlook for the stock. One food specialist said the generally bleak outlook for food manufacturing meant Unilever's restructuring move could turn into an annual event as the company attempted to keep up with events. But Mr Carl Short at SGST believes Unilever's prospects for 1994 and beyond are positive and the provisions augur well for subsequent trading. 'The stock rating looks undemanding at these levels,' he said. British Aerospace gained 9 at 540p ahead of today's full-year results. A loss is expected but there are high hopes that the figures will show an improvement in underlying performance. Music and rental group Thorn EMI hit an all-time high of 1148p, up 10, on 2m shares traded after reporting satisfactory results. However, analysts considering upgrading profits forecasts came away discouraged after meeting the company. Forecasts were left at around the Pounds 345m level for the full year. Rank Organisation added 4 at 1087p on the hope of good trading news at its agm today. Sedgwick, the UK's biggest insurance broker, pleased the market with its preliminary results and the shares rose 5 to 188p, helping to stabilise Willis Corroon, which settled only 2 easier at 208p. Full-year results at the top end of analysts forecasts saw SmithKline Beecham 'A' hold steady at 406p. Textiles group Dawson International improved 9 to 155p on speculative buying. Conglomerate BTR firmed 2 1/2 to 370p after it said it was floating its builders merchants subsidiary Graham Group at 183p a share. Lonrho eased 3 to 154p as nerves about next month's flotation of Ashanti Goldfield, in which it holds a 45 per cent stake, set in. Very heavy two-way business in Burton saw turnover hit 32m; the shares slipped about a penny to 52 1/2 p.</p>

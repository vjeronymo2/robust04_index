			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> 3 FACULTY COMPOSERS PRESENT NEW WORKS AT UC IRVINE  </P> <P> Varied works, each written within the past year, by three UC Irvine faculty  composers revealed a broad mix of simple tonality and atonality Monday night at  the Fine Arts Concert Hall on campus. The presentation provided sporadic  interest mingled with more routine, unadventurous moments.  </P> <P> The evening's only premiere, Bernard Gilmore's "La Folia" for solo violin,  juxtaposes snippets from various settings by Frescobaldi, Marais and others of  the popular 17th-Century dance in the title, creating an eclectic collage.  Sustained, soul-searching passages comment between the quotes, finally  transforming into an engagingly grotesque dance of their own, far removed from  the original theme.  </P> <P> A careful blend of idiomatic writing and detail, Gilmore's music never sits  still stylistically, but fits together lucidly, though not always with  convincing originality. Violinist Haroutune Bedelian gave the piece superb  attention, seamlessly moving from one remote idea to the other.  </P> <P> Four green-gowned members of the Terry Lewis Dance Ensemble swooned and swayed  to Paul Hodgins' electronic score "At Delphi," a generally understated, spooky  setting of an ancient Greek ritual involving a virgin under the intoxicating  effect of laurel leaves. Blunt choreography gives the piece a mild feminist  theme, though the overall attempts to be more ecstatic than intellectual do not  always achieve the pagan sensibility intended.  </P> <P> John Gerhold's "For Paula," a four-part tonal cycle for soprano, oboe and  piano, sets stream-of-consciousness texts by the composer expressing his  various feelings towards taking care of his 2-year-old daughter. The overt  simplicity of the music and words proved cloying, projecting the joy and other  emotions of fatherhood but not with a satisfactory level of sophistication.  </P> <P> Opening the evening, pianists Betty Oberacker and Kary Kramer, a professor of  music and a student at UC Santa Barbara respectively, delivered a  lecture-recital of piano music by faculty composers from seven different UC  campuses. Although their intentions were laudable, the presentation proceeded  woodenly, touting each composer without much depth, using information too  technical for the layman, too cursory and incomplete for the scholar.  </P></p>

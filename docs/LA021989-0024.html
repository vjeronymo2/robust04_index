			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASTIMES: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> BATIK  </P> <P> ANYONE WHO LIVED through the '60s probably had a batik bedspread, wall hanging  or caftan. Like tie-dying and love beads, it was an art uniquely associated  with those free-spirited days. But then, like so many of the skills of that  crafts revolution, batik languished, only recently enjoying a small renaissance  among serious fiber artists.  </P> <P> Batik is an ancient art, going back to Egypt, Persia, China, Japan and India,  but it reached its full potential on the small island of Java. Since the 10th  Century, Javanese batik has been the art of kings and then commoners, and  special patterns were developed to cover most important occasions, such as  weddings. One design is believed to have curative powers; another is used to  wrap a newborn baby.  </P> <P> The Javanese patterns are exquisite and complicated repetitive designs, an  ideal to which most of us can only aspire. On a more practical, at-home level,  batik is quite simple, requiring only paraffin or beeswax, fabric and dye.  Paraffin and dye are available at supermarkets, and any natural-fiber fabric  will do (polyesters do not take dyes, but some nylons and ramies do; if there  is any doubt about fiber content, dye a small sample before embarking on a  major project). Simply make designs on the fabric, using objects dipped in wax  (such as tin cans, needles or brushes); the wax will remain on the fabric. An  even simpler method is to dribble wax onto the fabric. Once the wax design is  complete, the fabric is dyed -- but those waxed areas will not be colored. This  is called a "resist" technique because the waxed portions resist or repel the  dye. When the fabric is dry, the wax is removed, usually by running a hot dry  iron over a piece of paper placed over the fabric. More advanced practitioners  will wax and dye the fabric several times, ending with a multicolored  extravaganza that might even get a second look in Java.  </P> <P>  Supplies can be found at most art stores, at Aaron Bros. throughout Southern  California and Kit Kraft in Studio City. Most libraries carry books (usually  from the '70s) on batik.  </P></p>

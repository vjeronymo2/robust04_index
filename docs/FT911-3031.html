			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Optimism returns to NZ wool CAUTIOUS optimism is returning to the New Zealand wool industry, after the settling of a long-standing debt with the Soviet Union and the return of China as a buyer. Prices rose by 43 cents per kilo at late April sales, with the market indicator hitting 411 - 15 cents above the level when the New Zealand Wool Board suspended its price-support mechanism in February. This followed Australia's decision to end its support floor price system, which sent prices on both sides of the Tasman Sea into a tailspin. The absence of China and the Soviet Union as buyers had seen prices fall over the last 18 months. China virtually stopped buying in 1989 due to significant economic difficulties at home and over buying, while the Soviet Union was forced to end its purchases last year due to its foreign exchange crisis. The first shipment of New Zealand wool for 12 months is on its way to the Soviet Union, after action to pay NZDollars 20m (Pounds 6.87m) of an outstanding NZDollars 50m bill, which allowed the completion of some NZDollars 16m of shelved contracts. The completion of this deal was through a consortium of exporters led by Christchurch firm Mircom, put together at the Soviets' suggestion. The Soviets also saw the formation of a group led by the ANZ Bank to issue credit lines to allow the trade to continue. The Wool Board is to provide wool from its 630,000-bale stockpile to fill a significant part of the new orders. The arrangements were taken to indicate the urgency the Soviet government saw in renewed wool imports. The Chinese are also showing greater interest. While they had been continuing to buy small amounts over the past year, their purchases were miniscule compared to the mid- and later-1980s when they were New Zealand's biggest customer for crossbred wools. Mr Roger Buchanan, marketing development manager of the New Zealand Wool Board, said the complex political and economic developments in the Soviet Union, which had led to the resumed buying, were 'something of a mystery.' He said it was known that Soviet mills were desperate for wool and it must be assumed the government had placed a high priority on imports. Last year, industry leaders unsuccessfully sought export guarantee insurance from the New Zealand government in an attempt to help the trade. Mr John Falloon, the Minister of Agriculture, said his refusal then had been vindicated by the appearance of the ANZ Bank to support the sales. The purchases to China follow visits to New Zealand by Mr Lie Huaqui, the Chinese Foreign Minister, and senior buyers, who were apparently encouraged by the lower prices. They had also resumed large-scale buying in Australia. New Zealand government sources say the Chinese are expected to buy 25,000 tonnes this year - still well down on the peak sales of 63,000 tonnes in 1988-89. The Council of Wool Exporters has warned farmers about the jump in prices, saying it is due to a limited supply of wool at this time of year, which is being actively sought by customers who had allowed their stocks to run down to critically low levels. It says a period of price instability should be expected at auction as the market adjusts to the free trading environment following the withdrawal of Wool Board support.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Procter &amp; Gamble criticised for advert PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the consumer goods giant, has been criticised over advertising claims for Ariel Ultra, one of its branded soap powders. The Independent Television Commission received complaints disputing the implied claim that Ariel Ultra would always remove fat from garments at 40 degrees centigrade. The ITC concluded that Ariel should normally work as advertised, but the advertising referred to other washing powders, suggesting they failed to work completely, implying that Ariel would always work in all circumstances. P&amp;G was unable to establish this claim to the satisfaction of the ITC. P&amp;G said it was taking steps to modify its advertising.</p>

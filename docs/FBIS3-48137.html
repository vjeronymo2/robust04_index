			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 22 Kyodo -- The ASAHI SHIMBUN urged the  ruling coalition Saturday [22 January] not to snuggle up to the  main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in talks to  revise the government-proposed political reform bills that were  voted down Friday at a plenary session of the House of  Councillors.    "The bills are not completely dead. They could be  resuscitated by again winning a two-thirds or more majority in  the House of Representatives, or by gaining approval in the  joint committee of both houses," an editorial of the ASAHI said.    The upper chamber rejected the package by 130 votes to 118,  with 20 members of the Social Democratic Party, the largest  force within the ruling coalition, voting against or refraining  from attending the voting session.    "The prime minister said, `there is now more room to reach a  compromise with the LDP.'...But we would feel compelled to tell  the coalition to hold it right there if some members are simply  planning to adopt all of the LDP's proposals just to get the  bills passed, as some of them have begun to openly say."    "We have thought all along that the LDP's bills, which were  rejected by the lower house, had too many problems as they had a  larger margin of single-seat constituencies than the  government's plan, as well as less strict controls on political  contributions by corporations. We cannot agree to the coalition  snuggling up to the LDP without principle," the ASAHI said.    "We hold steadfast in our assertion that political reform  must move forward as soon as possible. But that depends on the  contents of the reforms. Rather than adopting all of the LDP's  ideas as they are, it would be better for the government to  think seriously about starting afresh in devising ways to  restrict political funds and prevent corruption, separately from  reforms in the election system," the ASAHI said.    The MAINICHI SHIMBUN and the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN said Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa should not to retreat in the content  of the reform bills in negotiating with the opposition camp.    "If (Hosokawa's remarks) mean he intends to ease  restrictions  on political contribution by corporations to individual  politicians, we firmly oppose to that," the MAINICHI said. The  MAINICHI also said it opposes dissolution of the Diet for a snap  general election to break the deadlock.    The NIHON KEIZAI said that at least measures for  anticorruption and tightening political funds controls should be  realized during the current Diet session, which ends on January  29, and that electoral system reforms, which are currently  thought to be the pivotal part of the bills, can be discussed  later. It criticized both the ruling and opposition parties for  having altered the anticorruption drive into a means to change  the electoral system.    The YOMIURI SHIMBUN said, "The ruling and opposition parties  must be aware of their joint responsibility to enact political  reform and should begin talks immediately to fashion a  compromise."    The YOMIURI calls on Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono  to  hold a meeting to reach a compromise.</p>

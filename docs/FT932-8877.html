			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Pressure mounts for U-turn on rail sell-off THE GOVERNMENT is coming under intense pressure to follow last week's U-turns over school-tests and fines with new climbdowns on rail privatisation and the collection of pension payments from post offices. With prime minister John Major attempting to reassert his authority after this month's disastrous election results, the government is facing a determined effort to change its rail privatisation bill, spearheaded by a group of Tory backbenchers. It is also under pressure to back away from proposals which might compel some pensioners to have pension payments made by automated credit transfers. The Treasury is thought to be keen for more benefits to be paid in this way rather than being collected over the counter from post offices. Mr Major said last week that the government aimed to 'encourage' bank transfers while maintaining a 'viable' network of Post Offices. Mr Major acknowledged in his speech to last week's Scottish Conservative Conference that - with its Commons majority down to 18 - the government might be forced into an occasional climbdown. 'We may have to tack a little here, manoeuvre a little there. That's politics,' he said. The government is also facing the difficult prospect of piloting a long and complicated finance bill through its committee stage without having its revenue-raising proposals diluted. Ministers, after facing down attempts to amend its proposed reform of the North Sea tax regime and weathering a mini-rebellion over imposing value added tax on domestic fuel, are concerned that proposed changes to the company-car tax system could provide another potential flashpoint. The MPs backing changes to the government's rail privatisation plans intend to table a series of amendments to the bill for consideration at its Commons report stage next week. Among the likely amendments is one that would permit British Rail to bid against the private sector for rail franchises. Others would seek to ensure that Travelcards and senior citizens' railcards would not be axed. Sir Keith Speed, the Tory MP for Ashford, said yesterday that the proposals were designed to make rail privatisation 'popular and workable.' None of them would undermine the principle of the bill, he said. Warning that if the government demonstrated no flexibility MPs would have to 'consider our position', he said that his 'strong hope' was for ministers to decide they could accommodate the changes. Mr Tim Rathbone, the Tory MP for Lewes, said the changes were 'in no way' wrecking amendments.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Adia plans SFr100m rights as loss deepens ADIA, the Swiss temporary employment agency group, reported deepened losses in the first nine months of the year. It blamed high interest charges but said its equity would be boosted by SFr200m (Dollars 24m)in its second capital restructuring in less than a year. The group also revealed that German retailer Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus had agreed to sell its Adia stake to Mr Klaus Jacobs, giving Mr Jacobs a controlling 56.2 per cent holding. Adia's operating profits in the first nine months were SFr33.4m, compared with a loss of SFr83m in the same period of last year. Net loss jumped to SFr112.2m from a loss of SFr70m, but the group forecast it would break even in the fourth quarter. It said the increase in operating profits reflected rising demand in the US, Britain and Australia, and cost-saving measures in Europe and Japan. The capital restructuring plan raises SFr100m through a rights issue underwritten by Mr Jacobs. An additional SFr100m would be created by the conversion of loans held by a banking consortium led by Credit Suisse. A representative of the banking group would take a seat on Adia's board of directors. Adia would also propose at an annual meeting on December 2 that holders of its participation certificates swap them into bearer shares. Sulzer, the Swiss engineering and medical equipment group, said its order intake of SFr4.4bn in the first nine months of 1993 was 3.3 per cent lower than in the same period of last year. It expected full-year net profit to be similar to last year's SFr168m.</p>

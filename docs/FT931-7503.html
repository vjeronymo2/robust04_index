			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / The incredible shrinking market: Cost-cutting and gloomy forecasts of losses are taking their toll at Lloyd's The florists round here are in for a rough time. There'll be no more ornate dinners with banks of flowers,' says Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's of London, as he bluntly reports a further round of cuts. The savings at the corporation of Lloyd's, the 'civil service' that regulates and services the troubled insurance market, are part of a wide-ranging management shake-out. In the seven weeks since Mr David Rowland, the new chairman, joined Mr Middleton in the suite of executive offices at the top of the Lloyd's building, the pace has quickened. Over the past six months, Mr Middleton has sliced nearly Pounds 30m off a Pounds 145m annual budget, cut 300 of 2,200 jobs and promised the loss of 300 more. Chauffeurs, administrators and information technologists have been dismissed, and the corporation's 15 management layers scythed down to six. 'It is going to be a year of quite profound change,' promises Mr Middleton. Now that many support jobs have been removed, Mr Middleton and Mr Rowland are turning their attention to the more than 200 businesses which make up the market. Advised by a 'market board' of leading underwriters and brokers, as well as outside businessmen, Mr Middleton is preparing the first 'business plan' in Lloyd's 306-year history. Under consideration are several radical reforms, including potentially far-reaching changes to the agency system, which links the Names - the individuals who provide the market's capital - with the underwriters who use it. Members' agencies - which handle the affairs of Names and allocate them to syndicates - could be stripped of many administrative and financial functions. This could force many smaller and less productive ones out of business and add to the rationalisation which has seen the disappearance of some 170 of the 401 syndicates active in 1990. Mr Middleton is keen to bring a degree of centralisation to the fragmented market. 'The outside world sees it as a single brand name,' he adds, warning that Lloyd's is condemned to 'dwindle into insignificance' if it fails to improve its competitiveness in international markets for specialist commercial insurance and reinsurance. Despite the energy and drive of the new leadership team, its task has recently begun to appear more daunting. Optimism among underwriters and agents, fuelled by increases in insurance rates and the promise of a return to profitability in 1993, has been dented as the scale of the problems becomes apparent. The 1990 year of account, which Lloyd's will report in June in line with its three-year accounting system, looks set to produce heavier-than-expected losses. Just a year ago Lloyd's characterised estimates that the 1990 loss might reach Pounds 1bn as 'alarmist' and unduly pessimistic. It now appears that losses for the year will be at least Pounds 1.6bn and could equal 1989's record loss of Pounds 2.06bn. The chairman of one of the largest agencies says that the escalation of projected market losses for 1990 is worse than anticipated even as recently as December. 'I don't think anybody in the market expected 1990 to be a colossal loss.' There are two main reasons. First, reports from a number of syndicates suggest that the worst of the claims from so-called 'spiral' reinsurance, in which syndicates and companies reinsure each other's catastrophe losses, have not yet materialised. This has deepened the gloom of many at the market, especially those working Names whose syndicates were left relatively unscathed last year but who now face heavy personal losses. The scale and unexpectedness of the losses of one syndicate led one veteran underwriter, Mr Roy Bromley, to commit suicide at the end of last month. Second, there are few signs of a reduction in the level of claims from asbestosis and pollution in the United States, where potential liabilities on old policies sometimes written more than 30 years ago could undermine the market. Syndicates have reserved more than Pounds 2bn against such losses. Last week it emerged that Syndicate Underwriting Management, which handles the claims against more than 80 syndicates that have gone out of business, was last year notified of a 30 per cent increase in possible claims arising from US pollution cases. While the trend of judgments in US court cases over who should pay the cost of environmental clean-ups ordered by the federal government has not been clear-cut, underwriters nevertheless feel vulnerable. 'Some professionals think that pollution is the end of the world as we know it,' says one leading underwriter. Other factors have played a part in eroding the market's confidence. Lloyd's is bracing for another round of bad publicity over litigation between Names and their agents. Several thousand of the more than 30,000 Names who have underwritten at Lloyd's in the past five years are involved in some form of legal action. Two of the largest cases - those involving the Feltrim and Gooda Walker syndicates - are set to come to court over the next two years. Efforts to reach a global settlement of all outstanding cases are under way but so far no proposals have emerged. The decline of the market's capital base is also prompting concern. The scale of recent losses has forced many Names out of the market and caused others to reduce their commitments. This year capacity (the amount available to back insurance premiums) is expected to shrink by at least Pounds 1.5bn (see chart). Another fall is forecast next year, with some observers expecting capacity to drop to less than Pounds 7bn. Already there are indications that Lloyd's is losing some business to financially strong European insurers and reinsurers. Mr Jeff Fieldson, vice-president of Johnson &amp; Higgins, the US broker which places business for many of the world's biggest companies, says groups like his still work through Lloyd's but increasingly turn to insurers in Paris, Munich, Trieste and Zurich to complete big deals. Mr Middleton and Mr Rowland have responded to these problems with a two-pronged programme of cost-cutting and raising new capital. Swingeing job cuts are already well under way but efforts to attract capital are only just beginning. Such a course of action was recommended by a market task force chaired by Mr Rowland last year. His report proposed capacity of at least Pounds 13bn by 1997, a goal which, on present trends, Lloyd's is far from achieving. Institutional investors and insurance companies as well as wealthier Names will be targeted. However, the uncertainty stemming from the market's exposure to asbestosis and pollution claims is a significant block to new entrants. This legacy from the past is beginning to emerge as the single most important constraint to recovery, while efforts to resolve it highlight the potential clash between present and future investors. A growing number of market professionals wants to 'fence off' old liabilities by leaving syndicate accounts for 1990 open. This would mean that responsibility for losses arising in 1990 would have to be met by only those Names who were members of Lloyd's in that year. New Names would be exempt. Last year Lloyd's made it easier for agents to leave syndicates' accounts open and, as a result, the number of syndicates with open years doubled to more than 100. This week, however, the market appears to have ruled out the idea of forcing syndicates to keep 1990 open. This is unlikely to stop the practice despite its 'harsh' effect 'on Names who have stuck with us through thick and thin', says one agent. But it is a sacrifice they may be called upon to pay if Lloyd's is to surmount its present crisis.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          LLOYD'S: THE PROBLEMS MOUNT  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     1987    1988    1989    1990   1991    1992    1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Capacity Pounds bn  10.3    11.0    10.9    11.0   11.4    10.0     8.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Members           30,936  32,433  31,329  28,770  26,539 22,162  19,800  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Syndicates           365     376     401     401     354    279     228  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Profit (loss)        510    (510) (2,063) (1,600)      -      -       - Pounds m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Corporation        2,247   2,278   2,157   2,147   2,136  2,262   1,600* employees  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Estimate based on latest reductions of 600 to be completed by year end  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Lloyd's  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

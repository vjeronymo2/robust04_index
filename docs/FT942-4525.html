			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Northern Foods In the long run the migration of shoppers to large supermarkets should work in Northern Foods' favour. Its position as a supplier of own-label foods to the likes of Marks and Spencer and Sainsbury is a strength. Yet problems arise when this migration becomes a stampede. Last year's price war among supermarket giants drew customers away from local stores in droves. Doorstep milk deliveries fell by 12 per cent. Since these outlets account for a large slice of Northern's business, profits across the group barely grew. For all its efforts to rationalise distribution to smaller stores and franchise milk rounds, this year will be equally tough if food prices continue to fall. In addition to declining volumes on the non-supermarket side, Northern will have to fight its corner on margins with the supermarkets themselves. Grabbing a decent share of the wholesale milk market once it is open to competition would help cement Northern's position in this area. But the immediate impact on profits is unlikely to be great. While the earnings outlook is dull, Northern continues to generate cash. Financing modest acquisitions would present no problem even though capital spending is running well ahead of depreciation. Yet for the moment the equity market is more interested in recovery stories than other virtues. The shares stand at little more than half 1991's rights price. If the equity market is not prepared to value fully a cash-generative and strategically well-positioned company, others in the food industry may be tempted to step in.</p>

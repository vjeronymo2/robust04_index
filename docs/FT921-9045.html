			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / BP Chemicals to derecognise blue-collar unions BP CHEMICALS is to end collective pay bargaining at its Baglan Bay plant in South Wales in a rare example of a large UK company derecognising blue-collar unions. The company's plan, announced yesterday with proposals to cut 130 jobs and change working practices at the 900-strong plant, sparked fears among unions that other BP plants would follow. Many companies have withdrawn collective bargaining from white-collar employees, but it is unusual for manual-worker unions to be derecognised. BP Chemicals yesterday gave 90 days' notice to the TGWU general workers' union and the AEU engineers of its intention to end their role in pay bargaining at Baglan Bay. The two unions said about 700 of the 900 workers on the site are members. BP Chemicals said terms and conditions of all employees would be harmonised and each would be asked to sign a personal contract. Pay would depend in part on individual performance, although initially workers would receive basic pay rises of up to Pounds 1,300 a year and improved allowances. Mr Fred Higgs, TGWU national secretary, said: 'It is extremely cynical for the company to try to end collective bargaining at the same time as announcing job losses. It is an attempt to intimidate people into giving up their fundamental trade union rights. 'If they get away with it at Baglan Bay, they may try it at other sites.' The TGWU said it was seeking legal advice on the company's move. A meeting of union officials from throughout BP Chemicals has been called for Monday to discuss industrial action. Baglan Bay is one of three large chemical plants owned by BP in the UK, the other two are at Hull and Grangemouth, near Falkirk. It owns a further dozen smaller plants. The company proposes to alter shift patterns, increase team working and train workers to take on a greater variety of jobs. To reflect the changes, most employees will be called technicians rather than process operators. Mr Alan Bilsland, works general manager, said the job losses and other changes were essential to improve the plant's competitive position. The company planned to use voluntary redundancy to shed the jobs over the next 18 months but it was likely some enforced redundancies would be necessary. The company added that workers could still be represented by unions on an individual basis. BP Chemicals said that it would cut 50 jobs from its workforce of 464 at its advanced materials division at Baglan Bay. The company blamed the cuts on losing business with Canadair, the regional aircraft maker owned by Canada's Bombadier. BP said Canadair was bringing production of aircraft parts made of lightweight composite materials in-house. The 37-strong ruling general executive council of the TGWU has moved slightly further to the left after the latest elections. The left-right balance is now thought to be 23-14. Two of the territorial seats have been abolished, taking out a rightwinger in the northern region and the leftwing dockers leader Mr Walter Greendale from the Hull area. Mr Chris Green, a leftwinger, has taken over the civil air transport trade group.</p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CRASH VICTIM'S MOTHER FINALLY GETTING DAY IN COURT;  </P> <P> TRIALS: AS A MADD VOLUNTEER, RUTH HANZLIK COMFORTED OTHERS. NOW SHE MAY FIND  COMFORT -- SEEKING JUSTICE IN THE 1982 WRECK THAT KILLED HER DAUGHTER.  </P> <P> As a volunteer for Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Ruth Hanzlik of Granada Hills  spent three years in Van Nuys courtrooms, absorbing the cases of drunk drivers  accused of homicide. She comforted the survivors and committed herself to  understanding the intricacies of the legal system, so she would be ready when  her turn came.  </P> <P> Hanzlik's turn came Monday when the man accused of killing her 23-year-old  daughter and a friend in a 1982 drunk-driving accident appeared in court after  more than seven years as a fugitive.  </P> <P> Ruben Perez Lemon, 28, is accused of killing Carrie Sue Hanzlik and Paula Ann  Colicci, 21, who were driving home from a birthday party in the early morning  when their car was struck by Lemon's auto at Sherman Way and Reseda Boulevard,  according to court records.  </P> <P> Lemon's car, traveling at 60 m.p.h. to 70 m.p.h., ran a red light and swerved  to avoid two pedestrians in a crosswalk before hitting Hanzlik's car, according  to court records. According to the records, Lemon fled and was arrested later  at his home. He posted $5,000 bail and fled to Mexico.  </P> <P> He was arrested again Thursday as he stood on a corner in the 20800 block of  Ventura Boulevard. Police would not say how they located him.  </P> <P> Lemon pleaded not guilty Monday to charges of two counts of vehicular  manslaughter, two counts of driving under the influence of alcohol and one  count of hit-and-run. Bail was set at $200,000. A preliminary hearing was  scheduled for May 23  </P> <P> Hanzlik said of Lemon in court: "It feels like finally we're going to see an  end to this. We're going to get to a place in our life where we can go on with  it. The last 7 1/2 years have been somewhat of a limbo for us."  </P></p>

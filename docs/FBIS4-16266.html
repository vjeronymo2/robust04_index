			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Dialogue between Sergey Volkov, editor of the analysis </F> section of the newspaper ABV, and Mikhail Ustyugov, editor of  the economics section of the newspaper EKSPRESS K: "It Seems the  Asphalt Is Melting With the Last Snow. Whatever the Demand for  Democracy-- Such Will Be the Supply"]    [Text] [Volkov] Regardless of how much the subject of  elections may have recently set our teeth on edge, we will have  to say something about them, summing up the March results. As  predicted, voter activity turned out to be the lowest in recent  decades. Although in terms of this indicator we are still  probably "ahead of the rest of the planet," social apathy is  clearly on the rise in Kazakhstan. But if in developed  countries slow activity in the electoral precincts is explained  by the lack of confidence in politicians as a class (they say  that without them they could figure out their problems), in our  country, this phenomenon has a different subtext. Here the  people are tired of political games and, the main thing, they do  not believe in the possibility of stabilizing the situation with  the help of new deputies.    The passivity of a certain part of the population has  indirectly "supported" the executive power, which from the very  beginning without beating around the bush has taken to slipping  in (there is no other word for it) people it wants or finds  helpful. Of course, such a policy could not fail to evoke  hostility from certain voters who were already weary of  mindlessly obeying the powers that be.    [Ustyugov] Here are some characteristic figures obtained as  a  result of a sociological poll conducted by workers of the  Republic Center for Study of Public Opinion. People of  Kazakhstan were asked which problems bother them most today.  Two-thirds answered: the decline of the standard of living, and  only one out of 20 mentioned the lack of democratic freedoms.  Whatever the demand for freedom-- such is the supply. As a  result, we have been given elections that are conducted, as the  president put it, according to Kazakhstan's standards of  democracy. Who is to blame for the fact that they turned out to  be quite unlike the Western ones? There is American democracy,  there is the general European standard, there is the Chinese,  the Chilean, and there is Kazakhstan's. And ours is probably  far from the worst, even if it did baffle CSCE experts. In any  case a good half of the deputies (not counting those elected  through the state list) were elected, in my view, without any  violations or juggling of figures.    As for the activity of the electorate, the answer is  provided  again by the figures from the poll of the Republic Center for  Study of Public Opinion. Only 7.5 percent of those questioned  are counting on effective activity from the new legislative  organ, and the rest think that the members of parliament engage  partially in talkathons and partially in lofty abstractions that  have nothing directly to do with real life, which is ruled not  by laws but by local bureaucrats.    I do not know whether the sociologists were interested in  the  reaction of Kazakhstan residents to a possible turn toward  authoritarian power, with complete elimination of the  legislative branch, but I do not think they would respond with  any special disturbance or misgivings here either: The past four  months, during which the president has had additional authority  and published edicts instead of signing laws, have shown the  "elasticity" of Kazakhstan's democratic standards and the fact  that they are not ingrained in the very essence of the political  system, social life, and mentality of the citizens.  <H5>  The Fortress of Power and the "Degree" of Loyalty </H5>   [Volkov] And still, in spite of the back-room games that  have  weeded out many politicians who were really needed in the  Supreme Council, the new parliament will certainly not be in the  government's pocket.    In the first place, certain deputies have remained from the  preceding Supreme Council to join the current one, and the  majority of them are extremely opposed to the policy being  conducted today by the higher and middle echelons of power.    In the second place, no fewer if not more of the new members  of parliament also share the aforementioned dislike for the  actions of the government.    True, a part of the St. Petersburg corps is elected from the  state or, more precisely, the president's list. Their position  is unenviable. On the one hand, they were elected by the people  and, quite naturally, must defend their interests. On the  other, the fact that they were nominated by the head of state  places on them certain moral (not to mention other) obligations  to the president. This kind of duality (one might call it a  "split personality") of a considerable number of the people's  elect could undoubtedly play a self-destructive role in the new  parliament. Add to this the division of the Supreme Council  into two chambers (and many observers consider this all but a  fait accompli) and it becomes clear that for the first time our  deputies will be engaged in "mud slinging" at one another and  the government at the same time. I think the former will still  win out and the rest of the problems will be classified as  internal parliamentary ones.    A distinguishing feature of March was the active preparation  of certain people for posts in the Supreme Council. Today,  nobody any longer conceals the fact that Kuanysh Suyltanov  should become the leader of one of the chambers of parliament.  His conspicuous dismissal from the position of deputy prime  minister because of "election to people's deputy" long before  the beginning of the work of the first session was to have shown  to the least quick-witted that this statesmen had now seriously  taken up the cause of building  a new parliament.    [Ustyugov] The main task of the "script writers" who today  are preparing the basis for the first session is to provide for  a structure of the legislative organ and a mechanism for its  activity that will enable the executive power to function  freely. Parliament is to play a constructive-decorative role  and nothing more. Above all it will be necessary to undertake a  number of organizational measures aimed at holding back,  dragging out, and "self-entanglement" of decisions that run  counter to government policy. The complicated bicameral  structure, the system of relations between the two chambers, and  the regulations work to this end. Many a week will probably be  devoted to these questions.    Otherwise, the standoff between the powers would begin  almost  on the first day of the session. And what good does it do that  the amount of the minimum wage and pension in the Republic is  approaching the value of one U.S. dollar? They will call the  prime minister to the podium and vote, say, for increasing the  "minimum" to the value of the minimum consumer basket -- 400  tenge. The citizens will rejoice. Tomorrow they will all be  given 10 times more money. The day after tomorrow all the  prices will rise 10-fold. Will they summon the prime minister  to the podium again?    I am not speaking about the Republic budget, from which all  benefits for war veterans, misplaced residents of the Aral Sea  area, Semipalatinsk victims, Chernobyl victims, and those who  suffered from the repressions have been eliminated. What kind  of parliament would approve such a decision?    There is only one way out: Raise the "degree" of  parliamentary loyalty, which will make it possible to assign to  the president additional authority (in any case in the economic  sphere) throughout the entire period of the "transition." Then  the government will have its hands tied and the people's  deputies will have it easier: There will be no need to waver  between the Scylla and Charybdis of schism and disbandment.  <H5>  There Is More Room on Olympus </H5>   [Volkov] The personnel changes that occurred in March again  evoked more questions than answers. The "reassignment" of  Tulegen Zhukeyev from the position of state adviser to the  vacant post of deputy prime minister with the present  leapfrogging in functional duties of members of the government  make it impossible to understand whether this was a  reinforcement of a "weak section" in the administration of the  state or a demotion of some ill-favored person (recall how some  of the functions were "taken away" from the former state  adviser), or simply a change of the official title of the  position held by Mr. Zhukeyev, leaving him in charge of all the  sections he had before. The customary curtain of complete  secrecy over transfers like this leaves no chance of figuring  out the real reasons for the aforementioned actions.    Nor does the discharge of Marat Ospanov from the position of  the republic's chief tax collector because of his election as a  deputy a month before the beginning of the work of the  parliament provide an answer to the question of whether this is  related to his forthcoming active work in the new Supreme  Council or if there are some other factors at work here. It is  no accident, probably, that President Sergey Tereshchenko  recently said reproachfully that last year the tax services of  Kazakhstan collected only 42 percent of the taxes that were due.  Such "kindness" to the taxpayers at a time that is so difficult  for the state budget cannot but make one wonder. With respect  for Mr. Ospanov as a politician, I still cannot help but ask  what actually were the reasons for his desire to be among the  people's deputies again and why the Republic leaders supported  him in this? This question could be asked of several of those  who were elected in March.    [Ustyugov] I can add only that Zhukeyev's appointment as  deputy prime minister, from the standpoint of the Basic Law,  reinforces his positions since nothing is said about state  advisers in the Constitution. I would not be surprised if the  president eliminated the institution of state advisers  altogether this year.  <H5>  We Have Too Few Fedorovs But Too Many Zaveryukhas </H5>   [Volkov] March was also very instructive in the area of our  leaders' outside contacts. The tendencies here are such that  the Almaty leaders have already come up with a universal  "lamentation." Bouncing along the pothole-filled highways of the  capital (the impression was that the asphalt would melt along  with the last snow), they say: If the president had not  travelled abroad so frequently and had traveled on our roads,  things would be easier for us. Let us overlook the concreteness  of this complaint-request and discuss the principle of its  origin. It is very good that both Nursultan Nazarbayev and the  country he heads have a positive image abroad. It is even  better that considerable amounts of funds in dollars are  allotted to this country. But beyond that, as in the Soviet  Union in Gorbachev's times, everything practically comes to a  standstill. How, why, and where this money is spent--we do not  know. A fresh example. Having concluded an agreement with the  IMF and having received a guarantee that Kazakhstan would  receive a large foreign currency loan, our government stated  repeatedly that the money would be spent, among other things,  for stabilizing exchange rate of the tenge and curbing  inflation. In March, we could see quite well how these  intentions are being realized when on the eve of the elections  the dollar was surging upward and by April Fool's Day it had  doubled its tenge value -- and that was in one  month!    If things continue like this it will not be long before it  will be possible to have another financial reform in order to  reduce the scale of the Republic's monetary unit. Such  fantasies are nourished by the appearance in circulation of  bills worth 200 tenge and the word from the president about his  intention to buy from Great Britain special equipment on which  our monetary bills are printed. If the former information evokes  regret about such a rapid devaluation of the national currency  (it is no joke that within four months after the monetary reform  they will issue a denomination worth twice as much as the  nominal value of the largest monetary bill!), the latter causes  misgivings that soon the printing of tenge will turn into an  uncontrolled process of issuing money that rapidly loses its  value.    [Ustyugov] We do not have the appropriate political support  for a stricter financial exchange rate in Kazakhstan. The  Cabinet of Ministers is a monotonous, uniform monolith, and the  struggle of approaches and concepts (if it exists at all) is  left to the cadres. It is necessary to reveal (or create?) a  multipolarity of government similar to the Russian: We must have  our own Fedorovs who are ready to fall in battle against  preferential credit and our own Zaveryukhas and Skokovs, who  express the interests of the agro-industrial generals. But now  one gets the impression that the government expresses only its  own interests, which only it can understand, and therefore,  today it is capable of canceling out what it categorically  declared yesterday, and tomorrow it will no less resolutely  return to the other side. And all this without conflicts,  polemics, or resignations, with concerted, inspired enthusiasm.  The result is that the general deterioration of the situation  (and it is inevitable this year) is linked by the citizens not  to concrete officials representing various ideas and interests,  but the government and president as a whole. Today, the head of  state must distance himself from the Cabinet of  Ministers--beginning with separation of the staffs and ending  with the appointment to the position of prime minister of a  really respected strategist. Instead of this, Nazarbayev takes  the "fire" himself, signing first populist and economically  ideologized and then monetaristic-draconian decisions. There is  an ancient truth that the more you take on, the more they ask of  you. Appeals to create global conferences and alliances with  supernational kopeks sound good on world-scale spaces, but they  do not solve our internal problems.  <H5>  Do Not Grieve Over the Exchanges, Lads </H5>   [Volkov] Kazakhstan is sometimes discussed in terms of a sad  principle: Either something good or nothing at all. The decline  of the production rates, the shutting down of hundreds of  enterprises, and the nonpayments crisis have become typical  phenomena. It would not be so bad if behind all this one could  see positive tendencies in economic processes. Alas, even the  documents the president and prime minister have signed, taking  advantage of parliament's absence, give one no confidence that  with their implementation our economy will reach any significant  heights. Two recent edicts will serve as an example: "On  Commodity Exchanges" and "On Measures for Forming Securities."  Their adoption clearly shows that the country's leaders today  are more interested in the problem of "staking out" as quickly  as possible (before the beginning of the work of the Supreme  Council) the basic points of their own economic policy than in  actually implementing it. There has already been too much  discussion of the sad fate of the Kazakhstan stock exchanges,  which vanished not only because they were excessively numerous,  but also because of the fact that they were not included in the  government schemes. So many lances, arrows, and other piercing  writing implements have been broken over the creation of normal  conditions for the formation of the securities market. Since it  still does not exist, two legislative acts prepared by the  executive power (another paradox of our legal thinking) will  come out, and everyone is supposed to think that tomorrow  everything will be okay in the corresponding areas of the  economy. But in reality, little will change as a result of the  creation of state organs for questions of markets and securities  (and these are the provisions that are the linchpins of these  edicts), the more so taking into account the current degree of  state influence over the economy. Why do these issues have to  be raised again today? Is it really just in order to show that  the executive power has its finger on the pulse of the reforms?    [Ustyugov] Incidentally, the government commission for  developing the concept of the functioning of the securities  market in Kazakhstan was created about two years ago and it  seems that it has not convened once since then. Russia has  adopted hundreds of normative acts aimed at the formation and  civilized regulation of this extremely important variable in a  market economy. We are just beginning. Well, we can still  console ourselves: Better late than never.</p>

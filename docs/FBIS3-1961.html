According to Huang Ju, mayor of the city, Shanghai plans to  export 8.5 billion U.S. dollars-worth of goods this year, an  increase of 15.4 percent over last year and exceeding the growth  of its gross domestic product.    Last year saw the city export 7.34 billion U.S.  dollars-worth, keeping the same pace with the expansion of its  GDP.    "However, Shanghai's leading position in economic  development  has required it to further develop its foreign trade," the mayor  noted.    Huang called on foreign trade departments to strive to  export  at least 8.5 billion U.S. dollars-worth of goods this year and  goods valued at 10 billion U.S. dollars next year.    To accomplish the objective, the municipal government has  decided to adjust its industrial structure and organize  enterprise groups while adopting an investment policy to  encourage foreign trade departments.</p>

			<p>Products'   Sentenced   <F P=102> 94WD0396 London THE DAILY TELEGRAPH in English 21 May 94 p 9 </F> <F P=103> 94WD0396 </F> <F P=104>  London THE DAILY TELEGRAPH </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO     [Text] One of two men found guilty of smuggling &pound;60  million worth of drugs was jailed for 25 years yesterday.    The haul was hidden in a tanker full of egg yolk products  which was driven into Britain through Dover docks.    It was stopped in Dagenham, Essex, and the drugs were  recovered after the tanker was unloaded, Maidstone Crown Court  was told.    Robert Doubtfire, 32, from Broadwalk, Blackheath, south  London, and Frans van Taternhove, 44, a Dutchman, had denied the  charges.    Taternhove was jailed for 25 years and the &pound;8,000 in  cash  that he had on him when arrested was confiscated. No other  assets could be traced. Doubtfire will be sentenced next week.  Judge David Croft, QC [expansion not given], said: "This  smuggling operation was an attack on society."    After the case, Det Insp Peter Ship, said: "This was a very  sophisticated operation. A lot of money was spent on setting up  the tanker to conceal the drugs."    The containers were riveted shut and made to look invisible.    "The tanker's tachograph was set up in such a manner that it  gave the impression the lorry was on a completely different  route, which made it very hard to trace," said the inspector.    "We have taken two criminals off the street and hit  organised  crime where it hurts most," he added.</p>

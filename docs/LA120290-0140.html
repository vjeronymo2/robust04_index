			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IRONIC AND TRAGIC  </P> <P> I cannot imagine what it would be like to have no home to return to, no  familiar place to lay my head at night, no friendly voice to ask in the  morning, "Did you sleep well?" Nor can I imagine what it would be like to be  discharged from a hospital stay and not be able to say, "I am going home."  </P> <P> There are six persons with AIDS who are living in the Fraternity House in  Oceanside because they have no other place to go. They receive loving care and  attention around the clock. In the past three years, more than 100 people with  this disease-without-a-cure have been cared for there; 70 of them have died.  The numbers are not huge, but they represent seriously sick human beings who  require comfort and care.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, they do not always find compassion.  </P> <P> Places like Fraternity House must exist until the day comes when health  insurance will cover all costs and education will wipe out both homophobia and  the multitude of myths about the disease.  </P> <P> Tragically, Fraternity House has just been informed that an anticipated $10,000  grant from Wells Fargo Bank will not be available. Fraternity House receives no  public money. The size of the grant is infinitesimal when one compares it to  the millions wasted in Sacramento and Washington. But to six patients, those  dollars represent three daily meals, regular medication, competent nursing  care, clean linen, heat and the rest of the comforts that most of us take for  granted.  </P> <P> It is difficult for me to understand how we spend so much money in this country  for so many causes without any apparent attempt at prioritizing. I cannot  resist noting that, printed on the back of the story about the grant loss,  there is an article titled "Wanted: Private Jet for Five Finicky Passengers,"  (Nov. 20).  </P> <P> The San Diego Zoo seeks "$50,000 to charter a jet to fly five gorillas from  Cincinnati and Philadelphia" to San Diego. Moving gorillas across the country  must certainly pose a problem. As a Diamond Club member of the Zoological  Society of San Diego, I know how important those animals are to the zoo and to  the public. The irony, nevertheless, remains.  </P> <P> AGNES HERMAN, San Marcos  </P></p>

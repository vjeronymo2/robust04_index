			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Japanese flop sparks pricing rethink - International Japan's finance ministry is rethinking how to price equity offerings, as the result of what could become a costly hitch to its latest privatisation, that of Japan Tobacco, the state monopoly cigarette maker. The ministry is under fire from both Japanese and foreign securities houses over the second privatisation issue to go wrong since the introduction of tough new rules on the conduct of equity offerings at the end of the 1980s. An embarrassed ministry announced on Friday that there were no buyers for more than 65 per cent of the 436,666 shares allotted to small investors in Japan Tobacco. As a result, the ministry runs the risk of falling Y408bn short of the Y958bn (Dollars 9.75bn) it had hoped to raise from the share issue. The ministry is offering a total of 666,666 shares to individuals and institutions, comprising a one-third stake in the company. At the issue price of Y1.438m (Dollars 14,631) a share, Japan Tobacco is valued at Y2,876bn (Dollars 29.3bn). It is unlikely, in these circumstances, that other small investors will voluntarily take up many of the left-over shares, say brokers. Ministry officials will decide what to do on the results of a second attempt to allocate unwanted shares by lottery. The final reckoning will be on Thursday, when payments on those shares fall due. The flop increases the likelihood that Japan Tobacco's share price will fall when trading starts a week later, on October 27, unless the finance ministry keeps the unwanted shares. If the ministry fails to step in, a heavy loss could be on the way for big investors. That could destabilise an already weak equity market and guarantee a poor reception for future privatisation issues, like West Japan Railway early next year and another tranche of the already-privatised Nippon Telegraph and Telephone. Japan's equity pricing system, to be fair, does serve the purpose for which it was designed. It stops companies on the way to the market from covertly handing out cheap shares to friends in high places, as was the case in the late 1980s Recruit shares for favours scandal, which provoked the rule change. In drawing up the new rules for pricing shares, the finance ministry took its inspiration for the auction system it has used for many years to sell government bonds. The result produces a system very different from that normally used for international share sales. One third of the shares to be issued are auctioned in advance to rich individuals and institutional investors. The rest are sold by lottery to the public, at the mid-price of bids made in the auction. This drains off all the surplus institutional demand for the shares, before the issue even gets to the public, argue the system's critics, and ensures that the first few days' trading will be more likely to show a loss than in other international issues, which give advisers more scope to set the price at a level likely to stimulate the market. Big investors must pay the price they bid in the pre-offer auction, even if they are unlucky enough to have bid above the mid-price. In Japan Tobacco's case, bids accepted by the finance ministry ranged from Y1.36m a share, up to Y2.11m, probably at the top end of total bids received. 'This way, you get no after-market,' complains one foreign broker. A second problem is that the pre-offer auction risks setting a misleading price, in Japan Tobacco's case clearly higher than thousands of small investors will bear. It only reflects the valuation accorded to the shares by the biggest and richest one-third of investors, rather than the demand from all potential buyers. Japan Tobacco is not the only example of a flotation to have hit trouble under this system. Japan Telecom, a private sector long distance telephone operator, was a high profile flop only last month, despite the fact Nomura Securities priced it at a discount to the auction mid-price. Mass selling orders for JR East, a privatisation issue, made the stock exchange's computers break down and hit the whole market last October. Foreign lobbyists, like the European Business Council, have for years been urging the finance ministry to adopt something like the book-building system of pricing shares, used in most international equity issues. This would reduce the mathematical distortions of the Japanese system, it is argued. The finance ministry does not usually cave in easily to outside pressure. But it has a clear self-interest in ensuring a smooth reception for future attempts to raise government revenue from privatisations, at a time when its tax revenues are short of target.</p>

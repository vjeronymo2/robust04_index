			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / UK Company News: A look at the life and times of an empire builder - Hillsdown chief to quit HILLSDOWN Holdings' share price rose yesterday after it was announced that Sir Harry Solomon was quitting as chairman. 'That says it all, doesn't it,' laughs Sir Harry, an irrepressibly good humoured and self-effacing man, who is anxious to be reassured that he is doing the right thing. He decided some time ago that at the age of 55 and after 17 years in his second career, it was the right time personally to move on and the right time for the company to have a new chairman. That role will be taken from next April's annual meeting by Sir John Nott, the former politician and merchant banker. Sir Harry, knighted in 1991, says there has been no pressure from shareholders to leave. However, some in the stock market, have been seeking more focus and less unpredictability from Hillsdown. The group's earnings per share fell in 1990 and 1991, and are expected to fall again this year. The shares reached a low in September, when the yield rose to 14 per cent despite assurances that the dividend would be held. It was a different story when Hillsdown floated in 1985. Then acquisitive companies were fashionable, and chairmen found themselves the subjects of personality cults. Unlike some of the stars of the 1980s who courted publicity, Sir Harry is a rather private man, refusing, for example, to have his photograph taken. His first career, which lasted 15 years, was as a solicitor. He started as a criminal lawyer. 'I defended a few murderers,' he admits. Some were cleared, others were jailed. 'And some of them still send me Christmas cards,' he says. But it was in 1966 that the seeds of Hillsdown were sown, though the company was not founded until 1975. In 1966 Sir Harry's wife was expecting their first child. She made friends with another woman at her ante-natal class, and soon the two husbands met. The other husband was David Thompson, who ran a family meat business, and he became a client of Sir Harry's whose law practice had moved by then towards commercial and property work. By 1975 Sir Harry had had enough of being a solicitor and the two decided to set up Hillsdown - the name also of Mr Thompson's house. The business did not go far until the early 1980s when 'there were a lot of opportunities around, a bit like now,' says Sir Harry. Hillsdown did deal after deal, buying Lockwoods, the canning business from the receiver in 1981, Buxted chickens from Imperial Group in 1982, buying back Mr Thompson's family meat company from Imperial, the Smedley canning company in 1983 and many more. As one analyst says, 'they were buying very cheaply, on cheap bank debt, and leveraging on rising asset values.' That was the period Sir Harry now looks back on as the best of times. 'When we were doing some of the first deals, when everyone was tremendously enthusiastic, things were coming right, the management style was beginning to work.' By 1985 the group needed more capital to expand, and floated on the stock market. Its offer was nine times oversubscribed. In the same year it bid for Christie-Tyler, a furniture group, and two years later bought Fairview, a housebuilder. More deals followed, such as the purchase in 1989 of Premier Brands, the Typhoo tea group. Shares were issued to fund the expansion, and Mr Thompson, who had held the bulk of the original Hillsdown shares, left the business and sold shares too. The Premier Brands deal, for instance, was financed by a Pounds 110m placing. As the 1980s turned to the 1990s aggressive expansion went out of fashion, and Hillsdown found itself struggling with tougher trading conditions, and a less enthusiastic shareholder following. It was then that Sir Harry's worst time came. In January 1991 bear raiders circulated rumours about the group and the shares plunged. The market's fear of Hillsdown's ability to shock gained strength after the company sprung a rights issue in September last year, a surprise from which the share price has yet to recover. Stock market analysts think that the company may never regain the premium rating it enjoyed after it floated. But they believe the rating can recover if the Hillsdown empire, which has extended to North America and Europe, becomes focused; if the swings in profitability in divisions such as poultry can be ironed out; and if the business can be shifted towards its higher margin activities. Interests such as poultry, eggs and red meat, at the commodity end of the food industry, have suffered in the recession but the food processing businesses - such as Premier Brands and prepared meals - have fared better. Sir Harry thinks 'change is good for one'. But so far he has made no firm plans for his third career, remaining fully committed to Hillsdown until next April. But he will be going to Arsenal's ground on Saturday to see Middlesborough, his home team, playing. And whatever else he does - jogging, trekking, playing tennis or collecting historical autographed documents - one thing he will not do. 'I will not be pruning roses' he promises.</p>

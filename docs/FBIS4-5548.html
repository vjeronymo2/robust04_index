			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- The Central Peoples'  Committee and the Administration Council of the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea Thursday sent a joint message of  greetings to the International Chuche Idea Seminar on  Independence, Peace and Friendship which opened in New Delhi in  celebration of the 82nd birthday of the great leader President  Kim Il-song.    The current seminar is of particular significance as it is  open at a time of historical turn when the cold war ended and  the desire of the popular masses for independence has grown  stronger than ever before, the joint message says, and goes on:    The chuche idea is the most independent idea for defence of  the independence of the country and its free development against  all manner of domination and subjugation; it is a peaceloving  and internationalist idea which opposes aggression and war and  urges the peoples of all countries to love and cooperate with  one another and achieve common prosperity.    As they have strictly applied the chuche idea to the  building  of a new society under the wise guidance of the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il,  the Korean people have been able to build an independent  socialism centred on the popular masses and firmly defend the  sovereignty of the country and strengthen friendship and  solidarity with the world progressive people in face of the  imperialists' moves to stifle our country, which have been  intensified as never before.    When the idea of independence, peace and friendship  indicated  by the chuche idea is upheld, the age-old desire of mankind to  live a free and peaceful life in an independent world and  achieve an eternal prosperity, uniting and cooperating with one  another, will certainly be realized.    Although there still remain on the globe the old forces  seeking domination and subjugation, aggression and war and the  people's cause of independence is undergoing a grim test, it is  temporary and no force on earth can arrest the onward movement  of mankind on the track of independence.    The message expresses the belief that the seminar will make  a  great contribution to the accomplishment of the noble cause of  mankind for realizing the idea of independence, peace and  friendship and wishes the seminar success.</p>

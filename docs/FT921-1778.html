			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Candidate finds electorate 'switching off' BIRMINGHAM, HALL GREEN Conservative majority 7,621 Labour requires 8.4% swing to win. 46% of voters are middle class, 13% managerial/professional. THE CONSERVATIVE offensive against Labour tax policies has been, in the case of Birmingham Hall Green, rather like firing cannonballs into the desert. The sand pays little attention. Even Mr Andrew Hargreaves, seeking to retain the seat for the Conservatives, would go no further than saying that 'the issue is there lurking in the background'. At the moment, 'everything is a switch-off', he added. 'The problem is getting the electors to focus.' This makes the issue easier for Labour to handle, but Ms Jane Slowey, the party's Hall Green candidate, observed that the tax issue comes and goes: 'It's not the issue it was four or five weeks ago.' Mr David McGrath, the Liberal Democrat candidate, noted that the two main issues in the constituency were the recession on one hand and law and order on the other. Hall Green has its own political agenda running parallel with the national debate. This is a reflection of the local party balance and of the nature of the constituency. Mr Hargreaves polled 44.9 per cent of the vote in the 1987 election. But, between them, Labour with 28 per cent and the Alliance with 27 per cent gained more votes. 'Andrew Hargreaves has a political rather than a personal following,' said Mr Carl Chinn, the Birmingham University community historian, who lives in the constituency. This implies that his political future depends not only on how the anti-Conservative vote splits but also on the degree of success the Tories have in conveying their national message. This is a constituency of the middle classes, but not of the the best-off. It is a constituency of upwardly mobile skilled workers who have tended towards the Conservatives, but with a strong sprinkling of Irish people, who are traditionally Labour voters. While in Billesley and Brandwood there is a 50-50 split between owner-occupied and council housing, in the Hall Green ward owner-occupation jumps to about 80 per cent. Unemployment levels have consistently been beneath the city average, but have been rising. 'In any Birmingham constituency worry about cars is more crucial than tax,' said Mr Chinn, reflecting the west Midlands preoccupation with the future of the motor industry. The tax issue comes forward indirectly. Concern seems to focus less on tax levels as on obtaining the best value for each pound paid in tax.</p>

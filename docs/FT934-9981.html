			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: City salaries The news that arbitrageurs are managing to collect million-pound salaries once more caused a predictable kerfuffle among the excitable classes. It will doubtless encourage those members of the worshipful company of arbitrageurs who are still anonymous to keep their heads down from now on. City salaries are high compared with other occupations. This is in part because although the fees charged are small in relation to the quantity of funds handled, they are large in relation to the small groups of professionals required to handle the transactions. Individuals are also often in a strong bargaining position since they can readily identify their apparent contribution to profitability. Yet the variance with other occupations is so great that there remains a suspicion that institutions are mis-pricing even the most arcane skills which they are buying. Part of that deviation may arise because the apparent profitability is not properly costed to take into account the full support functions. Some of the particularly highly-paid individuals have relationships with their employers which more closely resemble joint equity ventures. In bad years, however, they do not cover a proportion of the losses. Mr Peter Wood of Direct Line, by contrast, actually sold an equity interest in a business to Royal Bank of Scotland in return for his service contract. Significantly, even before the latest rumours concerning the flotation of Direct line, he had been considering exchanging his large employee bonus for an equity interest in RBS.</p>

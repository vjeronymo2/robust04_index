			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Election address by presidential candidate Leonid Kuchma -- </F> live or recorded]    [Excerpts] Esteemed voters, I am very pleased to have the  opportunity to speak to you again, to reflect, to set forth my  views for the present and the future. After long reflection I  decided to join on the difficult election campaign for the  highest post -- that of president of Ukraine. I made this  decision because I am deeply convinced that no one can stand  aside when people are (?living in poverty).    I believe that the people of Ukraine deserve a better fate  and a better life than what we have today. For now, the whole  people have been forced to pay a terrible price for the  incompetence and short-sightedness, the lack of will and refusal  to work of those who governed the state for four years [words  indistinct], talk, make promises, and turn entirely different  things into reality. It is much easier to lay the blame on four  consecutive governments.    Recently we have all witnessed the unprecedented propaganda  campaign which has developed against me personally and against  the political course for which I stand. These [word indistinct]  are numerous accusations of antipatriotism, the desire to  restore the Soviet Union, to give away Crimea and the Black Sea  Fleet to Russia, anonymous falsehoods, plain lies, and an  information blockade.    Why has there been so much of this? I will reply. Those who  do this are simply afraid, they are afraid that they will have  to answer for betraying the hopes of the people, for the  collapse of the economy, for helping corruption and criminal  structures, for the unprecedented impoverishment of the people.    So maybe it is time to think about it -- maybe the trouble  is  that the state does not have a master.    A few words about the present economic situation, which has  become catastrophic in the last half-year, when Ukraine's  industry practically came to a stop. Adventurism in the economy  undoubtedly (?governs) [word indistinct] now. [passage omitted]  The country, according to all economic laws, is on the verge of  a catastrophe, and the people (?are without means) of existence.  Believe me, it is painful to watch, when crime prevails  everywhere, while honest people are unable to survive or feed  their children.    I am certain that if the current economic and political  course stays the same, even worse times and even greater ruin  await Ukraine. I am convinced that order has to be brought to  Ukraine, and that this can only be done when the individual and  his rights are at the center of attention of all branches of  power - legislative, executive, and judicial. All citizens (?of  Ukraine have to feel) equal, irrespective of their nationality,  religion, or position. I (?believe) and will endeavor for all  to be equal in the eyes of the law, and for the law to be above  all.    I want to assure you that if I am elected president, I,  Leonid Kuchma, am ready to assume all responsibility for the  state of affairs in the country, without looking for someone  else to take over the burden of problems.    I am deeply convinced that Ukraine needs a new economic and  political course. It will include a rejection of  self-isolation, the restoration of all mutually advantageous  economic, spiritual, and cultural links with the former  republics of the Soviet Union, above all with Russia. In my  opinion, Ukraine is not a cordon sanitaire between Europe and  Russia. Ukraine is a [word indistinct] bridge between West and  East. It is a country which should be open for cooperation  [word indistinct]. Only then will new technologies and  resources come here. Our state's future lies in using them.    But now the economy is a hostage to unwise policies. My aim  has always been and will be for the economy to be above  everything else. Because I am convinced that Ukraine will become  a real state only when the economy starts working, when  production starts to increase, when we create a powerful  economic system. All conditions for this exist here.    How to do this? If I am elected president of Ukraine, I  consider it necessary to restore, without interference by the  state, the abruptly disrupted economic links, to create a single  economic space with CIS countries on the model of the European  Community or the American Free Trade Area. I consider it  necessary to strive for Ukraine's full-fledged entry into the  economic union and will speak in favor of all states signing a  currency and customs agreement on equal terms.    Customs-houses and borders should record and monitor the  movement of goods and protect our domestic market, but  ill-thought out and irrational customs duties need to be  eliminated. Retail prices will immediately go down, which every  citizen of Ukraine will notice.    I think that in the economic sphere we need, above all, to  conduct market reforms vigorously. Not reforms for the sake of  reforms, but for the sake of the well-being of the people.  Because otherwise they will be doomed to [word indistinct].    If I am elected president, the taxation system will be  reviewed and liberalized. Income should not be taxed, only  profits should be taxed, as is the practice worldwide. The  fixed exchange rate between the karbovanets and the dollar will  be urgently eliminated. It destroys all of our exports and makes  production loss-making.    Equal conditions for the existence of all forms of ownership  will be ensured -- state, private, and collective ownership.  The financial and banking spheres will be put in order.  Permanent (?economic) regulations for the (?ruble zone) and  Ukrainian enterprise will be created.    In the area of state-building I am in favor of granting as  many rights as possible to the regions in resolving economic and  cultural problems. This in particular will reliably guarantee  Ukraine's territorial integrity and current borders.    I will strive to grant official status to the Russian  language in Ukraine, with Ukrainian retaining the status of  state language. (?We) believe that the situation whereby Russian  has the rights of a foreign language here is not only a mistake,  but a dangerous mistake.    I have never talked anywhere about restoring the Soviet  Union, because a return to the past is impossible. But I will  do everything so that Ukraine develops good-neighborly relations  with all countries, especially with those with which we are  linked by history, culture, and economy.    I want to emphasize that the course toward mutually  advantageous strategic partnership with Russia does not mean  that we should have less friendly relations with the United  States or France, say. I have never concealed that I am a  supporter of Ukrainian statehood. (?But I have always) been and  will continue to be a resolute opponent of developing statehood  on the foundations of isolationism and anti-Russian sentiments.    I want to speak separately about the problems of rural  areas.  [passage omitted] I regard as inadmissible [words indistinct]  the forced (?division) of collective farms, for they are now our  main source of food. I will have an attentive and careful  attitude to property reforms concerning the land. I think that  collective farms' land should not be sold, but should belong to  those who cultivate it. But unproductive land, land under  buildings and factories, dacha plots, should be sold freely.  Otherwise private foreign capital will not come to us.    In social policy my fundamental position is this: state  education and health care should be free, because, tell me  please, who here can pay for this now? A handful of people.  The wages of doctors, teachers, servicemen, and the militia  should ensure a dignified life for the individual, and not a  half-starved existence. I do not want students and pensioners  to be beggars in our country. But increasing wages to [word  indistinct], grants and pensions, can be done only if production  starts to work, and if there are radical changes in the  structure of the budget. [passage omitted]    My opponents shamelessly [words indistinct] special powers,  but did not use them. But I only had the illusion of power,  because real power means personnel, administrative structures,  finances and law enforcement bodies. All of this was in the  hands of the president and the Supreme Council. The government  only had the right to issue decrees, which were coordinated with  the president's team, the president personally, and with the  Supreme Council. This was only the illusion of power, I repeat.  My opponents maintain that I (?began) to campaign against the  mafia, but I did not take the matter to its conclusion. But my  government conducted hundreds of checks and inspections and  handed over quite a few [word indistinct] to the procuracy and  the law enforcement [words indistinct].    I want to assure you that if I am elected president, I will  have sufficient powers and resoluteness to take what has been  started to its conclusion. I am in general convinced that the  new president should from the outset declare real war on  corruption and crime. My opponents are trying to blame Kuchma  for the price increases but I know that any respectable  scientific [word indistinct] can confirm that those who were not  able to or could not (?take) political decisions were to blame  for the increases in prices. And (?I was virtually declared an  enemy) for the attempt to conclude an economic union (?with  Russia).    But it was understandable to all that an economic union  meant  markets for our goods, stability of prices for energy-carriers,  millions of permanent jobs for workers. I am convinced that  time will (?change understanding) and many people will be  ashamed of their actions. Today I want to implement these plans  and ideas, which I was not allowed to implement in 1993. I want  my children and grandchildren to live in a wealthy, democratic  sovereign Ukraine within its current borders, so that (?it is)  equally respected in Russia and America, for them to be proud of  their state.    I want our people to have a worthy life, for order to reign  in the country, and for people to have faith in the future. I  want a master to take charge in Ukraine who is responsible for  everything. All together we have to bring Ukraine out of the  crisis, work together and build, take care of the old and weak.  To do this we need to search for unifying and integrating  (?values), which will unite East and West, North and South. We  have such human values. These are good, work, accord, order, and  decency. Thank you.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / New York state bids Dollars 2.5bn for electricity company The state of New York has decided to buck the worldwide trend towards privatisation by announcing plans for a Dollars 2.53bn (Pounds 1.59bn) takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company, a private sector electricity company quoted on the New York Stock Exchange. While some electricity companies in the US have always been publicly owned, this is believed to be the first time a state has proposed buying out the shareholders of a private-sector company and bringing it into public ownership. Mr Mario Cuomo, the Democratic governor of New York state, says the object of the takeover is to reduce electricity prices for Long Island consumers and businesses. At present, the rates charged by the Long Island Lighting Company - known to its few friends as Lilco - are the highest in the US, if not the world. The bid is likely to prove highly popular with the voters of Long Island. Significantly, it also happens to have been launched at a time when Mr Cuomo is locked in a fierce battle for re-election. Lilco's electricity prices are high because the company is burdened with Dollars 5.3bn of debt, the legacy of spending Dollars 5.5bn between 1973 and 1984 building a nuclear power station at Shoreham on Long Island, which was dismantled because of public concerns about safety. At present, Lilco's electricity rates are 16.1 cents per kWh for residential customers and 12.35 cents for industrial customers, roughly double the US average. Mr Cuomo says a takeover by the state will result in an immediate 10 per cent cut in those rates, plus another 10-15 per cent cut later. The financial logic of the bid is beguiling. Mr Cuomo says that, under public ownership, Lilco will no longer need to pay federal taxes or shareholder dividends, resulting in immediate savings of Dollars 250m a year. Later, its debt will be refinanced with cheaper public sector debt. The bid itself will be financed through an issue of tax-exempt revenue bonds. Yet if public ownership makes sense for Lilco, some argue, why not nationalise all the other private-sector utilities? Or for that matter, the rest of US industry? Mr James McFadden, a utilities analyst at the securities house Bear Stearns, says: 'The question is whether you want more utilities owned by the government sector or not. Most folks in this country would say you want smaller government, not bigger government, and this runs at cross-purposes with that.' On Friday Lilco said it was 'seriously evaluating' the proposal, but its shares were trading only Dollars 1 1/8 up at Dollars 17 5/8 , far short of the Dollars 21.50 a share proposed by New York state. At that price, the market is betting either that the Federal government will intervene to block the bid - or that Mr Cuomo will not be re-elected to pursue it.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rafael Medina Cruz] </F>   [Text] Over 200 million new pesos' worth of cocaine base,  packaged marijuana, methamphetamine, and heroin (the latter  shipped to Mexico from Thailand) were incinerated yesterday in  Baja California and Sonora States by authorities from the  Attorney General's Office [PGR], the National Defense  Secretariat, various State Human Rights Commissions, and the  health sector.    Jose Antonio Ochoa Palacios, the PGR's representative in  Baja  California, reported the burning of the following drugs in the  Fifth Infantry Battalion's facilities located in the town of  Tijuana's settlement of El Aguaje de la Tuna: approximately 8.5  tons of cannabis indica, 4,237 grams of Thai heroin, 15.5 kg of  methamphetamine, and 38 kg and 585 grams of pure cocaine. The  drugs presumably were intended to be smuggled into the United  States for sale and consumption.    According to reports submitted to the PGR's assistant  attorney for local offices and inspection, Alfonso Cabrera  Morales, the drugs in question, with a market value totaling  several tens of millions of new pesos, were seized by Federal  Judicial Police [PJF] agents assigned to both Tijuana and  Tecate. The PJF's deputy commissioner, Raul Loza Parra,  remarked: "The drugs burned were confiscated within the past two  months."    The event was attended by Ruben Dario Castillo Ferrara, the  district garrison commander; Ricardo M. Legario Z., commander of  the Fifth Infantry Battalion; Jorge Avelaez Palacio, director of  the SSA [Secretariat of Health and Assistance] Health Center in  Tijuana; and Eduardo Garcia Alcaynes, from the PGR's Internal  Comptroller's Office, among others. Representative Ochoa  Palacios underscored the resolute participation of all the  state's social and institutional sectors in the battle against  the drug traffic.    Carlos Jaime Pratt Straffon, the PGR's representative in  Sonora, for his part, reported that approximately nine tons of  compressed marijuana were destroyed at the Hermosillo Hunt Club  and Firing Range facilities located at km 26 of the Bahia de  Quino highway. These drugs also were presumably intended for  shipment to the northern part of the country and, subsequently,  to the United States.    Like Ochoa Palacios, Pratt Straffon addressed that state's  attorney general, Wenceslao Cota Monteya, the State Human Rights  Commission inspectors, Hector Contreras Perez and Jesus Arturo  Pena; as well as the Foreign Relations Secretariat's regional  representative, Alejandro [surname missing]. Straffon emphasized  the valuable, determined participation of the civilian society  and the military, state, and municipal authorities in the daily  battle being waged against the grave, increasing drug  trafficking problem, afflicting everyone alike. He added that  the nearly nine tons of cannabis indica incinerated had been  seized during the past 60 days by federal agents under orders  from the force's assistant representative, Julio Cesar Moralla  Amador.</p>

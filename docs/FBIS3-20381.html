			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara, Mar. 29 (A.A.) -- The Pro-Islamic  Prosperity Party (RP) won the Ankara mayoral election, according  to the latest unofficial results on Tuesday [30 March].    Melih Gokcek, the RP candidate won by a narrow margin over  Social Democrat Populist Party (SHP) candidate Korel Goymen.    The RP made sweeping gains across the country to take third  place overall behind Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's center-right  True Path Party (DYP) and the main opposition Motherland Party  (ANAP).    The RP doubled its share of the vote since the last  nationwide municipal elections in 1989.    Campaigning for a "just order" and adherence to conservative  Islamic values, the RP has found support among the rural  migrants who flocked to the major cities in search of jobs.    The party has never made a serious impact in Ankara, a city  of 3 million and cradle of the secular Turkish Republic founded  by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1923.</p>

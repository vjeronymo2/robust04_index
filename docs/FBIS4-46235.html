			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Jose Maria Monterrey, director of the National  Civilian Police (PNC), has confirmed he has received death  threats and that 15 days ago he was the target of an attempt on  his life.    "These actions come from sectors that have yet to understand  the role of the new society and the democracy being experienced  in the country," Monterrey told LA PRENSA GRAFICA. Monterrey  said that for the past 20 days he has been receiving threatening  phone calls and communiques both at his office and home. He  added that investigations are being conducted to find out who is  responsible.    The PNC director said that some of the threats have already  been carried out, indicating that 15 days ago he was the target  of an attack from which he emerged unharmed. As a result of  this, he has been forced to take security measures. "I have  never in my life had to use bodyguards; I have never even been  armed. Unfortunately, I will have to take some precautions so  as not to ignore these threats," he added.    Monterrey said the PCN has acted firmly against kidnappers,  drug traffickers, car theft gangs, and individuals who have been  illegally using weapons, so some of these sectors might be  responsible for the threats.

			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL OKS RISE IN REDEMPTIONS FOR CONTAINERS  </P> <P> A bill more than doubling the redemption rate on recyclable beverage containers  was approved unanimously Tuesday by the Senate Natural Resources and Wildlife  Committee.  </P> <P> The measure, which was sent to the Appropriations Committee, would raise the  redemption rate from the current 1 cent per container to 5 cents for two  containers.  </P> <P> The bill, authored by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), is an attempt to  improve consumer response to the state's 18-month-old recycling program. With a  minimal 65% recycling goal, the Department of Conservation reported in March  that recycling of beverage containers between July and December of 1988 reached  only 57% for aluminum, 33% for glass and 5% for plastic.  </P> <P> Hart argued that a stronger financial incentive is necessary for California  recycling to be a success. His bill would take effect Jan. 1, 1990.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Goals of Program  </P> <P> Under the bill, two beverage containers would be worth a nickel, and the  larger, 24-ounce plastic containers would be worth a nickel each. With an 80%  recycling goal, any type of container that failed to reach 65% recycling by  Jan. 1, 1993, would be worth a full nickel each. The large plastic containers  would be worth a dime.  </P> <P> "We might see plastic surpass glass in this new configuration," said mark  murray, policy Representatives from Anheuser-Busch, Adolph Coors Co. and the  California Grocers Assn. testified in support of the measure, despite their  previous opposition to recycling/bottle bills. The primary reason industry  leaders support Hart's bill, Murray said, is to avoid a potential initiative by  Californians Against Waste that would raise redemption rates to 5 cents per  container.  </P> <P> Hart said he is confident that his bill will win the two-thirds support of both  houses necessary for passage.  </P> <P> "I think we have a powerful coalition here," Hart said. "It's going take  someone to throw something into the gears to throw this off track."  </P></p>

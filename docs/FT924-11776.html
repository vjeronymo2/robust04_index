			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Amato wins approval for crucial reforms: Boost for effort to curb public sector deficit THE Amato government's efforts to curb Italy's huge public sector deficit received an important boost yesterday when parliament approved a law endorsing a fundamental restructuring of pensions, the health service, local government and the civil service. Inefficiencies and waste in these four areas have been a principal factor in fuelling the public sector deficit, equivalent to over 10.5 per cent of GDP and nearly triple the EC average. The reforms are expected to generate a third of the extra L93,000bn (Pounds 42bn) needed in the 1993 budget, with a cumulative effect thereafter. The breakthrough in parliament was accompanied by welcome external support for the government's reform policies from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris. The OECD took the unusual step of releasing six weeks in advance parts of its annual report on Italy at the government's request. The report concludes that 'the stakes for Italy (in resolving its fiscal crisis) are currently higher that at any period since the second world war'. Mr Philippe Huet, chairman of the OECD committee, said the report warned Italians they had 'no alternative, whatever government is in power in Rome', but to follow Mr Amato's policies. It predicted 1 per cent growth next year. Against the background of this parliamentary vote and with the lira holding reasonably steady around 880 to the D-Mark, senior government officials were predicting a lowering of the discount rate from 15 per cent. The reforms have been rushed through parliament under special procedures, having been first proposed in July. Deputies have approved the broad outlines; the executive now has 90 days to fill in the details. On pensions, the government was obliged to resort to a vote of confidence to speed the measure through. It is taking similar action, probably in both houses, to win approval for the rest of the 1993 measures, hoping in this way that L66,000bn of extra revenue and spending cuts will be approved within the next three weeks. The structural reforms will shake-up the post-war welfare state and put local and public administration on to a more managerial and accountable basis. Pensions will now be brought into line with the EC norm, gradually raising the retirement age for men from 60 to 65 and from 55 to 60 (with incentives to remain until 65) for women. Privileged public sector pensions, available for women after 15 years service and men after 20, will be gradually realigned with the 36 years in the private sector. The health service is going to be removed from political control, and the 640 local health units halved and placed under professional management. The reform of local/regional administration envisages an end to Rome's tight centralised control of funding. In future they will be able to raise a significant array of extra taxes. As for the 3.2m public employees, recruitment will be more selective, and there will be greater job flexibility and performance monitoring. The OECD report says: 'Reaching the (Maastricht) fiscal target implies cutting the public sector deficit by nearly 2 per cent of GDP a year from 1993 onwards. . . . Maintained over four years, an adjustment of this size, in face of a widening gap between real interest rates and economic growth, would represent a major achievement, nearly unparallelled in OECD countries.'</p>

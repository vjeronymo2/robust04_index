			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China targeted for palm oil sales MALAYSIA is trying to persuade China to buy more of its palm oil. Mr Lim Keng Yaik, Malaysia's minister of primary industries, said that during a visit to China he hoped to persuade the authorities there to reduce import tariffs on palm oil from the present 28 per cent to 20 per cent. Last year China imported 854,000 tonnes of palm oil, of which about 550,000 tonnes originated in Malaysia. Mr Lim said that China's imports of edible oils and fats were likely to nearly double to 3m tonnes over the next few years. Malaysia is offering China USDollars 100m of credits to enter into long-term purchasing agreements for its palm oil. Under the credit scheme China would enter into contracts to purchase from Malaysia a minimum of 300,000 tonnes of palm oil a year over an extended period. Last year Malaysia produced more than 6.3m tonnes of palm oil, accounting for about 55 per cent of total world output. The country is trying to diversify its palm oil export markets. It is hoping for significant volumes of exports to Russia in coming months as part of a countertrade deal under which the Malaysian air force is taking delivery of 18 Russian-built Mig fighter jets.</p>

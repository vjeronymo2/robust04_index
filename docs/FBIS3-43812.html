The talks brought together 176 religious leaders and  "Ugases," or traditional chiefs, from the clans of warlord  Mohamed Farah Aidid and his enemy self-styled president Ali  Mahdi Mohamed.    Several other smaller clans were also represented.    But the warlords themselves did not attend the meeting,  chaired by a prominent Islamic leader, the Imam of Hirab,  Mohamoud Omar, revered both by General Aidid's Habr Gedir  subclan and Ali Mahdi's Abgal.    "This is the beginning of a peaceful settlement in Somalia  and Allah will support us," Imam Mohamoud told reporters after  the agreement calling for peace between the clans and the return  of property looted in the civil war was signed at the Kah hotel  in Ali Mahdi's north Mogadishu enclave.    "I believe this meeting was fruitful because the people are  fed up with war. Ali Mahdi and Aidid are clansmen and so they  must follow all the agreements reached by their clans," said the  Imam, wearing a red-and-gold embroidered tunic and white turban  with black sunglasses.    Previous peace accords between the warlords, however, have  come to nothing, and UN-brokered talks in Addis Ababa last month  broke up without agreement.    But Italian ambassador Mario Scialoja, who visited the Imam  during the talks Sunday, expressed optimism that pressure was  building on the warlords to make peace.    "I am confident that this agreement between the Habr Gedir  and the Abgal will lead to reconciliation between the two  clans," he said before driving away with an Italian military  escort.    "This could lead to a political agreement," Scialoja said.  "In another few weeks we might reach a breakthrough."</p>

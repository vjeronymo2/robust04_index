			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 5 May (MENA)--Egypt has expressed its deep  regret over the serious escalation in the struggle in Yemen.  This was contained in a statement issued by the Egyptian  Foreign Ministry today.    The Egyptian Foreign Ministry's statement said that halting  the fighting in Yemen has become an urgent necessity, which  Egypt demands anew.    The statement called on all Yemeni parties to refrain from  attempting to impose a fait accompli by force, to give a chance  to the efforts aimed at putting an end to the bloody clashes,  and to spare the Yemeni people untold dangers.    The statement stressed that a wise and responsible dialogue  is the correct way to settle differences and safeguard the  interests of the fraternal Yemeni people. The statement  explained that since the beginning of the crisis in Yemen,  Egypt, led by President Husni Mubarak, has exerted intensive  efforts to prevent the differences from worsening and to avert  the impending dangers to Yemen's unity and its people's unity.    The statement said that in view of the deteriorating  situation in Yemen in the past few hours, and that situation  despite the mediation efforts, Egypt appeals to the warring  factions to fully shoulder their responsibility before their  people and nation, to stop the clashes immediately, and to  realize that there will be no victors or vanquished.    The statement said the Yemeni people will be the ultimate  losers who will suffer from the unleashing of the forces of  confrontation and aggression and from the destruction that will  befall Yemen.</p>

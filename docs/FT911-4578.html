			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Uncertainty on takeovers criticised GREATER continuity between the Office of Fair Trading and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is needed to reduce uncertainty in industry over government merger policy, the Commons trade and industry committee heard yesterday, writes Robert Rice. Mr Archie Norman, group finance director of Kingfisher, told the MPs' inquiry into government policy on takeovers and mergers that the present system had an unacceptable degree of uncertainty. Any company contemplating a takeover needed a high degree of certainty before embarking on an exercise involving substantial costs in management resources and fees to advisers. The OFT should be more candid with the parties on their reasons for misgivings about a particular merger and should be prepared to identify undertakings which which would satisfy them instead of waiting for the parties to suggest them.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, March 31, IRNA -- Dispelling the doubt of  various Kashmiri freedom struggle groups on the role Iran played  in the events that led to the withdrawal of Pak-sponsored  resolution on Kashmir at the recently concluded UN Human Rights  Commission summit at Geneva, the Iranian ambassador to India,  'Ali Reza Sheykh 'Attar [name as received], has said these have  resulted from the lack of a "correct, deep and comprehensive  information of events". The ambassador's interview, originally  given to IRNA, New Delhi, has today appeared in leading  newspapers of the valley.    On Iran's position on Kashmir, 'Attar says "his country  believes in a lasting solution to the dispute fulfilling the  aspiration of Kashmiri people".    'Attar dismisses the allegation that Iran took a pro-India  stand in the interest of its commercial ties with that country  as "misconceived". He states that "commercial ties with  Pakistan are equally important to Iran. Moreover, Iran has  never compromised its principles for its economic interests.  Kashmiris are aware of this fact".    Cautioning the people of Kashmir of the West's designs, the  ambassador warns: "These powers do not stand for the well-being  of Muslims. Therefore, they should not be given any excuse to  establish their foothold in the region". "The West's  intervention has never been in the interests of Muslims.  Palestine, Somalia and Bosnia bear testimony to this", adds the  ambassador.    While holding the view that Iran's initiative at geneva  proved "effective", the ambassador is quoted to have said "both  India and Pakistan have appreciated it". The ambassador also  says that the Iranian mediation came in the wake of the two  countries' interest to sort out their differences over the  resolution at the summit.    Reposing confidecne in growing political awareness among the  people of Kashmir, 'Attar concludes that now "the case of  resolving the Kashmir tangle through negotiations among all  sides has become stronger".</p>

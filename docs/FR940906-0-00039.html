			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Evidence of spawning by Kootenai River white sturgeon has been documented only in 1991 and 1993. In 1990 and 1991, river discharge during the suspected spawning period was atypical for the post-Libby Dam period. Instead of discharge declining through late spring as occurred during 1989 and most prior years following Libby Dam operation, increasing and higher than ``normal'' flows coincided with increasing water temperatures through June in 1990 and 1991. In both years, mature female sturgeon tagged with ultrasonic transmitters moved from 15 to 110 river km (10 to 68 river mi) upriver and congregated in the 16 river km (10 river mi) reach near Bonners Ferry (Apperson 1992). These migrations coincided with an increase in flows near Bonners Ferry from approximately 24,700 cfs to nearly 42,400 cfs (700 to 1,200 cms) and an increase in water temperature from 8 to 14  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (46 to 57  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although no sturgeon eggs were recovered in 1990, 13 eggs were collected in early July 1991 from an artificial substrate placed in the suspected spawning area near river km 243 (river mi 155) at Bonners Ferry, within 0.06 mi (100 m) downriver from the railroad bridge (Apperson 1992). The eggs, estimated to be approximately 3 days of age, were spawned when water temperatures were 14  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (57  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F) and discharge between June 29 and July 2 ranged from 14,125 to 19,400 cfs (400 to 500 cms). Water velocities where sturgeon eggs were collected were estimated at 2.4 to 3.1 fps (0.8 to 1.0 mps); these velocities were at the lower end of velocity ranges measured in white sturgeon spawning areas during egg collection in the lower Columbia River (1.6 to 9.1 fps or 0.5 to 2.8 mps) (Miller et al. 1991). Although pre-spawning migratory behavior was observed in both 1990 and 1991, the higher than normal Kootenai River flows through the suspected spawning area occurred only for a brief period, with a few viable eggs collected in 1991. Evidence that more than one female spawned successfully, or whether the eggs spawned in 1991 survived past the larval stage, is lacking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Spawning was also documented during the 1993 experimental test flow (see Factor D below for a more complete discussion of this test flow). Two eggs spawned from two separate females were collected during the test flow period on artificial substrate mats in the same general location where eggs were found in 1991. The first egg was collected on June 10, with an estimated spawning date of June 7. The second egg collected on June 15 was not fertilized. Flows at Bonners Ferry during this period averaged 20,000 cfs (566 cms) with no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> load-following and water temperatures ranged from 12 to 14  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (54 to 57  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F). A third egg was collected on July 10 in a D-ring net. However, the egg was dead and the back-calculated time of spawning was not determinable. Although 1993 spawning monitoring efforts were intense, larval sturgeon are normally difficult to collect. Similar to 1991 results, there is currently no evidence that eggs spawned in 1993 survived past the larval stage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional adverse impacts to sturgeon because of reduced spring flow conditions may result from load-factoring or load-following at Libby Dam. Load-factoring, the deliberate practice of artificially raising and lowering river levels over a daily or weekly pattern for peak power generation or recreation, can create rapid changes in tailwater flows and affect depth, temperature, dissolved gases, and other physical-chemical conditions in the tailwater. Load-factoring at Libby Dam is a frequent and sporadic operating practice contributing to routine fluctuations in river elevations of 1 to 3 ft (0.3 to 0.9 m) per day (Kim Apperson, IDFG, pers. comm., 1993). These fluctuations may adversely affect sturgeon spawning behavior and reduce any egg/larvae survival by dewatering early rearing habitats. Because sturgeon spawning coincides with peak flows during spring and early summer, flows within natural fluctuations are considered important in maintaining consistent sturgeon spawning behavior during the spawning period (Lance Beckman, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Kootenai River white sturgeon eggs and larvae are subject to downstream drift and are vulnerable to dewatering from flow fluctuations for 4 to 6 weeks post-spawning. This is especially critical for eggs and larvae deposited in shallow, littoral areas within the 16 river km (10 river mi) stretch downstream of Bonners Ferry. For example, initial study results from Instream Flow Incremental Methodology (IFIM) monitoring in the Kootenai River near Bonners Ferry indicate that potential egg and larval habitats may be exposed or dewatered when flows drop below 11,000 cfs (BPA 1993). Load-factoring also affects and modifies the primary and secondary productivity in lotic ecosystems (Ward and Stanford 1979). White sturgeon normally begin exogenous feeding within 2 weeks following hatching. Therefore, the availability of native benthos, periphyton, and zooplankton suitable as prey organisms is critical to their early survival.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service believes that some sturgeon spawning may occur on a periodic, and possibly annual basis in the Kootenai River. However, survival past the age/larval stage is suspect since recruitment (above age 1) was virtually non-existent from 1974 to 1978, and unknown after 1978. For example, three adult white sturgeon were captured in 1993 near Shorty's Island (river mi 141, river km 227) while fishing for broodstock sturgeon (BPA 1993). One fish was estimated at 14 years old, likely spawned during 1978. A second fish was estimated to be 14 to 17 years of age, suggesting it came from the 1975 to 1978 year class(es) while the third fish was not aged because both aging structures (pectoral fin rays) were deformed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

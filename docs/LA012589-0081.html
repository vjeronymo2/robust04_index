			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUMBER GROWS;  </P> <P> IMMIGRANT TEENS FIND LITTLE REFUGE  </P> <P> When a work accident in his Mexican hometown left his father paralyzed last  year, Cesar Reyes, the eldest of nine children, decided to go to the United  States. He planned to find a job and send money home. He was 17.  </P> <P> Jose Vicente, 19, came to escape Salvadoran guerrillas who had taken him and  his mother prisoners. They had come to their home in the middle of the night,  like they had earlier for his father, he said. Jose Vicente was the only one to  escape.  </P> <P> Over the last several months in Los Angeles, Cesar and Jose have tried but  failed most days to find work and have spent most nights on the streets. They  are among hundreds, perhaps thousands, of young homeless immigrants sleeping in  parks, under bridges and in abandoned buildings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Numbers Unprecedented  </P> <P> The teen-age immigrants -- some as young as 12 and 14 -- are arriving in  unprecedented numbers, according to experts who say more of them are arriving  alone. Some come escaping the draft, others the escalating violence and poverty  in their home countries.  </P> <P> With no relatives or friends to receive them and confronted by U.S. laws that  ban their employment, the youngsters often go hungry or depend on the kindness  of strangers.  </P> <P> The few religious and community groups that help teen-age immigrants say they  are seeing about twice as many as a year ago. Some estimate that more than half  the homeless teen-agers downtown are Latino immigrants.  </P> <P> Some end up at Juvenile Hall and in the hands of immigration authorities.  Otherwise, no government agency claims responsibility for the youngsters.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Department of Children's Protective Services used to  offer assistance to those who asked to be sent home, but even that service has  been discontinued. The Mexican Consulate says it is trying to pick up the slack  and assists in the return of as many as 25 youngsters to Mexico each week.  </P> <P> Those trying to help the youngsters who remain face a frustrating task: Not  only are jobs scarcer than ever for illegal immigrants, but services for them  are almost non-existent.  </P> <P> "No one cares what happens to these kids," said Father Richard Estrada,  associate pastor at Our Lady Queen of Angels Catholic Church, also known as La  Placita.  </P> <P> About a dozen youngsters turn up almost daily at the historic downtown church  that has declared itself a sanctuary for refugees and immigrants. They are  offered meals three days a week and are allowed to sleep on the floor of the  church hall, where about 200 older immigrants bed down each night.  </P> <P> "We counsel the kids to go home, especially the younger ones," Estrada said.  "And we try to keep them from going bad." But it is a losing battle, he said,  since "we have little to offer them."  </P> <P> A few months ago Alfonso, 19, hooked up with two other teen-agers who guided  him across the border. They were on their way back to Los Angeles after having  been deported, and they led Alfonso to their former home -- MacArthur Park.  (The young man asked that his real name not be used. To protect other  youngsters in this story, most last names have been dropped.)  </P> <P> The park scene startled Alfonso -- kids, younger than himself, strung out on  drugs and selling in broad daylight. At night, they hopped into cars with  Americanos who paid them up to $30 for sex.  </P> <P> Once he got to know some of the youths at the park, Alfonso felt more at ease.  "They're really all right," he said. But Alfonso remained sure of one thing: He  would never use drugs nor end up like them.  </P> <P> After about three weeks of failed attempts at finding a job, of going hungry  and of sleeping under dirty blankets under a stairway with the others, Alfonso  relented.  </P> <P> Gathering all the macho moxie he could muster, Alfonso told himself, "A mi me  vale!" -- a Mexican war cry akin to "The hell with it!" -- and got into one of  the cars that cruise the park for boys. His bronzed, aquiline good looks made  him popular on the corner.  </P> <P> The park is in the heart of the predominantly Central American Pico-Union area  and along with downtown has the highest concentration of young homeless  immigrants, according to Anne Donahue, director of a Covenant House shelter  program.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, Covenant House workers have been scouting Los Angeles streets  at night for homeless teen-agers. The organization is preparing to open a  100-bed shelter next year, Donahue said.  </P> <P> "We've been amazed by the high number of Latino kids on the streets," she said.  "And we've barely scratched the surface."  </P> <P> "There is an absolutely critical need for services for all homeless youngsters"  -- including the immigrant youths who are generally younger and not always  welcomed at shelters serving the general homeless teen-age population, she  said.  </P> <P> Jaime Flores, a community worker at El Rescate, a group in the Pico-Union  district that assists Central American refugees, said that nearly half the  refugees arriving from Guatemala and El Salvador these days are minors  traveling alone or with other minors.  </P> <P> Unlike previous waves of refugees, many of the youngsters are the first in  their families to come. UCLA anthropologist James Loucky, who works in the  Guatemalan community, said this has given rise to homelessness among Central  Americans.  </P> <P> "It's something we're seeing for the first time," he said. "Even a year ago I  didn't know of any Central American homeless."  </P> <P> Loucky said the support network among the refugees has weakened over time as  the communities have grown.  </P> <P> "People (in the Guatemalan community) say that now there are people coming up  who they don't know or who are maybe the kids of people they use to know back  home. . . . Years have gone by, and there's not the same sense of obligation,"  he said.  </P> <P> It was nearly noon and Pedro Angel still had not eaten. He had risen at 5 a.m.  with the other men at La Placita's church hall to go look for work at the  day-labor pickup spots they frequent. Finding none, he returned to the church.  He had nowhere else to go.  </P> <P> A slender, sweet-faced, 16-year-old from Guatemala, Pedro Angel began working  alongside his father on their small piece of land when he was 9 years old. "We  are very poor," he said.  </P> <P> His dream of making enough money here to send home has vanished over the last  two months. "I'm sorry I ever came," he said.  </P> <P> Some of the youngsters walk the few blocks from La Placita to Skid Row missions  for meals. Pedro Angel prefers to go hungry, he said. The place frightens him.  </P> <P> Unlike Pedro Angel, the vast majority of youngsters interviewed for this story  expressed no intention of returning home -- not yet anyway.  </P> <P> "It would be embarrassing," said Alfonso, who still drops by the park to visit  old friends although he has temporarily been taken in by a man who picked him  up there. "They'd make fun of me back home."  </P> <P> When the youngsters write or call home, they tell their parents they are doing  fine. "We don't want to worry them," one teen-ager said, recalling his parent's  reluctant consent when he left.  </P> <P> "Besides, it's not as if we could ask our parents to send us money," said  another, eliciting laughter from his friends.  </P> <P> For others, however, the money is secondary.  </P> <P> "It's hard not knowing when I'll be able to return to my own country . . . or  see my brothers and sisters," said Jose Vicente, the young Salvadoran whose  parents were abducted by guerrillas. "There are times when I feel no joy about  anything. . . ."  </P> <P> Jose, who was taken in by a couple after spending several weeks on the streets,  said he has found only occasional work. He once got a steady job, he said, but  the gardener who employed him refused to pay him after three weeks. "I didn't  want any problems so I let it go," he said.  </P> <P> Jose seldom leaves the house these days. The labor pickup corner he used to go  to was raided recently by immigration agents. The few jobs he finds in the  newspaper require proof of legal status, and he has none.  </P> <P> Those who work with the youths say that behind their tough and unkempt exterior  they are "good kids" -- well-mannered and easy to work with.  </P> <P> "They seem to be real tender hearted," said Daniel Loera, who serves as lay  Catholic chaplain at Central Juvenile Hall. But when it comes to survival, they  will do whatever it takes, he said.  </P> <P> Paul Guerrero, a probation officer who keeps track of illegal immigrant  youngsters at Juvenile Hall, said that about 25 of them are brought in each  week -- twice as many as a year ago -- most of them for selling drugs, stealing  and car burglaries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Return After Deportation  </P> <P> Even after the youngsters are turned over to authorities for deportation,  Guerrero said he often sees them again. In one case, a teen-age boy who was  sent back across the border, re-entered the country illegally, was arrested on  the streets of Los Angeles for selling drugs and was back in Juvenile Hall --  all within 24 hours, Guerrero said.  </P> <P> "I see no way to stop them from coming," he said. "We should have some services  for them while they're here."  </P> <P> Some of the youngsters not only survive, but manage to flourish.  </P> <P> Joaquin was 15 when he came to the United States. He had one goal in mind:  "They say everything's better in the U.S., so I thought it would be better to  get an education here."  </P> <P> Over the last two years, Joaquin, a serious-minded young man with big plans,  has attended three different high schools and worked when he could find a job.  He has lived in half a dozen shelters, in abandoned buildings, and occasionally  with friends, but the teen has seldom missed a day of school. He has maintained  a 3.5 grade point average. He hopes to graduate with honors from Hollywood High  next summer.  </P> <P> "I don't care what I have to go through to get what I want . . ., like an  education," he said.  </P> <P> Joaquin's determination has already paid off: He speaks English almost like a  native. And he has been allowed to stay at shelters where he has seen other  Spanish-speaking youngsters turned away.  </P> <P> Joaquin recently lost an opportunity to attend advanced courses at UCLA because  he cannot afford to pay for transportation. But a more immediate concern is  where he will be spending the night.  </P> <P> A few days ago, he was asked to leave the small shelter where he was staying.  The six-bed shelter run by a Byzantine Rite Catholic priest is one of only a  few small shelters specifically serving immigrant youth. At this shelter,  temporary housing is offered to youngsters for a month at a time. Joaquin had  stayed for two.  </P> <P> "I don't know where I will go next," he said. "I just hope that I'll find a  stable place where I'll be able to study. . . . These are my last six months in  school."  </P> <P> The young man said he is applying for placement by the county in a foster home,  but it is unlikely he will qualify.  </P> <P> Spokeswomen for the county Department of Childrens Services said the agency is  responsible only for "neglected or abused" children.  </P> <P> "A child that just makes up his mind that he wants to leave home and come to  the big city is not a case within our realm," said Barbara Calhoon, a  supervisor in the department's international placement unit. She was referring  to foster care and transportation to a youngster's home country.  </P> <P> Up until last August, an average of 15 youngsters a month were sent home  through the international unit. Now, only about two a month go, she said. The  change reflects a stricter interpretation of departmental policy.  </P> <P> Sister Kathy Wood, a Franciscan nun who offers morning meals to homeless  immigrants on Skid Row, is disappointed by the lack of government help. No  matter how you look at it, she insisted, "downtown is no place for children to  be on the street. It doesn't matter what country they were born in."  </P> <P> If there is no alternative and a youngster's well-being is at stake, the  Immigration and Naturalization Service might send the youngster home, said  Robert Moschorak, associate INS Western Region commissioner for operations.  "But we're not interested in providing free trips to home countries," he said,  adding that in his 24 years with the agency he has yet to see a minor turn  himself in.  </P> <P> INS officials said they seldom apprehend minors in the interior, where their  enforcement focus is the workplace. Those caught at the border are sent home  "voluntarily." Many of the Central Americans, however, refuse to return  voluntarily. About 2,000 minors are held by the INS each year, and the  overwhelming majority of them are apprehended in Southern California, according  to research of INS records by the National Center for Immigrants Rights Inc.  </P> <P> Although overall apprehensions at the border are down from previous years,  Christine Davis, an INS official responsible for detention and deportation,  said she has detected "a slight increase in the number of Central American  unaccompanied minors, primarily young boys."  </P> <P> The Los Angeles-based National Center for Immigrants Rights, which has  litigated numerous class action suits on behalf of immigrants, plans to open a  multi-service center and small shelter for homeless youngsters next spring to  assist those released from custody. The center has begun recruiting families  willing to offer temporary shelter to the youngsters, as well as lawyers  willing to assist with their cases.  </P> <P> Despite such efforts, however, the needs of the young immigrants far outstrip  available services.  </P> <P> Brother Joseph McLachlan of the Missionaries of Charity -- a Catholic order  founded by Nobel laureate Mother Teresa of Calcutta -- sees as many as 60  immigrant teen-agers a day at a small shelter he operates in the Pico-Union  area. They drop in at the homey, two-story house for a shower, a free meal and  clean clothes. Some just come to rest from their nights on the streets.  </P> <P> Brother Joseph said he never has enough to offer them. And he has nowhere to  send those who ask for help in kicking a drug habit. He has been told by  government-funded drug rehabilitation programs that the young men do not  qualify.  </P> <P> The hardest part for Brother Joseph comes at the end of the day, however, when  he closes the door behind them. There is room only for eight to spend the  night.  </P> <P> "It's very difficult to let them out, especially the young ones, knowing the  difficulties and danger they face sleeping in the streets," he said. "All I can  say is . . . 'Take care of yourself.' "  </P></p>

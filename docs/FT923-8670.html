			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Invitation to visit centres welcomed THE International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) yesterday welcomed the invitation to its officials by Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of Bosnia's insurgent Serbs, to visit more Serb-controlled detention centres. But it ruled out taking control of the centres itself. Mr Karadzic also said he would free detainees over the age of 60. 'We feel these are moves in the right direction,' Mr Pierre Gauthier, ICRC spokesman, said yesterday. He added that the ICRC had been demanding for some time access to all detention centres, as well as the unconditional liberation of all detainees not involved in the conflict. He said the ICRC had been active in Bosnia for a month, and its 25 officials there had visited 10 detention centres, among them centres controlled by each of the three groups in the conflict. It was drawing up a new list of centres to visit. 'Omarska is one of our priorities,' he said, referring to the camp in northern Bosnia where journalists last week found emaciated and terrified men behind barbed wire in a situation reminiscent of Nazi concentration camps. However, Mr Gauthier dismissed suggestions that the ICRC itself take control of some centres. ICRC procedure is to report its findings in confidence to the responsible government authority. If nothing is done to eliminate abuses, it then reports, also in confidence, to the countries that have signed the Geneva convention, urging them to put pressure on the offending government. If that fails to produce results, it condemns the offending government publicly.</p>

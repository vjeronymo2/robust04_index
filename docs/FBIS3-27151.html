The decision was based on consideration of "the recent  diplomatic efforts made by Russia" to defuse the Sarajevo  crisis, said the Russian president's press secretary Pavel  Voshchanov.    After conversations over the telephone, the two presidents  agreed that it is up to the United Nations to mediate and make  the decision upon the developments in Sarajevo, he said.    They decided to continue discussion over the solution of the  bosnia issue as a whole in the near future.    Voshchanov declared that Clinton praised Yeltsin's proposal  to seek a political settlement as one that can ease the tension  of the crisis, which was fueled by the February-5 mortar  shelling on the besieged Bosnian capital city in which 68  civilians were killed and over 200 injured.    After that, NATO issued after a marathon session an  ultimatum  that asked Bosnian Serbs and Muslim forces to withdraw their  heavy weapons from around Sarajevo and put them under United  Nations control before midnight Sunday, or face NATO air strikes.    As the deadline was approaching, Moscow stepped up  mediations  and, as a result, Serbs began pulling back heavy guns on  Thursday.    But heavy snow prevented a complete withdrawal or  handing-over to the United Nations before the deadline, said  U.N. Special Envoy in Bosnia Yasushi Akashi, who urged NATO not  to hastily launch air strikes.    Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev assured in a  television interview this evening that Bosnian Serbs will not be  bombed when the NATO deadline is due.    He implied his confidence stemmed from an hour talk with  U.S.  Defense Minister William Perry over the telephone during the day  and an earlier meeting of defense ministers from Western  countries including the United States and Britain.</p>

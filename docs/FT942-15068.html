			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Toppled chief looks back in acceptance: But the collapse 'need never have happened' For a man who has just lost control of a business he built from nothing to one of the UK's largest privately held manufacturing groups, Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw shows a remarkable lack of bitterness. It is remarkable because Sir Neville, who, with his brother Mr Trevor Bowman-Shaw, owns Lancer Boss, says the receivership of the largest UK-owned lift-truck producer need never have happened. 'It's a great pity, as there were alternatives on the table,' he says. In the past few days Sir Neville has been almost a bystander in one of the most unusual and fastest-moving corporate collapses seen in UK manufacturing industry. His version of events reveals how, in hindsight, he might have acted differently. Last autumn, he says, Bayerische Hypo-Bank, lead bank for Lancer Boss's German subsidiary Steinbock Boss, suggested that Lancer Boss should meet potential German investors in the company. Protracted talks began with Jungheinrich, the Hamburg-based lift-truck producer, but it was not until March 18 that an offer was received. The offer, says Sir Neville, was for Lancer Boss' German, Austrian, UK and Irish operations. It was for a nominal amount, he says, and was rejected. Meanwhile, he adds, the company's UK banks and some of the German banks had become concerned that there was only one suitor for Lancer Boss. In response Sir Neville identified 'three or four' alternative investors. Deals with any of these, he says, would have ensured full payment of Lancer Boss' creditors. Jungheinrich, he says, came back on March 30 with another nominal offer for the German and Austrian companies, and eventually presented Sir Neville with a seven-day conditional offer on the Thursday after Easter. Sir Neville says he was told by legal advisers that he should not sign the contract. Following the refusal, the German banks withdrew facilities from Steinbock Boss and, a few hours after a receiver had been appointed to the German unit on April 8, Mr Allan Phillips and Mr Scott Barnes of Grant Thornton were appointed receivers to the UK operations. Sir Neville reflects that he should never have let Lancer Boss develop with two separate banking groups. 'I am not being anti-German,' he says, 'but the fact is that the German banking group thought a national solution was satisfactory, but I think they are wrong. NatWest were looking for a more European solution.' He should also have given Lancer Boss a better financial structure, he adds. He had tried to clinch a deal two years ago with a trade investor that would have secured a long-term future for Lancer Boss, but was overtaken by the recession. Now Sir Neville says he faces a more austere future. And what does he miss most? 'My driver  - people said I'd miss my driver most of all and it's true. We were in the same regiment.'</p>

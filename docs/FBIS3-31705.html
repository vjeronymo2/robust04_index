			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Omer Vatric from Mostar] </F>   [Excerpt] Is peace closer to Mostar after Sarajevo? To  judge by the frequent visits by international representatives,  one would say that better days are ahead for Mostar. There is  less and less firing in the city, and the talks on establishing  an EC [European Community] administration over Mostar have been  stepped up.    Last night (Albert Benabu), UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]  head for civilian affairs, held talks with members of the Mostar  War Presidency, while today they held two hours of talks with  (Fernando Sanchez Rau), head of the Spanish mission, and (Morris  Mono), head of the French mission. Smajl Kvaric and Alija  Alikadic, representatives of the Mostar authorities, stressed  that the Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities in Mostar supported the  efforts of the EC to establish an EC administration over Mostar,  but under certain conditions, which they had detailed last night  in a written reply to General (Bo Pelvas), special envoy of Mr.  Stoltenberg.    These conditions are as follows: Mostar has to be an open  city, and it cannot be a part of the Croatian republic of  Herceg-Bosna, nor its capital; conditions have to be created for  the return of the refugees and displaced people; in order for  talks to continue with the Croatian side under international  auspices, free entry of all humanitarian convoys has to be  guaranteed, electricity has to be supplied to the eastern part  of the city -- which has been without electricity for eight  months -- water has to be restored, the Ploce-Mostar-Sarajevo  humanitarian corridor has to be opened, medical evacuation of  the seriously wounded from the city has to be allowed, [word  indistinct] hospitals, medical and civilian premises have to be  respected, and all prisoners have to be released.

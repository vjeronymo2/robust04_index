			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Time to put away their knitting needles - A growing number of friendly societies are diversifying into new areas It is hard to think of a more unlikely bunch of revolutionaries than a group which includes the Dentists Provident Society and the Metropolitan Police Friendly Society. Yet this week, by joining the growing number of friendly societies which are using their ability to become incorporated to spread their wings and extend the range of services they can offer, they are contributing to a movement which has implications for the financial services sector more generally. Altogether, 12 societies have taken advantage of the powers they acquired under the Friendly Societies Act 1992 - 10 of them doing so this week. In numerical terms they are only a fraction of the 450 or so extant societies, but since they include the two largest, this group now accounts for more than three quarters of the Pounds 6bn or so funds under management by friendly societies. Societies see the advantages of incorporation clearly. Previous legislation tied them more closely to their origins in the co-operative movement and in welfare provision than some thought necessary. They were limited to selling long-term contracts, such as life assurance and pensions policies, and also faced restrictions on the range of tax-exempt investments they could offer. The 1992 Act allowed them to incorporate and set up subsidiaries to carry out a range of related activities, provided that the Friendly Societies Commission, the regulator, agreed the plan, and the societies' members approved the move. The list of activities permitted after incorporation is a sign of how diverse the sector is. Unit trusts and Peps, or general insurance are small steps from the mainstream business carried on by the larger societies, but moving into the administration of nursing homes or sheltered housing is a more surprising possibility, even though some societies, such as the Holloway Original, are already in this area. So far, however, the main societies are looking to financial services. Liverpool Victoria, which has Pounds 2.8bn under management, will offer buildings and home contents insurance, and is planning to act as an agent for mortgage business together with a building society. Royal Liver Assurance, which has just over Pounds 1bn under management, is also planning to enter the general insurance business. Both societies, which collect their premiums door-to-door, see this, rather than immediate access to more sophisticated savings arrangements, as what their market wants. In the longer-term, however, both see other opportunities, particularly in the needs of individuals and their families as people retire earlier and live longer. 'If I could pay something now to make sure my mother would never come and live with me I probably would,' Ms Lindsay Firth McGurkin, head of marketing at Liverpool Victoria, commented as she contemplated possible new areas of business. Others which have incorporated have a different approach. Family Assurance Friendly Society was the first to make the move, last summer, and immediately entered the Pep market. The society, which has Pounds 717m under management, is a far cry from the long-standing, collecting societies. It was set up in 1975 to market tax-free savings, and sells products to its members through, for example, independent financial advisers and through newspaper advertising and direct mail. Like the collecting societies, however, Mr Barry Chambers, Family Assurance's marketing director, sees the future of the welfare state as offering a significant opportunity. 'Friendly societies are united in making sure the sector gets a share of the cake,' he said. He added that the society would also be interested in moving into fund management for charities and small pension funds and providing administrative services to other societies. These changes do not mean that the friendly society sector will immediately change completely. Many, often smaller, societies will still see incorporation as irrelevant. Nor is there likely to be a stampede among those which do incorporate into esoteric areas in which they lack previous experience. Ms Marion Poole, general secretary of the National Conference of Friendly Societies, described the societies as 'sensibly cautious'. 'Friendly societies are going to take their time, if only to avoid the equivalent of buying a chain of estate agents just before the bottom falls out of the property market,' she said. For the longer term, however, the largest friendly societies have shown their determination to adapt in order to survive. They will not simply, in a much-used phrase, 'stick to their knitting', even if they are practising their crochet before considering fancy embroidery.</p>

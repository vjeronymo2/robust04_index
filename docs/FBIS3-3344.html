The letter, signed by a previously unheard of group called  the Association of Chinese Patriots and sent to Japanese news  agencies in Beijing, hails Hosokawa's visit and asks him to  continue the efforts started last week by U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher on human rights and democracy.    "The Chinese people have long carried in their hearts a bad  image of the Japanese Government," the letter said. "This is  not only because of the history of the Japanese invasion. But  more importantly because all previous Japanese Governments have  paid scant attention to democracy and human rights in China."    While blaming Japanese aggressors for killing millions of  Chinese 50 years ago, the letter attacks China's "one-party  dictatorship" and accuses it of allowing "tens of millions of  unlucky Chinese citizens" to perish in a series of disasters  brought on by the Communist Party.    "We sincerely hope Your Excellency Morihiro Hosokawa, who  was  able to end the long-term rule of Japan's Liberal Democratic  Party, will also be able to end a Japanese diplomatic history  which has paid no attention to human rights and democracy," it  said.    During a welcoming banquet at the Great Hall of the People  on  Saturday, Hosokawa urged China to improve its human rights  record, saying the international community recognizes human  rights as a universal value.    Hosokawa made the call after Premier Li Peng briefed him  about exchanges that took place between Christopher and Chinese  leaders over human right.    The Japanese prime minister, who is currently on a three-day  visit to China through Monday, met Li again and then President  Jiang Zemin.</p>

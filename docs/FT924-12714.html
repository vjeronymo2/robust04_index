			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (5): Trickle becomes a flood - Japanese plants are opening far and wide IN DECEMBER, the first car will roll off the assembly line at Toyota's Pounds 700m car plant in the UK, as Japan's leading vehicle maker commissions its first car production operation in Europe. Toyota began output of engines in Europe at its Pounds 140m plant in north Wales in September. Earlier this month Honda began volume production at its Pounds 300m car plant in southern England. The start-up of a wave of new plants by the Japanese auto industry heralds the start of a new phase in the formidable assault by Japanese car makers on the European car industry. An array of plants and new models are entering production in the UK, Hungary, Italy and Spain. Japanese vehicle production capacity in Europe is expected to exceed 1.2m a year by the end of the 1990s. European car production totalled 12.7m last year with the Volkswagen group accounting for 2.44m and Renault, the smallest of the big six volume carmakers, for 1.55m. Japanese carmakers captured 12.3 per cent of west European new car sales of 13.49m last year and this is forecast to rise to between 16 and 20 per cent by 1999. Toyota and Honda are developing a total capacity to produce 300,000 cars a year by the mid-1990s at their UK plants, and the figure could easily double by the end of the decade. The UK is not the only Japanese springboard into Europe. At Esztergom, 40 kms north of Budapest, the first Suzuki Swifts are also set to leave the line of Magyar Suzuki's more modest assembly plant during the autumn, while in northern Italy Daihatsu is preparing to begin production by the end of the year of micro vans at its joint venture with Piaggio. Back in Britain Nissan, which pioneered the route for the Japanese motor industry into local car production in Europe during the mid-1980s, is already launching its second UK-built car range. A new generation Micra - Nissan's small car that competes with the Ford Fiesta, the Peugeot 205 and the Renault Clio - will be supplied to Europe from its Pounds 900m Sunderland car plant in England. The Toyota, Honda and Suzuki plants may start slowly, but the Nissan example shows how fast the trickle will become a flood. Japan's second largest auto maker began car production modestly enough in Europe in 1986, but it is now pulling out all the stops to stay a jump ahead of its Japanese rivals. While it is Nissan's burgeoning UK operations that claim much of the limelight, the company is also investing heavily in Nissan Motor Iberica, the Spanish commercial vehicle maker, where it acquired majority control a decade ago. From 1990 to 1995 Nissan is investing Pounds 600m in Spain. Last month it started European production in Barcelona of its new Serena multi-purpose vehicle while in the spring the company will roll out a new generation four-wheel drive vehicle. As a sign of the changing order Nissan will supply part of its Spanish output of the four-wheel drive vehicle to Ford for sale in Europe under the Ford badge. The link between Ford and Nissan in Spain shows how quickly the arrival of the Japanese vehicle makers in Europe is set to move on to a more sophisticated plane. General Motors of the US (which sells under the Opel/Vauxhall badges in Europe) is already using the technology of Isuzu, its minority-owned Japanese affiliate, to produce four-wheel drive leisure vehicles - the Opel/Vauxhall Frontera - at a joint venture, IBC Vehicles, in the UK. Rapidly mounting research and development costs are the driving force behind the new alliances. Volkswagen of Germany, the biggest European car maker, has recently finalised a deal with Suzuki for the production of a range of small cars in Spain. Suzuki, already producing compact four-wheel drive vehicles in Spain and now starting car production in Hungary, will develop the new range of minicars with Seat, VW's Spanish subsidiary. While VW develops its link with Suzuki, Rover, formerly British Leyland, has become closely allied to Honda, while Volvo, the ailing Swedish car maker, has sought refuge with Mitsubishi Motors in a joint venture in the Netherlands to develop the next generation medium-sized car to replace the present Volvo 440 series. Honda, in addition to its own UK car and engine plant, holds a 20 per cent equity stake in Rover's vehicle operations, and Honda technology has essentially underpinned all Rover's mainstream new cars launched since the mid-1980s. Volvo has brought Mitsubishi in as a joint venture partner at its Dutch plant, where a new range of cars - badged both Volvo and Mitsubishi, but mainly engineered by the Japanese car maker - will emerge in the mid-1990s. To date only Mazda among the leading Japanese car makers is still to determine a strategy for starting local car production in Europe. Even as the concrete is drying at the assembly plants, the leading Japanese producers are also pressing ahead with the establishment of R&amp;D facilities in Europe. Honda is building up a technical centre near Frankfurt. Toyota's development resources are being concentrated in Belgium. Nissan has invested Pounds 64m to date in design and development operations in Europe including a technical centre in the UK.</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Philippine House of Representatives backed a presidential ban against the  return of Ferdinand E. Marcos, saying the ailing former president might stir up  trouble if he came home from exile. House Speaker Ramon Mitra said a majority  vote supported President Corazon Aquino's ban on Marcos' return. But Mitra, who  heads a pro-Aquino political party, said members of Congress might listen if  the former ruler "is going to return some of the money" he allegedly stole  while in office. Marcos is in guarded condition in a Honolulu hospital.  </P></p>

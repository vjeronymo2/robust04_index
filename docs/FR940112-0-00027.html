			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Fraudulent Behavior or Failure To Cooperate or To Take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any Required Action in Disability Determinations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under sections 223(f) and 1614(a)(4) of the Act, title II or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> title XVI disability benefits may be terminated if a prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> favorable determination of disability was fraudulently obtained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or if the beneficiary fails, without good cause, to cooperate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the Secretary in reviewing his or her entitlement or to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follow prescribed treatment which is expected to restore his or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> her ability to work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 10305(c) of OBRA 1989 amended section 223(f) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act to provide that in making, for purposes of section 223(f),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any determination or decision relating to fraudulent behavior by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any individual or failure by any individual without good cause to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooperate or to take any required action, the Secretary shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take into account any physical, mental, educational, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> English language) the individual may have. In addition, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to making similar determinations and decisions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of section 1614(a)(4) of the Act, section 1631(c)(1) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> title XVI of the Act, as amended by OBRA 1989, requires the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary to take these limitations into account in determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether an individual acted in good faith or was at fault, and in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining fraud, deception, or intent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 404.1518, 404.1530, 404.1579, 404.1594, 416.918,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 416.930, 416.994 and 416.994a reflect the pertinent provisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 223(f) and 1614(a)(4) of the Act. We are making the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following changes in these regulations:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Amend &sect;&sect;404.1518 and 416.918 to provide that we will take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitations (including any lack of facility with the English  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language) the individual has when determining if the individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has a good reason for failing to attend a consultative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examination which we have arranged for the individual. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific amendments were not included in the NPRM. Current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;404.1518 and 416.918 provide that we may determine that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual who is applying for benefits based on disability or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blindness is not disabled or blind, or that an individual who is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entitled to or eligible for benefits based on disability or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blindness is no longer disabled or blind, if we find that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual failed or refused to attend a consultative examination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without a good reason. While &sect;&sect;404.1518 and 416.918 provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules for determining whether an individual has a good reason for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such failure or refusal and, thus, are within the scope of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendments to sections 223(f) and 1631(c)(1) of the Act, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inadvertently failed to include these regulations when we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed the proposed regulations to implement section 10305 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OBRA 1989. We are amending &sect;&sect;404.1518(a) and 416.918(a) in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule to make it clear that we will consider an individual's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physical, mental, educational, and linguistic limitations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (including any lack of facility with the English language) in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining whether the individual has a good reason for failing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to attend a consultative examination. In connection with this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change, we also are making related changes, which were not in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPRM, to &sect;&sect;404.1579(e)(2), 404.1586(d), 404.1594(e)(2),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 416.986(c), 416.994(b)(4)(ii) and 416.994a(g)(2) to include in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these sections a cross-reference to &sect;404.1518 or &sect;416.918, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate, to clarify that &sect;&sect;404.1518 and 416.918 provide the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules for determining whether an individual has a good reason for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not attending a consultative examination. Current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;416.994a(g)(2) already contains such a cross-reference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Amend &sect;&sect;404.1530(c) and 416.930(c) to provide that we will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take into account any physical, mental, educational, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> English language) the individual has when deciding if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual has acceptable reasons for failure to follow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prescribed treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Amend &sect;&sect;404.1579 (e)(1) and (e)(2), 404.1594 (e)(1) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)(2), 416.994 (b)(4)(i) and (b)(4)(ii) and 416.994a (g)(1) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)(2) to indicate that we will take into account any physical,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lack of facility with the English language) the individual has in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining whether a prior favorable determination or decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was fraudulently obtained or in determining whether an individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has good cause for failure to supply evidence we ask for or to go  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a physical or mental examination. The amendments to these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections of the regulations include certain technical changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that were not reflected in the NPRM. For the final rule, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adding the phrase ``or decision'' to &sect;&sect;404.1579(e)(1),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 404.1594(e)(1), 416.994(b)(4)(i) and 416.994a(g)(1) to clarify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that these provisions apply not only to determinations we make,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but also to decisions we make. Section 416.994a(g)(1) already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contains this language. Also, as discussed above,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;404.1579(e)(2), 404.1586(d), 404.1594(e)(2), 416.986(c),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 416.994(b)(4)(ii) and 416.994a(g)(2) of the final rule include a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cross-reference to &sect;404.1518 or &sect;416.918, as appropriate, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides rules for determining whether an individual has good  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause for failing to attend a consultative examination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

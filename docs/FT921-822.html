			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Have fare, will travel For the passenger, one of the most disturbing aspects of bus deregulation is the sense of disorder it brings to an industry which should have safety as its top priority, writes Richard Tomkins. Talk to anyone about buses in Merthyr Tydfil and, chances are, an initial outburst about chaos will be followed by the words: 'One day, somebody's going to get killed.' The large numbers of competing buses mix uncomfortably with pedestrians in the town centre bus station, and in the narrow streets outside it, stop wherever they see a would-be passenger. Many of the vehicles look decrepit; others are painted in the liveries of companies from which they have been borrowed or bought, so it is difficult to identify who is operating them. Smoking on the buses is notionally banned, but no one seems to take much notice. On a positive note, competition has brought huge increases in bus frequency to some areas. Trefechan, an outlying village of 400 homes, used to be served by two buses an hour: now, it has 20. But on some routes, operators simply duplicate each other's timings so overall frequency is the same. And in Merthyr and surrounding areas buses are a rare sight after 6.30pm on weekdays or any time on Sundays. Some welcome the changes. For bus-spotters, Merthyr is paradise. 'I've never taken so many pictures in half an hour,' gasped one camera-toting spotter between snaps. The FT's correspondent, too, was a beneficiary of deregulation. With a little over an hour to go before his return train from Cardiff to London, he sought advice at the tourist office on which would be the next bus from Merthyr to Cardiff station. The hapless assistant pointed to a sea of timetables from half a dozen operators, shuffled half-heartedly through a few of them, and confessed she could not tell. Help, however, was at hand in the bus station. An employee of one operator said his company's next bus would not get to Cardiff until well after the train had gone. Then, leaning forward and jabbing a finger towards a single-decker a few paces away, he murmured: 'I shouldn't be telling you this, but that's a Cardiff bus.' The aged vehicle bore no visible clues as to its ownership or destination. The only occupant was the driver, slumped disconsolately over the steering wheel. He sat up, opened the doors and asked: 'Cardiff?' 'Yes. But I've got to be there for the 3.25pm train to London. What time are you going?' Peering out at the empty bus shelter and gazing back round the empty bus, he shrugged his shoulders and replied: 'Now?' The suggestion eagerly greeted, he exchanged Pounds 2 for a ticket, started the engine, rammed the bus into gear, and roared off down the Taff Vale to the accompaniment of a thousand rattles. One ear-splitting, bone-shaking hour later, the bus groaned into the terminal outside Cardiff station with minutes to spare before the train's departure. The driver looked pleased with himself. 'I didn't think we'd make it, to be honest,' he said. 'This thing's not supposed to do more than 45mph.' During the whole of the 24-mile journey, the 52-seat bus had only picked up one other fare-paying passenger - a woman with two infants. The fares paid would not even have covered the cost of the fuel consumed. There was nobody waiting for the journey back.</p>

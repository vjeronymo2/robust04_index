			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1990 PREP FOOTBALL ALL-STARS;  </P> <P> TALENTED BISHOP AMAT DOMINATES VALLEY TEAM WITH 4 PLAYERS;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: POWERFUL MUIR, NOGALES ARE RIGHT BEHIND WITH THREE EACH. GLENDORA HAS  TWO.  </P> <P> For the Bishop Amat High football team, it was a season in which the Lancers  more than lived up to their successful tradition.  </P> <P> Despite having mostly juniors in its starting lineup, Bishop Amat captured its  sixth consecutive Angelus League title and reached the CIF Southern Section  Division I quarterfinals.  </P> <P> So it is hardly a surprise that the talent-rich Lancers lead the way with four  first-team and two second-team selections for The Times' 1990 All-San Gabriel  Valley All-Star High School Football Team.  </P> <P> Of the 46 players selected, Bishop Amat placed offensive lineman John  Ludwiczak, running back Scott Fields, linebacker Jason Patterson and defensive  back Mike Velasco on the first team and linebackers Miregi Huma and Peter Gomez  on the second team.  </P> <P> Three other valley powers -- Muir, Nogales and Glendora -- were right behind  Bishop Amat. Muir and Nogales each had three players on the first team and one  on the second unit. Glendora had two on the first team and three on the second  squad.  </P> <P> Division II quarterfinalist Muir placed quarterback Sedrick Thomas and  defensive backs Reggie Reser and Demetrice Martin on the first team and  receiver Ron Jones on the second unit.  </P> <P> Nogales, which advanced to the Division IV quarterfinals and finished 10-1,  placed offensive lineman Todd Wild, running back Tyrone Edwards and linebacker  Luis Cuevas on the first team and defensive lineman Tony Verran made the second  squad.  </P> <P> Glendora, which reached the Division IV semifinals and finished 12-2, placed  running back Bill Zernickow and defensive back Tim Flynn on the first squad and  offensive linemen Kirk Bowman and Don Liddell and defensive back Josh Romero on  the second team.  </P> <P> The only other school with more than one player on the first team is Baldwin  Park with offensive lineman Peter Medrano and linebacker Fernando Arredondo.  The Braves, who advanced to the Division IV finals for the first time since  1984, also added defensive lineman Jerry Sims to the second unit.  </P> <P> San Marino has one player on the first team and two on the second and Rosemead,  Claremont, Temple City and Blair each has one on the first and another on the  second.  </P> <P> There are 22 schools represented on the first and second teams.  </P> <P> Zernickow, Arcadia kicker Neil Voskeritchian and Damien defensive lineman Mike  Balian are first-team repeaters from last year. Fields is the only junior on  the first team.  </P> <P> The selections were based on a poll of 49 11-man coaches in The Times' San  Gabriel Valley circulation area, which covers the San Gabriel and Pomona  valleys.  </P> <P> The San Gabriel Valley player, lineman and coach of the year -- whose names  have yet to be announced -- will be honored at a breakfast and awards ceremony  at 8:30 a.m. Sunday at the Anaheim Hilton Hotel &amp; Towers, 777 Convention  Way.  </P> <P> The invitational event, sponsored by the Los Angeles Times Fund, is only for  the 36 winners of the highest awards from 12 Times circulation areas: San  Gabriel Valley, Westside, Central Los Angeles, Orange County, Southeast, South  Coast, Glendale, Centinela-South Bay, San Fernando Valley, San Diego County,  Inland Empire (Riverside and San Bernardino counties) and Ventura County.  </P> <P> Each year, the valley is stocked with outstanding running backs and in 1990,  all three running backs on the first team rushed for 1,300 yards or more.  </P> <P> Leading the way was Glendora's Zernickow, a 6-foot, 205-pound tailback who  played an essential role in his team's 24-3-1 record the past two seasons.  </P> <P> Zernickow ran for 1,594 yards and 17 touchdowns as a senior after rushing for  1,761 yards and 17 touchdowns as a junior. A flanker as a sophomore, he  finished his career with 3,538 yards rushing.  </P> <P> He also made an impact in spot duty on defense, where he was a lineman and  back. He had eight quarterback sacks, two interceptions -- including one that  he returned for a touchdown -- and a fumble that he also returned for a  touchdown.  </P> <P> An All-Division IV selection as a junior, Zernickow has been recruited by  numerous NCAA Division I colleges including Colorado, Washington, Brigham  Young, Nevada Las Vegas and Oregon.  </P> <P> Another running back who capped a brilliant prep career was Edwards, who is 6-2  and 185 pounds with 4.4-second speed in the 40-yard dash. Edwards rushed for  1,285 yards and 12 touchdowns in 166 carries -- an average of 7.7 yards a carry  -- to lead Nogales to an undefeated regular season and its best record in  school history.  </P> <P> Edwards, who also rushed for 1,100 yards as a junior, was rewarded by being  named to the All-Sierra League first team for the second consecutive year and  the league's athlete of the year in football.  </P> <P> An outstanding all-around athlete, who is one of the top long jumpers in the  Southern Section, Edwards has been recruited by major colleges including USC,  UC Berkeley, UCLA and Arizona.  </P> <P> The youngest member of the backfield is Fields of Bishop Amat, but he could  develop into the best of the group. At 6-3 and 200 pounds, he is the latest in  a line of exceptional running backs to attend the La Puente school. Others have  included Eric Bieniemy of Colorado and Mazio Royster of USC.  </P> <P> In his first year as a varsity tailback, Fields rushed for 1,416 yards and 15  touchdowns in 176 carries -- an average of eight yards a carry. He also had six  receptions for 66 yards and a touchdown.  </P> <P> He was also one of the team's defensive leaders on the line with an  interception, three quarterback sacks and three fumble recoveries including one  for a touchdown.  </P> <P> But the most versatile member of the backfield may have been Muir's Thomas, an  exceptional passer and rusher who also handled the punting chores for the  Mustangs.  </P> <P> Thomas completed 87 of 132 passes for 1,991 yards and 19 touchdowns with only  five interceptions. At 6-0 and 210 pounds, he also used his 4.5 speed in the 40  to rush for 740 yards and four touchdowns.  </P> <P> A part-time starter at quarterback and a starter at linebacker as a junior,  Thomas is regarded as one of the valley's top college prospects. Colorado, USC,  UCLA, UC Berkeley, Oklahoma and Washington are some of the schools recruiting  the two-time All-Pacific League selection.  </P> <P> Chang Weisberg of Rosemead was the leading pass-catcher in the valley this year  with 64 receptions for 1,089 yards and eight touchdowns. He also caught 60  passes for 811 yards and nine touchdowns as a junior.  </P> <P> An excellent pitcher and outfielder for the school's baseball team, the 6-0 and  180-pound Weisberg is being recruited to play football by Hawaii, San Diego  State, Pacific and UC Davis. A safety on defense, he was a two-time All-Mission  Valley League selection.  </P> <P> Another elusive passing target for defensive backs is Charles Carr of Blair,  the first player on the Vikings to make the first team in recent years. At 6-0  and 170 pounds, Carr made a big impression by catching 49 passes for 823 yards  and 10 touchdowns.  </P> <P> Carr also made a major contribution in the defensive backfield with five  interceptions and returned one for a touchdown. He was a two-time All-Rio Hondo  League selection.  </P> <P> The first-team kicker, Arcadia's Voskeritchian, was also selected as a junior.  Voskeritchian earned another all-star selection with his exceptional range and  accuracy.  </P> <P> Voskeritchian, 5-9 and 160 pounds, made eight field goals including a  school-record 50-yarder. He made all 23 of his conversion attempts. He also  booted 32 of 34 kickoffs into the end zone.  </P> <P> That was similar to his success as a junior when he made eight field goals and  32 extra points for 56 points. He is being recruited by Stanford, USC,  Washington State, Oregon and Oregon State.  </P> <P> The offensive line is as big as usual with an average weight of 230 pounds.  </P> <P> One of the most imposing players is Chad Ventriglia of Claremont, a 6-4,  240-pound guard who is regarded as one of the best blockers in the Baseline  League. In addition to making all-league on offense, he also caused a fumble  and had four quarterback sacks to earn all-league selection at defensive  tackle.  </P> <P> Considered a Division I college prospect, he is being recruited by Brigham  Young, Arizona, Kansas and Idaho State.  </P> <P> The smallest member of the line is Wild of Nogales, who is 5-9 and 190 pounds.  But he has anchored the offensive line as a starting guard for the Nobles the  past three seasons. He also made the All-Sierra League team as a senior and was  the team's kicker.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most heavily recruited player on the line is Steve Chiasson of  Wilson, a 6-4, 240-pound center who also made All-Sierra League as a defensive  tackle. He is being recruited by USC, Oklahoma, Washington State, Louisiana  State, Nebraska and Hawaii.  </P> <P> A preseason all-state selection by Cal-Hi Sports News, Chiasson was among the  league leaders on defense with nine sacks and 77 tackles.  </P> <P> Another top college prospect on the line is Baldwin Park's Medrano. At 6-3 and  241 pounds, Medrano starred at offensive and defensive tackle for the Braves.  He was the team's best blocker on offense and was among Baldwin Park's sack  leaders on defense with six.  </P> <P> A two-time All-Sierra League selection, Medrano is being recruited by USC,  Colorado, Colorado State and UNLV.  </P> <P> A factor in Bishop Amat's success over the years has been its talented  offensive linemen. The 6-3, 230-pound Ludwiczak continued that tradition. He is  an excellent blocker who received All-Sierra League honors the past two  seasons.  </P> <P> There is also plenty of size and ability on the defensive line, which averages  220 pounds.  </P> <P> One of the most successful was Nathan Olsen of San Marino, a fierce pass rusher  who was selected defensive lineman of the year in the Rio Hondo League. A  two-time all-league selection, the 6-3, 220-pound Olsen led the Titans with 13  1/2 sacks.  </P> <P> Olsen, whose father Merlin starred for the Rams and is a member of the Pro  Football Hall of Fame, was called "the best defensive lineman I have ever  coached," by San Marino Coach Bill Maloney. He is being recruited by Colorado,  Stanford, Washington, UCLA and Utah State.  </P> <P> At 6-0 and 185 pounds, James Robinson of Walnut is the smallest player on the  defensive front. He was also one of the most difficult to block with team highs  of nine sacks and three fumble recoveries.  </P> <P> Selected as the Valle Vista League lineman of the year, Robinson is being  recruited by UC Davis, UC Santa Barbara and Occidental.  </P> <P> The biggest player in the interior line -- and perhaps the most sought-after  college prospect -- is Damien's Balian, who is 6-4 and 255 pounds. A consensus  preseason prep All-American and all-state selection, Balian lived up to his  reputation with eight sacks, three fumble recoveries and five forced fumbles.  </P> <P> The two-time All-Baseline League and all-valley selection is being recruited by  Colorado, UC Berkeley, Arizona State, Washington and Washington State.  </P> <P> Another blue-chip prospect on the line is Matt Gilmour of Temple City, who also  excelled as an inside linebacker and as a tackle on offense. An outstanding  all-around athlete, the 6-5, 220-pound Gilmour also starts on the school's  basketball and baseball teams.  </P> <P> But he has received the most attention as a football player. He is a two-time  All-Rio Hondo League selection and a member of The Times' second team last  year. He is being recruited by USC, Washington, Colorado and UCLA.  </P> <P> The linebacker corps features Bishop Amat's Patterson, who also stood out at  defensive end and fullback. At 6-0 and 210 pounds, he is hardly the biggest  player on the squad, but was surely one of the most active.  </P> <P> On defense, he led the valley with 18 quarterback sacks and had a team-leading  18 blocked passes. On offense, he rushed for 761 yards and 10 touchdowns in 134  carries and caught 22 passes for 307 yards and a touchdown.  </P> <P> His accomplishments did not go without notice from the powerful Angelus League,  which selected him its most valuable player.  </P> <P> Another top linebacker was Arredondo of Baldwin Park, who received all-league  first-team honors on defense for the second year in a row. Arredondo, 6-foot  and 195 pounds, was also a starting tight end for the Braves. He is being  recruited by UC Davis and Hawaii.  </P> <P> Along with teammates Edwards and Wild, Cuevas has played an important role in  Nogales' recent success. At 5-9 and 160, he was a three-year starter who was  one of his team's leading tacklers as a senior.  </P> <P> A two-time all-league choice, Cuevas was selected Sierra League defensive  player of the year this season.  </P> <P> On a talented Bishop Amat squad, Velasco may have been overshadowed by players  such as Fields and Patterson. But the 5-11, 175-pound Velasco had statistics  worthy of an all-valley selection.  </P> <P> Not only did he lead the team with five interceptions, Velasco also recovered  five fumbles, forced three fumbles and was one of the top tacklers for the  Lancers. He was also chosen to the All-Angelus League first team.  </P> <P> The secondary also features Glendora's Flynn, the leader of a defense that was  one of the best in the valley. The 6-1, 190-pound Flynn led the Tartans with  six interceptions and ranked among the leaders in tackles with 90.  </P> <P> A second-team all-valley selection last year and a two-time All-Baseline League  pick, Flynn was voted the league's most valuable defensive player. He is being  recruited by UNLV, Oregon State, Washington State, Air Force and Army.  </P> <P> The two most heavily recruited defensive backs in the valley this season are  Muir's Reser and Martin.  </P> <P> Reser, 5-10 and 175 pounds, is the Mustangs' career leader in interceptions  with 11 and also has a reputation as one of the hardest-hitting defensive backs  in the valley. He is the school's all-time leader in tackles with 241.  </P> <P> Also a strong offensive player with 4.45 speed in the 40, Reser scored 14  touchdowns in his prep career. Reser, a three-time All-Pacific League selection  who made the all-valley second team the past two seasons, is considered one of  the nation's premier college prospects at defensive back. He is being recruited  by UC Berkeley, Colorado, Michigan State, USC, UCLA and Washington.  </P> <P> The 5-10, 175-pound Martin was among the most versatile players in the valley.  A starter at quarterback as a junior, he became a standout at defensive back  and wide receiver as a senior.  </P> <P> Martin was one of Muir's defensive leaders with three interceptions and 75  tackles and caught 20 passes for 612 yards and 10 touchdowns -- an average of  about 30 yards a catch. It's no wonder why he is being recruited by UC  Berkeley, Colorado, Washington, Michigan State and USC.  </P> <P> First Team Offense  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.10IN:2.44IN:2.00IN:1.45IN:1.45IN:1.56IN"

It is the United States.    This is the case today. What about tomorrow?    Regardless of the prospects for their own political lives,  they are now picking and choosing the archenemy in 26 years time  (i.e. the year 2020).    Is it still the United States?    There are divergent views on this question. Those from the  leadership think tank share a general view: Japan.    This view was disclosed in a document issued by the CPC  Central Committee and the Central Military Commission.  <H3>  Twenty-three Departments Participated in a Symposium on  Developments in the International Situation </H3>   During the period from 25 November to 5 December 1993, the  General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the General  Office of the Central Military Commission held a symposium on  the development of the international situation. During the  symposium, discussions were conducted on the development of the  world situation, China's position in today's world, the  challenges China may face in the next century, and the  polarization pattern in the world. The symposium was held at  the Jingxi Hotel.    Among the units participating in the symposium were 23  departments and organs, including such organs under the CPC  Central Committee as the Research Group on International  Relations, Research Group on Diplomatic Relations, Research  Group on Relations With the United States, Research Group on  Relations with Japan, Research Group on Relations with Western  Europe, Research Group on Relations With Russia, and organs  under the Central Military commission, such as the Research  Office on International Strategy, Research Office on European  and American Strategy, Research Office on Asian Military  Intelligence, Research Group on Far East Strategy, Research  Office on National Defense Military Strategy, the Operations  Department of the PLA General Staff Headquarters, and the  Research Office for Strategic Studies.    A total of more than 60 papers were published at the  symposium.  <H3>  Many Central Leaders and Senior Statesmen Attended the  Meeting </H3>   The symposium was attended by many leaders of the CPC  Central  Committee, including Qiao Shi, Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, Chi  Haotian, Zhang Wannian, Hong Xuezhi, Cao Shuangming, Zhang  Lianzhong, Zhao Nanqi, Ding Guangen, Wen Jiabao, Wei Jianheng,  Tao Siju, and Jia Chunwang. Among the senior statesmen present  at the symposium were Bao Yibo, Wan Li, Li Desheng, Gu Mu, Xiao  Ke, and Zhang Aiping. The 11-day symposium was presided over  respectively by Yang Dezhong, Wang Ruilin, and Li Ji.    At the meeting, participants reached a consensus on the  assessment of the current international situation, the threat  from the international community toward China from the present  stage till the beginning of the next century, China's major  rivals in the year 2020, and China's stance on its sovereignty  over Hong Kong.    Discussions were also unfolded and different opinions and  comments made on a number of issues, such as the future  development of Sino-Russian relations, whether or not China  should offer economic aid to Russia (to boost the bilateral  relations), the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Sino-U.S.  relations, China's stance in the United Nations, China's ties  with Third World countries, China's relations with India and  Indonesia, as well as China's ties with Germany and French.  <H5>  "The Major Target of U.S. Hegemonism Is China" </H5>   On the basis of the above consensus, the symposium drew a  number of conclusions, one of which read: From the present  stage to the beginning of the next century, the major target of  U.S. hegemonism and power politics is China and Third World  countries in Asia. Its strategy toward China is to, through  economic activities and trade, control and sanction China and  force China to change the course of its ideology and make it  incline toward the West; take advantage of opening up, personnel  exchanges, and propaganda means to make ideological infiltration  into China's upper strata; give financial assistance to hostile  forces both inside and outside Chinese territories and wait for  the opportune moment to stir up turbulence; support and  encourage western groups to impose economic sanctions against  China with a view to reaching their political goal; fabricate  the theory of a China threat toward neighboring Asian countries  to sow dissension between China and countries like India,  Indonesia, and Malaysia; and manipulate Japan and South Korea to  follow U.S. strategy toward China.    However, things may look different in 20 years' time.  <H3>  Over 60 Percent of Participants Regarded Japan as China's  Archenemy </H3>   During the symposium, over 60 percent of the participants  believed that by the year 2020 Japan would surpass the United  States in economic strength and become a new economic empire.  Restricted by Japan's lack of nature resources, militarist  forces inside the country will grow alongside economic  development; when its military strength and armaments go beyond  its needs for self-defense and reach a nondefensive stage, Japan  will surely challenge China politically and militarily. By that  time, the United States will change its policy from utilizing,  inciting, and manipulating Japan to follow its strategy to  supporting Japan's policy and strategy toward China. Under the  present situation where the Soviet Union has disintegrated and  Russia faces an unclear future in its political and economic  reform, Japan's military development, which was previously aimed  at preventing Soviet aggression, will take China as the target.  Based on its economic as well as scientific and technological  strength, which are constantly growing, Japan will engage in  arms expansion and become the world's largest military power by  the year 2020. Japan will rank first in the world in per capita  military expenditure, 25 times higher than China.    However, regarding Japan as China's archenemy in 2020 was  not  the only view expressed at the symposium.  <H3>  A Quarter of the Participants Still Consider the United  States as China's Major Rival </H3>   A quarter of the participants still consider U.S. hegemonism  and power politics as China's greatest rival in 2020. In  addition to continuously subverting and interfering in China's  internal affairs through the means of ideological propaganda,  the United States can also make use of Japan and South Korea to  present military challenges to China. The United States is  still the world's only military power, the leader of the western  alliance, and the biggest backstage boss of political interests.    Besides Japan and the United States, some people also keep  an  "imaginary enemy" in their mind.  <H3>  About 10 Percent of Participants Believe That Russia Is  Going To Be China's Most Dangerous Enemy </H3>   During the symposium, less than 10 percent of the  participants held the view that Russia will become China's most  dangerous enemy by the year 2020. They based this view on the  adjoining territories of China and Russia, where a vast part of  Chinese territory is inhabited by minority nationalities, on  territorial disputes between the two countries, on Russia's long  desire for China's territories, and on ideological differences  between the two countries.    When discussing China's relations with foreign countries,  the  issue of China forging an alliance with other countries was also  brought out into the open. With a view to coping with China's  present and future enemies, some people raised the idea of  playing the Russia card.  <H3>  "Rebuild a Friendly Cooperative Relationship Between China  and Russia" </H3>   It was noted by many participants in the symposium that,  judging from ties and strategic positions between nations, it is  not practical for China to give up the chance to enter into an  alliance with other countries. To serve the purpose of  safeguarding China's national interests and social system, it  suits China's interests to build nonideological allied relations  or enter peace and cooperation treaties with Third World  countries or Russia on the basis of mutual assistance, mutual  benefit, and non-interference. Those present at the symposium  also suggested that China should provide economic aid to Russia  and CIS countries in order to rebuild a friendly cooperative  relationship with Russia. They believe that building up a  friendly cooperative relationship with Russia is the most  practical strategy to adopt to contend with U.S. strategy toward  China, and is also a strategy to guard against the revival of  Japanese militarism in 2020.  <H5>  Veteran Generals Have a Tendency To Play the Russia Card </H5>   A number of papers and data became the focus of the  symposium, including a paper entitled "On Japan's Strategy  Toward and Influence on China in the Year 2020," which was  written by the Research Group for International Relations under  the CPC Central Committee; a paper entitled "On Japan's Strategy  Toward China in the Next Century," which was prepared by the  Research Office for International Strategic Studies; papers  under the headings "Japan Lists China as Its Number-One  Political Enemy" and "Factors Leading to Anti-China Wars By  Japan," which were published by the Research Office for Asian  Military Intelligence; papers entitled "Japan's Influence on and  Ambitions Toward Taiwan" and "the Realities of the Revival of  Japanese Militarism," which were released by the Research Group  on Far East Strategy; as well as data prepared by the Operations  Department of the PLA General Staff Headquarters under the  heading "the Development and Strategy of Japanese Military  Strength" and "Japan Possesses the Technology and Equipment To  Produce Nuclear Weapons."    All the veteran generals who attended the meeting had a  tendency to play the Russia card, suggesting that China further  promote its ties with Russia at an appropriate time. Military  personnel who once studied in the Soviet Union even favored the  idea of providing Russia with substantive economic aid to make a  good impression on Russia.    During the symposium, the CPC Central Committee and the  Central Military Commission submitted a 63,000-character,  five-part final report under the heading "Analysis of This  Symposium on the Current International Situation as well as  Future Changes in the World Setup."  <H3>  Reflecting the CPC's Feeling of Isolation in the  International Community </H3>   A person in the know said privately after the meeting that  this symposium served to reflect the CPC's present isolated  position in the world, the feelings of the CPC's decisionmaking  level of being cut off by the international community under the  present situation where communism is declining, and the CPC's  urgent desire to seek allies to resist the world-wide historical  tide of democracy. He indicated: "However, it will prove a  mistake if China picks Russia, for Russia is not the Soviet  Union but `the former Soviet Union,' still less the Soviet Union  of the Stalin era. This is one reason. The other reason is that  China is faced with many variables, and who can guarantee that  China will still be a 'socialist' paradise by the year 2020?"    This person hates foreign aggressors bitterly, especially  Japanese militarists. He believed, however, that once China is  able to get onto the normal track of history and becomes  powerful and rich, no enemy would scare China.</p>

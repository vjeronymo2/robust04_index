			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Oil and chemicals shore up output Production in the electronics and chemicals industries rose strongly in the three months to June while the output of the clothing, paper and publishing sectors dipped slightly, figures from the Central Statistical Office yesterday showed, Gillian Tett writes. Manufacturing showed a steady growth, in spite of slowing slightly in June. Manufacturing output in the three months to June was a seasonally adjusted 1.3 per cent higher than in the three months to March, and 3.5 per cent higher than in the same period a year ago. About a third of this quarter-on-quarter growth was accounted for by the coke, petrol and nuclear fuels sector, where production surged in the latest quarter after a strong rise in the output of North Sea oil and gas. Output rose 14.4 per cent in the second quarter of the year, compared with the three months to March, when production in this sector was been relatively slow. The chemicals and man-made fibres sector also showed strong improvement  - rising 1.8 per cent in the second quarter compared with the first quarter - fuelled by a strong performance from organic chemicals and pharmaceutical companies. Engineering companies performed well, with production rising 1.1 per cent in the second quarter of the year compared with the first quarter, and 4.1 per cent compared with the same period a year ago. The CSO said the fastest growth in the engineering sector occured in information technology, with computer, electronic component and telecommunications companies all reporting strong activity. Consequently output in the electrical and optical sectors rose 3.1 per cent quarter on quarter and 9.9 per cent year on year. Economists welcomed the figures as indicating that the recovery in manufacturing was becoming increasingly broad based and export driven.</p>

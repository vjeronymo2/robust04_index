			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDENT PHOTO  </P> <P> I am writing to commend your editorial judgment in deciding to run a photo and  prominent headline on the front page (March 6) regarding two Southland students  winning Westinghouse science prizes.  </P> <P> Whether this reflects your paper's priorities or just a slow news day, I think  it's terrific that you decided to give such prominent play to an education  story.  </P> <P> I'm certainly not advocating that you take a USA Today "happy news" approach to  your paper, but as the husband of an Inglewood elementary schoolteacher I  greatly appreciate your role in bringing public attention to positive academic  stories such as this one.  </P> <P> MITCHELL R. SEMEL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

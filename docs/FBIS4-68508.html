The Rumble </F> of Boots: Vivid Episodes From Market Competition"]    [Text] Although the Russian market in plastic money will be  25 years old this year, the stormiest events in it did not  unfold until 1992-1993, when real competition among payment  systems and numerous commercial structures emerged here. And in  literally the past few months the competition in the Russian  electronic-payments market has developed into an open conflict  in which both sides have conducted themselves fairly toughly and  the plot of the conflict has taken on the qualities of a  detective story.  <H8>  The Story of Plastic Money in Russia: Pain Over Rights </H8>   "My wife's credit card was stolen."    "Did you put a stop on the account?"    "No, I'm pleased: the thief is spending much less!"    (A bourgeois joke)    The pioneers in developing the Russian consumer-payments  market were Diners Club International (which, incidentally, in  1950 put out the world's first international credit card) and  American Express. In 1969 they signed an agency agreement with  the State Committee for Foreign Tourism in the person of its  commercial arm, the Inturist All-Union Joint-Stock Company, for  servicing those payment systems' credit cards; that is, the  joint-stock company became those systems servicing agent.    In 1974 an analogous agreement was concluded with VISA  International, in 1975 one was signed with Eurocard/Mastercard,  and in 1986 one was signed with JCB International.    During the entire time that agency rights to the servicing  of  credit cards belonged to the Inturist All-Union Joint-Stock  Company, the entire technical side of the work was handled by a  credit-card group operating under the State Committee for  Foreign Tourism, and commercial settlements were carried out on  behalf of Inturist through the USSR Bank for Foreign Economic  Activity.    At the end of 1987, in accordance with new legislation, the  Inturservis All-Union (naturally!) Economic-Accountability  (absolutely essential!) VTO [Foreign Trade Association]  (subsequently All-Union Joint-Stock Company] was founded, and  Inturist's agency rights with respect to all payment systems  were transferred to it. A special subsidiary company,  Inturkreditkart, was set up for the technical servicing of  payments. Igor Fedorov became head of the main company, and  Aleksandr Kapustin started working in the subsidiary (we will  encounter their names again more than once).    And this is when the first intrigues in the Russian  "plastic"  market began, intrigues which illuminate by reflected light many  years of competition among international payment systems on the  remaining five-sixths (or approximately that much) of the globe.    In January 1988 VISA International elected the Inturist  All-Union Joint-Stock Company as a member possessing basic  rights (including the right of emission), despite the fact that  the joint-stock company was not a banking institution. When this  was done, Inturservis was recognized as a managing agent of  Inturist.    In response, Eurocard (subsequently Europay) elected the  USSR  Bank for Foreign Economic Activity as its member.    Beginning in November 1988, Inturservis started exercising  Inturist's membership rights, concluding direct contracts with  trade enterprises dealing in foreign exchange (and this was just  the time when they were undergoing a development boom). At the  same time, the servicing of all payments continued to be carried  out exclusively through the Inturservis processing center, which  at that time was the only agency in Russia that had the  requisite software, hardware and personnel to handle the  complete cycle of servicing "plastic" payments: the processing  of credit cards, the confirmation of purchases and verification  of account balances, the conversion of the payment into  electronic form and computer connections with the payment  system, the handling of the payment disbursal, and the  offsetting of client's payments between banks.    The present stage in the development of the Russian "plastic  money" market began in September 1991, when Kredo Bank, which  was accepted as a VISA International member in 1990, started  offering VISA cards in Russia. Later Most [Bridge] Bank,  Inkombank and Mosbiznesbank started carrying out programs to  issue VISA cards, while the Inturservis processing center  continued to service payments made with their cards.    In 1992, after the sole Russian member of Europay  International, the USSR Bank for Foreign Economic Activity,  ceased its banking activity in November 1991, Europay  International started to accept other Russian banks as members,  among which the most active became Most-bank (to which the  personnel that had been working with credit cards in the USSR  Bank for Foreign Economic Activity transferred) and Dialog Bank.    In the meantime, Kredo Bank, Most Bank and Dialog Bank--the  first three banks to become members of both VISA International  and Europay International--proposed to Inturservis that it  divide its business in servicing VISA and Europay credit cards  into two parts. However, the negotiations proved unsuccessful,  since it is possible to transfer agency rights, but rather  difficult to divide a processing center and its personnel.    Then the banks decided to found another processing center,  Kardtsentr [Card Center], which was to be only for the Europay  system. Naturally, that undertaking received the active support  of Europay international, since Inturservis had historically  received the support of VISA International.    Then Kredo Bank, however, decided (we do not rule out the  possibility that it did so under the influence of the fairly  jealous VISA International) not to take part in Kardtsentr, and,  joining with Inturservis, on 11 November 1992 it founded the  United Card Service Joint-Stock Company (UCS), the Russian  version of whose name was United Credit Card Company--KOKK (for  more detail, see the following section of the article).  Aleksandr Kapustin became the president of UCS, and Yuriy Agapov  became chairman of the board. In January 1993 authority to carry  out Inturservis's activities in the area of "plastic" payments  was transferred to UCS (for $900,000).    That is how two processing centers emerged in the market,  while UCS has so far retained an exclusive position with respect  to the processing of VISA, Diners Club and JCB cards. At the  same time, payments with Europay cards can be serviced by both  UCS and Kardtsentr.    To give a more complete picture, it should be added that in  1993 many national card-payment programs started to be  implemented--STB, Olbi, Ortcard, Most-card and Union Card.  However, because these cards are mainly connected with ruble  accounts, and no connection with external payment systems is  required for servicing them, the processing of these cards is  usually carried out by their issuers' own processing centers  (for more detail, see KOMMERSANT No. 33, 23 August 1993).    Once again, to give a more complete picture, let us also  mention the American Express company, which has not taken any  part in the conflicts that we are going to relate: at the  beginning of 1992 American Express began to terminate, de facto,  the fulfillment of its existing agency agreement with  Inturservis, and by the end of the year all of Inturservis's  contracts with enterprises for the servicing of payments made  with the American Express card were transferred to American  Express (Russia) Ltd., which assumed functions related to the  technical servicing of payments.  <H8>  A Classic Capitalist Conflict: Kredo and Most Divide Their </H8> Property But Do Not Divide Their Market and Management    "Filled with agitation,    I undid your corset--    You ran away laughing,    While I stood there pondering...."    Count Aleksey Tolstoy    And so, by the fall of 1993 the UCS company was a  joint-stock  company with authorized capital of $1 million, in which 49  percent of the shares belonged to the Inturservis All-Russian  Joint Stock Company--the owner of agency rights for all payment  systems--while 39 percent belonged to Kredo Bank (through which  all payments serviced through UCS passed), and 12 percent  belonged to the joint Finnish-British company Inpass Ltd. In the  latter, 50 percent each of the shares belonged to the Finnish  Okobank, through which VISA payments passed after going through  Kredo, and to the British company CardTec Ltd, which develops  hardware for the credit card business.    In our view, a fateful role in the subsequent development of  events was played by the public disclosure of plans for the  reorganization of UCS, plans which had been jointly developed by  the joint-stock companies. (The presentation of UCS  stockholders' new policy took place on 28 September--see  KOMMERSANT No. 39, 4 October 1993).    According to the strategy that had been developed, the  Inturservis All-Russian Joint-Stock Company was supposed to  transfer its exclusive contracts with enterprises for VISA and  Europay cards to the Russian banking sector, leaving UCS (or its  successor) only rights and contracts to service Diners Club and  JCB cards.    For this purpose, Russian banks that were VISA members were  supposed to establish, on the basis of equal rights, a new Viza  Rossiya Servis (VRS) company, to which the Inturservis  All-Russian Joint-Stock Company's contracts--but only contracts  pertaining to VISA cards--were supposed to be transferred. (It  must be noted that in most countries national bank associations  that are members of international payments systems have long  since been established.) At the same time, according to the  plan, all technical operations related to the servicing of  credit cards would continue to be carried out by UCS (on the  basis of a service agreement with VRS).    On the other hand, the Inturservis All-Russian Joint-Stock  Company was supposed to transfer contracts for Europay cards to  Kredo Bank--either permanently or until such time as an  agreement was concluded to establish for Europay cards an  organization analogous to Viza Rossiya Servis (that is, a  national association), to which all rights for the servicing of  cards would be transferred.    In and of itself, this latter circumstance gave Kredo  certain  potential advantages in the "plastic money" market, at least  until such time as a Europay national association was  established. However, what was key in the new strategy was not  even that, but the point according to which, until Russian  Europay member-banks had been granted the right to utilize the  technical services of UCS along with the services of Kardtsentr,  VRS members would not be allowed to seek the services of  Kardtsentr for servicing the cards of Europay and other systems  (in the event that Kardtsentr started working with systems other  than Europay).    There are grounds for assuming that this point was included  in the UCS program as a countermove after it became known that  Europay International was pressuring the Russian Europay  member-banks to obtain a provision whereby Kardtsentr for three  years would not provide services to trade enterprises that had  agreements with VISA. We learned of the existence of such  pressure and of attempts on the part of Europay to "use force to  impose exclusivity" from [Piter Derbi], the president of Dialog  Bank, which is one of the founders of Kardtsentr (See CARDS  INTERNATIONAL, No. 93, 6 September 1993).    In this connection, it is indisputable that the UCS  technical  exclusivity proposed for the members of Viza Rossiya Servis  would have substantially graver consequences for the affairs of  Kardtsentr than Kardtsentr's technical exclusivity would have  for the future of UCS. Faced with the necessity of choosing,  both processing centers' clients would more likely choose  UCS--by virtue of the greater work experience contributed to UCS  by Inturservis.    Naturally, diametrically opposite opinions exist with  respect  to the quality and efficiency of Kardtsentr's work. They range  from the opinion set forth in an open letter from Kardtsentr's  founders to the officers of UCS (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY for 14  August 1993), to that expressed by Fedor Naumov, the head of  Inkombank's credit card department, who left Kardtsentr: "They  have existed for 13 months now and have not yet done anything.  Conducting affairs that way is a mockery of banks (see EAST  EUROPEAN BANKER, No. 35, September 1993).    However, even Dmitriy Alekhin, Kardtsentr's managing  director, has said the following: "We started with nothing, and  in order to provide high-class services and compete with UCS, we  need not only technology but experience ... at present we are  not yet ready" (see EAST EUROPEAN BANKER, No. 35, September  1993).    In other words, after the presentation of the UCS's  stockholders's agreement, the situation required decisive  actions from the active members of Kardtsentr, if only to  preserve the status quo in the credit-card servicing market,  especially for the servicing of the deeply kindred Europay cards.  <H8>  Open Letter From Bankers (August 1993) on the Utility of </H8> Honest Competition    To Mr A.

Lipanov, Vice-President of Kredo Bank    Lately the mass media have carried invalid reports aimed at  discrediting the activities of the Kardtsentr Joint-Stock  Company, whose founders are a group of Russian banks.    We regard these publications as the manifestation of  unscrupulous competition and profoundly regret that such methods  are becoming common in Russian banking practice.    As founders of Kardtsentr who have an interest in the  successful development in our country of a civilized system of  settlements employing plastic cards, we propose to you in the  future to wage competition in the financial services market by  other means, namely: by means of the quality of services  provided to clients, the speed with which settlements are made,  and attractive prices for services provided.    We sincerely desire interaction and cooperation and hope  that  such unseemly occurrences will not happen in the future.    [Signed] President of the National Credit Bank    O. Boyko    President of the Stolichnyy Bank    A. Smolenskiy    President of Most Bank    V. Gusinskiy    President of Elbim Bank    S. Morozov    President of Yugorskiy Bank    O. Kantor    The first round of the counterintrigue developed according  to  a perfectly capitalist scenario: in October-November of last  year, Most Bank entered into negotiations with Inturservis for  the purchase of its block of 49 percent of UCS stock. The ground  for negotiations had been prepared by the expression of a  willingness (within the framework of the UCS stockholders'  strategic agreement) to give up the rights to servicing credit  cards. Inturservis seemingly let it be known that it was  prepared to quit the "plastic market." Indeed, in the past few  years the alignment of forces has changed substantially, and the  Inturist system has ceased to be the principal source of  "plastic" payments in Russia.    However, Igor Fedorov, president of the Inturservis  All-Russian Joint-Stock Company, naturally wanted to get a good  "indemnity." To do so he wanted, first of all, to sell the  entire block of stock as a whole (without breaking it up), and  second, to do so on a competitive basis.    Consequently, Inkombank, which is active in issuing VISA  cards, entered into a fight with Mosbank for the Inturservis  bloc of UCS stock. Because of purely technical circumstances,  Inkombank dropped out of the competition, but in the course of  bidding it raised the acquisition price to $2.3 million, that is  to nearly 4.7 times the nominal value.    Toward the beginning of December Igor Fedorov concluded a  contract with Most Bank, received money for the bloc of UCS  stock, and seemingly offhandedly informed the UCS board about it  (directly int he course of a board meeting).    The Gogolian tableau vivant was unexpectedly interrupted by  Mr [Pekka Khonkanen], president of Inpass Ltd. With purely  Scandinavian imperturbability he announced that Most Bank had  also offered to buy his 12 percent of UCS shares--for good money.    The reaction of Kredo Bank's representatives on the UCS  board  was instantaneous--they immediately (at the board meeting) made  Mr [Khonkanen] an offer that he couldn't refuse. Realizing that  haggling was inappropriate in this case, he took about $560,000  for his 12 percent, that is, the same 4.7 times the nominal  value.    Consequently, as of 3 December UCS became the joint property  of Kredo Bank, whose 51 percent had cost it less than $1  million, and Most Bank, which had paid $2.3 million for 49  percent of the stock. And Igor Fedorov and [Pekka Khonkanen]  evidently remained extremely pleased with themselves--the  securities in which they had invested had brought their  companies each 370 percent annual earnings in foreign exchange,  which is close to the result recorded in the Guinnes Book  of World Records, and that is without counting  dividends--based on the results of 1993, UCS's net profit for  distribution came to $600,000, or 60 percent per share. And it  cannot be said that Inturservis and Inpass Ltd. sold everything  that they could--the former firm left itself all agency rights  with regard to the technical servicing of credit cards (UCS  continued to lease certain rights from Inturservis), and the  latter left itself the status of the first nonresident bank  hooked up to the chain of VISA credit card payments serviced by  UCS.    And this is when the second round began, which now took  place  in the spirit of a "Red Guard attack." The officers of Most  Bank, deciding to exercise their rights as a stockholder,  submitted a proposal to the management of UCS to put all  payments for the Europay system in the Russian stage of the  banking chain through Most Bank, rather than Kredo Bank.    Here, in our view, commentary is needed. The bank through  which the processing center carries out the "plastic" payments  for at least one of the credit card systems receives  considerable advantages. They are the following:    First of all, UCS is an extremely large client. In 1993 UCS  turnover for servicing credit-card payments came to nearly $170  million, approximately one-fifth of which was for the Europay  system. Naturally, balances of funds in the UCS account would  become a good backup in the short-term money market for any  bank. Moreover, since cash foreign exchange is now out of favor,  one can predict a substantial increase in electronic turnover to  show up in the 1994 results.    Second, from every transaction the servicing bank takes a  commission, which in this case could come to several hundred  thousands of dollars a year.    Third, the servicing bank also gains the opportunity to  acquire for itself extremely large settlement accounts of UCS  clients that accept "plastic" payments directly. For enterprises  accepting credit cards, it is advantageous to have an account in  the servicing bank because in that case their payments are made  a day or two faster. At least, all clients serviced for the  Europay system at Kardtsentr have accounts in Kardtsentr's  founding banks.    Fourth, the servicing bank can also offer new clients  services related to the collection of cash proceeds, getting  additional commissions and a considerable influx of cash from  that.    Fifth, by acquiring clients, the bank gains the additional  opportunity to place corporate and personal credit cards issued  by the bank among clients and their personnel, and to eventually  provide those firms with its automatic teller machines.    UCS president Aleksandr Kapustin responded to the proposal  by  Most Bank's officers in accordance with his charter: if the  owner of the controlling block (Kredo) gave approval for a  contract to be transferred "from itself" to Most Bank, Mr  Kapustin would not object.    Kredo, naturally, graphically demonstrated the elementary  truth of capitalism, namely, the difference between a block of  shares and a controlling block. As a result of which, an  unpleasant truth was revealed to Most Bank: having paid $2.3  million, it had not acquired any rights with respect to the  management of UCS and had not acquired any additional market or  income. The possible dividend on UCS stock is poor consolation,  since on the basis of 1994 results it will (in terms of the real  capital spent by Most Bank) amount to no more than 30 percent in  foreign exchange, and that is in the event that the principal  UCS stockholder does not adopt a plan for large-scale  reinvestments.    Consequently, accomplishment of the main "political"  objective--to save Kardtsentr and its clientele by influencing  the process of the reorganization of UCS and establishment of  Viza Rossiya Servis--remained just as remote as it had in  September 1993. Under these circumstances, Most Bank decided to  resort to "the continuation of politics by other means," by  carrying out a revolution in UCS's management staff.  <H8>  Practically a Detective-Story Plot: Most Bank versus Toby </H8> Mitchell    "Many will revile me    And now will probably ask    Why do I joke so stupidly?    What's it to them? I want to!"    Aleksandr Pushkin    KOMMERSANT Toby Mitchell citizen of Great  Britain, 36 years old. Worked for the VISA International company  starting in 1985; in 1990 was appointed director of the Central  and Eastern Europe Department; in 1992 became vice-president of  VISA International. In January 1993, with the consent of VISA  International, Mr Mitchell founded the Payment Systems  Partnership company, in which he named himself senior partner.  The company's principal job is consultations regarding the  development of consumer payment systems in Eastern Europe.    According to Mr Kapustin, after relations between the  management of UCS and the junior stockholding firm (Most Bank)  grew strained, Most Bank's representatives expressed a desire to  see the firm's accounting reports. The company's officers  accommodated the junior stockholder's desire and gave Most  Bank's specialists access to their financial documents. It must  be noted that the group sent to UCS was not an auditing  commission of the joint-stock company in the full sense of the  word (and could not have been one, according to UCS's charter),  since it represented the interests of only one of the  stockholders. Nonetheless, the UCS officers decided not to hide  "their cards." Aleksandr Kapustin regarded the audit with  Olympian calm, since in 1993 UCS's financial documents had  repeatedly been audited by Centrobank, the Anti-Trust Committee,  the tax inspectorate, and several auditing firms (including  Ernst &amp; Young specialists), and even by the Ministry of State  Security.    In the course of their work, the Most group's specialists  called attention to documents confirming a payment for the  amount of $95,000 from the firm's account to the personal  account of Mr Mitchell for the performance of a set of work  under contract with UCS.    Let us note that in conversation with a KOMMERSANT  correspondent, Kredo Bank's vice-president Igor Lipanov, a  member of the UCS board, said that the decision to conclude a  contract with Mr Mitchell was approved by UCS's Council of  Directors and board, and made in accordance with the UCS's  charter, and that the results of its fulfillment were detailed  in an appropriate report dated 29 May 1993 and deemed highly  satisfactory by the board. Subsequently, this fact was certified  in an official letter signed by Yuriy Agapov (Kredo's president  and chairman of the UCS board) and Igor Fedorov (president of  the VISA International and member of the UCS board).    However, as Mr Kapustin reported, immediately after the  group  of Most Bank specialists had called attention to the documents  pertaining to the contract with Mr Mitchell, those documents  were confiscated according to established procedures by a  representative of the okrug tax police, which coincidentally  (let's call it a coincidence) showed up at UCS literally "on the  heels" of the group of Most Bank staff members (the UCS  bookkeeping department has an official record of the  confiscation).    KOMMERSANT Subsequently KOMMERSANT's  editorial staff decided to clarify the question of why a payment  by UCS was made to Mr Mitchell's personal account (although that  is not contrary to Russian law), rather than to the account of  Payment Systems Partnership, which would be more typical for  standard Russian practice. We asked that question to Mr Mitchell  himself and also sought the opinion of Mr Antony Berendt, a  specialist in British business and banking law from the London  School of Business. It turned out that the Payment Systems  Partnership firm, in principle, has no account other than Mr  Mitchell's personal account. The point is that British law  allows the formation of a legal entity as the commercial name  (trade name) of an individual, with the use of the individual's  personal accounts for business purposes. In other words, whereas  Russian law contemplates the possibility of engaging in  entrepreneurial activity without the formation of a legal  entity, British law contemplates the possibility of engaging in  entrepreneurial activity with the formation (for purposes of  taxation and the creation of a subject of commercial and  international law) of a legal entity in the form of a trade  name.    Nonetheless, on 9 February (two days after the completion of  the audit and a day after the confiscation of documents  pertaining to the contract with Mr Mitchell, a letter from Mr  Polyakov, a vice president of Most Bank, was received by the  Moscow City Internal Affairs Administration's Administration for  Combating Economic Crimes. The letter stated that the transfer  of the money to Mr Mitchell had caused harm to Most Bank's  interests, and it also contained a request to "resolve the  question" of bringing criminal charges against Mr Kapustin on  the basis of this fact (the editorial office has the text of the  complaint, as it does the texts of the other documents  mentioned). Naturally, the removal of the "criminal" from the  office of UCS president would be decided automatically.  Evidently, in that case even the main stockholder would lose the  possibility of influencing the situation, since the decision to  remove a "criminal" from the management of the main processing  center in Russia would most likely be supported by the  management of VISA International and Europay International.    It is interesting that, according to Mr Kapustin himself,  whom staff members of the Economic Crimes Administration invited  for a conversation, confidential documents confiscated on the  day before by the representative of the okrug tax police were  appended to Mr Polyakov's letter (incidentally, a sentence to  the effect that documents pertaining to the transfer of money to  Mr Mitchell are attached to Mr Polyakov's letter exists in the  text of the letter itself). Moreover, according to unofficial  information obtained by UCS's representative in the City  Internal Affairs Administration's Economic Crimes  Administration, Most Bank's complaint had been brought to the  Economic Crimes Administration by Col Papakhin, the deputy  director of the Moscow City Internal Affairs Administration's  Investigative Administration, who at that moment was on a  regular leave; while on leave, Mr Papakhin was awaiting an order  dismissing him from the internal affairs agencies, after which  he was supposed to begin work at Most Bank (as KOMMERSANT's  staff has learned, starting this March Aleksandr Papakhin began  performing official duties at Most Bank).    Not finding any indications of a crime in the UCS  president's  actions, on 17 February the Moscow City Internal Affairs  Administration's Administration for Combating Economic Crimes  issued a order declining to initiate a criminal case.    Nonetheless, on 17 February staff members of the Moscow City  Internal Affairs Administration's Investigative Administration  issued an order on the initiation of criminal case No. 003209  with regard to the fact of the transfer of money to Mr Mitchell  "by an unknown criminal."    Mr Gusinskiy, Most Bank's president, sent a letter to the  Moscow Procuracy (initial No. 561, dated 23 February 1994)  expressing the opinion that staff members of the City Internal  Affairs Administration's Economic Crimes Administration had a  "prejudiced attitude" toward the case. But the Moscow  Procuracy's Administration for Oversight Over the Execution of  the Law in Internal Affairs Agencies issued an order revoking  the order of the City Internal Affairs Administration's  Investigative Administration to initiate a criminal case on the  grounds that the latter order was "illegal" and "issued on a  contrived pretext."    This last circumstance requires separate commentary. The  point is that the order to initiate a criminal case indicated  that it had been initiated on the basis of an audit conducted by  the Seventh Department (for combating organized crime) of the  Moscow City Internal Affairs Administration's RUOP [Regional  Administration for Fighting Organized Crime]. However, staff  members of the Moscow Procuracy (and this fact is officially  confirmed in the procuracy's order revoking the order initiating  the criminal case) established that, with respect to UCS, an  "audit by the Seventh Department of the Moscow City Internal  Affairs Administration's RUOP was not conducted," and  consequently, no materials from the "audit" had been received by  the City Internal Affairs Administration's Investigative  Administration.    In reality, the City Internal Affairs Administration's  Investigative Administration had initiated the criminal case  after receiving a 17 February 1994 letter from Most Bank, which  was registered there under number 387 (the fact of the receipt  of the letter from Most Bank is mentioned by Vladimir Gusinskiy  in his letter to the Moscow Procuracy that is referred to above).    In addition, the Investigative Administration's order  initiating the criminal case states that "an unknown criminal  unjustifiably transferred $95,000 from an account at Most Bank  to Account No. 070614623 at the Republic National Bank (New  York)." In reality, UCS had no settlement account in Most Bank.  Moreover, as UCS's financial documents indicate, money was not  transferred to Republic National Bank, either. Mr Mitchell's  money was transferred from the International Moscow Bank (from  the UCS account) to Kredo Bank (to Mr Mitchell's account).  However, since International Moscow and Kredo do not have direct  correspondent relations, the money, in accordance with  established procedure, was transferred through Republic National  Bank, which has correspondent relations with both banks and is  Kredo's principal correspondent bank for settlements in U.S.  dollars.    Nonetheless, after the Moscow Procuracy's decision, the case  was transferred further along official lines to the RF Procuracy  General. At this stage, the company's principal stockholder,  Kredo Bank, was involved in the process of examining the case.  On 17 March the Bank's vice-president Igor Lipanov sent a letter  to the Moscow Procuracy and the director of the Investigative  Administration of the RF Procuracy that noted that, in the  opinion of Kredo Bank's officers, Most Bank "is attempting to  provoke a criminal investigation of the UCS president on a  contrived pretext for the purposes of gaining competitive  advantages in the market."    In sum, as KOMMERSANT's editorial staff has learned, on 6  April the UCS officers received an official letter (initial No.  16-574-94) confirming the official agreement of the RF Procuracy  General with the order of the Moscow Procuracy not to initiate  the criminal case against Mr Kapustin.    With this decision by the Procuracy General, the detective  aspect of the plot was exhausted, for Mr Mitchell, in an  interview with a KOMMERSANT correspondent, stated that he would  decline to bring suit against Most Bank and its officers, whose  actions, according to him, had damaged his reputation.    Thus, suspicion was lifted from the UCS management, the  company's activities continued, and Mr Kapustin ceased to be  associated in business circles with Article 93-1 of the RSFSR  Criminal Code (from eight years to the "top," and invariably  with confiscation of property).    It would seem that the time had come to engage in  implementing the UCS strategy in full. But everything worked out  somewhat differently.   <H8>    VISA and Europe: Their Shadows Swayed on the Threshold </H8>   "They're dissatisfied with my reply,    `Resolve our dispute as fast as possible!'

Last week Alan Goslar, first vice-president of VISA  International, told us the following: "My attitude toward the  existing situation is this: it's a purely Russian problem.  Russia's banking community should sort out this whole thing on  its own. After hearing both sides, I said that they themselves  should find a solution. We cannot act as a jury. They are their  affairs, and I will do everything possible to keep from being  drawn into the conflict.    "Granted, Russian banks are inclined to create squabbles out  of nothing and to deal with one another harshly," continued Mr  Goslar. "The methods employed in business are very different  from ours. They very much like to push each other toward the  abyss. Taking some one to the point of collapse is practiced  very widely here. It's a market where the competition is very  strong, and the banks have a weapon that we never dreamed of.  According to my observations, Mr Gusinskiy believes that there  are battles ahead that he is capable of winning. I'm sure that  he will take very decisive actions. But I am prepared to argue  that Kredo, too, is prepared for decisive actions. I'm sure that  Mr Gusinskiy is pursuing certain goals, but will he be able to  achieve them using such methods?"    Something was achieved all the same--Western businessmen  recalled the plots of Jack London and Brett Harte, and maybe  even those of Mario Puzo and Ian Fleming. As a result, we  developed the sense that the conflict among Russian banks had  forced international associations to think seriously about  politics in Russia. They, carefully counting all the stars that  had fallen from the eyes of Russian bankers and illuminated  their way to the Russian market, decided to change their policy  of clearly defined preferences for any specific Russian  structures and, it appears, started to actively assist all at  once. If it does not prove possible to unambiguously defeat  their historically ubiquitous competitor, whom they have  encountered in a new market, then it is better not to lose what  they already have.    Evidently, having noticed the certainty that emerged in  Western associations that it was extremely risky in Russia to  bet everything on one horse (be it UCS or Kardtsentr), Most Bank  appears to have decided to play that situation to its own  maximum benefit. According to the latest information, Most Bank  has taken decisive steps toward individual self-definition in  the credit card market. One can say that it has made an  asymmetrical response.    As Mr Geoffrey de Schrevel, chief manager of Europay  International for Central and Eastern Europe, informed us, Most  Bank's representatives informed him that, while not planning to  quit Kardtsentr, they nonetheless want to build their own  Europay processing center parallel to Kardtsentr's machine.  Since any Europay member-bank may in principle do such a thing,  the association will not object.    In addition, according to Mr Jan Doskar, VISA  International's  manager for Eastern Europe, Most Bank, which is a member of the  VISA system, intends by the end of the year (following UCS) to  install a terminal for satellite communications with their  system.    Despite the fact that Most Bank is losing out to its  competitors in the "plastic" market in time, it has a chance for  success.    After all, in the course of the conflict Most Bank evidently  succeeded in burying the idea of UCS stockholders for  establishing a Viza Rossiya Servis and an analogous entity for  Europay with a common processing center in the form of UCS or  its successor. Now, it appears, Kredo Bank has been doomed  forever to "climb down" from its controlling block in any  organizations dealing with credit cards. On the other hand, even  if Kredo Bank should try to establish a national association on  the basis of UCS (for example, through the additional issuance  of UCS stock), other banks will hardly join it--if 49 percent is  not enough to redistribute the market, smaller shares are even  more pointless. Thus, Kardtsentr's existing clientele, on which  Most Bank might count in its independent actions in the market,  will be retained in the Europay system (and, in the future, in  the VISA system too).    However, Kredo has not abandoned realization of part of its  original strategic design, either. As KOMMERSANT editors have  learned, back on 15 March Igor Fedorov, on behalf of the  Inturservis All-Russian Joint-Stock Company, officially gave up  to Kredo agency rights and contracts (gave up exclusive  authorization) not only for the VISA and Europay systems, but  for the Diners Club and JCB systems, too. Last week Kredo began  transferring contracts with enterprises (former clients first of  Inturservis and then of UCS) directly to itself and strengthened  its position as the bank that exclusively services the UCS  turnover.    Moreover, according to information possessed by the editors,  last week the Union Card company (founded by a consortium of  Russian banks, including Inkombank, Avtobank, TOKO Bank,  Mosbiznesbank, Delovaya Rossiya [Business Russia], the VBB and  others) concluded a processing contract with UCS (Union Card  payments were previously serviced by Avtobank's center).  Consequently, the network of enterprises accepting Union Card  cards has expanded by at least 2,000 outlets (the number of  UCS's clients for the servicing of payments with the cards of  other payment systems), and the turnover serviced by UCS will  increase by another 10-15 percent, according to our estimates.    In addition, we do not rule out the possibility that the  positions of Kredo Bank, Inkombank and certain bank founders of  Kardtsentr (Dialog, Moscow Savings Bank and others) on the  market may draw closer after the Most Bank's processing center  becomes a competitor not only of UCS but of Kardtsentr itself.    Thus, as a result of the clash that occurred in the credit  card market, the situation of oligopoly (in which experts,  recalling the words of Kardtsentr's director, might assess the  positions of Kredo Bank and UCS as preferable for the time  being) has been preserved.    This situation's plus for clients consists in the fact that,  when UCS and Kardtsentr and Most Bank's new processing center  all start to simultaneously service both the VISA system and the  Europay system, they will inevitably begin to compete among  themselves in terms of rates and services. Moreover, the party  that is losing in terms of service capabilities will most likely  resort to offering dumping rates. Specialists judge the lowest  limit of rates to be 1.9-2.0 percent, as opposed to the current  3.5-4.0 percent. Under these conditions, the servicing of  payments will for all practical purposes become an unprofitable  business, and the development of it will become exclusively a  money-losing proposition, for 2 percent is the amount of the  external commission that foreign banks take.    In addition, each of the sides will place its reliance even  more emphatically on strong points in its business technology:  Kardtsentr and the banks belonging to it will evidently place it  on the development of automatic teller machines, and UCS--on the  installation of universal devices for processing the cards (at  the so-called POS--point of sale) of all the systems represented  in the market, including national ones (STB, Union Card, etc.).    On the other hand, the minus for clients will be that it  will  hardly be likely that Russian banks, having numerous processing  centers, will ever reach any agreement on organizing the  national mutual offsetting of credit card payments made within  Russia (and that idea was seemingly the second level of the  strategy of Kredo Bank and UCS), as happens in other countries,  including those with a substantially smaller "plastic" turnover.  Accordingly, the money in settlements will continue to race  overseas--with an inevitable loss of pace and of external  commission (2 percent of the amount).    By withdrawing, for all practical purposes, from creating  the  possibility for the Russian banking sector to organize the  internal mutual offsetting of payments on the basis of a single  processing center, international associations have not helped  the Russian "plastic" market to rise to a new stage. It cannot  be said that they have come off as losers: they have been left  with respectable insurance deposits (according to the  associations' rules, the Russian servicing banks and processing  centers keep them in foreign banks), almost $4 million in  external commissions (based on the forecast for 1994), and also  the possibility of "sitting" for two or three days on Russian  money involved in settlements.</p>

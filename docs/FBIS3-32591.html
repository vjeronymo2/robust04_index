			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 7 Feb (EFE) -- The Cardenist Front for  National Reconstruction Party (PFCRN) has symbolically joined  the armed revolt in Chiapas and begun a tough fight to discredit  its opponents in the presidential campaign.    Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, PFCRN candidate to the Mexican  presidency, announced that its "vote-sponsoring brigades" will  mobilize this week wearing a "uniform" -- a ski cap and  sweatshirt -- like members of the Zapatist National Liberation  Army (EZLN) who rebelled on 1 January.    Fernando Pineda, national propaganda secretary, today  explained to EFE that the ski cap will be "a symbol of peace,  not of war." He added that it will be worn as a symbol of the  Zapatist struggle for democracy and to demand a "no to weapons,  yes to the ballot box."    The ski cap is the main garment worn by Zapatist leaders.  Rebel leader "Subcommander Marcos" says he wears it to honor  the Mexican culture of "keeping things under wraps" in which the  name of the ruling party's presidential candidate is withheld.    "The PFCRN fully agrees with the Zapatists' demands. We have  adopted their ten points for democracy and offered ourselves as  the Zapatists' peaceful branch because we believe their demands  are just," Pineda said.    The opposition party spokesman said its members hope  violence  will stop and that just solutions will be given to the people of  Chiapas and Mexico, where, according to him, there are more than  40 million poor people, meaning half the country's population.  The way to prevent permanent instability in the country is to  promote new, in-depth economic policies and to help the poorest  people overcome their backwardness.    "We are going to emphasize this platform unity with the EZLN  in our political campaign and guarantee that a political rather  than military solution prevails on 21 August (presidential  election day)".    Aguilar Talamantes was applauded by dozens of supporters  wearing black and white ski caps on 6 February when he began his  campaign in the capital.    During his electoral campaign, which began in January,  Aguilar Talamantes harshly criticized another opposition  presidential candidate, Cuahtemoc Cardenas of the Party of the  Democratic Revolution (PRD), whom he describes as "lacking  seriousness and ideological commitment."    Aguilar Talamantes has also criticized Diego Fernandez de  Cevallos of the conservative National Action Party (PAN) for his  "elitist" character because he wants politics for "groups of  decent people without taking the poor into consideration."    The PFCRN, known as the Worker's Socialist party until 1986,  proposes to end agricultural backwardness; to sponsor progress,  democracy, and development; and to promote an in-depth  reconstruction of the country's political and social life as  guidelines for winning the presidency.    Nine parties will participate in the 21 August general  elections, but only the ruling PRI (Institutional Revolutionary  Party), PAN, and PRD are considered strong.</p>

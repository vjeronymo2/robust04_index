			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Ninawa -- Trade Minister Muhammad Mahdi Salih  and Agriculture Minister Bashir 'Alwan Hammadi have discussed  with Ninawa Governor Staff Lt Gen 'Abd-al-Wahid Shannan Al Ribat  the final preparations that have been made to begin the campaign  for harvesting and marketing wheat and barley crops in the  governorate.    This was during an expanded meeting of the governorate's  Central Harvest and Marketing Committee which was attended by  comrade Najm 'Abdallah al-'Iraqi, secretary of the Ba'th Party  Ninawa Branch; 'Abd-al-Hamid al-Sayigh, secretary of the Mosul  branch; several directors from the two ministries, heads of the  departments concerned with the campaign; and representatives of  the Federation of Peasant Cooperative Societies in the  governorate.    The ministers praised the efforts and preparations that have  been made by the Central Committee and the subcommittees in the  Ninawa and Mosul party branches and other participant sides for  the success of the harvest and marketing campaign in fulfillment  of leader President Saddam Husayn's desire to ensure the  campaign's requirements throughout our country, especially in  Ninawa Governorate, in order to guarantee food for the people  and to defeat the unfair blockade on our country. [passage  omitted]    It was decided during the meeting to increase the present  storage capacity so as to absorb the entire quantity of grain to  be bought. Some 300 trucks have been ensured for transporting  grain. This is in addition to transport by rail.    The agriculture minister affirmed that Ninawa will be the  nail in the coffin of the food embargo imposed on our people.  He said: This governorate, which leader President Saddam Husayn  called "the bread basket of great Iraq," will play a major role  in guaranteeing people's food.    The ministers of trade and agriculture, accompanied by the  governor, then made a tour of several harvest and marketing  areas to inspect the preparations which have been made. The  areas included: al-Hadr, al-Qayyarah, Shawrah, Mahallabiyah,  Tall 'Afar, Sinjar, al-Bi'aj, Tall Kayf, and Ba'shiqah.</p>

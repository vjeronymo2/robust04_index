			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Autif calls for PEP investment limit to be held at Pounds 9,000 The unit trust industry wants the existing overall annual limit on how much an individual can invest in Personal Equity Plans to be kept at Pounds 9,000, Alison Smith writes. Autif, its trade association, made the call in its Budget submission to the Treasury. Mr Philip Warland, Autif director-general, said the limit  - Pounds 6,000 in a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 in a single-company Pep - did not need raising but within it a saver should be able to put Pounds 3,000 into gilts and corporate bonds. The tax treatment of Peps has come under attack from the Association of British Insurers and the Building Societies Association. Both have called for consistent tax treatment between different types of savings and have suggested lower Pep limits.</p>

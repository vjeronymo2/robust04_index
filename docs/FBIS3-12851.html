			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Friday Arabic sermon by Islamic revolution leader Ayatollah </F> 'Ali Khamene'i at Tehran University on 4 March--recorded]    [Text] Believers everywhere: May God's peace, mercy, and  blessings be with you. The advent of the blessed night of the  Koran's revelation, a night better than a thousand months,  represents an opportunity for the Muslim to purify his soul and  educate his spirit, lifting it, via his supplications and  prayers to God, from the swamp of materialism to the realm of  light and meaning. It is a success that I wish you will all  have, brothers and sisters.    All vicious hands are seeking to drag humanity toward  corruption and materialism. The Muslims must guard themselves  against being dragged into this overwhelming flood through piety  and seeking God's protection. They must erect the Islamic  nation's structure on a solid foundation of souls strengthened  by the repetition of God's name and a will reassured of the  fulfillment of the divine promise, especially as we mark the  martyrdom anniversary of the lord of the pious and prince of the  faithful 'Ali Bin-Abu-Talib, may God's peace be with him. Let  us therefore turn this great man's saga into a beacon lighting  our way.    The basic issue in our Islamic world today is the painful,  bloody incident at the venerated Ibrahimi Mosque where fasting  worshippers were massacred en masse by the hand of international  Zionism. The massacre cloaked this month of fasting with the  garb of sorrow and overwhelmed Muslim hearts with anguish and  distress. The media of global arrogance and their stooges are  strenuously and cunningly seeking to impose a blackout on this  news and downplay its heinous character. But its grave  implications are clear to everyone who has an enlightened heart.    I find it necessary to present the following points to our  brothers and sisters:    First, those who perpetrated this incident are not a small  group. No, everything indicates that the incident occurred after  careful planning, preparation, and support from those who  usurped Palestine. The Israeli Government is the criminal and  its accomplices are those who have been giving it backing, thus  encouraging it to dare to carry out this act. The unconditional  U.S. backing for Israel, particularly at the recent humiliating  negotiations, provided a safe climate for the Israeli Government  to perpetrate this crime. The other accomplices are all those  writers, politicians, and media personnel who beat the drums and  did their utmost to undermine the Islamic ranks who are  struggling against usurper Zionism and to transform the conflict  into a conflict between two wings of our nation. They did this  in line with U.S.-Israeli wishes.    Second, this incident marks the beginning of a new stage in  the progress of Zionist policy. It will not be the last  incident; the Zionists are still pursuing the policy they  adopted soon after the occupation, which aims to produce  stifling and insecure conditions for the Muslims. On the  threshold of this unjust solution to the cause, they seek to  prevent something called the Palestinian people from continuing  to exist in the usurped territories. They have succeeded in  turning the Palestinian people into a minority on their land.  They are seeking to weaken them more and terrify their ranks so  that the Palestinian cause can be handed over to oblivion and  loss. It is the usurpers' beautiful dream and naive  imagination. This incident is proof of their self-deceiving  imagination.    Third, this incident teaches all the Palestinians, Arabs,  and  Muslims the lesson that the usurpers of Palestine are continuing  their policy of assassination, terror, and deception. Polite  talk with them, compromise, and so-called peaceful solutions  will be to no avail. Had this incident occurred during the  armed fedayeen struggle carried out by Palestinian groups, it  could have been described as a retaliation. But its occurrence,  after those individuals who profess to be Palestinians signed,  with dirty and trembling hand, a document selling off Palestine,  demonstrates the inveterately hostile, uncompromising, and  usurping nature of Zionism.    Fourth, the zealous and heroic Palestinian people must, as  a consequence, decide their own future and not leave it for the  enemy to decide. The United States, Israel, and the corrupt  regimes who are U.S. puppets will not adopt a humanitarian  decision that honors the Palestinians. Those who opted for  negotiations think only of keeping their seats of power for a  few more days. They are heedless of the people who are wronged  and oppressed in their own country. Their youths are killed,  their women dishonored, their homes turned into graves, and  their mosques, worship, and prayers are transformed into  massacres. The Palestinians are Muslims and must therefore draw  inspiration from their great Koran, which says: "And why should  ye not fight in the cause of God and the cause of those who,  being weak, are ill-treated and oppressed, men, women and  children." [Koranic verse]    The Koran also describes the enemies of God: "In a believer  they respect not the ties of kinship or of covenant. It is they  who have transgressed all bounds." [Koranic verse]    Jihad is a difficult endeavor that needs endurance but it  pleases God almighty, shatters the chains of bondage and  humiliation, and guarantees an ideal future. Palestine has no  security even in its own territory. Its life without struggle  is not easier than a life of struggle.    No right is greater than God's words: "And if any strive,  they do so for their own souls, for God is free of all needs  from all creation." [Koranic verse]    I ask the exalted to bestow enlightenment and vigilance on  the Islamic nations so that they can fulfill their duty to the  Palestinian cause, especially as this issue has become more  bitter and more afflicted.    International Jerusalem Day next week is drawing near. It is  the arena in which the will of the Muslim masses becomes evident  and is an opportunity that expresses Islamic maturity. Let us  all appreciate this opportunity and raise our voices on that day  in the face of the usurpers of Palestine and all those who back  them.    In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful.    "When comes the help of God, and victory, and thou dost see  the people enter God's religion in crowds, celebrate the praises  of thy Lord and pray for his forgiveness, for he is  oft-returning in grace and mercy." [Koranic verse]</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION IN JANUARY TAKES A 1.2% DROP  </P> <P> Industrial production slipped 1.2% in January, the government said today, as  abnormally warm weather reduced utility use and auto makers temporarily laid  off workers to reduce bloated inventories.  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve said January's decline followed a revised 0.2% gain in  output a month earlier as a major strike ended at the Boeing Co. and utilities  fired up their operations to meet the demand prompted by the fourth-coldest  December on record. December's increase originally was reported to be 0.4%.  </P> <P> January's decline was the first dip in production since a 0.3% drop in October.  </P> <P> "In January, the output of motor vehicles was curtailed drastically, and the  extremely warm weather caused a sharp drop in utilities' output," the  department said.  </P> <P> Output at utilities fell 10.7% last month, the warmest January in 96 years of  government weather record-keeping, reversing a huge 6.3% advance in December.  </P> <P> And the layoffs at auto factories drove overall manufacturing production down  0.9%. Manufacturing output represents 84% of the index.  </P> <P> "Automobile assemblies plunged to a 4.1-million-unit annual rate from a  6.2-million-unit rate in December," the department said.  </P> <P> The interest-sensitive manufacturing sector has been among the hardest hit by  Federal Reserve efforts to restrain inflation by keeping a tight grip on  credit.  </P> <P> Production of durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to last more than  three years -- fell 1.7% after rising 0.3% in December and 0.4% in November.  </P> <P> Non-durable goods production increased 0.2%, reversing a 0.2% decline in  December.  </P> <P> In another report, the Fed said the operating rate of the nation's factories,  mines and utilities dipped 1.2 percentage points to 81.9% in January.  </P> <P> Factory use had remained steady at a revised 83.1% in December, largely because  of the weather-related 5 percentage point hike to 86.4% in the utility rate.  </P> <P> The factory-use rate was 83.1% in both October and November.  </P> <P> Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85% or above as an indication  of inflationary pressures.  </P></p>

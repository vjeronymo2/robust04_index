			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Manica Province Governor Artur Canana by </F> correspondent Antonio Elias in Manica; date not given]    [Text] [Elias] How many people from Manica Province are  believed to be living as refugees in neighboring countries?    [Canana] We do not have updated information on that matter,  but it is possible that some 100,000 people continue to stay in  Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Zambia.    [Elias] We have learned in Catandica that people who return  via United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  [UNHCR]-organized repatriation continue to receive aid for 18  months. However, those who return by their own means -- and we  believe that is the majority -- do not benefit from such aid.  It is rather senseless discrimination....    [Canana] I do not know. Any person who arrives, be it  officially or informally, receives the same treatment once  inside this country. What may well happen is that one family  arrives and it does not register immediately. When that  happens, the authorities have no idea who or where those people  are. This is why we have registry personnel in every district  and administrative area. They are there principally to deal  with unofficial arrivals. They go from village to village  registering the arrivals of families. Then, they take that  information to the district which, in turn, provides aid. They  receive exactly the same aid that is given to those who arrive  officially. Where the difference lies is that the people who  return officially do receive some items at departure points,  notably household goods. Those who arrive unofficially do not  receive those things. That is a difference, but they all get  aid for the same 18-month period.  <H5>  We still reach Mossurize through Zimbabwe </H5>   [Elias] What is the government's concrete role in the aid  given to those refugees, over and above the support granted by  the nongovernmental organizations [NGO's]?    [Canana] Even the aid by the NGO's is already an action on  the part of the government. The NGO's do not discover what  needs to be done. They go about their work after preliminary  contacts with us.    We have some infrastructure that needs rehabilitating, so we  negotiate with those organizations and each one of them does  what it can in accordance with its capabilities.    We share and we define priorities, notably in the water,  roads, health, and education sectors. Each NGO does what it can  within that framework and whatever is outstanding is financed by  the State Budget.    [Elias] Do you think that all of Manica Province's secondary  and tertiary roads will be open to use before elections are due  to be held?    [Canana] I do not think so. Our capabilities do not match  the great requirements or the volume of work at hand. We only  have one specialized enterprise and that is ECMEP [expansion  unknown]. In addition to that enterprise's technical  weaknesses, there is also the problem of financial incapacity.  On the basis of the work that has been done in this province,  it is our belief that we will only be able to complete the  rehabilitation of all access routes by 1996 and that only if  there are no other obstacles. Last year's road rehabilitation  plan was fulfilled and we have already started implementing the  plan for this year.    [Elias] Is road rehabilitation work being done without any  problems in Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo]-controlled  areas?    [Canana] We have had problems in those areas and we continue  to have them. Immediately after the cease-fire accord was  signed, we decided that priority should be given to the  rehabilitation of roads leading to areas which had been  inaccessible during the war. One example is Mossurize District.  However, even now we must still go through Zimbabwean territory  to get to Mossurize. We have not found common ground with  Renamo concerning reopening the national road to that district.  Rather, I should say that we were forbidden to do so. We had  also given priority to the road to Dombe, but they also stopped  us from rehabilitating it. We have found another road to Dombe,  along National Route One, but it is a much longer route,  something like 100 km more. We are working in other areas where  there are no restrictions.  <H5>  The parties must prove they are serious </H5>   [Elias] Many people view the country's central region as the  region where Renamo enjoys most influence. If that is true, do  you think that it will be possible for the Mozambique Liberation  Front [Frelimo] Party to win in Manica Province in the upcoming  October elections?    [Canana] Well, that is one reading of the situation. Each  person reads it in his or her own way. Like all the other  parties, Renamo and Frelimo must prove to the people that they  are serious. I do not want to think like the population.  [sentence as published] They know whether Renamo has done good  or bad. The Frelimo Party also knows, and I think it has done  well. It is not the accused that goes on the stand to declare  that it has won. You must wait for the judge. The people are  the ones who must say whether Renamo is dominant in the central  region. We are going to wait for our opportunity. The people  know what Renamo is, and they know what Frelimo is. It knows  the people, it works with them.    Renamo has done a lot of work here. It has worked very hard,  but only the people can tell whether it was good or bad work.  The Frelimo Party is present throughout the country. Only the  people know whether we are doing well or poorly and only they  will be able to answer that question. Let us wait and see. Ask  me that question again in November, once elections are behind us.    [Elias] What space have the other "unarmed" parties been  gaining in Manica Province?    [Canana] I do not believe they can do more than they have so  far. Those parties that are represented here are making an  effort to get through to the masses. I would not expect more  than that. Their penetration hinges on their conditions, their  skills, their work, their publicity, and their knowledge about  the population. That is not something that you can acquire from  one day to the next. That is something that takes time. I  believe that the formerly emergent parties now should have  another name because they have taken cognizance of that reality.  They are not managing the sort of penetration we have had.  That is impossible. We have the years that we have behind us.  It would be like expecting you to have as much grey hair as  your father. Your father gets grey hair as a result of many  years of life. We have the penetration we have thanks to our  years. When those parties become more mature, then, sure, they  will also be sufficiently well known. We have our years and we  are proud of them.    [Elias] Those "unarmed" parties are virtually unknown out  here....    [Canana] They are not particularly well known, but they are  known.    [Elias] In October of last year, MEDIAFAX published an  opinion poll by Gestinform which suggested that your work in  this province is viewed unfavorably....    [Canana] I am not commenting. They talked with the people.  I think that it is only natural that this person or that should  not like my work. They want me to do my work in some other way.  Nonetheless, I am calm, I know my duties as a governor, and I  know I am fulfilling them in accordance with the means and the  capabilities the state has been making available to me. That  opinion poll is just an opinion poll. It may, or may not, be  right. Whether it is right or not, it is just an opinion poll.  The fact is that I do not feel that citizens lack trust in me.    [Elias] Does it perhaps not have to do with the fact that  you  were not born in Manica Province?    [Canana] I can tell you that I have been a public servant  for  close on 25 years, of which I only worked five in the province  where I was born. I always worked away from it as an assistant  and then in more senior capacities. I have never felt any  rejection on account of the fact that I was not born in the  place where I was working and the same thing happens here in  Manica Province. I have never felt that this or that citizen  disliked me because I am not from here. I am not here to  represent the interests of some ethnic group. I am here to  ensure that laws are complied with and that citizens are  afforded protection. I do what I possibly can to fulfill those  goals.    [Elias] Perhaps you have concluded that the opinion poll  was not done correctly.    [Canana] Correctly or otherwise, I do not know. I do not  know why we should arrive at such a conclusion. Perhaps it was  conducted in a correct manner. I would not like to assess it  myself. I am also not going to comment on an assessment that is  somewhat secretive. If something should happen, the citizens  already have that information. The citizens talk, and we always  talk with the people. When the people have a problem, they  approach the official and say that his work is not to their  benefit. If they continue to be displeased about the work done  by that official, the people have the chance to complain about  him to a more senior official when the latter comes around. I  think that people have something to say, whether in a secretive  or in an open system.  <H5>  Has the electoral campaign not begun? </H5>   [Elias] What will be your role in the electoral campaign as  a  member of the Frelimo Party?    [Canana] As a provincial governor, I do not have a specific  role within Frelimo. As a member of the Frelimo Party Central  Committee, I might be given certain tasks by my party.    [Elias] Have you not started playing that role yet, seeing  that you are a Frelimo Party Central Committee member?    [Canana] As you are aware, the electoral campaign has not  begun yet.    [Elias] But it is difficult to see that there will be a day  when it will be declared that the electoral campaign begins  today....    [Canana] Whether directly or indirectly, we in the Frelimo  Party are generally contributing toward the successful  implementation of the peace process in all its spheres and that  necessarily includes creating the conditions needed for general  elections. As a governor, it is my duty to select cadres for  the provincial commission. Infrastructure must be created for  the provincial commission and the technical secretariat to  function. Technical cadres must also be chosen for the electoral  census. By law, that must be done by the governor. That work  is specifically intended for the elections and not for the  electoral campaign.    As a member of the Frelimo Party Central Committee I might,  however, be awarded a different task in terms of the electoral  campaign. I expect I will be given such tasks quite soon.    The Electoral Law does not forbid me, as a government  official, from participating in my party's electoral campaign.    [Elias] We have learned that Mr. Coelho, the owner of the  Garuzo tourist resort, has been ordered by the Interior Ministry  to leave the country in 24 hours. He appealed to the provincial  government, which reconsidered the measure....    [Canana] That is not true. Coelho has been a resident in  this country for many years, and, as far as I know, he does not  have any problems. Those who have problems are his daughter and  his son-in-law, and those are problems they did not get into in  this province. I do not know exactly where they got into those  problems, but it seems that it was up in Nampula Province. It  was for that reason that their residence permits were not  extended.</p>

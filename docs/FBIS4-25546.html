			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 12 KYODO -- Chinese Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen told his visiting Japanese counterpart Koji Kakizawa  on Sunday [12 June] that U.N. sanctions on North Korea would be  "ineffective," but that China is willing to play a "positive  role" in seeking a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue, a  Japanese official said.    While the meeting of the two foreign ministers focused  mainly  on the nuclear question on the Korean peninsula, Japan also  condemned the underground nuclear test carried out by China last  Friday, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said.    "It is extremely regrettable that the People's Republic of  China conducted another nuclear test. Japan has always regarded  the nuclear test ban as one of the highest priorities in the  field of disarmament and it strongly urges China not to repeat  nuclear testing in the future," Kakizawa was quoted as saying.    On the North Korean nuclear issue, Qian said China "will  participate positively in the discussions within the framework  of the United Nations and is ready to play its own positive  role," the spokesman said.    The Chinese foreign minister said applying sanctions to  North  Korea would be ineffective, judging from the fact that it has  already been isolated and has little economic contact with the  rest of the world, he said.    The spokesman refused to speculate on whether China would be  willing to go along with U.N. Security Council sanctions under  discussion, or whether it would veto such sanctions.    "We explained to our counterpart our view that the situation  demands that the international community as a whole, through the  United Nations Security Council, consider an appropriate  response, including sanctions," he said.    "Our purpose is not to bring about punitive measures.  Rather, our objective is that North Korea dispel the doubts of  the international community over its nuclear development and it  come back to the dialogue table," he said.    Kakizawa said Japan values highly the work China has already  done on the issue and stressed the importance of China playing a  "positive role within the framework of the U.N.," the spokesman  said.    The two foreign ministers also discussed other issues of  bilateral concern, including growing and increasingly  "interdependent" economic and trade ties and China's entry into  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), he said.    Kakizawa's one-day visit follows his talks with South Korean  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Undersecretary of State  Peter Tarnoff, held Saturday in Seoul on the recent developments  of the North Korean nuclear issue</p>

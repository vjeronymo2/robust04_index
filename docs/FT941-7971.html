			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Business and the Law: Safeguards on enforcement - European Court The European Court has ruled that German civil procedure rules infringe Community law in permiting a temporary property attachment order to be issued on the sole ground that a judgment will have to be enforced in another member country. The Court said such national procedural rules infringe the principles of a single market for judgments under the Brussels Convention on Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments. In particular, national enforcement rules which differ depending on whether a judgment is ultimately to be enforced within the domestic jurisdiction or in another member country are precluded by the prohibition of discrimination in the Rome treaty when read together with the Brussels Convention. The ECJ gave its ruling in response to a question referred to it by the Hanseatic Oberlandesgericht of Hamburg. The question arose in the context of litigation between a German Company, Mund &amp; Fester, and Hatrex, the international transport firm. Hatrex had transported a consignment of nuts from Turkey which had been damaged in transit. Mund &amp; Fester sued Hatrex for damages and interest. Since Hatrex was based in the Netherlands, Mund &amp; Fester also applied to the Hamburg court for a property attachment order against the truck belonging to Hatrex used to transport the nuts. The truck was still in Germany. The German rules on property attachment orders provided that an order may be made in the context of a judgment to be enforced within the national jurisdiction only when it is likely that, without the order, enforcement would be impossible or fundamentally more difficult. Yet, when a judgment would have to be enforced abroad, that was sufficient justification in itself for an order. The Hamburg court refused the order on the ground that the foreign enforcement provision was inconsistent with the Brussels Convention in a case where a member country was involved. Mund &amp; Fester appealed. They claimed German rules on attachment orders were unaffected by the Brussels Convention. The Hamburg appeal court asked the ECJ to interpret the Brussels Convention in these circumstances. The ECJ said the question effectively asked whether the Rome treaty prohibition of discrimination on the ground of nationality read together with the Convention precluded such rules which differ between domestic and foreign judgments. First, the ECJ determined that the German provisions came within the scope of Community law. Since the Brussels Convention was based on article 220 of the treaty which dealt with the recognition and enforcement of judgments, national rules in that field are subject to relevant Community law. Second, the Court said that the treaty prohibition of discrimination on the ground of nationality prohibited all such discrimination in areas within the scope of the treaty. Discrimination included disguised discrimination, which took the form of applying different criteria which had the same result as overt discrimination. The Court ruled the national rules of civil procedure in question were a form of disguised discrimination on the ground of nationality. Although the rule did not exclusively prejudice foreigners, it was unlikely often to apply to Germans. Finally, the ECJ concluded the attachment order rules were contrary to the Rome treaty's ban on discrimination since they could not be objectively justified. According to the ECJ, the enforcement risks in all member countries were no greater than in Germany because all are contracting parties to the Brussels Convention. As indicated in the interpretative report on the Brussels Convention, the territories of the contracting parties can be considered as a single entity.

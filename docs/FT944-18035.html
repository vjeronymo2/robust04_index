			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: GM shakes up senior management General Motors has announced a shake-up of senior executives in its core North American operations, in a move intended in part to recognise the successes of its Saturn small car division. The reshuffle brings two executives to the fore: Mr Richard 'Skip' LeFauve, head of Saturn, who has been given responsibility for all small cars in North America; and Mr Donald Hackworth, who will run the medium-sized and luxury car businesses. Mr Richard Wagoner, who became president of GM's North American operations this summer, said there were 'a lot of good ideas in Saturn that need to spread across the company', though he added that 'the flow will not be one-way'. Saturn accounts for some 300,000 of the 3m cars that GM produces in North America each year, compared with the 1m vehicles produced by its other small cars division, the Lansing Automotive Division. The company said its North American car operations would continue to be run as four separate divisions, and that it was not making any changes to its product lines. Mr Wagoner said no specific cost savings were projected as result of the shake-up. The move comes as production at the US's biggest automotive group continues to pick up after a strike at a parts plant in Michigan, which brought several production lines to a halt last week. The strike ended when GM agreed to demands from the United Auto Workers union to hire more staff at the plant to reduce the overtime load on the existing 11,000 workers. Mr Wagoner said yesterday that settlement of the dispute did not mean GM would give in to demands for extra staff at other sites. The company looked at staffing levels plant by plant, and had settled other similar issues without adding to staff levels, he said. Mr Wagoner characterised the latest strike as a symptom of expanding demand in the US, which had caused 'bottlenecks' at various points in the production and distribution chain. 'Clearly, we are hitting some rough spots,' he said. The question for the GM's management, he added, was: 'How do you manage the upside, while leaving the company prepared for any future downturn?'</p>

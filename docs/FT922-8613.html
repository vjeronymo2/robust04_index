			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Crossing the Ts on going upmarket / A look at moves towards higher quality For most of its 150 years, the Churchill group has made fairly utilitarian tableware. But by the late 1980s, the cheaper end of the china business was becoming increasingly competitive. 'That part of the market was becoming more price sensitive and margins were under pressure,' says Stephen Roper, managing director of the Stoke-on-Trent company, which expects 1992 turnover of Pounds 35m and employs 1,300 people. The Churchill management, headed by Roper and his two brothers, sat down to analyse their problems. Their existing customers, mainly chain stores and mail order companies, wanted better design and more variation. When the Churchill team looked more closely they found a gap in the market for standard 20-piece tableware sets between Pounds 19.95 and Pounds 34.95. They decided to pitch in with a set offering more up-market design features priced at Pounds 29.95. After a slow start, the new Chartwell range became popular and is this year expected to reach sales of Pounds 6m out of domestic tableware sales of Pounds 25m. Roper calculates that the Chartwell range produces a 15 per cent return on sales compared with 5 per cent by its cheaper ranges. The record of British industry for improving quality has not been good. Many companies have sought, unsuccessfully, to compete on price at the lower end of the market. 'Increasingly this is a high-wage, high-cost economy. Companies have to add value to survive,' says Tony Morris, head of strategy and marketing at accountants Robson Rhodes. But moving up-market can impose considerable burdens on a business. 'They often lack the appropriate technical and management skills,' notes Morris. 'They need to improve their quality and control systems. It often involves a change in management culture.' Brian Moore, managing director of Thrislington Sales, a manufacturer of toilet partitions, confirms the scale of the change which a company needs to undergo in its move up-market. Thrislington started out supplying cheap and cheerful cubicles to the building trade but now sells specially designed cubicles to architects. 'We have gone from operating out of a small workshop to a business with its own product range made under licence around the world,' says Moore. The move up-market led to a doubling of the company's margins. It now employs 50 people and had turnover of Pounds 4m last year. It produces laminated panels and assembles the cubicles in a 40,000 sq ft factory near Chester. The experiences of Churchill and Thrislington show that key elements in a company moving up-market are: DESIGN When Moore started making cubicles, his main selling point was the speed of delivery - lead times of competitors were typically 16 weeks. But the basic quality of the cubicles meant they did not appeal to architects specifying equipment for big construction projects. Moore decided to call in a professional designer. He asked David Goodwin, managing director of his own product design consultancy, Goodwin Emck, to design a more up-market cubicle. The new cubicle, launched in 1986, won a leading design award and has since gone on to take a quarter of the market for higher quality cubicles, says Moore. Churchill, for its part, beefed up its in-house design department and introduced new features to its Chartwell range which gave customers the feel of added value. These included a move to four-colour from two-colour printing on its tableware, the introduction of a 10-sided plate design, fluting on cups and bowls and more informative packaging. MARKETING Churchill was forced to take a critical look at its markets and it made its first serious study of pricing and the sort of features which would appeal to its more mid-market customers. Even so, the launch of the Chartwell range was a nail-biting time. 'Our trade customers didn't have to buy,' says Roper. 'They asked what Churchill was doing in the middle range when we had been at the low end of the market for 100 years.' Buyers were wooed by providing them with tableware which offered all the design features, and more, which they would have expected for the price, says Roper. Encouraged by the Chartwell launch, Churchill appointed its first full-time marketing manager, Wendy Morton. Previously a small group of senior people in the company had selected the tableware patterns they thought would sell. 'We now do much more extensive market research,' says Morton. 'We also monitor trends in kitchen laminates, wall coverings and paints.' PRODUCTION Moving up-market meant Churchill had to make a considerable investment in the four-colour printing equipment and in a dust press to ease manufacture of the 10-sided plates. Making a more complicated range slowed down production. Middle-range customers expect a greater choice of items such as coffee jugs and sauce boats which require skilled hand-casting compared with the more mechanised production of plates and cups. For Thrislington, which had always bought in components for its cubicles, the impact on production was less marked. But a greater use of nylon and aluminium components pushed up tooling costs and meant new suppliers had to be found. QUALITY Moving up-market brought both companies into contact with more demanding customers and they have had to pay close attention to quality. But neither appears to have made a fundamental change in the way they monitored quality at the time of their moves up-market. Only now are both starting to modify their procedures to conform to BS 5750, the most popular UK quality standard. But going up-market is not a once-and-for-all process. Both Churchill and Thrislington are working on new products which will take them further in this direction. Churchill plans a new, slightly more expensive range. Thrislington, meanwhile, plans to launch a new design intended to break into the market currently held by the one-off joiner-made cubicle.</p>

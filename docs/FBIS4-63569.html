			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Valeriy Krasnyanskiy, head of the St. </F> Petersburg Property Fund, by Valentina Shestakova; place and  date not given: "I Consider Myself a Member of Sobchak's Team"]    [Text] A new head of the Property Fund has been  appointed--Valeriy Krasnyanskiy. For seven generations the  tradition has been for the eldest sons in the Krasnyanskiy  family to became jurists. In 1971 Valeriy finished postgraduate  studies. In 1980 he began to teach at the university's law  school.    In 1986, together with Petr Filippov, Anatoliy Chubays,  and others, he took part in creating the Perestroyka Club; in  1989 he was in charge of Yuriy Boldyrev's election campaign. In  1990--elected to the city soviet; 1993--appointed a member of  the Central Electoral Commission of the Russian Federation.    [Krasnyanskiy] I have not had any illusions regarding  communism almost since childhood. In school, I studied with  opposition-minded professors and associate professors who ended  up there via the second Leningrad case. I envisaged the reform  of the Soviet system as more evolutionary, through.    I was not a supporter of shock therapy: First we needed to  correct the situation in the economy, then free people's  spiritual life from control, and only then change the political  structure. However, we want everything and right away. Well,  this seems to be Russia's fate...    [Shestakova] Does it not seem to you that there is something  insulting to the individual about voucher privatization?    [Krasnyanskiy] Each of us received a voucher and had the  opportunity to invest it. Those who were luckier and smarter  found a good place for their vouchers and receive dividends. In  addition, each employee owns part of his enterprise's property.  Everybody was given a chance to become an owner.    [Shestakova] St. Petersburg is ahead of practically all the  regions in the pace of privatization.    But have we not paid too high a price? Do you not think that  running in front of the locomotive was somewhat artificial?    [Krasnyanskiy] On the all-Russia scale--no. Life always  makes  it difficult for those who are ahead. But what has been taking  place is moral, because the concept of voucher privatization  turned out to be viable. Vouchers stimulated the formation of  the stock market and created conditions for attracting  investment for enterprise development.    Seven million privatization vouchers have been collected in  the city, which exceeds St. Petersburg's population. The process  of secondary privatization is beginning, where small investors'  shares will pay off.    The second stage will begin after 1 July and will proceed in  keeping with the "Post-Voucher Privatization Concept" developed  by the State Committee for Administration of State Property.  Those who did not want to undergo reorganization have been left  on the sidelines. Now they face either gradual privatization or  getting the status of a state-owned entity. Socialist methods of  administration will be applied to such organizations:  record-keeping and control, strict limitations on wages, and so  on.    [Shestakova] Grounds keepers will appear on the streets  again...    [Krasnyanskiy] Apparently so.    After 1 July stock will be sold only for money. Therefore,  before assuming 51 percent of stock, the labor collective will  have to think it over many times. The best privatization option  will be the first one, under which the collective keeps 25  percent of nonvoting preferred stock, which is more attractive  for investors.    No restrictions are envisaged for foreigners in buying and  selling stock. Although we should not count too much on  foreigners' help--they are in no hurry to come to Russia.    [Shestakova] Will there be land vouchers?    [Krasnyanskiy] As securities--probably not. But investors  want to have ownership rights not only to the enterprise but  also to the land lot on which it is situated. The Property Fund  has prepared the corresponding documents; they are currently in  the approval stage. So selling land will be permitted de facto.  Its value will be determined by a scale approved by the city  council, after applying certain coefficients.    Among the new features in the government program of  privatization of state and municipal enterprises in the Russian  Federation after 1 July is the possibility of putting up for  investment auction both entire enterprises as a whole (not just  a block of stock) and selling through an investment bid the  rights of cofounder.    At the end of May the concept of the St. Petersburg program  will be submitted to the judgment of the government.    [Shestakova] And here, again, "there are possibilities,"  since the program of post-voucher privatization is not yet  ready, which means that the legislative base will be formed as  we go.    [Krasnyanskiy] Unfortunately, you are quite close. First,  the  program does not specify the time frame for the transfer of  payments, and on these grounds frictions may develop with the  treasury and the tax inspection. Also, it is not clear what  constitutes directly privatization activities of our fund, since  part of it is taxable and the rest is not. The confusion arises  mainly because normative acts are drafted by people far removed  from jurisprudence.    [Shestakova] Any person in a government job is guilty  all-around these days. Remember, like in the movie "Wedding in  Malinovka": "a change of authority..." Today it is the whites,  tomorrow the reds, and then the striped. The one at the end of  the line is at fault. And this usually befalls the direct  implementers of privatization at the slightest shift in the  political course. Does this not frighten you?    [Krasnyanskiy] Every reform is associated with difficulties;  it inevitably brings down the standard of living, causes  discontent, and becomes associated not with the objective  process but with the people implementing these reforms.    If I find myself to be the last in line, I will be guided  exclusively by my own convictions and the law.    [Shestakova] What team do you associate yourself with?    [Krasnyanskiy] The reformist one. And as a functionary--with  Sobchak's team.</p>

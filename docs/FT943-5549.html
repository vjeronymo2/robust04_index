			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Chechen rebels head for capital Opposition forces in the Russian North Caucasian republic of Chechnya are moving closer to the capital, Grozny - and are calling for the overthrow of the republic's president, General Dzhokar Dudayev. According to spokesmen for the various forces now opposing Gen Dudayev, four regions are under their control and highways to Grozny have been cut a few kilometres from the city. The Chechen provisional council, the main opposition group, said that presidential forces were repulsed on Thursday as they attempted to regain control of one region, Urus-Martan. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the former speaker of the Russian parliament, has emerged as a main focus of the opposition - in uneasy alliance with forces of Mr Ruslan Labazanov and Mr Umar Avturkhanov, two warlords who control different areas of the republic. Russia has threatened intervention but seems likely to stay on the sidelines. Mr Alexander Shokhin, a Russian deputy prime minister, said yesterday: 'We must use political means in Chechnya.' Gen Dudayev's military spokesman claimed that an opposition tank column backed by Russian helicopter gunships was advancing on a village about 30km north of Grozny. The gunships had fired on government positions, he claimed. But the defence ministry in Moscow denied any Russian role in the fighting.</p>

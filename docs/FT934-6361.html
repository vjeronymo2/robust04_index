			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Kwik Save says the going will get tough Kwik Save, the UK's leading discount food retailer, yesterday unveiled a 14 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 126.1m, but admitted the supermarket price war would make it hard to maintain its sales and profits growth of recent years. Mr Graeme Bowler, Kwik Save's chief executive since June, said there had been an 'unprecedented surge' in price competition as superstore chains had woken up to the changing nature of the UK food market. 'I think the superstores have done a wonderful job for years of pulling the wool over customers' eyes, and telling them it really doesn't matter how much they spend on food,' he said. That had opened the way for the discount sector - a problem which the superstores were now addressing. 'It will be harder to maintain the rate of growth in sales and profits we have experienced over the last five years,' he conceded. Mr Bowler vigorously countered City fears that Kwik Save had lost its edge on price by extending its range. He said its wider range, including leading brands at very low prices, set it apart from the 'limited offer of mainly unknown brands' provided by newcomers to the UK discount market such as Germany's Aldi, Denmark's Netto, and France's Ed. Kwik Save's sales for the year to August 28 increased 14.4 per cent to Pounds 2.86bn. Some 8.4 percentage points of the increase came from existing stores, with 'no discernible inflation' in selling prices. That meant Kwik Save's sales growth was ahead of the leading superstore chains, which have been seeing negligible underlying growth in recent years. New stores added 6.1 points, with a handful of store closures removing 0.1 points. Mr Derek Pretty, finance director, said gross margins were down slightly. That resulted partly from rising sales of lower-margin liquor and tobacco, but also from Kwik Save's policy of investing gross margin in lowering prices to drive volumes. He added, however, that Kwik Save had been able to pass some margin pressure on to its suppliers. The operating margin fell from 4.2 per cent to 4 per cent. Mr Pretty also emphasised the group's strong cash-flow, which enabled it to spend Pounds 103.2m on 69 new stores, store refits and new systems, without borrowing. Capital spending is expected to increase to Pounds 120m next year, with up to 80 new stores to be added to the 814 trading at the year end. Income from concessions within Kwik Save stores selling fresh foods - an important part of the Kwik Save formula - increased 23 per cent. Earnings increased 15.1 per cent to 55.49p. The final dividend was 12.9p, bringing the total for the year to 18.3p, up 14.4 per cent. The shares closed down 9p at 573p. Lex, Page 22</p>

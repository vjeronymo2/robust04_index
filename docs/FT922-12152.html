			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Poland keeps grip on budget spending POLAND'S new government is keeping a tight grip on budget spending as first quarter inflation is running at lower-than-expected levels. Figures from the Central Statistical Office shoe the deficit reached Zl 10,450bn at the end of March, Zl 7,500bn less than the ceiling fixed by parliament for the first quarter.  The budget deficit is one of the key indicators the International Monetary Fund will be considering in forthcoming talks with the Poles; it is insisting that the figure not exceed Zl 65,500bn for the year. The talks are aimed at agreeing new performance criteria and should lead to the release of new tranches of a Dollars 1.6bn extended facility suspended when the previous government allowed the deficit to exceed agreed targets. The lower-than-expected deficit comes despite a 10 per cent shortfall in first quarter revenues and was achieved thanks to a sharp 17 per cent cut in planned spending.  This policy of cutting spending will come under strain in coming months as state sector industrial profits, which are the main source of revenues, continue to weaken despite a growth in sales in March. Consumer prices in the first quarter rose by 12.7 per cent compared to the last three months of 1991, or a couple of percentage points below expectation.  The results also show a sharp 17 per cent rise in industrial sales in March compared to February when sale had already begun to show signs of improvement.  March saw unemployment decline for the first time since free market reforms were introduced in 1990. It fell 25,000 to 2.2m. However, this probably reflects changes in rules on benefit entitlement. Figures for foreign trade are unavailable but the rise in industrial sales could reflect a growth in exports as a recent 12 per cent devaluation of the zloty begins to work through.</p>

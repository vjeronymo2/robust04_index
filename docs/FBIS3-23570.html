			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by IZVESTIYA correspondent Igor Andreyev: "Aircraft </F> Competition: MiG or YaK?"; first paragraph is IZVESTIYA  introduction]    [Text] In the waning days of February, two leading aviation  development bureaus will present the Russian Federation Air  Forces with competing proposals for a new generation of fighter  aircraft. The one chosen as the winner by military aviators will  be granted the honor of providing this kind of aircraft not only  to Russia and the CIS member countries, but to numerous  customers located in distant foreign countries as well.    IZVESTIYA has already discussed one of the competitors  (issue  No 25 of 1994). This is the MiG firm, which is widely known  domestically and in foreign countries. Equally famous is its  rival in creative commercial endeavors, the YaK corporation,  which was the traditional supplier of "flying classrooms" to  Soviet aviation and our former allies. The need for this kind of  aircraft is great, since Russia alone will require 800 aircraft  for employment in the so-called advanced pilot training. Taking  into account the needs of the CIS member countries and "Third  World" states, the total amount needed is about 1,200 new  aircraft. The production program is enormous, with the potential  of effecting a substantial change in the nature of Russian  exports, an area in which no boasts of a preponderance of  science-intensive products can be made.    YaK, hoping to emerge as the winner of the competition, has  its eyes set not only on financing a military aviation program,  but more on mass use of this aircraft, thus attracting the  undivided attention of potential foreign purchasers and serving  as a reliable indication of quality of the fighter. In any  event, this is the view held by the corporation's foreign  partner, Aeromacchi, Italy's oldest aircraft manufacturer. The  Italians became familiar with the YaK-130 project in last year's  air show at Le Bourget, where they expressed a desire to become  part of a deal -- to participate in creating the machine and  selling series-produced craft in their traditional markets  located in Southeastern Asia, the Near East, South America, and  even New Zealand. The Russian side will handle sales at home and  in the CIS. Also contributing to a great need for a new trainer  in our country is the fact that mutual payments between the  Comecon partners were made in currency, at full world prices,  for components and spare parts supplied to Russia by Hungary,  the Czech Republic, or the Slovak Republic. One has only to  realize that the obsolete Czechoslovak L-39s, which were used to  teach at least two generations of our pilots to fly, are sitting  on the ground -- hundreds of them -- due to a shortage of spare  parts. To prevent this kind of trouble, the Air Forces have  served the designers with a strict requirement: All components  must necessarily be manufactured domestically. Strange as it may  seem, the Yak-130's most important assembly, the engine, will be  supplied by Slovakia, of all places. That is, Russian engine  designers have been hard at work coming up with a modification  of the small power plant, long produced in that country under  Soviet licence, for installation in this aircraft. The "prodigal  son," which has been ransomed from the Slovaks to obtain rights  to series production in its homeland, will be returning home.    This year, the Yak-130 will be fabricated "in the flesh" and  flight testing initiated. Nowhere in the world is there yet an  aircraft possessing such superior flight and technical  characteristics. It is the only craft capable of flying at  extreme angles of attack fatal for other aircraft and of  executing the famous Pugachev Cobra. Built into the design of  the controls is the capability of changing their "habits" to  endow the aircraft with the characteristics of the basic fighter  models in the inventory of our Air Forces and those of foreign  countries. The design computations of the YaK people are being  closely followed by the Aeromacchi specialists, who wish to end  up with a flying craft offering the same characteristics the  project calls for. Of importance in addition to the purely  tactical characteristics are economic considerations, an example  of which is the requirement for lowering the cost of one hour of  flight of the Yak-130 by one order of magnitude, that is, by a  factor of 10, as compared to that of the Su-27.    If the YaK corporation wins the competition, its trainers  will be made available in 1997 to customers located in Russia  and in foreign countries.</p>

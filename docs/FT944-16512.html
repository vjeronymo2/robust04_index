			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / City aims to woo Russian companies The Corporation of London will take advantage of the Queen's state visit to Russia next week to promote the City as Europe's leading financial centre and attract Russian companies to London. London has become a haven for Russia's new rich and an increasingly important centre for deal-making involving Russian companies. Last month the Corporation helped the Chartered Association of Russian Commercial Banks to set up an office in London and has encouraged Polish and Georgian businesses to set up centres in the City. The Corporation launched a trading initiative this summer in central and eastern Europe to promote the network of financial, legal and other facilities offered by the City.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister Yi  Hoe-chang has instructed government ministries and agencies to  complete their reorganization plans for "a small but efficient  government" by the end of April, although it is unlikely that  all will meet the deadline. As of Monday only nine, or 25  percent, of the 38 ministries and agencies subject to downsizing  had completed their plans. Among them were the Foreign Ministry  and five other ministries whose reorganization plans were  approved by the cabinet on Monday.    The completed plans of the nine ministries and agencies call  for a combined staff reduction of 301: Two by the prime  minister's office, 15 by the Economic Planning Board, 52 by the  Foreign Ministry, 33 by the Home Ministry, 43 by the Trade,  Industry and Energy Ministry, nine by the Health and Social  Affairs Ministry, four by the Labor Ministry, 28 by the  Government Administration Ministry and 115 by the Korean  National Railroad.    Of the remaining 29 ministries and agencies, the Finance  Ministry and 15 others have submitted their plans while the  rest, including the Defense Ministry, have yet to do so. The  National Unification Board, the Legislation Ministry, the  National Statistical Office, the Patriots and Veterans Affairs  Ministry, the Military Manpower Administration and the Korean  Customs Administration have not yet prepared their plans,  whereas the Environment Ministry, the National Tax  Administration and the Korean Industrial Property Office  submitted plans calling for a staff increase of 300 to 1,000 in  spite of President Kim Yong-sam's streamlining policy.    A Government Administration Ministry official said  examination of the plans submitted by the ministries and  agencies takes time. "But we're pressing them to complete their  plans by the end of the month," he added.</p>

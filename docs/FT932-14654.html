			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / UK Company News: Queens Moat replaced by Norcros in FT-SE Mid 250 QUEENS Moat Houses, the hotel company the shares of which were suspended last month amid financial difficulties, was yesterday removed from the FT-SE Mid 250 and replaced by Norcros, building products and packaging group. Under rules introduced last year, Queens Moat was withdrawn from the index after yesterday's close at a nominal share price of 1p compared to its suspension price of 47 1/2 p. Although this leads to falls in the value of the FT-SE Mid 250, the FT-Actuaries All Share and other indices, the new rules are designed to be more realistic. In the past, shares were withdrawn from the FT-SE 100 at their suspension price, which few shares could match if and when trading resumed. This meant it was often impossible for fund managers to match the performance of the index. The following is the full text of the statement issued by the FT-SE Actuaries UK Indices Committee after the stock market closed yesterday: 'The FT-SE Actuaries UK Indices Committee has today approved, following the suspension of shares in Queens Moat Houses on March 31 1993, that Queens Moat Houses be removed from the FT-SE Mid 250 at a nominal price of 1p and replaced by Norcros after close of business today. 'The removal of Queens Moat Houses has been made in accordance with Rules 7.4.2 and 7.4.3 of the Ground Rules for the Management of the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices. Rule 7.4.3 allows for a suspended constituent which subsequently restores its quotation to be reinstated at the value at which it was removed (eg, 1p). 'Norcros will be promoted to the FT-SE Mid 250 from the FT-SE SmallCap. 'No replacement company will be included in the FT-SE SmallCap. 'The removal of Queens Moat Houses from the FT-SE Mid 250 will result in the following adjustments to the FT-SE Actuaries UK Indices after today's close: FT-SE Mid 250: -10.47 index points; FT-SE Actuaries 350: -1.05 index points FT-SE-A 350 Hotels &amp; Leisure Industry Basket: -48.97 index points. FT-Actuaries All-Share: -1 index point; FT-A All-Share Hotels &amp; Leisure sector: -40.9 index points.' Lex, Page 22</p>

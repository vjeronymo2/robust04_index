			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: WANT FAME FOR FLEETING MOMENT?  </P> <P> I was watching a sportscaster the other night giving a live report on TV. Well,  sort of. Mostly I was distracted by the 15 or 20 kids popping over his  shoulder, waving their arms and capturing their 15 minutes of fame promised by  Andy Warhol.  </P> <P> It's amazing how that little red light on the television camera can activate  the "star gene" in everyone.  </P> <P> I've watched people who were told to push a button and release a Ping-Pong ball  with a number on it for the lottery -- nothing more.  </P> <P> They can't resist waving. Game-show contestants who are coached to say two  words, "Big money," and shut up, look into the camera and add, "I want to say  hi to my wonderful husband, Leroy, and my three beautiful children. Hi, Mitzi,  Marksy and Todd."  </P> <P> There was a time when the only way you could make it to celebritydom was to  become a movie star. Not any more. It's getting easier.  </P> <P> If you're a secretary, shred something; a lawyer, steal something; an  evangelist, cry; or a sports figure, drop off at the Betty Ford clinic for a  week or two. You can go on fertility drugs and give birth to a litter. . . make  an embarrassing home video . . . break into the Pentagon's computers . . . or  break into a celebrity's house.  </P> <P> Author Mifflin Lowe has even written a small handbook on "How to Be a  Celebrity." He has wonderful advice for celebrity authors: "Insult a major  religion. Islam would do nicely."  </P> <P> He advises talk-show guests: "As soon as you sit down, mention a city. Any  city. At least 50 people will applaud. Also mention your family is more  important than your career. If you want to become a political celebrity and  you're not a Kennedy, it's probably not worth the effort."  </P> <P> If you're already a celebrity, Lowe suggests you retire early and retire often.  And every time someone takes your picture, grab the camera and whack 'em across  the mouth with it.  </P> <P> Lowe tells you how to get there, but he doesn't tell you how to stay on top. In  New York one day, I was waiting in front of my hotel when a photographer asked  me to step aside. A limo approached and a dog got out as the photographer shot  a roll or two of film. I asked the doorman, "Who's that?" He said, "The dog who  appeared in 'Down and Out in Beverly Hills.' "  </P> <P> Where is that dog now? Hey, baby, two weeks at Betty Ford's clinic and he'll be  back on top.  </P></p>

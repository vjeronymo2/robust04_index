			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Deflator paints wrong picture of export volumes Sir, In his Economic Viewpoint (December 9), Samuel Brittan comments favourably on a recently published article by Peter Sinclair in the Oxford Review of Economic Policy, where export values have been deflated by a general price index, the gross domestic product deflator, to calculate a measure of export volume. There is little justification for the use of this deflator when an index of export prices is available. Its use could give rise to a significant distortion compared with the appropriate deflator. The fact that the inappropriate deflator makes a big difference must make one suspicious of the final result. If a measure of the purchasing power of exports is required, as Sinclair proposes in his article, it could readily be derived by adjusting the correctly computed export volume index by a measure of the terms of trade such as the ratio of export to import prices. The resulting indicator would not involve any breach of the conventions of index numbers, unlike the crude practice reported in the article.

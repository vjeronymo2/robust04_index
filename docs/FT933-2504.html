			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Ofwat set to fix water charges for next decade OFWAT, the water industry regulator, will announce next July annual percentage increases covering water bills for the next 10 years. The price rises will come into effect from April 1, 1995 and will apply until the year 2005. Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, said yesterday that 'price setting will not be a process of negotiation'. His statement followed comments from water company executives and investors who have said they expected the new price rules to emerge from 'horse trading' between Ofwat and the water companies. Ofwat and the companies will spend the next six months trying to resolve disagreements before the companies submit their business plans to Ofwat. The industry has clashed with its regulator in the past two years over the rate of return - a measure of profitability - which it should be allowed to earn on new investment. The issue, which remains unresolved, is central to the calculation of future prices because it determines how much of the cost of the industry's current Pounds 45bn investment programme is passed on to customers. Between April and July next year, Ofwat plans to examine every business plan and set draft price rises for each company on a confidential basis. Companies will then be given the chance to respond in writing before a single meeting with Mr Byatt, which 'would be the final opportunity for companies to bring to (his) attention any points which they wish him to consider'. The process is the first wide-ranging review of water prices since the 1989 privatisation. Ms Janet Langdon, director of the Water Services Association, said: 'All the companies will be glad to have clarification of the procedures and it is good that there is going to be some consultation through the final meeting.'</p>

Kostevyat: "Radio Communications in a  Motorized-Rifle Battalion"]    [Text] Tactical conditions (the type of battle, the  conditions for entry into it, and the nature of the conduct of  combat operations), the role and place of the subunit in the  combat formation, the combat mission, organization of  coordination and the command and control system, enemy  capabilities to destroy it, and also the terrain, time of year  and time of day affect the organization and support of radio  communications in a motorized-rifle battalion. Furthermore,  communications in a battalion largely depend on the condition of  the equipment and the experience of the specialists.    Let's examine how today, in our view, it is most advisable  to  utilize radio communications to support continuous command and  control of elements of the battalion's combat formation and of  coordinating subunits.    Let's assume that a motorized-rifle battalion is part of a  motorized-rifle brigade and that it has to transition from one  type of battle to another in a short period of time during the  course of combat operations. For example, in defense -- to  conduct an offensive against an enemy that has broken through,  in an offensive -- to repel an enemy counterattack or, on the  march -- to enter a meeting engagement. Both organic subunit  radio communications systems and also radios that are in the  armored vehicles of the battalion's companies and platoons will  be used to support radio communications.    In certain situations (specifically, while operating as a  tactical air assault force, in the mountains, on swampy terrain,  etc.), the motorized-rifle battalion can accomplish the combat  mission without heavy weapons and equipment. Then they have to  organize radio communications using only organic portable radios.    Consequently, you need to plan radio communications  beforehand so that it satisfies command and control requirements  to the maximum extent possible and its diagram does not require  major changes under any conditions of the combat situation.  Experience shows that a radio net and a type of its operation --  open telephone communications using coded topographical maps,  prearranged message codes and tables of call signs of ranking  officers --is the primary method of organization. One of these  variants is shown in the diagram.    <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008C-15A>           Organization of Radio Communications </FIG>      Let's assume that the motorized-rifle battalion commander's  (an R-14 BM or a BMP-1KSh), the chief of staff's (BTR-80K or  BMP-1K), and the reconnaissance platoon commander's (BRM-1K)  command-staff vehicles and two of the signals platoon's BMP-1's  (BTR-80's) are deployed at the battalion command-observation  post. The command-staff vehicles of the commanders of the  attached and supporting artillery, antiaircraft, tank, engineer  and flame-thrower subunits can also be located here. It has not  been excluded that the forward aircraft controller (FAC) will  arrive here with R-853 (R-859, R-809) portable radios.  Furthermore, communications personnel will set up the  motorized-rifle battalion deputy commander for weapon's radios  at the technical observation post which, as a rule, is located  near the command-observation post.  <H3>  Radio Communications With the Commander and Staff at the  Next Higher Level </H3>   It is organized by motorized-rifle brigade headquarters  communications instructions and it is best supported by brigade  and battalion men and equipment.    It is desirable to support the motorized-rifle battalion  commander's communications with the motorized-rifle brigade  commander on two radio nets on HF and ultrashort wave-band  radios in the open and encrypted modes. In the event of the loss  of communications, you need to provide for the entry of the  battalion commander's HF radio into the headquarters' duty radio  net through a higher echelon.    It is advisable to include an ultrashort wave radio that is  in a BMP-1K on the brigade staff radio net to maintain  communications with motorized-rifle brigade headquarters during  battalion operations in armored vehicles. If personnel are  fighting on foot, you need to carry out communications with the  commander and staff at the next higher level using a portable  ultra-shortwave radio.    When a motorized-rifle battalion is either the forward  detachment, a tactical air assault force, or an antiair-assault  reserve, you need to organize the battalion commander's  communications with the corresponding commander or staff by  connecting radios of various bands into their radio net.  Furthermore, if the battalion is acting as a TVD [tactical air  assault force], it would also be good to have communications  with the commander at the next higher level via a separate  ultrashort wave or HF radio net.    We think that it is advisable for the motorized-rifle  battalion reconnaissance commander to ensure he can operate on  the motorized-rifle brigade reconnaissance chief's HF radio net  to obtain the required information. And the commanders of the  battalion's mortar battery, antitank platoon and attached  artillery subunit operate in the ultrashort wave range on the  brigade artillery chief's radio net. They can also receive  information on the meteorological situation here. The air  defense subunit commander's radio communications with the  motorized-rifle brigade air defense chief should be organized on  his ultrashort wave radio net.    If the commanders of the reconnaissance platoon, mortar  battery and air defense platoon are located directly at the  motorized-rifle battalion command-observation post, the  battalion commander has the opportunity to obtain an alternate  communications channel with the brigade commander through the  radio net to which these subunits are connected.    Obviously the motorized-rifle battalion deputy commander for  rear services and weapons needs to ensure that his radios  operate on the ultra-shortwave radio nets of the appropriate  higher-echelon authorities for effective resolution of issues.    And one more thing. A brigade traffic control and regulating  service radio net is created on ultra-shortwave band radios for  command and control of battalion subunit movements forward to  occupy defense areas, at the final coordination line and also  while completing a march. The motorized-rifle battalion  commander's radio should be linked to that net.  <H3>  Radio Communications With the Commanders of Subordinate,  Attached or Supporting Subunits </H3>   It is best of all to plan command and control of battalion  subunits on three radio nets on R-111, R-123, R-159 and R-158  radios.    The first radio net is a battalion commander radio net  (R-111  and R-123 radios are utilized during operations in armored  vehicles and R-158 and R-159 radios are used while on foot). The  radios of the motorized-rifle battalion commander, chief of  staff, and the commanders of the motorized-rifle companies,  antitank platoon, air defense platoon and signals platoon should  operate on it. Furthermore, the radios of the commanders of the  mortar battery and reconnaissance platoon should be connected to  it when their command and control posts are located apart from  the motorized-rifle battalion command-observation post. A total  of 7-10 subscribers can operate here. This composition of the  radio net will permit the battalion commander to have stable  command and control of all elements of the combat formation,  while ensuring close coordination among themselves during the  course of the battle.    We need to note that when the enemy creates jamming and when  it is impossible to maintain communications with radios  installed in BMP's and BTR's, you need to shift to operations on  a radio net using portable radios and, of course, to shift to  another frequency.    The second radio net -- is also a battalion commander radio  net but one that is already linked to the radios of the  motorized-rifle battalion commander and chief of staff, and the  commanders of motorized-rifle companies, armored vehicle groups,  and fire ambushes. The following may be a part of this net: The  motorized-rifle battalion deputy commander for weapons, the  reconnaissance (combat reconnaissance) patrol, combat security,  and detachments for the elimination of the aftereffects of enemy  use of weapons of mass destruction, traffic control, removal of  obstacles and other temporary formations. Here we must provide  for the operations of the commanders of the attached artillery,  tank, antiaircraft, engineer and flame-thrower subunits. The  total number of subscribers is high -- 20-22. But for the time  being there is no other solution.    And finally, communications with rear services and technical  support subunits is organized on a special radio net. The chief  of staff radio, located in the command-observation post, is the  main one. It is advisable to include on the radio net the radios  of the battalion deputy commander for weapons (at the technical  observation post), the commanders of the VMO [logistical support  platoon], VTO [technical support platoon] and MEDV [medical  platoon] and also the armored vehicles designated for evacuation  of damaged vehicles. Furthermore, the motorized-rifle  battalion's combat subunit radios can be enlisted to resolve the  issues of evacuating the wounded from the battlefield and  delivering ammunition.    The last radio net is not created during battalion  operations  without heavy weapons and equipment. In this case, the radios of  the commanders of the logistical support platoon, technical  support squad and medical platoon can be included on the  motorized-rifle battalion commander's second radio net.    As we can see, the organization of the data of the three  radio nets in the battalion increases the stability of  communications and provides the required information  transmission capacity among all elements of its combat  formation. It is also quite important that the issues of  coordination can be efficiently resolved in the process.    In cases when the number of radios in the motorized-rifle  battalion is limited, the battalion commander's communications  with all subunits will have to be maintained on one radio net on  ultrashort wave-band radios. This variant is also acceptable  while completing a march.    It is also advisable to conduct the supervision of the  attached tank company by including the battalion commander's and  chief of staff's R-123 radios on this subunit commander's radio  net.    If an artillery battalion will support the motorized-rifle  battalion, their commanders will communicate either personally  (when the command posts are collocated) or through the artillery  battalion and tank company commanders' radio nets.    Communications with aircraft are provided through the FAC.  The experience of conducting combat operations in Afghanistan  showed that he usually arrived at the motorized-rifle battalion  command-observation post with a portable radio and operated on  aircraft and combat helicopter command and control and also  target designation and guidance vectoring radio nets.  <H5>  Radio Communications for Coordination </H5>   We know that precise organization of coordination is one of  the main conditions for the successful execution of combat  missions by the battalion. However, you won't manage to create  special radio nets for its support in a motorized-rifle  battalion because additional radios are needed to do that. And  yet there is a solution: The exchange of information between the  elements of the combat formation is carried out through  reciprocal entry into the appropriate radio nets, for example,  via the battalion commander's radio net but with the  authorization of the main station.    Moreover, this issue is also being resolved through personal  contact. This is possible when the commanders of the  motorized-rifle company and artillery battery are collocated at  a single command and control post, etc.    Thus, we must widely employ the method of reciprocal entry  into the needed radio nets to ensure reliable coordination in  the battalion and its subunits. Indeed, with one essential  condition: The motorized-rifle battalion communications chief  must think through this issue beforehand and disseminate the  required radio operating data to the appropriate commanders.  <H5>  Radio Communications in Battalion Subunits </H5>   The corresponding commanders' radio nets are organized to  ensure command and control in motorized-rifle battalion  companies, the mortar battery and independent platoons. The men  and equipment of the signals platoon and also of the subunits  are utilized here.    In each motorized-rifle company, radio communications are  ensured with the commanders of platoons, armored groups and the  fire ambush on the radio net using R-158 and R-123 radios. This  same radio net is also used to carry out command and control of  the crews of the armored personnel vehicles that will provide  fire support to disembarked motorized riflemen who are on foot.    It is advisable to provide two radio nets on behalf of the  mortar battery commander. The first radio net is for  communications with the senior officer who is located at the  fire positions and with the forward (flank) observation post.  The mortar battery command and control platoon's R-159 portable  radios are used here.    The second radio net is designated for command and control  of  the mortar platoons. It consists of the senior officer's and  mortar platoon commander's R-159 radios.    From the diagram it is obvious that, when necessary, the  mortar battery commander can directly command the fire platoons.    Proceeding from the assumption that observation posts will  be  sent out from the reconnaissance platoon in the defense and  while preparing for an offensive, its commander can be located  at the motorized-rifle battalion command-observation post. Then  you need to organize the reconnaissance platoon commander's  radio net (on R-123 and R-158 radios) on which communications  can be carried out with the observation posts.    You need to provide for the creation of a special radio net  for the antitank platoon commander through which he will be able  to control the operations of the subordinate SPG-9 and ATGM  [antitank guided missile] squads using R-123 and R-158 radios.    Destruction of airborne targets in battle is the mission of  the air defense subunit; by way of illustration, the SAM  [surface-to-air missile] platoon. Therefore, here we need to  have a radio net on R-123, R-147 or R-147P radios, through which  its commander will maintain communications with the commanders  of subordinate crews and air defense gunners-SAM operators. The  latter have an R-147P radio receiver. Therefore, they will also  be able to receive, in a timely manner, commands for the  destruction of enemy helicopters and aircraft.    The motorized-rifle battalion commander and chief of staff  must have the capability to enter their radios into the  appropriate radio nets in order to, for example, transmit an  urgent order to some subunit or other. This task has been  accomplished. However, the communications chief must prepare and  issue them the needed radio operating data beforehand.    Now, on the reception of warning signals on the airborne  enemy or radioactive, chemical, or biological (bacteriological)  contamination. They are being transmitted out of any sequence  from brigade headquarters to all of its commander's active radio  nets. You need to immediately disseminate received signals to  the personnel of subordinate, attached and supporting subunits.    In conclusion, we can say that reliable command and control  of all elements of the battalion's combat formation using radio  communications can be ensured through not only its skillful  planning but also through proper protection from enemy jamming.  The motorized-rifle battalion has all of the capabilities to do  that. They only need to be fully utilized.    COPYRIGHT: VOYENNYY VESTNIK No 9 1993</p>

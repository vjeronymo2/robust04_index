			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGENDA FOR CLEANING UP OUR DIRTY AIR  </P> <P> Now that summer has formally arrived, smog season has, predictably, also  arrived. We will be reminded to curb our outdoor activities during smog alerts,  and everyone will feel the disabling effects of poor quality air.  </P> <P> Substantial changes will have to take place in the Los Angeles area if air  quality is to improve, and car-pool lanes and Metro Rail are a good start.  </P> <P> Measures to further limit vehicle exhaust emissions should be aimed at the  large trucks and buses that spew clouds of black diesel exhaust, creating  sickening air for anyone in the vicinity.  </P> <P> These trucks and buses are almost always owned by businesses that have the  wherewithal to operate their vehicles in a non-polluting manner, and since  private-party motorists are required to have their cars conform to strict smog  specifications, then truck and bus lines should also have to adhere to the same  stringent policies.  </P> <P> WILLIAM A. MATTHEWS  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

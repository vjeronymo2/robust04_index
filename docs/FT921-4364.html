			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / A dirty small town in east Germany: A community coping with post-communist trauma THE DIRTY little town of Apolda lies slumped in a trough between the earthen waves thrown up by the former communist farming combines of north-east Thuringia. This is no resurrection showpiece to be paraded before touring worthies and would-be investors. There are no grand projects in Apolda. No tower cranes to match those stalking the skylines of nearby Erfurt, Weimar and Jena. Apolda is a small town in eastern Germany. Its 28,000 inhabitants, like millions of others in the former German Democratic Republic, are learning hard economic lessons in the post-communist world. In the centre of the town, where the coat of lignite soot is thickest, cobbled roads lead past tumbledown houses and silent factories. A mucky stream trundles along, nibbling at the brickwork of the brewery wall. Beyond the wall, however, there are gleaming new boilers, mash tuns and bottling lines. Mr Gunther Ramthor, managing director of the Apoldaer Brewery, was works director 'before the change'. Now he employs 68 where there were once 110. Mr Ramthor and his three partners have invested DM2.5m (Pounds 860,000) since they bought the plant on All Fools' Day last year from the Treuhand privatisation agency. Since then, they have seen production drop 30 per cent as freedom from communism brought freedom of choice and an invasion of advertised brands from the west. Mr Ramthor has also seen more than 20 would-be western buyers, and shown them the door, refusing to sell. Sales of Apoldaer are rising again. New markets have been opened in Saxony and Lower Saxony. 'People are beginning to understand the importance of regional and local businesses,' he says. Officially there is 25 per cent unemployment in the town , but the real figure is 50 per cent. Half are still hidden by Bonn-funded projects such as the job creation scheme which for a day last week occupied three young men, overseen by two others, in painting a pedestrian crossing. Apolda's knitting industry, which employed 8,000, now has 800 workers. The farming workforce has been halved. The chemicals works has collapsed, like the leather goods factory and the precision engineering plant which once made parts for Soviet timepieces. Many new shops have opened in the past year, and while many have since closed, shops are still the most apparent alternative employers. Mr Ramthor says people are learning. 'In economic terms they must first master the bicycle and work their way up to the Airbus. All agree it will take longer than the politicians say, but everything will come good eventually, because people now know they must do it for themselves.' Early waves of optimism and opportunism swept through the town and left behind confusion and disenchantment. A dozen town-centre shops which opened in the first months of unification have closed. Carpetbaggers set up an environmental engineering business, ran up DM2m in debts and disappeared. The collapse last year of plans for a car components manufacturer to employ 4,000 taught a hard lesson. Jobs do not come to a place like Apolda by the thousand. The reality is work for 50 former clock engineers making water meters for a western company, Hydrometer. Reflexite, a US optics concern, and the town's only foreign investor, has opened a workshop employing 16. Buried below the skyline 35km from the autobahn, and with no expectations of an early link, Apolda has developed its own ideas. Calls for aid to be redirected into building a Mittelstand ' a core of small and medium-sized private businesses, like the successful post-war project - have yielded favourable echoes in Erfurt, the state capital. Regional planners, faced with more pressing challenges in Thuringia's bigger blackspots, want the Apolda area declared an agricultural zone, and to be done with it. But the community wants more. 'The population is industrially oriented,' says local journalist Mr Joachim Henniger. 'For people to be asked to go back to the land goes against history and everything people were taught in the GDR time.' Plots are being marked out on the town's outer limits for industry parks to house yet-to-be-found businesses. Logic and local ambition, according Mr Henniger, dictate that these will process, pack, market and dispatch produce from the surrounding acres. Apolda is ready to transform itself from a satellite workbench for the old command economy into a vertically-integrated food processing economy. Most of the materials are to hand. First foundations comprise the 5,500 hectares of the Pfiffelbach farming co-operative. The communist ZBO agricultural combine was broken up and returned to its former owners which created a commercial group. The group has carved out the poorer land and sold chunks of it to industry park planners. There are experienced businessmen like Mr Ramthor, able to attract working capital. There are people like Mr Dietmar Scheunert, one of several hundred skilled workers from the now-closed ZBO workshops, doggedly fending for themselves. Patience is as plentiful as industrial cycles are long in Apolda. David der Strickersmann brought the knitting industry here in 1593 and market forces swept it away in 1991. The land remains. On the road out, the endless black acres, which will soon be green with crops of potatoes, wheat, and malting barley and hops for Mr Ramthor, do not seem quite so threatening as on the road in.</p>

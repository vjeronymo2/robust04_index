			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Swiss Probe Philip Morris Deal: Swiss authorities have launched a formal probe  of possible insider trading in Jacobs Suchard AG shares before the Swiss  chocolate and coffee group agreed last month to be bought by U.S. tobacco and  food giant Philip Morris for $3.8 billion.  </P> <P> "We have come across some aspects during our informal inquiries that could  indicate insider trading," prosecutor Daniel Tewlin said. "We now want to get  some information that we could not get through informal inquiries." By starting  a formal investigation, Tewlin is empowered to seize documents he thinks are  pertinent to the case. Insider trading has been illegal in Switzerland since  1988, but no one has ever been prosecuted.  </P></p>

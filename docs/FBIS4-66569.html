			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Review by Belkacem Rouache of book: Faillite des </F> politicards algeriens (The Failure of Algeria's Political  Leaders) by Maamar Boudersa, Rocher Noir, 1994]    [Text] Written in direct, straightforward style,  Faillite des politicards algeriens is a book about  contemporary Algeria by an academic who goes straight to the  heart of the matter by analyzing the current situation of the  country and the factors that have brought it to ruin.    "The policies adopted by Chadli sowed the seeds of social  instability, political confusion, and economic crisis," writes  Boudersa on page 25 of the book.    The author divides the book into four main parts: general  political principles; the crisis and solutions; the providential  man; and impediments to a solution. There is also a concluding  section with bibliographical references.    Citing Ibn Khaldoan, the author notes that: "war is natural  to man: Any nation, any race can serve as an example."    And examples are cited: the FLN [National Liberation Front]  versus French colonialism, Fidel Castro, diverse Third World  leaders combating underdevelopment, as well as the "wars" of  Western democracies against unemployment and inflation.    In Algeria, two statesmen opted for policies based on the  "war footing" principle. The first, says the author, was  Boumediene.    "The nation, he said, had enemies to vanquish:  neocolonialism, underdevelopment, illiteracy, regional  imbalance, poverty, misery, and injustices."    The second "warrior" who imposed himself on the national  political scene was Mohamed Boudiaf. The latter openly declared  war on the Algerian politico-financial "mafia," the author  notes. He quickly won legitimacy once he opted--intuitively, and  quite sincerely--for a policy based on the "war" that was  Boumediene's legacy. Indeed, his "battle" was espoused by the  entire nation, by society as a whole.    Maamar Boudersa says that politicians and statesmen who  ignore this principle and fail to apply it lead their country  down the path to instability, turbulence, even civil war.    Chadli, with his policies aimed at preserving power by  methods opposite to Boumediene's, sowed the seeds of political  and economic instability.    Thus Chadli, under the slogan "for a better life," gave  economic preference to consumption, to the detriment of  investment.    The author notes that this policy, presupposing a limited  economic role for the state, was inspired more by Keynes than by  Marx or Lenin, as others have tried to argue.    The author organizes the second part of Faillite des  politicards algeriens around studies of Algeria's heads of  government since the unrest of October 1988.    Hamrouche and Ghozali, he says, followed the same policies  as  their predecessors. The predecessors: in other words, those who  contributed, each in his own way, to the decade of the  1980's--which as everyone knows ended up destabilizing state,  society, and the national economy. Abdelhamid Brahimi was not  the only one to blame, he says. The team included Chadli, Taleb  Ahmed Brahimi, Larbi Belkheir, Belkaid Mehri, Messaadia,  Abdelghani, Belakhdar...    In all this criticism, our scholar spares Abdessalem, who he  says tried to solve the underlying problems, rather than just  put out brush fires like Hamrouche and Ghozali.    However, we know that even Abdessalem ultimately failed.  During his tenure, Algeria fell into a major economic recession,  aggravated by a policy that made war against practically  everyone but failed to score any victories.    Boudiafism! The author writes that the assassination of  President Boudiaf has benefited those who opposed him and who  after his death have sought to bask in his political legacy.  Boudersa recalls in this connection what Lenin wrote about false  Marxists: "Throughout history, after the death of revolutionary  leaders who were popular with the oppressed classes, the enemies  of those leaders have tried to exploit the reputation of the  deceased to dupe the oppressed."    Islamism versus nationalism.    The author writes that in order to realize its political  objectives, the outgrowths of a defeatist policy, and destroy  the system based on Boumediene's "war" legacy, a secret weapon  was chosen--a weapon that according to the author was eminently  serviceable, of local fabrication, and historically durable:  realization of the "old and defunct reformist-colonial project  introduced as an alternative to the national-liberation vision."    In the same vein, the author notes that the national charter  of 1976 was "enriched" in this direction, when the national  commission chaired by Taleb Ahmed called for establishment of an  Islamic state as elaborated by Mohamed Harbi's in  L'Algerie et son destin [Algeria and its Destiny].    Even Hamrouche discussed it in his talks at Matignon (Paris)  with Michel Rocard, as reported by the press: "The rise of  Islam, amplified by the French media, he said, disturbed and  dumbfounded many people, he said. But the government was never  upset or fearful. His analysis was correct. Events showed we  were right."    "The influence of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] quickly  ran up against its limits... Now...I have a real problem: I  would not like to see the FIS disappear. It is necessary for  this abscess of fixation, this socially reactionary formation,  to remain."    As for impediments to resolution of the crisis, Boudersa  says  that while corruption may have been the common denominator of  the political coalitions responsible for the country's ruin, the  only possible way to rebuild it is through a coalition against  corruption.    Boudersa bases this conclusion on the principle of war.  Boumediene made war on unemployment, the enemies of the nation,  underdevelopment, regional imbalance, illiteracy, and poverty.  Boudiaf made war on corruption, Chadli made war on Algeria.    An impassioned book, of burning relevance to today's  problems, and a very fast read.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Representatives from ARENA [Nationalist Republican  Alliance] have asked the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) to  recheck the vote count in the presidential election and correct  mistakes that have been observed.    Dr. Sergio Mena Mendez, ARENA's legal representative,  presented to the TSE General Secretariat a petition to  investigate the vote count because, according to ARENA's count,  there is a difference of more than 38,000 votes that cannot be  found anywhere.    Mena Mendez said his party knows perfectly well that the  deadline to contest the election results has expired, and that  it only wants the TSE to correct the mistakes that were made to  prevent them from being repeated in the runoff.    Mena Mendez said that after the final results of the vote  count for deputies were disclosed, members of ARENA discovered  an inexplicable difference of more than 38,000 votes between the  figures for deputies and the figures for president.    According to party representatives, this difference of  38,000  votes resulted from "a computation error at a specific number of  voting tables in San Salvador Municipality; it is an error that  affects all of the parties."    Mena Mendez said the party does not know where the error  could have occurred, and this is precisely what it is asking the  TSE to investigate.    As is well-known, all of the polling stations were manned by  a representative from each party, and because of this, it is  nearly inconceivable that more than 38,000 votes could have been  lost, including the vote count certificates that are signed by  each of the party representatives.    Mena Mendez argues that there were more votes for deputies  than for president which, according to ARENA, is unusual.  Nevertheless, the trend is proportional in terms votes garnered  by the respective parties. In other words, all of the parties  received more votes for deputies than for president.    Meanwhile, TSE President Dr. Luis Arturo Zaldivar said the  deadline to contest the presidential election results has  already expired, adding that ARENA's request is "completely out  of place."    Furthermore, he denied that such a mistake occurred at the  TSE computation center.    Following is a breakdown in the different number of voters  announced by ARENA in the election for mayors, deputies, and  president in San Salvador Municipality:    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Political Party   |Mayoral election  |Deputy election   |Presidential elec-|  |                  |                  |                  |tion              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |ARENA             |77,901            |80,968            |69,903            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Democratic Conver-|4,968             |9,492             |--                |  |gence             |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Farabundo Marti N-|38,848            |42,856            |38,156 *          |  |ational Liberatio-|                  |                  |                  |  |n Front           |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |National Revoluti-|514               |1,016             |--                |  |onary Movement    |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Christian Democra-|21,493            |16,539            |10,286            |  |tic Party         |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |National Concilia-|13,136            |4,504             |2,145             |  |tion Party        |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Authentic Christi-|357               |678               |348               |  |an Movement       |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Unity Movement    |2,835             |4,267             |2,575             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |National Solidari-|741               |1,061             |643               |  |ty Movement       |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Valid votes       |160,793           |161,381           |127,487           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Contested         |117               |152               |100               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Annulled          |4,224             |4,354             |2,853             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Abstentions       |561               |574               |478               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total voters      |165,695           |166,461           |127,487           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Difference in number of voters                          |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total voters, mayoral elections                         |165,695           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total voters for president                              |127,487           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Difference in voters                                    |38,208            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total voters for deputies                               |166,461           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total voters for president                              |127,487           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Difference in voters                                    |38,974            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |* Votes received by FMLN-CD-MNR coalition for presidential election        |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

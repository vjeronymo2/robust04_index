			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: 'Difficult two years' ahead for Volvo VOLVO, the Swedish auto group, is facing 'two extremely difficult years' as severe competition and depressed margins in its key markets of the US, Britain and Sweden take their toll, Mr Christer Zetterberg, chief executive, said yesterday. The company, the largest in Scandinavia, also announced its first joint project with Renault, the French auto group, with which it formed a strategic allegiance last year. The agreement covers the manufacture and delivery of car engines. Volvo's policy is not to give financial forecasts. However, Mr Zetterberg's gloom at the annual shareholders' meeting suggests the company faces difficult times as it struggles to recover from problems that resulted in a SKr1.03bn (Dollars 166m) loss last year. He disclosed the company was set to reduce its costs by a further SKr2bn next year after this year's SKr3bn savings through rationalisation and efficiency improvements, mainly in car production. This will involve a 7,000 cut in jobs from the company's 68,000-strong workforce by the third quarter of 1992. Some 5,000 of these will be in Sweden, where an estimated 69 per cent of Volvo's employees work. Mr Zetterberg stressed that Volvo had enough financial resources to cushion itself against adversity. He said its stock portfolio was worth more than SKr25bn - SKr10bn more than Volvo's acquisition value. The agreement with Renault promises to be the first of many joint projects between the two companies. It covers deliveries of gasoline-powered car engines from Volvo to Renault from the beginning of 1993. Deliveries during the first period will be valued at SKr2.5bn. In return, Volvo cars are to be equipped with diesel engines supplied by Renault. New calculations suggest that co-operation with Renault could save Volvo more than SKr800m a year for the next two to five years.</p>

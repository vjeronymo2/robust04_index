			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan 17): Slow march to full democracy - Politics PAKISTAN faces a clear political challenge: to move beyond the legacy of military rule and firmly establish the acceptance of democracy. Mr Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister, rules with a parliamentary majority in Islamabad and his IDA (Islamic Democratic Alliance) coalition controls the four provincial governments. But in a country ruled by army generals for 24 of the 45 years years since independence, Mr Sharif's government has yet to demonstrate clearly that it has full control. Suspicions continue over the army's aspirations to manipulate politics from behind the scenes. The government at times appears constrained by a complex informal decision-making structure, often called the 'troika', consisting of the army chief, the president and the prime minister. President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, an ex-bureaucrat and formerly one of General Zia-ul-Haq's most trusted ministers, has wide constitutional powers to dissolve the parliament. Two years ago, he exercised them by dismissing the government of Ms Benazir Bhutto, which itself had unexpectedly come to power in elections after the death of Gen Zia in an air crash in 1988. A government minister recently conceded that there is continuing nervousness over the fact that 'national politics and economic affairs need one clear decision making structure to go ahead rather than a divided one'. In public, army leaders and politicians deny that there are rifts between competing interests on important policy issues. But events such as a recent army-backed crackdown in the southern province of Sindh early this summer caused divisions between civilian and military leaders over the conduct of the operation. Mr Sharif's ruling alliance has been faced with rumours of an imminent change of government, prompted by splits, first with the conservative Jamaat-I-Islami party and subsequently with a Karachi-based powerful regional party, the MQM (Mohajir Qaumi Movement). The opposition PDA (People's Democratic Alliance), led by Ms Bhutto, recently announced that it would submit en-masse resignations of its members from national and provincial assemblies to force a crisis which would lead to national elections. However, the opposition has yet to announce a date for such action. PDA politicians concede that the decision is difficult because, if it failed to induce a crisis, their withdrawal could simply lead to by-elections for the vacant seats. Moreover, the opposition has still to generate enough public support. The result is that, to the extent that it is possibly to judge the outcome of political skirmishes, Mr Sharif's government seems set to carry on. Government officials say there are no clear-cut alternatives acceptable to the president, and the army is not likely to intervene directly. 'They cannot go back to Benazir Bhutto because they've already tried her. Changing governments every couple of years also makes it difficult to justify continuing this democracy,' said a senior official. However, Mr Sharif still faces difficult problems. Successive governments have been faced with rampant lawlessness in the southern province of Sindh. Highway robbers, professional kidnappers and militant political activists have been involved in crimes, fuelling fear among the local population and business community. Instability in Sindh risks weakening the position of the provincial government which is backed by Mr Sharif. At the same time, the fall-out could benefit Ms Bhutto, given that it is her home province. Islamisation of the country's legal, political and economic system is a further important test for the government. Last year, a 'Shariat bill' was passed in the parliament, to provide the basis for introducing Islamic laws in the country. Businessmen and international lenders and investors are concerned about the implications. Mr Sharif is attempting a middle line, calling for laws which make sense for businessmen but maintaining the government's public commitment to Islamisation and avoiding alienation of fundamentalist elements. The government is seeking to win popular support through a three-year Social Action Programme designed to improve health, drinking water and literacy. But with few opportunities for drastic cuts in defence spending and the government's debt service payments, there is limited ability to speed up development. Finally, there is little evidence of a thaw in bitter relations with Ms Bhutto's opposition PDA. From the government's side, there are few signs of any significant moves by Mr Sharif to discuss concerns such as the alleged large scale arrest and victimisation of Ms Bhutto's supporters. The PDA, which was itself unseated because of allegations of corruption, has meanwhile intensified charges of corruption and mismanagement against government leaders. With elections for the presidency due by the end of next year, the divide may widen further in coming months, as opposing camps prepare for the campaign.</p>

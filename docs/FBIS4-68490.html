			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Petition by V.S. Grigoriadi, V.I. Golovlev, A.L. Kushnar, </F> A.P. Pochinok, and V.P. Utkin, State Duma deputies from  Chelyabinsk, addressed to Russian Federation President B.  Yeltsin, dated 10 March 1994, under the rubric "It Is Official":  "Deputies of the State Duma From Chelyabinsk Ask the President  To Appoint a New Head of Administration"]    [Text] The press has already reported that Deputies  of the State Duma from Chelyabinsk V. Grigoriadi, V. Golovlev,  A. Kushnar, A. Pochinok, and V. Utkin have sent a letter to  President of Russia B. Yeltsin in which they make a critical  assessment of the socioeconomic and public policy situation in  the oblast and ask that the issue of appointing a new head of  the oblast administration be considered.    The deputies have approached the CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY  editorial office with a request to familiarize the voters with  the full text of their appeal and made it available for  publication.    To President of the Russian Federation B.N. Yeltsin    Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich!    All the deputies representing the 4 million inhabitants of  Chelyabinsk Oblast in the Federal Assembly are appealing to you.    We support the economic transformations you are  implementing.  Although we belong to different political groups (Russia's  Choice, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord), a problem has  brought us together which, as we see it, has reached crisis  level--the state of affairs in Chelyabinsk Oblast.    Since we have a realistic notion of how complex and  contradictory the political and economic situation in Russia is,  we are convinced that resolution of the main problems associated  with the processes of reforms and reinforcement of the Russian  state in leading industrial territories, of which Chelyabinsk  Oblast is one, would have proceeded more effectively and in  keeping with the main bearings and directions you have clearly  outlined in the Message to the Federal Assembly Deputies had the  executive authorities of regions pursued the course of the  president unswervingly and consistently.    Owing to the consolidation of progressive forces in  Chelyabinsk Oblast, our territory was one of the regions that  unconditionally supported the president and the course pursued  by him. This is confirmed by the results of voting during the  election of the president of the Russian Federation in June 1991  and the referendum in April 1993. Unfortunately the opposite  trend has been registered lately: a fall in the rating of the  president and his course. Here is proof:    --the results of voting on 12 December 1993 (our territory  ended up being the only one among the krays and oblasts to not  have representatives on the Federation Council);    --voting on ratification of the Constitution came close to  failing, which gave our political opponents the pretext to call  the results of the vote into doubt;    --a considerable reinvigoration of oppositionist forces in  the region has been registered, primarily the rapid growth of  the number of supporters of the Liberal-Democratic Party of  Russia.    Abuse of the president's trust is becoming a practice  expressed in violations of the law and deliberate failure to  carry out the edicts of the president and is creating an  environment of irresponsibility and permissiveness. This is  confirmed by the findings of a commission of the Central  Electoral Commission which operated in February of this year  concerning failure to carry out a number of presidential edicts,  a letter from Deputy Chairman of the Government A. Chubays (No.  ACh-15/942 dated 7 February 1994) concerning violation of the  Law "On Privatization of State and Municipal Property in the  Russian Federation" and Edicts of the President No. 1231 dated  14 December 1992 and No. 2284 dated 24 December 1993, by the  head of the Chelyabinsk Oblast Administration. Besides, social  tensions in the oblast are being fueled by the periodically  developing scandals associated with the operations of the local  authorities and exhibiting a criminal coloring, including those  related to issues of foreign economic activities, foodstuffs  procurement, uncontrolled disbursement and theft of funds from  the budget, and so on.    To our mind, all this has resulted from the fact that head  of  the Oblast Administration V.P. Solovyev has focused all his  activities on retaining personal power to the detriment of the  direct functions of executive structures. The administration has  been afflicted with continuous squabbling and the absence of a  genuine program of action for implementation of the president's  course. In recent months three first deputy heads of the oblast  administration and a number of heads of cities and rayons, who  "ventured" to raise the issue of uncontrolled disbursement of  the budget and strange connections between the administration  and a number of commercial structures, have been dismissed.    The head of the oblast administration justifies ostentatious  disregard for legislative and regulatory acts, dubious  operations involving budget funds, and his arbitrary personnel  practices by actions allegedly coordinated with first aide to  the president V. Ilyushin, which causes bewilderment and  profound doubts and directly discredits the president.    We believe that the head of the oblast administration does  not meet the requirement for a leader who is capable of  consolidating progressive forces of the oblast in order to  implement the presidential course of economic and political  transformations.    Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich!    The socioeconomic and public policy situation in the oblast  is becoming critical and requires that measures be immediately  taken to reinforce executive power and build confidence in it.    We ask that you consider the issue of appointing a new head.  In the event it is necessary to set up an interdepartmental  commission on the situation in the oblast, we ask that deputies  from our oblast be included in it.    Respectfully,    [Signed] V.S. Grigoriadi (district 182)    V.I. Golovlev (district 183)    A.L. Kushnar (district 184)    A.P. Pochinok (district 185)    V.P. Utkin (district 186)    10 March 1994</p>

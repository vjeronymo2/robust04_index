			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Insolvency priorities to include sick pay Holiday and sickness pay will rank as preferential creditors in the government's emergency insolvency bill amendment to be discussed in the Commons on Monday. According to a draft circulated yesterday they will be included as liabilities with wages, salaries and pension contributions, to be paid first from the proceeds of companies that enter receivership or administration. The legislation, which applies retrospectively from March 15, clarifies the difficulties raised following the Appeal Court ruling on Paramount Airways, the insolvent charter airline in administration. The judgment said that receivers and administrators would be deemed to have adopted the obligations of existing employment contracts after 14 days if they did not issue new contracts. After two weeks of lobbying, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, announced the changes on Monday and officials have been working since to introduce the legislation. A private member's bill to amend sections of the 1986 insolvency act dealing with the valuation of assets of liquidated companies completed its passage through the Commons without debate yesterday. The bill, sponsored by Mr John Butterfill, Conservative MP for Bournemouth West, now goes to the House of Lords.</p>

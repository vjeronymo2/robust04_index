			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Civil Engineering: Pounds 20m Hong Kong bridge development BRIDON ROPES, a subsidiary of Bridon, and RYLANDS-WHITECROSS, a subsidiary of TWIL, have won what is believed to be the world's largest order for high carbon steel wire through their joint venture company, European Bridge Wire. The contract, worth over Pounds 20m, has been awarded by Cleveland Structural Engineering, part of Trafalgar House Construction, and is for the supply of specialised high tensile galvanised steel bridge wire. The wire will be produced in equal quantities at Doncaster and Warrington and shipped to Hong Kong to be aerially spun on site to form the suspension cables for the Tsing Ma Bridge. The bridge will be one of the world's largest single-span structures, accommodating a double deck for road and rail traffic, with a total length of 2,100 metres and a main spain of 1,377 metres. The most technically difficult part of the whole bridge is the erection of the steel deck and the supporting suspension cables which will be carried out by Cleveland Structural Engineering. The bridge is expected to be open for rail traffic in 1996.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / EU poll issues that have guided Twelve campaigns: Portugal Voting Sunday. The vote will be a judgment on the centre-right Social Democrats (PSD) after almost two years of recession. It will also test the main opposition party, the centre-left Socialists, in the run-up to a general election in October 1995. On European issues, the two main parties differ little. Both are strongly pro-European. But while the Socialists openly advocate federalism, the PSD steers away from the term in favour of less emotive expressions such as European integration. Both favour a single currency and greater powers for the European Parliament. The PSD reflects growing Portuguese dissillusioment with Europe by taking a tough stand favouring Portuguese interests, particularly over agriculture. The Socialists have been criticising not the Common Agricultural Policy but the PSD government for failing to invest EU farm funds wisely. LIKELY RESULT: Polls put Socialists slightly ahead with 30 per cent against 29 per cent for PSD.</p>

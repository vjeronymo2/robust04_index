			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Arts: 'Punchbag' and 'Jamais Vu' Punchbag, a new play by Robert Llewellyn, is set in a women's self-defence class. The Hampstead stage is given over to the gym in Julian McGowan's neat design, with encouraging slogans - Assess; React; Terminate - around the walls. We, the audience, are the students, and a strangely passive lot, too, unmoved by the extraordinary courtship routines taken place around us. They involve instructor Lloyd, his side-kick Peter, who, as the 'punchbag', spends most of the play dressed like a plastic ladybird in protective clothing, and two of the women honing up their defence skills, spikey Jane and soft Polly. It is billed as a 'physical comedy', and there can be no complaints about the physical as the four actors fling themselves across the stage with frightening force and agility at Glen Walford's direction. The laughs come if you enjoy seeing women kick men in the groin; there is little doubt who the winners are here. Robert Llewellyn's play bears similarities to those Victorian moral tales which were expected to pep up the poor. In the first act we learn why women must be physically prepared to ward off fallen man; in the second, why there is little good in getting the body in shape if morals remain lax. At the end comes the sanctimonious punch line - to be really acceptable men must learn to say no. The characters are lightly sketched but the acting is so lively that you can forget the sermon and enjoy the fights. Sophie Heyman is excellent as the girl who likes to say yes; Buffy Davis is credible as the susceptible nice one, as is Eamonn Walker as the black leader burdened with sex appeal and Andy Serkis, as the wimp. * Ken Campbell walks on to the stage of the Vaudeville clutching the Evening Standard Comedy of the Year award. 'You can make your own mind up now', he says, placing it alongside the models of Munch's 'Scream' and a sexually erect Pacific Islander which comprise the minimalist set for his one man monologue, Jamais Vu. But can you make up your own mind? Over the next 2 1/2 hours Campbell makes the mind a very confusing place. His own embarks from Gant's Hill Library on a surreal journey, embracing John Birt clones, the Duke of Edinburgh and the inhabitants of Tanna, who regard the Duke as a God. On the way he befriends oddballs, from a drop out barrister happy in cardboard city to a resident of the Uxbridge Secure Unit, and he takes seriously their unreliable contributions to his convoluted ramble. Campbell is not for me. His comic personality is too close to the crazies he picks up to be relaxing. He is spot on at reproducing the scientific jargon which drives on their fantasies, but this is disturbing rather than witty. Sometimes, as in his imaginative conversations with Richard Eyre, director of the National Theatre (where Jamais Vu started) he sounds like Frankie Howerd on speed; sometimes he descends to desperate clowning, attaching sink plungers to his bald head. Campbell has a sympathetic personality and there is the occasional sharp one-liner. But he expects much of the audience in forcing it to linger so long to discover whether he can tie his imaginative meanderings into a coherent climax.</p>

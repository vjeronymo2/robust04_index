			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: Amax/Cyprus mining link hits snag THE PROPOSED merger between US mining groups Amax and Cyprus Minerals has run into problems with the authorities. The US justice department is using anti-trust regulations to request more information about their molybdenum businesses. Both groups said they were willing to work with the deparment to resolve any anti-trust difficulties, but Amax said that 'there can be no assurance that the companies will be able to satisfy any objections the department of justice may have to the merger'. Molybdenum, is a versatile and cost-effective alloying agent in special steels, cast irons, nickel, cobalt and titanium-based alloys. In the chemicals sector, molybdenum is used in catalysts, lubricants and pigments. Cyprus owns the Thompson Creek molybdenum mine in Idaho, which produced 40m lb last year, and the mothballed Tonopah mine in Nevada. Amax has two mines in Colorado: the Henderson, which produced 33m lb in 1992, and the Climax, also mothballed. Amax and Cyprus announced in May that they wanted to merge their core operations into a group with assets worth Dollars 5bn and revenues of Dollars 2.8bn. This would be the second-largest copper producer and the second-largest coal producer in the US. However, Amax's aluminium operations would be spun off to shareholders as a separate company. Amax hoped to clear regulatory hurdles and obtain shareholder approvals by the end of this year.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: HunterPrint to cut costs in bid to eliminate losses HunterPrint, the specialist printing company, has embarked on a Pounds 3m cost-cutting programme in a bid to reduce losses and improve gearing. The Corby-based group announced the move yesterday after warning that difficult trading conditions were continuing to hamper its performance. In the year to September 1993, the company incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.2m, compared with a restated deficit of Pounds 12.2m. Although the losses represented a substantial upturn on the 1992 results, the improvement was undermined by an exceptional Pounds 1.2m charge to cover the cost of disposing of surplus property assets. Turnover, meanwhile, fell by 3 per cent to Pounds 50.8m (Pounds 52.2m). Losses per share came out at 6.7p (68p). The group's difficulties were highlighted by its admission that year-end borrowing of Pounds 17.9m was higher than expected in spite of cost-cutting and the completion of two refinancing packages in recent years. Gearing exceeded forecast levels because the group had invested Pounds 6.2m in plant and facilities, including three second hand presses. Mr Tony Caplin, chief executive, said the presses were needed to ensure capacity for Pounds 10m of new orders to print supplements for Associated Newspapers, the Guardian Media Group and Mirror Group Newspapers. Income from the new orders, however, was not generated in time to influence the 1993 figures. Printing demand from other customers remained 'low and erratic' as advertising expenditure continued to decline, Mr Caplin added. 'There is no guarantee of a market recovery in 1994; even with the level and nature of contract orders, the company remains vulnerable in the current competitive pricing of spot market work.' His caution has increased uncertainty over the business, which has failed to revive its fortunes despite raising Pounds 18.3m through a placing and offer as part of its last refinancing package in December 1992. Since then the share price has fallen sharply from a high of 50p. It closed down 2p yesterday at 25p after the company said it had no distributable reserves to pay a dividend on either its convertible preference or ordinary shares.</p>

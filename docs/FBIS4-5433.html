			<p>BFN     [Text] The missing third secretary of the Russian Embassy,  Igor Makeyev, is reportedly no longer in Thailand but police do  not know where he is taking refuge, Deputy Police Director  General Pol. Gen. [Police General] Phong-ammat Amattayakun said  yesterday.    He said that police had unearthed no trace of Mr Makeyev's  whereabouts.    He also insisted that Immigration Department officials could  not find any record of the Russian diplomat having left the  country.    Pol. Gen. Phong-ammat said Mr Makeyev's name did not appear  on the list of foreigners who had passed though Thailand's  Immigration checkpoints.    A report from Russia's Tass news agency said Mr Makeyev had  emerged in the United States but other details were not  available.    Meanwhile immigration officials at Don Muang airport said  they would stop issuing visas to the citizens of certain nations  who apply for entry visas at Don Muang, but refused to name the  countries.    A high-ranking official said the measures were designed to  prevent some ill-intentioned foreigners from carrying out acts  of sabotage in Thailand.    Pol. Gen. Phong-ammat said Thailand last year had relaxed  the  process of issuing visas at Don Muang airport to promote tourism  but this would have to change in line with the world situation.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Cookery: A quick bite along party lines HIGH-SPEED, home-cooked alternatives to the ready-prepared meals of the high street multiples - microwaved, trayed and cardboard-boxed - seem to have struck a chord with readers, particularly those who are, in the words of one, 'always in search of something as easy as pasta but more unusual and more glamorous. In other words, dishes that are genuinely practicable for mid-week dinners a deux and could even be used for a dinner party.' So, here is my suggestion for an informal and relatively effortless mid-week dinner party. RED MULLET WITH PESTO (serves 4) A first and main course rolled into one, this is served best in deep soup plates, with forks for spearing the fish and vegetables and spoons for supping up the broth. Salad, plus a handsome selection of cheeses and good chocolate or sweetmeats with coffee, are all you will need afterwards. Ingredients: Red mullet, cleaned, scaled and filleted (enough to yield 1-1 1/2 lb of fillets); 3-4 oz green beans; 2 oz small young spinach leaves; 2 leeks; 2-2 1/2 pt unsalted fish stock; a good pinch of saffron strands pounded with mortar and pestle; a long curl of finely-pared orange peel; a generous splash of Noilly Prat; 1 ciabatta loaf; 2 or 3 sprigs of basil; home-made pesto (or Le Roi with a grating of Parmesan added). Method: Remove any scales and bones the fishmonger may have missed and cut the fillets across obliquely into generous bite-size pieces. Dust the skin - but not the flesh of the fish - lightly with salt. Top and tail the beans and cut the leeks into chunks. Slice the bread, toast it lightly, spread with pesto, pile it on to a plate and keep hot. Fast-boil the Noilly Prat until reduced by half. Add the fish stock, orange peel and saffron and bring to the boil. Drop the leeks and beans into the pan and cook them until just tender. Then add the spinach and the finely-torn basil leaves: they will need little more than a minute to wilt and heat through. While the broth and vegetables are cooking, heat a well-seasoned frying pan and dry-fry the fish (in two batches). First, cook it skin side down. After about two minutes, when the skin is crisp and the flesh has begun to change colour, turn it over and and fry it flesh side down for just a few seconds. Remove and keep hot in a tureen while you cook the rest of the fish in the same way. Discard the orange peel and ladle the vegetables and broth over the red mullet. Check seasoning and bring to table with the toast (the idea is to eat the stew and nibble the toast on the side). Then drop the remaining toast into the tureen so it soaks up the flavoursome liquid and softens enough to cut with a spoon and sup with the broth. PROCESSOR PESTO I always used to make pesto by hand - aromatherapy par excellence if you have the time for it - but I have decided that metal blades do not taint basil as mortar and pestle addicts once led me to believe. The new generation of Magimix machines contain a miniature inner bowl which is ideal for making pesto. A labour of love has been reduced to an unlovely but efficient one-minute task. Ingredients: A handful of fresh basil (ie, 2 little supermarket bunches); 1-2 garlic cloves; 1 well-rounded tablespoon pine nuts or flaked almonds; scant 2 tablespoons freshly-grated Parmesan cheese; 2-3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil. Method: Strip the basil leaves from the stalks and put them into the mini-bowl of a food processor. Chop the garlic and crush it with a good pinch of salt. Add it to the bowl and whizz briefly. Add the nuts and cheese and process again until the ingredients are all chopped finely and well mixed. Finally, add enough oil to make a creamy puree-like paste, adding it slowly through the funnel while the machine is running. Check seasoning and serve.</p>

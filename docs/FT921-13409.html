			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / European air traffic control could buckle EUROPE'S fragmented air traffic control system could start buckling by this spring, leading to long delays and cancellations, according to Mr Giovanni Bisignani, managing director of Alitalia. Mr Bisignani, who has just taken over as chairman of the Association of European Airlines (AEA), which groups 23 flag carriers, said the failure to establish a unified air traffic control system had not been exposed last year because of the exceptional downturn in traffic, caused by recession and the Gulf war. Even so, AEA members clocked up 50,000 hours in flight delays in 1991. 'We can not go on with 22 different operational systems and 33 different software systems,' he said. 'We need action and quick: it is not a lack of physical space; the system is inadequate.' He called on the European Commission to press for a unified control system as the precondition for a single market in civil aviation. Brussels' hands have been tied because air traffic control falls under national jurisdiction largely for reasons of national security. Mr Bisignani underlined that fragmentation imposed unacceptable costs on airlines at a time of crisis in the industry. of Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.22bn) a year in Europe, whereas the unified US control system dealt with three times the volume of traffic and cost airlines Dollars 2.5bn. Mr Bisignani's remarks on air traffic control came as part of a presentation on the AEA's reservations about Brussels' 'open skies' policy. 'We need and want a single market ..but some things must be changed,' he said after the presentation to the European Parliament and in meetings with the Commission. The AEA accepts the thrust of Commission deregulation, but wants to blunt its sharper edges. Under the 'third aviation package' adopted by Brussels last July, and now working its way through the Council of Ministers of the 12, access to EC routes will be opened up; established carriers' hold on landing and take-off 'slots' at hub airports will be loosened; national licensing rules will be replaced by common rules detailing capital adequacy and technical fitness; and fare-setting will be liberalised. Mr Bisignani said yesterday the AEA rejected growing Brussels supervision of access to routes and level of fares. On cabotage - allowing airlines from one member state to offer domestic services in another - he proposed a transitional period of three years beyond the 1993 target date.</p>

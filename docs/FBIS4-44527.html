MOF and SAT provided in a "Circular on Adjusting  Farm-Product  Value-Added Tax Rates and Exempting Certain Items from  Value-Added Taxes" that the following goods will be exempted  from value-added taxes before the end of 1995: 1) Grain and  edible vegetable oil sold by state-grain commercial enterprises  to the military and by state-grain retail enterprises to urban  residents; 2) feed 3) agricultural plastic film; 4) ammonium  bicarbonate, common calcium superphosphate, and calcium  magnesium phosphate produced and sold by chemical-fertilizer  production-enterprises, and urea, phosphamidon, and phosphamidon  sulphate produced and sold by small chemical-fetilizer  enterprises that have changed from their former production of  ammonium bicarbonate, common calcium superphosphate, and calcium  magnesium phosphate; 5) Dipterex, DDVP, Rogor, parathion,  xinliulin, acephatemet, acetyl acephatemet, hybrid-rice blast,  shachongshuang, fenitrothion, marathion, aluminum phosphide,  weed-eradication ether, grade-D weed-amine, and Rogor oxide  produced and sold by pesticide-production enterprises; 6)  wholesale and retail seeds, seedlings, chemical fertilizer,  pesticides, and farm machinery.    It is understood that this adjustment was studied and  planned  based on the State Council's "Summary of Meeting To Study  Pertinent Issues Since Tax-Revenue Reform Plans Went Into  Effect." Finance and tax bureaus in all areas will begin to  enforce these new provisions on 1 May 1994.</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: German bank postpones rights launch Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank, Germany's fifth largest bank, has postponed a DM1bn rights issue indefinitely because of weak stock market conditions, writes David Waller in Frankfurt. The 1-for-10 issue was announced in early May, shortly after the Bavaria-based bank reported a 33 per cent rise in earnings for last year. Since then, bank shares have underperformed the DAX index of leading German shares. Meanwhile, Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial company, insisted it would not pull its DM3bn international offering. This is in spite of a narrowing of the gap between the price of the new shares and the market price, from 20 per cent when first announced to 13 per cent yesterday.</p>

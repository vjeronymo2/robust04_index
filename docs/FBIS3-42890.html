Besides Baburin's  ROS [Russian National Union] and Zyuganov's Communist Party,  even Nikolay Lysenko's National-Republican Party is getting  ready for 12 December. Although if I were personally asked just  a month ago to name the principal fascists of Russia, without  stopping to think, I would have named: Lysenko. And only then:  Barkashov.    But the leader of one of the most radical groups of Russian  nationalists is able to sniff the wind in order not to break his  neck in the example of his less pragmatic double--the leader  Barkashov of the defeated Russian National Unity.    Both of them came from Vasilyev's Pamyat. Both of them  aspire  to the role of savior of the Russian nation. The first thing  each of them did was to muster troops for themselves--according  to their own calculations, 500 militants each. Thus, why does  the leader of the NRPR [National-Republican Party of Russia]  call the leader of the RNYe [Russian National Unity] his exact  opposite?    "Indeed, Lysenko is a Russian nationalist, a person with  ultranationalistic views. But this ultra does not shout `Sieg  Heil,' rather the opposite, and he categorically rejects those  who shout `Sieg Heil'--this is the way Nikolay Lysenko sees  himself. [no close quotes as published]    Barkashov, in Lysenko's words, "obviously lived in some kind  of unreal world, a world of illusions." After all, it is  impossible in the final analysis to wear a swastika on one's  sleeve and throw up one's hand in a Nazi greeting while living  in a country that still remembers the 30 million who died in the  war with German Nazism and simultaneously count on popular  success among the public.    The sensitive leader of the NRPR is another matter.    A year earlier Lysenko had already made a clever move. The  president had scarcely attempted timidly to stop the formation  of militarized structures under political organizations with an  edict when Lysenko formally detached from the party the Russian  National Legion that had gained fame in the Ossetia battles and  in Pridnestrovye. (However, the president's salvo then, in  contrast to October of this year, proved to be a dud.)    The evacuation this summer of the NRPR from the FNS  [National  Salvation Front] "with the absolutely wild positions of the  communist organizations," as it later became clear, also became  a prudent step for Lysenko. (In revenge, the red Sovraska  [SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA] insulted the nationalist, accusing him in  his appeals of "Russian-Jewish unity.")    The NRPR leader also "realistically assessed the situation"  in the first days of October of this year. He not only did not  rush to defend the White House, as was done by the romantic  Barkashov, but even refrained from any kind of commentary on  those events. Yeltsin, of course, "crudely violated" the  Constitution, Lysenko would say later, but it was a  "sovok"-type, and deserved it: "I foresaw that Rutskoy and  Khasbulatov would lose."    It is simply that the leader of the national-republicans  needed the elections in order finally to get out to the people,  albeit over the corpses of former allies who had perished.    Who could expect that the competing Communists would be  given  free rein. "If I were in Yeltsin's shoes, I would not allow the  participation of the Communist organizations in the upcoming  elections," Lysenko admitted to a MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS  correspondent.    The national-republicans were also compelled to be a little  concerned about Mikhail Astafyev's Constitutional Democratic  Party, whose voting list was rather inopportunely headed by the  well-known fighter against Russophobia, Igor Shafarevich, and  "iron Shurik" Nevzorov. It is they who will accurately gather up  the entire patriotically concerned electorate.    But the most devastating blow to the Lysenko followers was  delivered by Yuriy Luzhkov, our respected mayor, who declared  war in the capital on the uninvited guests from the south. But,  after all, the promise to "severely punish" the "southern  occupiers" is the keystone of the NRPR election program, whose  implementation (with general approval, which is sad) Luzhkov has  already practically started.    "I understand very well that this is a demagogic move just  before the elections," says Lysenko, "but I do not doubt that  Luzhkov is the pioneer in this matter."    So, who will continue these beginnings? The elections will  determine this. The Lysenko group has little possibility of  surmounting even the 5 percent barrier. And probably all that  will remain will be to take off the tattered sheepskin and say  in one's natural tongue: "Sieg Heil!"</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Letter: Ethics and service Sir, I am one of that minority of FT-reading customers of the Co-operative Bank who responded to the bank's questionnaire on ethical behaviour. While I applaud the desire to build a more positive corporate image, I have to say that such activity should serve as a top up to its commitment to its customers, not as a replacement for it. Like many customers, I responded to heavy advertising and applied for a Co-op Visa Gold Card. I met all of the financial criteria and (having checked with the search company which the bank used) had nothing on file to classify me as a bad risk. The bank refused my application and wrote saying that it was under no obligation to tell me why the application was refused. In subsequent correspondence, the bank did not deny that the reason was that I was already a customer with a Visa card and that the offer was designed to attract new customers. It appears from correspondence elsewhere that thousands of customers found themselves in the same position. Is this ethical behaviour of which the bank would be proud? I have subsequently changed banks as a result of this experience. When will service companies learn that their actions can lose them customers for life and that no amount of window dressing or ethical charters can make up for a genuine commitment to their customers?

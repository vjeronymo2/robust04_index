			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jiri Horacek: "Defense Minister Baudys Evaluates </F> Results of Army Transformation"]    [Text] At a news conference yesterday, Defense Minister  Antonin Baudys summarized the results of the transformation of  the Army of the Czech Republic. He pointed out that the main  task of his ministry was to carry out the transformation of the  army without threatening its combat and mobilization readiness  and operability.    "Significant reorganization took place. Changes occurred in  certain high-ranking Defense Ministry posts," Baudys said.  According to him, the officer corps has undergone an  extraordinary screening. During the past year, 4,303 officers  left the Army -- 45 percent of them were colonels and lieutenant  colonels, and 20 were generals. He said, however, that  personnel problems continue because the departure of young  officers and NCO's could not be stopped. He reported that new  operational levels of command have been established. These  changes concern Hradec Kralove tactical air force command, the  4th air defense company, and Stara Boleslav logistics command  (Logistics is the science of rear-echelon combat service support  using modern methods). The Air Force and Air Defense Command  has been abolished, and so was the command of the 2d and 3d air  defense divisions. "A new mechanized brigade emerged in Susice  as a new standard element of ground forces, and the organization  of three more brigades is in the works. One of them will be a  rapid deployment brigade, approximately 3,500 men strong,"  Baudys stated. In a discussion with reporters, he asserted that  he maintains the statement he made last year, when he described  as traitors to the country all the professional soldiers who  approved of the 1968 USSR aggression against Czechoslovakia.  "It is not possible in practice to bring about the departure  from the army of all these people. There are so many of them  that we would have to dissolve the Army, and organize a  completely new one," Baudys added.</p>

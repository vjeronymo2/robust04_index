			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 22 (YONHAP) -- The leading opposition  Democratic Party (DP) urged Wednesday that the proposed  South-North Korean summit be held before a third round of North  Korea-U.S. high-level talks, which it expected to come next  month.    DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek, commenting on foreign media reports  that North Korean President Kim Il-song has suggested Aug. 15 as  a possible date for the historic talks, said, "the earlier the  South- North Korean summit came, the better it would be.    "Even if it's just for demonstrating national independence,  the summit should be held prior to the third-round talks between  Pyongyang and Washington."    The party's spokesman, Rep. Pak Chi-won, said in a  statement:  "We believe it was natural for the summit leaders of the two  sides to meet prior to the third-round talks to resolve the  nuclear issue from the perspective of national independence, so  that we see President Kim (Il-song)'s idea, revealed in an  indirect way, of holding it on Aug. 15 as inappropriate."    Noting that his party is aware of North Korea's political  schedule to hold a "pan-national rally" on Aug. 15, Pak said,  "it is our position that the inter-Korean summit should not be  abused politically under any circumstances."</p>

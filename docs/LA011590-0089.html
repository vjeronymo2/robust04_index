			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BLACK GENERAL LAUDS EQUALITY IN ARMED FORCES  </P> <P> Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Sunday that  the armed forces offer black Americans equal opportunity with whites "more so  than any other form of endeavor in our society."  </P> <P> Powell, the first black to hold the nation's highest uniformed rank, also said  he does not believe that the all-volunteer U.S. forces have become  disproportionately black.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's out of proportion," he said, adding that "anybody who is  willing to serve, qualified to serve, proud to serve should be allowed to  serve."  </P> <P> Blacks currently make up about 21% of the armed forces; about 12% of the U.S.  population is black.  </P> <P> During an interview on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley," Powell was  asked whether he considers the military system a "meritocracy" and whether it  is an equal-opportunity employer.  </P> <P> Powell replied: "More so than any other form of endeavor in our society. I'm  very proud of what we have done in the military over the years and I think, for  the most part, it is a meritocracy. You are not limited by anything but your  own ability."  </P></p>

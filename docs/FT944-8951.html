			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Channel shares fall as profits climb Shares in Channel Holdings, the security components group, yesterday fell 6p to 46p despite a 12 per cent rise in interim profits. Mr Philip Ling, chairman, said the short-term outlook for the CQR subsidiary was 'constrained by the uncertain level of overall demand in the UK intruder alarm industry.' Mr Patrick Rogers, chief executive, said he thought that the market had hoped for a larger profits rise and also that it had focused too much on the slowdown in the UK intruder alarm market. CQR's profits in the first half were unchanged from a year ago and a similar performance was expected in the second half, Mr Rogers said. Group pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 808,000 to Pounds 902,000 in the six months to September 30. Shawley Antony, acquired in July, contributed operating profits of Pounds 35,000. Turnover amounted to Pounds 8.67m (Pounds 7.66m). The interim dividend is increased to 0.55p (0.5p), payable from earnings per share of 1.8p (1.7p).</p>

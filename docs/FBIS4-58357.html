			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of  the Armed Forces, paid an inspection visit to the al-Thawrah  camp in 'Imran today. He inspected the forces of the 1st  Armored Brigade, the 5th Brigade, and the Central Security  Forces in 'Imran.    During the visit, he was acquainted with the results of the  acts of sabotage and the damage inflicted on the buildings and  equipment in the camp, which resulted from the regrettable  incidents that took place in the camp on Wednesday and Thursday.  These incidents were caused by the secessionist elements in the  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], as a prelude to implementing their  scheme to foment fighting between the comrades-in-arms to  fragment the homeland and to return to the situation as it was  before 22 May 1990 with the objective of guaranteeing their  destructive selfish interests.    During the visit, the brother president also acquainted  himself with the conditions of the camp's personnel, and  congratulated them for their safety. He extended his  condolences to the martyrs' families, to the masses of our  people, and Armed Forces on the martyrs of unity and democracy  from the personnel of the 1st and 3d Armored Brigades who fell  in these regrettable incidents. He also expressed his deep  regret and sorrow over the regrettable incidents at the 'Imran  camp.</p>

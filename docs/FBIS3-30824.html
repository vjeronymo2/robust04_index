			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Lucie </F> Weissova at the conclusion of his visit to Israel; place and  date not given--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Weissova] Mr. Prime Minister, the official  talks with Israeli senior figures are now behind you, so I would  like to ask you what the aims of your trip to Israel were and  whether your talks fulfilled your expectations.    [Klaus] This is the first visit by a prime minister of our  country to Israel. I think our relations with Israel have  always been good. The episode when we had a communist regime  should be quickly erased. This was the main aim of our  visit--to learn about the situation in this complicated region.  It is really not enough to read books and articles about it;  you need to see it yourself. [passage omitted] The other aim  was to tell people here about our country. [passage omitted]    The last thing is something more specific. For a long time,  we found ourselves deadlocked as regards an agreement on the  protection of investments; we signed agreements with a number of  countries without any problems. However, there was a great  problem here because of our different views on the repatriation  of investment profits. Our negotiators had been unable to reach  a consensus, and the matter really called for a decision to be  made by two prime ministers--and we took it. We signed a joint  communique, and the agreement can be signed soon.    And something even more important: We are interested in  opposing protectionism anywhere in the world and are therefore  offering free trade zones. [passage omitted]    I think we have managed to reach the joint conclusion with  the Israeli side that Israel, too, is interested in creating  such a zone between our country and Israel soon. This is also  included in the joint communique that Prime Minister Rabin and I  signed. [passage omitted]</p>

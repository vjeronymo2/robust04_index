			<p>BFN     [Text] It is expedient to hold the first joint exercises of  the Russian and American peacekeeping forces scheduled for this  summer in the Orenburg region on the territory of the United  States. This conclusion was reached in the course of a working  meeting between the Russian parliamentarians and members of the  American Senate held on Tuesday in Moscow. This information was  made public at a press conference attended by the Chairman of  the State Duma Committee on Defense Sergey Yushenkov, head of  the analogous committee of the US Senate Sam Nunn, leader of the  State Duma committee on international affairs Vladimir Lukin,  and Senator Robert Couts.    Responding to INTERFAX, Yushenkov indicated that "a campaign  of protest against the presence of the American forces in the  center of Russia is being waged in Orenburg and around it, it is  difficult to conduct exercises in such a situation." However,  the new variant providing for the exercises in the U.S. "will be  subject to obstruction -- now due to the spending of state funds  for the transfer of our forces across the ocean," Yushenkov  believes.    At the same time Yushenkov and Nunn believe that it is  necessary to conduct such joint maneuvers "as a symbol of  confidence and partnership between our countries." In  particular, Nunn declared that "the American people will welcome  Russian servicemen on their soil."</p>

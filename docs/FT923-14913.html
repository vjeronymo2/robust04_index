			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Arts: Old Masters are back in fashion - Saleroom / Next week's important London auctions ON WEDNESDAY Sotheby's auction Rembrandt's portrait of the preacher and theologian Johannes Uyttenbogaert. The canvas, signed and dated 1633, is one of perhaps 50 paintings by the master in private - but not royal - hands. It comes with an impeccable pedigree and, more crucial, the blessing of the famously debunking Rembrandt Research Project. Unlike the Rembrandt which failed at Christie's in April, it also comes with a reasonable estimate: Pounds 3m plus. The emphasis is on the plus. Its fate will be seen by many as a litmus-test of the state of the so far remarkably resilient Old Master market. It is a sombre, serious picture. Uyttenbogaert is portrayed after his return from exile and towards the close of what had been a dramatic and turbulent life. The young Rembrandt focuses on the careworn face and captures all the sitter's human vulnerability. He might almost be sheltering behind his crisply painted ruff. There has been a steady stream of requests for condition reports on the picture, all from private collectors. Sotheby's is no doubt cheered by the fact that the 'Daniel and Cyrus before the Idol of Bel' at Christie's had been bought in for Pounds 6m, a more than respectable amount for the jewel-like but small canvas. In a reversal of the current trend, it is Sotheby's that offers the most interesting paintings sale of the London Old Master season. Of particular note, too, is Guido Reni's brooding 'David with the head of Goliath', believed to be the documented second version of the picture painted in 1631. The subject-matter, with its homo-erotic overtones, is quintessentially Caravaggesque but the manner in which it is interpreted is Reni's own. Despite museum interest in the picture, its fate is perhaps harder to judge. The pre-sale estimate has been dropped to Pounds 1.6m-Pounds 2.5m, the lower end of the estimate less than the record price the painting fetched after it was first discovered and sold by Sotheby's in 1985. The National Gallery in London had hoped to acquire it then, and it has been on loan there - and much admired - more or less ever since. Whispers abroad to the effect that the picture is actually by The Divine Guido's pupil Simone Cantarini would be more convincing if they were based on a knowledge of the latter's work rather than a desire to use him as an art historical dustbin. In any event, the quality of the picture speaks for itself - and against an attribution to Cantarini. A hitherto unpublished Lucas Cranach the Elder of a female personification of justice, is another highlight. It is a highly unusual subject and one not without irony. Cranach's all but naked Justice is a sensual, languid creature. How striking to have a representation of a virtue that inspires vice. She comes with an estimate of Pounds 350,000-Pounds 450,000. Again the estimate compares favourably with the Pounds 506,000 paid for a less alluring Cranach portrait at Christie's in April. Procaccini's dangerously smiling Judith with the head of Holofernes, is another high quality, unpublished piece. It is ludicrously under-valued at Pounds 25,000-30,000. Both it and the Francesco Cairo 'Agony in the Garden' (estimate Pounds 100,000-Pounds 150,000) are reminders of the eccentric brilliance of the Lombard Baroque at its best. The strength of Christie's Friday sale is in earlier - and later - works. A pair of predella panels by Giovanni di Paolo combine narrative innocence with pictorial austerity. The more entertaining of the two features an unidentified levitating saint. This is the sale's star lot, estimated at Pounds 1.2m-Pounds 1.8m. In gentler vein is Garofalo's tender Holy Family set in a dreamily romantic landscape (Pounds 100,000-150,000). The gold ground panel of the Annunciation by Arcangelo di Cola da Camerino has the late-Gothic elegance that one would expect from a contemporary of Gentile da Fabriano. Will collectors be put off by the fact that it was sold, for Dollars 1.1m, in New York only two years ago? It now comes with a temptingly low reserve, and a lower estimate of Pounds 300,000. Two of a set of four Venetian Canalettos are excellent witness for the case against museum deaccessioning. The Alte Pinakothek in Munich sold these two Grand Canal vedute in 1939 as they were then thought to be by Bellotto. No one now doubts the original attribution, and they are set to do well. There is every chance that they will exceed their estimate of Pounds 600,000-Pounds 800,000.</p>

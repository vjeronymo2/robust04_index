			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN IS ARRESTED IN KIDNAPING AND RAPE OF TEEN-AGE JOB-SEEKER  </P> <P> An East Los Angeles man was in jail Sunday for investigation of kidnaping a  16-year old girl on the pretense of finding her a job.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police said Frank Palomino, 37, was arrested Saturday after his  alleged victim spotted him in another car as detectives were returning her to  the city from Tijuana.  </P> <P> Hollenbeck Division Detective John Santy said Palomino, on Thursday, told the  girl and her aunt that he would take them to places where they could find jobs.  He dropped the aunt off at one location and then sped off with the girl to  Tijuana.  </P> <P> Investigators allege the suspect raped her in a motel room and held her there  against her will. Despite the presence of another man who was guarding the  motel room, the girl -- who had come to the United States from her native  Mexico two months ago -- was able to escape and summon help, Santy said.  </P> <P> After being alerted by Tijuana authorities, two Los Angeles detectives went to  Tijuana to return her to Los Angeles for questioning, Santy said. As they were  driving back on Interstate 5, the girl spotted Palomino driving alongside them.  The detectives pulled the car over and took Palmonio into custody.  </P> <P> He was being held in lieu of $7,500 bail at Parker Center Jail.  </P></p>

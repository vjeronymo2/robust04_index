			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Ottawa tries to help hard-pressed retailers THE CANADIAN government is extending a helping hand to hard-pressed retailers by eliminating import duties on two dozen key consumer items and imposing measures to discourage Canadians from shopping in the US. Canadian retailers have singled out cross-border shopping as an important factor in their difficulties, manifested in the recent collapse of several well-known clothing chains. Thousands of Canadians clog border crossings each weekend to take advantage of lower prices and wider variety in US shopping malls. Canadian households are also bombarded with catalogues from low-cost US mail-order companies, many of which accept telephone orders 24 hours a day. In an attempt to improve the price competitiveness of Canadian stores, the revenue minister, Mr Otto Jelinek, said that duties of up to 12.6 per cent will be removed immediately from a number of consumer durables, including microwave ovens and video recorders. Duties on these items, none of which is produced locally, total about CDollars 60m (Pounds 28.7m) a year. As a disincentive to mail-order, the government is halving, to CDollars 20, the duty-free ceiling on packages from the US. Canada Post will also in future collect a CDollars 5 'handling fee' on every dutiable parcel. The measures come amid indications that the cross-border phenomenon may have passed its peak with the weakening of the Canadian dollar.</p>

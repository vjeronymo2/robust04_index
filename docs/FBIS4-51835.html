			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 3 KYODO -- Japan's 11 major commercial  banks have agreed to cooperate to avert credit crises caused by  their own liquidity shortages, the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN said  Tuesday [3 May].    At the behest of the Bank of Japan (BOJ), the 11 banks have  created a scheme under which, when one of them lapses into a  liquidity crisis through failure to secure necessary amounts of  cash in the money market, the others are required to make  low-interest, emergency loans to the beleagured bank. The plan  calls for up to 300 billion yen in loans per bank, which means  the maximum available funds for the troubled bank could run as  much as 3 trillion yen.    In practice, the loans would be made in the form of the  rescuers' purchase of certificates of deposit (CDs) issued by  the institution in crisis.    The bigger of the 11 "city banks" each procure 2-3 trillion  yen of funds daily in interbank trading on the Tokyo money  market.    Currently, the BOJ is required to come to rescue of  institutions which are unable to secure the necessary sums. But  concerned that fund shortages could exceed its capacity, the BOJ  has strongly called on the 11 institutions to establish their  own support system to handle cases of credit crisis.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Summary] "A reliable source in the Ministry of Public  Works and Transport cites the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia as  saying that the Chinese Government has decided to withdraw part  of its $8.6 million loan and use it to repair the Mao Zedong  road in Cambodia. The rest will be used to buy vehicles.    "Ms. (Xi Yuyi), PRC ambassador to Cambodia, met and  discussed  this matter with Ing Kiet, state secretary of the Ministry of  Public Works and Transport, on 21 June."    This decision has disappointed the ministry which has  written  a letter to the Royal Government requesting that the total loan  be maintained for the ministry as mentioned in the agreement  signed between the two countries on 17 January 1994.    "According to the agreement, the loan will be used for the  four most important domains urgently needed by the ministry,  that is, 862,200 dollars for buying two airplanes, $2.8 million  for buying 190 large and small vehicles for transportation work,  and $4,437,800 for repairing railroads."    It is unknown why the Chinese side wants to divert its loan  of $8.6 million to the Royal Government for repairing Mao Zedong  road which has not been mentioned in the agreement.    Some people have said that if China wants to repair this  road, it should have asked for funds from the Chinese people and  Government instead of using this loan which will only affect the  important projects set in the agreement.    "The source added that the $4.4 million budget set for the  repair of railway system is very important because Cambodia's  railroads are now very old and damaged." According to the  project, this budget is set to repair the Phnom  Penh-Sihanoukville line and purchase steel and other materials  to improve the railway system.    If the Chinese side withdraws part of this fund, the repair  of railway system will be forced to depend on other loans. In  this case, in addition to being disappointing, the agreement  which was signed by government representatives of the two  countries will be meaningless.</p>

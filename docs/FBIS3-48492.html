"Any visit to the South by North Korean Chondogyo officials  and a South-North Chondogyo contact to discuss the visit are not  permissible," a National Unification Board official said on  Tuesday. He said such a move runs counter to the government  policy of withholding all travels back and forth between the two  sides due to the nuclear issue.    The central headquarters of Chondogyo, an indigenous  religious organization, formally asked the unification board  earlier in the day to send to the North its reply that they had  accepted the North Korean Chondogyo proposal to have a  working-level contact at Panmunjom on Feb. 3.    In a telephone message to the South's Chondogyo on Jan. 24,  Yu Mi-yong, guidance chairman of the North Korean Chondogyo,  offered to have a working-level contact at Panmunjom.</p>

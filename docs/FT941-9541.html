			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Revival of exit visas in France France has decreed that nationals of 13 countries will need exit visas to leave the country, reviving a measure adopted in the mid-1980s to combat terrorism, AP reports from Paris. The countries include Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, North Korea, Lebanon, Libya, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Sudan and Yemen. Palestinians will also need visas. The decree signed by Mr Charles Pasqua, interior minister, was published at the weekend in the Official Journal, meaning that it took effect as law. Interior ministry officials refused to comment on why the order was adopted. It mirrored a measure covering most other countries adopted in 1986 as a weapon in the battle against terrorism. Store owners in ports along France's Brittany coast closed their doors on Saturday afternoon in sympathy with striking fishermen who are pressing the government for more aid to offset low prices, Reuter reports from Rennes. Authorities said several thousand people marched in silence in the port of Le Guilvinec, where the strike began.</p>

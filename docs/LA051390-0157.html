			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> HOW TO TURN CRIB INTO BED TO FIT GROWING CHILD  </P> <P> Children will grow out of their furniture just as surely as they outgrow their  clothes.  </P> <P> Our Crib 'n Bed is the practical idea for any family who doesn't want to  purchase more furniture when it's time to move from the crib to a bed.  </P> <P> Build the crib for use while the child is an infant. When the child is ready  for a bed, remove the railings on both sides, unbolt the small block of drawers  from the end of the crib -- which become a nightstand -- and you will have a  youth bed with two drawers for storage.  </P> <P> Since a youth bed is smaller than a twin-size mattress, it is recommended you  use a thick piece of durable foam cut to the proper dimensions as a mattress.  </P> <P> Our companion piece is a dresser/changing table measuring about 41 inches tall  and 31 inches wide. The shelf on top folds down for use as a changing table and  will hold a cradle or a basinet-size pad.  </P> <P> When it's no longer useful as a changing table, the shelf will fold up to  display knickknacks.  </P> <P> Both plans include step-by-step instructions, photos, diagrams and materials  lists, and they conform to safety suggestions in consumer reports. To obtain  Crib 'n Bed, Plan No. 775, send $4.95. Changing Table Dresser, Plan No. 776, is  $4.50.  </P> <P> Please include postage and handling. California residents please add 6% sales  tax. Send check or money order to Steve Ellingson, c/o Los Angeles Times, P.O.  Box 2383, Van Nuys, Calif. 91409-2383.  </P></p>

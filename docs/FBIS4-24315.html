			<p>BFN     [Text] Ongoing talks among intellectuals and elders of  Mogadishu indicate that they do not wish to see a resumption of  fighting among the brotherly Somali people. This was stated by  Ali Mohamed Ugas Ali, member of the United Somali Congress [USC]  Central Committee.    Ugas Ali, who was speaking to reporters from Radio  Mogadishu,  the voice of the Somali people, said there are a few  self-seekers who are bent on creating trouble among the Somali  people but that they now understand the value of peace and are  tired of the agony of civil war. Ugas Ali added that the  intellectuals and elders are working to unite against all the  causes of insecurity.    Concluding, Ali Mohamed Ugas Ali stressed that Somalis in  general, and those in Mogadishu in particular, should be extra  alert to the traps being laid by those wishing to start  senseless fighting. He added that efforts should be made  towards healing the wounds of the past.</p>

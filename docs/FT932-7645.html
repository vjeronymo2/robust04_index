			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Way opened for BR bill changes THE GOVERNMENT yesterday rejected calls from a Commons select committee for changes to its rail privatisation plans. It appeared to leave open the possibility of last-minute amendments to the Railways Bill, to be debated in the Commons next week. The cross-party transport committee last month published the results of a four-month investigation into the government's plans and called for a series of changes, warning that privatisation could otherwise go badly wrong. Several of its criticisms focused on the idea of open access to the tracks for competing passenger-train operators and the separation of ownership of the tracks and trains. The committee also warned that budgetary constraints could lead to line closures. The government response rejects fundamental changes to the structure of privatisation. It says: 'As the report itself recognises, the grain of current trends in Europe and elsewhere is away from unitary railway undertakings and towards greater freedom of access.' The government also says, however, that it has been considering the issues addressed by the report and will continue to do so as the Railways Bill passes through parliament. This statement may give encouragement to rebel Conservative backbenchers seeking changes to the Railways Bill at report stage in the Commons on Monday and Tuesday. The rebels want clauses added to the bill which would preserve discounted railcard schemes and give British Rail the right to bid for franchises. Train passengers have registered a large vote of no-confidence in the privatisation plans, a survey shows. Some 71 per cent of people interviewed at mainline stations said they were opposed to the plans, according to a Gallup survey in today's Daily Telegraph. Gallup interviewed 575 passengers.</p>

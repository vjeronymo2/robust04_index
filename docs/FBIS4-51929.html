			<p>BFN     [Text] A MAINICHI SHIMBUN opinion poll shows nearly 70  percent of the respondents want the issue of North Korea's  suspected nuclear arms program to be resolved by dialogue and  not by sanctions. As regards Japan's participation in the UN  Security Council as a permanent member, while 45 percent of the  respondents said they "support" it, 43 percent said they "don't  have an answer." This indicates that the public does not yet  have a full understanding of the issue.    MAINICHI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide survey by  interviewing 3,000 eligible voters on 22-24 April, with 76  percent responding.    Regarding North Korea's nuclear arms development program, 26  percent said they are "greatly concerned," and 43 percent said  they are "somewhat concerned." Thus a total of 69 percent of  the respondents were found to be concerned about the issue. On  the other hand, the proportion of respondents who said they were  "not much concerned" amounted to 20 percent, and those who said  they are "not concerned at all" totaled 10 percent.    When asked about ways to resolve this issue, 71 percent  said:  "Concerned nations should continue dialogue with North Korea to  persuade it to accept inspections by the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA)." This number substantially exceeded the  13 percent of respondents who said: "Economic sanctions must be  taken against North Korea." Only 4 percent said: "There is no  need to ask North Korea to accept inspections." Broken down by  the political parties supported by the respondents, 17 percent  of the Liberal Democratic Party supporters and 16 percent of  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] supporters replied "economic  sanctions must be taken," while high rates of 85 percent of  Japan New Party supporters and 82 percent of Sakigake  [Harbinger] supporters replied "it should be resolved through  dialogue."    Compared with when the last poll was conducted in September  1993, the proportion of respondents who "supported" Japan's  participation in the UN Security Council as a permanent member  decreased by 2 points to 45 percent. The number of those who  "opposed" it also decreased by 1 point to 10 percent.    However, the number of respondents who said they "don't have  an answer" regarding Japan's participation totalled 43 percent,  an increase of 5 points over the last poll. Among male  respondents, 55 percent said they "supported" it, 11 percent  said they "opposed" it, and 31 percent said they "don't have an  answer." Of female respondents, 36 percent said they  "supported" it, 9 percent "opposed" it, and 53 percent said they  "don't have an answer."</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / S African draft constitution condemned by ultra-right THE FIRST draft of a multiracial constitution for South Africa was unveiled yesterday, provoking condemnation from the ultra-right Conservative party. 'It is a recipe for civil war, further economic deterioration and a spiral of violence and crime, which will reduce the country to ruin,' said Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg, the party leader, adding that the CP would not return to negotiations. Fears of heightened ethnic violence were expressed by many yesterday, following Sunday's massacre of at least 10 people during a church service in a white suburb of Cape Town. Democracy negotiators charged with drawing up a constitution to ease tensions in a multiracial state, published an outline of an interim constitution under which the first elections would be held next April. This would remain in force until a final constitution is agreed by an elected assembly. But the document, the product of months of negotiation, begged the most important questions: how power should be shared within the planned multi-party cabinet; and how it should be distributed between central and regional governments. The mainly-Zulu Inkatha Freedom party refused to attend yesterday's talks, although the party executive met to consider the document. It is likely to reject the draft. Inkatha has said it will continue with bilateral negotiations but will not return to multi-party talks unless given an effective veto over proceedings. Analysts point out, however, that much recent progress has been achieved in bilateral meetings between the three most important parties  - the ruling National party, the African National Congress and Inkatha  - with agreements then ratified by multi-party talks. The draft constitution focuses on devolution of power to regional governments. It provides also for heavy regional representation in the national parliament, which will also draw up the final constitution. It also lists a variety of areas - including health, education, local taxation and local policing - in which regional governments would share power with central government while a new constitution is finalised. However, the issue of how power should be shared between the two levels of government is deferred for consideration by an independent commission after the first elections. A final decision on this issue would be left to the multi-party cabinet and the elected constituent assembly.</p>

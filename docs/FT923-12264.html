			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / ITV presses ahead with satellite channel plan A NUMBER of leading ITV companies are pressing ahead with plans for a new satellite television channel involving an investment of Pounds 25m to Pounds 30m. The channel would be broadcast on the Astra satellite system and consist, at least at the outset, of programmes from the ITV archives. The enthuasiasm for the channel is a clear sign that the companies believe satellite television is likely to continue growing and that they should be part of it. Companies backing the plan in principle are London Weekend Television and Central, as well as two of the companies that begin broadcasting in January  -Carlton Television, which ousted Thames in London, and Meridian, winner of the south of England franchise. Consultants Booz Allen have been commissioned to carry out further research. The final decision on the channel will be taken in September and the service could be launched early next year. Senior ITV executives believe there is a high probability that the channel will go ahead. The hope is that all 16 ITV companies will take a stake. The channel would initially be funded by advertising but might move to subscription later. At the same time, Thames Television and the BBC are trying to raise finance for UK Gold, a satellite channel based on their archives, to be launched this autumn. BBC Enterprises recently said it would like to take stakes in up to five satellite channels covering everything from news and children's programmes to documentaries and wildlife. ITV has become interested in satellite television again, partly as a defensive measure but also to defuse current troubles with the Office of Fair Trading. The OFT is believed to be unhappy about ITV plans to buy the rights to programmes for up to 15 years to deprive other potential users. There might be less objection if the programmes were shown on a satellite channel, rather than just kept on the shelf. A survey by LWT of regular viewers of televised football found only 3 per cent of those without cable or satellite equipment would definitely get it when BSkyB starts to broadcast live premier league games. Just over half of those with equipment said they were likely to subscribe to the service from BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Somali </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Ali Mahdi Mohamed, president of the Somali  Republic, sent a congratulatory New Year 1994 message today to  all the Somali people wherever they may be, beseeching God to  make this year the year in which the Somali people revive their  nationhood and find peace amidst the general public of the world  at large. [passage omitted]    The president sent a message of good wishes and  congratulations to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who  he said has selflessly stood up for the interests of the Somali  people, noting the UN Security Council's day and night effort to  ensure that the crisis in Somalia is resolved. The president  sent a similar message to the UN Operation in Somalia leadership  and staff and wished them success.    The president further called on the Somali community to make  use of the international assistance which is badly needed by  many countries in the world who also face crisis. [passage  omitted]    On the formation of district and regional assemblies and  more  so the national assembly, the president called on the Somali  people to speed up the formation of those assemblies which the  world and all peace-loving people see as the only solution of  reviving the nationhood of Somalia. The president further  highlighted the way the 12 factions are fully involved in the  faster formation of those assemblies in order to establish the  interim national assembly and further called on our brothers the  Somali National Alliance [SNA] and their supporters to be  positive and flexible towards the peace calls by their brothers  [the 12 factions], and if their [SNA] peace call is genuine, for  them to participate in the formation of the assemblies, which is  vital.    Today we are not in a position of confrontation and blaming  each other but we are at the crossroads of reviving the  nationhood of the Somali people, the president said. [passage  omitted]    Finally, President Ali Mahdi Mohamed called on the Somali  people wherever they may be to pray to God to bestow success and  prosperity on Somalia in this year 1994.</p>

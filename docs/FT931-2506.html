			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Union supports selection reform THE CAMPAIGN in the Labour party to introduce one member one vote (OMOV) for the selection of parliamentary candidates achieved a significant breakthrough when leaders of the Shopworkers' union Usdaw came out in favour of the reform. This would replace the present system, where unions exercise a direct vote in candidate selection through local electoral colleges alongside individual members. Usdaw's executive will recommend the change at the union's annual conference in April. If this is carried it will strengthen the chances of success for OMOV at Labour's conference in the autumn. The change of union policy on OMOV will please Labour leader John Smith, who also favours the reform and will increase the pressure on other unions over the next few months to support it. 'The outcome on OMOV may now be too close to call,' said one union official. It is estimated that more than 1.5m union votes are committed to OMOV. It will be opposed by the Transport and General Workers, the General, Municipal and Boilermakers and the Public Employees who make up more than 2m votes. The union block vote falls from 89 per cent to 70 per cent at this year's Labour conference, however, and the constituency parties - with increased representation - are expected to back OMOV. USDAW said it would continue to back the use of an electoral college for the election of the leader and deputy, but would back a cut in the union proportion of the college from 40 per cent to 33 per cent. It also favours reducing the union vote to party conference from 70 per cent to 50 per cent over the next few years as individual membership grows. Mr Bill Morris, the TGWU's general secretary, warned last night that if Labour 'cuts itself adrift from the unions, it cuts itself adrift from its most solid base of support.' He added the current debate over the relationship between the unions and Labour was 'overheated' and in danger of plunging the party into 'unnecessary, internal preoccupations.'</p>

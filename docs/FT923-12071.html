			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Waldegrave outlines Charter's role THE Citizen's Charter amounts to a reinvention of the role of government, Mr William Waldegrave, minister for public service, said yesterday. Mr Waldegrave, speaking to the Institute of Directors, re-asserted the government's commitment to privatising services still performed by the public sector. He also highlighted the need to devise mechanisms to bring a substitute for competition into public services where privatisation was not possible. 'We have had to restore the principle that the government's job is to govern, not to administer; to steer, not to row,' he said. Where services did still have to be provided by the state, management improvements in Whitehall should include delegating financial responsibility and establishing clear purchaser-provider relationships. Mr Waldegrave rejected the claim from some MPs that the establishment of Next Steps agencies, in which parts of the Civil Service were turned into executive bodies, diluted public accountability. Such moves improved existing accountability, he argued, by providing a counterweight to the centralisation of power in 'a pull downwards and outwards - to the local provider, the user and the local community'. However, the initiative was attacked last night by Lord Scarman, the former law lord. He said the charter would be ineffective without legal rights - including freedom of information and rights of redress in the courts. Although charters could be valuable in improving public services such as transport, health, water and gas, without the protection of a written constitution they would not be enough to ensure higher standards. Lord Scarman also called for a convention to draw up such a constitution, and announced that Charter 88, the pressure group for constitutional reform, would establish a 'citizen's inquiry'.

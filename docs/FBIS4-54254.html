He said economic growth rates in  1992-93 and 1993-94 are satisfactory because the state has  sought increased paddy rice production by giving priority to the  agricultural sector, guided the development of other economic  sectors, and designated the period since 1992-93 for stressing  economic development of the country. He said 1994-95 has been  designated as a year of growth in all-round production. That is  why personnel from the respective states and divisions have to  strive for the successful implementation of projects designated  in all sectors. [passage omitted on tasks of personnel]    He continued and said: While we are striving for political  stability and economic and social -- health and educational --  development, we are concentrating and working on economic  development. One must be aware of the interdependency among the  sectors. Food, clothing, and shelter are the most important  elements in social life. That is why economic development is  crucial to resolve food, clothing, and shelter problems. He  said in 1993-94 that more 8 million baskets of paddy rice have  been produced as targeted and he told personnel to continue  efforts annual increases in paddy rice production. [passage  omitted].

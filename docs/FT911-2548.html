			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Greece decides to swallow the EC medicine A BOATLOAD of Greek tourists on a trip to the island of Delos recently looked surprised to be charged for visiting the ruins of Apollo's sanctuary. But the murmurs of protest were few as they rummaged for thousand-drachma notes. One woman told her sons, with only a hint of irony: 'You see, now you're real Europeans.' Threa tened with a summons from the European Court of Justice for discriminating against other EC citizens, Greece has dropped its practice of making only foreignerspay at museums and ancient sites. The change was diplomatically timed to coincide with Easter, when the first wave of foreign tourists rolled in. The conservative government is trying hard to uproot the prevailing image of Greece asan unco-operative Community partner, dependent on EC hand-outs because it is unwilling or unable to put its economy in order. 'It's true Greece was remiss about everything from applying for funds to answering letters. We didn't participate fully. But that's changed. Now we want to make a real contribution,' says Mr George Papastamkos, undersecretary for EC affairs. However, Greece is now being criticised for its reluctance to lift a veto on Ecu600m (Pounds 414m) in economic aid for Turkey, even after being granted a special balance of payments loan earlier this year. The veto was imposed in the early 1980s in protest atthe Turkish military presence in northern Cyprus. Foreign Ministry officials in Athens are reluctant to comment on suggestions that the government may soon agree to the Turkish aid. But the real test of Greece's future relationship with the Community will be the progress made on restructuring its economy under the terms of its Ecu2.2bn loan. Greece has undertaken to reduce inflation from 22.8 per cent at the end of last year to 9.5 per cent by 1993 and to cut government borrowing from 13.1 to 1.5 per cent of gross national product. The current account deficit must be cut from 6 to 3 per cent of GNP. The three-year stabilisation programme is intended to prepare the drachma for entry to the exchange rate mechanism by the end of 1993, in time for Greece to join in the second phase of economic and monetary union. Other conditions for the loan included an overhaul of the pension system, sweeping tax reforms and a 10 per cent cut in the civil service payroll. About one-third of spending goes to cover the public sector wage and pensions bill. With another 40 percent earmarked for servicing the public debt, now over 100 per cent of GDP, there is little scope for state investment. The government intends to use the EC loan to help cover the Greek contribution to infrastructure projects included in the Community's regional programme, calculating that increased private capital inflow will cover the current account shortfall. 'We're on track with most projects, and in some cases the Commission has gone out of its way to find extra financing,' says Mr Achilles Karamanlis, minister of public works. As a result, a long-delayed project to help develop north-western Greece through construction of a Dollars 400m bridge across the western end of the Corinth Gulf should go ahead later this year. Still, Community surveillance of Greece's economic performance will be strict: the terms of a similar loan in the mid-1980s were largely ignored. On the basis of first-quarter performance, Greek officials will be able to report progress on containing inflation - now likely to fall below this year's target of 17.5 per cent. However, there are problems with reducing the deficit as public sector corporations are still overspending, while the government's revenue forecast now looks too ambitious. Plans to raise at least Dr200bn from privatising 20 debt-plagued companies run by the state-controlled Industrial Reconstruction Organisation will be curtailed. Potential buyers have been slow to appear. Issues of state land bonds, convertible into building plots, were expected to bring in another Dr150bn. They will be delayed until later this year because local authorities in several designated areas are raising objections. But when it comes to tax evasion, the Finance Ministry is on the warpath. A new tax inspector has arrived on the islandof Mykonos, opposite Delos, which attracts about 500,000 tourists every summer and still keeps up its reputation for riotous nightlife. 'He seems likea tough character,' says a bar owner, shuffling the night's takings before deciding how much to ring up on the cash register.</p>

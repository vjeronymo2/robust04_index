			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Juris Bojars, chairman of the Latvian </F> Democratic Labor Party, by A. Borisov; place and date not  given: "One Must Be Pragmatic"]    [Excerpts] Fate and, to be more exact, a short line in his  life record -- 22 (!) years ago Juris Bojars worked in the KGB  -- have willed that this well-known Latvian lawyer was deprived  of the possibility to stand for the Saeima [parliament]  elections. Finding himself outside the parliament, however,  Bojars did not remain outside big politics. My interlocutor is  not only chairman of the Latvian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP],  but also director of the Latvian Institute of International  Relations. [passage omitted]    [Borisov] I address my next question to you as a  specialist in international relations. It is common knowledge  that recently the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution on  the violations of human rights in Latvia....    [Bojars] The resolution does not mention human rights  violations. It deals with the problems of these rights. There  is not a single state that would not have similar problems.    [Borisov]One of the reasons why Latvia did not join the  European Council was the delay in adopting the law on  citizenship. Is the approval of this law in a national  referendum a correct move?    [Bojars] Such a decision has not yet been adopted. Only  [Prime Minister] V. Birkavs has expressed some considerations  about this issue. I think that this option does not run counter  to the principles of democracy. However, my personal opinion is  that in such a case we must submit the entire package rather  than just one draft law for public approval. People must have a  chance to choose. Russia's experience has demonstrated that if  they have one draft constitution they may either accept or  reject it. The people think: How can we live without a  constitution? They approve of it as a result, without either  discussing or reading it. The same will happen in our country  because the majority of the population does not have the  possibility or the desire to read this document.    [Borisov]As there is a dilemma in foreign policy  whether to lean toward the East or the West, what would you  advise?    [Bojars] To be pragmatic and do what is necessary. Regarding  current tendencies.... Yeltsin is also accused of his love for  the West. This is in fashion now. Since we were so firmly tied  to the East, there is nothing surprising in our current yearning  for the West.    [Borisov] Speaking of security, is there any sense in  hurrying to be under NATO's wing?    [Bojars] Under the current circumstances, it is very  difficult for Latvia to defend itself on its own. One can  understand our officials who have found the only option for  action -- to search for protection in NATO, although Russia does  not like such a course of events. In such a case, Russia could  behave in a natural and wise manner -- not to disseminate  threats about turning Latvia into its province, but to conclude  an agreement with us on mutual security and to provide  guarantees. Certainly, anyone may tell you that before the war  Latvia and the USSR had about seven such agreements, all of  which were violated. So, where are the guarantees that someone  like Zhirinovskiy will not do the same after assuming power?  Given NATO's strength, relations with this bloc may be one of  the possible replies.    [Borisov]You were very critical of Godmanis' government  once. Have you preserved the same attitude toward Birkavs'  cabinet?    [Bojars] My answer is as follows. The current circle of  authorities does not differ greatly from the former one. I must  admit, however, that the policies of the current government are  less chaotic, while Godmanis was a very messy person. Birkavs  is much more reserved. Moreover, he is a lawyer and he is more  accustomed to some order and a system, which is also positive.  Godmanis was like someone from the Popular Front, although he  did not found this organization. I would say frankly that he  simply stuck to the Popular Front. He took advantage of this  situation and resorted to populist ideas that are not exploited  by the current cabinet. The latter is a truly right-wing  organization devoted to conservative ideals. The government  moves concerning pensioners do not indicate any social trend in  the current cabinet of ministers or "Latvia's Way." Therefore,  my attitude toward this government is critical and reserved.    [Borisov]The LDDP lost the elections. Why?    [Bojars] Not only we but all left-wing parties suffered a  defeat. This is quite natural. The Socialist International has  established a certain regularity -- in postcommunist societies  the leftist parties usually lose the first elections, while in  the second elections the picture changes considerably. The same  is typical of Russia. True, there are no strong noncommunist  leftist parties there. Thus, we have to deal with a historical  regularity. Thorough reforms are in store for our party in the  beginning of next year. We are bringing them in line with the  best traditions of European social democracy.    [Borisov]Thank you for the interview.</p>

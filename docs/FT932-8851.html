			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Arts: Dezso Rank - Recital All too fallible memory suggests that Rank has not played late Beethoven before in London. We have heard him unfailingly stylish in Mozart and Chopin, direct and uncompromising in Bartok, a most persuasive advocate of his Hungarian contemporaries; but his Wigmore Hall programme on Saturday was devoted to the last three Beethoven piano sonatas, Op. 109, 110 and 111, played in strict chronology. It promised much; Rank is such an accomplished and fastidious artist that his approach to these pianistic summits was inevitably going to be considered and fascinatingly detailed. What was delivered, though, came across as unexpectedly approximate, like a snapshot of work in progress rather than a series of distinct, fully achieved interpretations. General principles could just be discerned: in all three works Rank appeared to set out to subvert the conventional aspirations of late Beethoven playing, de-emphasising the grandeur (even in Op. 111) and demystifying the most serene moments of lyrical intensity. The snapshot often seemed more like a negative. Ethereal spirituality was brought down to earthy directness, strenuous aspiration transformed into sportive exuberance, yet what might have been bracingly different never cohered completely and too often was disappointing on purely cosmetic grounds. The opening of Op. 109 ought to have suited Rank's luminous tone and limpid articulation, yet came over as almost shockingly matter-of-fact, with an uncomfortable sprinkling of errors; in Op. 110, vital left-hand detail in the first movement went for nothing, and the central section of the final fugue was prosaic and underpowered. There were things to admire - a finely spun, singing line in some of the Op. 109 variations, clean, athletic counterpoint in the finale of Op. 111, an explosive scherzo in Op. 110 - but they were the exceptions to the rule of inconsistency. Rank must return to London with the same programme when either his interpretations or his own playing, perhaps both, are focused more firmly.</p>

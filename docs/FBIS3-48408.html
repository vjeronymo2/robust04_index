			<p>Language: <F P=105> Burmese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Lieutenant General Tin U, secretary 2 of the  State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC], met and  delivered an address on matters concerning the rule of law,  local tranquillity and stability, and the reduction and  eradication of crimes to the members of the Yangon [Rangoon]  Division's district, and township law and order restoration  councils; responsible personnel from the departments under the  Home Ministry and the People's Force Headquarters; regional  commanders, responsible personnel of the Yangon City Development  Committee [YCDC], judges from divisions, districts and  townships, and legal officers at the meeting hall of the YCDC at  1300.    In his address Lt. Gen. Tin U cited and explained Prime  Minister Senior General Than Shwe's directive and guideline on  administrative mechanism in detail. He said responsible  personnel should not perform their jobs as usual during the  revolutionary period in which the old system and era are being  dismantled and a new system and era are being built in the  country. Responsible personnel have to exert more effort in  order to carry out their work and responsibilities with sharp  and innovative minds, and with diligence and perseverance. He  continued that the dignity of the people and the nation will be  affected if Yangon City becomes dirty and there is an increase  in robbery, muggings, pickpocket incidences, and other illegal  activities. All of these activities run counter to the  character of the city and result if there is a breakdown in the  rule of law. That is why Yangon is being renovated from all  sides to retain the character of the city. Moreover, it is very  important to have discipline, to observe laws, and to establish  local tranquillity effectively and efficiently.    He also said there is a serious need for state employees  from  various public service organizations to understand the political  situation during the change of system and era. They must also  understand that they should use their authority, bestowed on  them by the state, in a proper way and not to abuse their power.  [passage omitted on objectives of law and order restoration  council in various regions].    He continued that the SLORC will effectively prevent and  defend any form of action that can cause the disappearance of  rule of law and that will allow anarchy to prevail in the  country. Law and order restoration councils have to take a  leading role to implement local ty/ty and ensure the prevalence  of rule of law in the respective regions. All public service  organizations have to cooperate and work together to the benefit  of regions and localities.    He added that there is need to take effective action against  those public service organizations which do not cooperate with  others. The law and order restoration councils at ward level  are basic administrative organizations; therefore, these  councils should be supervised with the help of ward leaders in  order to carry out their work honestly, bravely, and without  corruption. He said the state administrative mechanism must be  effective and efficient to establish a peaceful and modern  country. It is also very important for the administrative  mechanism to become an instrument which can support the  all-around development of the country. He noted that it does  not matter how good the systems and ideas to be practiced are if  people disobey the law and have no discipline. This results in  a lack of development for the country and the country then will  face the greater danger of being wiped from the world map.    He said the SLORC, for the long-term benefit of the state,  is  taking effective action against criminal acts that can destroy  local ty/ty. He also warned that effective action will taken  against public service personnel, who conduct themselves badly,  and without any discrimination. In conclusion, he said various  levels of law and order restoration councils in the respective  regions have to take a leading role and supervise their areas  bravely and properly for the development of the country and for  peace and stability. He said the departments have to coordinate  and cooperate amongst each other without employing  discrimination as they carry out their responsibilities. He  said responsible personnel have to disclose the names of those  who take bribes from criminals and take effective action against  them. He also reminded responsible personnel not to punish  innocent people by mistake when handing down sentences to  prevent the crimes. He urged responsible personnel to work hard  to become a person who is respected by the people. He also told  them to avoid accepting all gifts and bribes.

			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Ireland's Parliament decided to give caretaker Prime Minister Charles Haughey  until Thursday for another attempt to form a government, raising the likelihood  that his failure to do so could result in another snap election. Haughey told  Parliament: "I do not regard a general election as the solution to our present  difficulties. . . . It would be a Doomsday solution." The biggest stumbling  block in forming a new government is Haughey's refusal to consider sharing  power in a coalition, even after last month's inconclusive general election  left him worse off than before. Haughey was forced to resign last Thursday  after failing to be reelected as prime minister for the fourth time.  </P></p>

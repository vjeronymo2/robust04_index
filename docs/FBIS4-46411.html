			<p>BFN     [Text] Ba'labakk, Lebanon, June 8 (AFP)--Pro-Iranian  Hizballah guerrillas kidnapped six Lebanese and a retired Syrian  soldier Wednesday in Syrian-controlled eastern Lebanon, police  said.    Lebanese and Syrian security services had contacted the  group  late Wednesday in a bid to secure their release, they said. The  seven were not identified.    Witnesses said that three people were beaten and seized from  their homes by Hizballah members, while the four others were  taken in public places in Ba'labakk and its surroundings.    Security services said the seven could have been taken in a  Hizballah sweep to investigate the kidnapping on May 21 of  pro-Iranian guerrilla leader Mustafa al-Dirani who was seized  from his home in a raid by Israeli commandos.    Israel hopes al-Dirani can supply vital information on  missing Israeli airman Ron Arad shot down in south Lebanon in  1986.</p>

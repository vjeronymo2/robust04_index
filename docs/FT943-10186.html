			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / International Company News: USAir turns down pilots' proposals USAir, the struggling US carrier in which British Airways holds a minority stake, yesterday rejected a proposal from the pilots' union that employees should swap Dollars 2.5bn worth of wage cuts for 25 per cent of the company's shares. It said the savings flowing from the plan were 'illusory' and several serious flaws would have to be corrected before 'meaningful' negotiations over cost reductions could take place. However, USAir said some aspects of the pilots' proposal were encouraging, and it was prepared to accept the principle of an equity-for-concessions swap. 'It's a starting point,' the company said. USAir, which faces tough competition from low-cost carriers making in-roads into its markets, has not made a profit since 1988. In June it put forward a plan to slash operating costs by Dollars 1bn a year, with half of the savings coming from the wage bill. Last week the Air Line Pilots Association proposed that employees should yield Dollars 2.5bn worth of wage cuts over the next five years in exchange for partial employee ownership and representation on the company's board.</p>

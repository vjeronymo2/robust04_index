			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Noriega says he will not testify FORMER Panamanian leader General Manuel Antonio Noriega said yesterday he would not testify in his drug-trafficking conspiracy trial in Miami. He said he had made the decision because 'my presentation would have to be limited not to include political matters, issues of war, and the (1989 US) invasion.' The decision was announced as the general's defence rested its case in the trial underway in Miami since last September. Prosecutors yesterday began to present a rebuttal case in which several agents of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) will testify. If convicted on 10 drug and racketeering counts, Gen Noriega could get up to 140 years in prison. In a hearing before trial judge Mr William Hoeveler, with the jury absent, one of Gen Noriega's attorneys, Mr Jon May, asked the judge to order the government to make further disclosures which the defence had a right to know. A major part of the defence argument rests on the fact that the DEA did not inform either prosecutors or the defence about an on-going money-laundering investigation it had carried out with Panamanian authorities until after the prosecution had completed presenting its case against the general. A former Panamanian legislator testified on Monday Gen Noriega personally lobbied for a tough anti-drug law finally passed in late 1986. The legislation made drug prosecutions easier and for the first time outlawed money laundering.</p>

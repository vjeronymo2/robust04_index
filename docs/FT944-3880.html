			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Sport: Litigation is the name of the game - Growing numbers of sportsmen are consulting a lawyer instead of the referee This year, a powerful new figure has entered the British sporting scene. The authorities are running scared but, with media attention dominated by drugs scandals, the contestant's rise to prominence has been hardly noticed. The new contender on pitch and track is the lawyer, and the name of the game is litigation. In the second High Court case of the year involving a soccer accident, the Aston Villa footballer John Fashanu and his insurers were ordered to pay Pounds 70,000 in compensation to a defender injured in a 1987 league game. In a wrangle over contracts, Leicester City went to law last week seeking compensation running into millions of pounds after its manager, Brian Little, was lured away by Villa. Meanwhile in Geneva, attorneys acting for the International Motorsport Federation are trying to decide whether David Coulthard will work for McLaren or Williams Renault in next season's Formula One. If Williams wins, a talented driver may have to sit out 1995 in the pits while Nigel Mansell continues his comeback. The death of the Austrian skier Uli Maier last season focused attention  - and litigation - on a dangerous sport. When the International Ski Federation introduced compulsory and far-reaching rights-waivers for competitors in this year's World Cup, skiers began talking of a boycott. The old maxim of Volens non fit injuria (he who consents cannot be injured), which used to govern sport, is now history and the inclination to reach for a lawyer rather than a referee is worrying the highest reaches of world sport. Since the effects of this on the Olympic Games can only be bad, Olympic officials and leaders of international federations have begun to fight back against the tendency to sue and are attempting to make specialised sports arbitration more attractive. Recent cases such as the one involving the American sprinter Butch Reynolds, who sued the world athletics body for Dollars 27m after he was suspended over allegations of drug abuse, were the last straw. As worries mount about how litigation could affect the Atlanta Games in 1996, Dr Primo Nebiolo, president of the International Amateur Athletics Federation, announced at the International Olympic Committee council meeting in Barcelona last week that new IAAF rules would impose mandatory arbitration on competitors. 'We will change our constitution and insert an article making it obligatory for an athlete to follow all internal appeals and then go to arbitration,' said Dr Nebiolo. Other sports within the Olympic programme plan the same restrictions. Insiders say that the IAAF realised how serious the problems of litigation by athletes had become when the Coca-Cola corporation froze millions of dollars in sponsorship money to prevent it being sequestered under a court order to pay compensation to Butch Reynolds. If the new system had been in place, Reynolds's dispute with the US Olympic Committee, would have had to go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland. This court has existed on a very modest scale for nearly 10 years. However, it has only recently been separated from the IOC, which was seen as a vital move, as many of the most serious disputes are likely to involve the Olympics and national trials. Dick Pound, a Canadian lawyer and the most powerful member of the IOC after President Juan Samaranch, said: 'Previously in these disputes the IOC had tended to take the line, 'What you say is debateable; what we say is sacred fact.' To hold ourselves up to outside jurisdiction is a signal of how seriously the problem must be addressed. 'It is vital to find some means which can keep the Olympics in Atlanta free of litigation, which may paralyse the ability of the organisers, the officials and the athletes, in relation to the Games,' he said. In a lecture given in Washington, he gave warning that a stadium full of writs could have far-reaching consequences. 'We must all hope that the courts in the United States will not try to substitute their judgment for that of the proper sports authorities,' he said. 'If this does not happen, I foresee the day when the US will no longer be able to attract any major sports events.'</p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Mediators renew Bosnia initiative LORD Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators, met Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in Geneva yesterday as part of renewed diplomatic efforts to end the slaughter in the former Yugoslav republic, agencies report. The talks coincided with reports that Serb rockets destroyed a temporary hospital, killing 52 patients and medical staff, in the blockaded east Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde. The death toll, if independently confirmed, would be one of the worst in a single incident in the 14-month war between Bosnia's Moslem, Croat and Serb communities. The talks, a day after the mediators met Croat leaders, focused on the growing conflict between the Moslem-led government and its former Croat allies. Lord Owen said that one of the main aims of the discussions was to alleviate fighting between Moslems and Croats 'but the essential task is still the overall peace settlement'. Shortly after the talks, Moslem, Croat and Serb members of Bosnia's collective presidency gathered at the UN's European headquarters for a special session and ordered a truce between Moslem and Croat forces. But diplomats voiced scepticism about a ceasefire holding. The presidency also demanded the immediate deployment of United Nations peacekeepers to stem the bloodshed in Gorazde, one of six Moslem 'safe areas' designated by the UN. So far, besieging Serb militiamen have prevented UN forces from gaining access to the enclave. Lord Owen said that despite the deteriorating situation on the ground, the two international mediators were still trying to find a diplomatic solution that would enable Moslems, Croats and Serbs to live together within a single state. UN commanders, meanwhile, have called a meeting of Serb, Croat and Moslem army chiefs to take place at Sarajevo airport tomorrow to discuss a lasting ceasefire. Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg hope to gather leaders of all the Bosnian factions, as well as Serb President Slobodan Milosevic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, for talks in Geneva on Wednesday.</p>

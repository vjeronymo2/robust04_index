The provisional P&hyph;DP rates for firm power and firm and nonfirm transmission service represent an increase of more than 1 percent in total P&hyph;DP revenues; therefore, it is a major rate adjustment as defined at 10 CFR &sect;&sect;903.2(e) and 903.2(f)(1). The distinction between a minor and major rate adjustment is used only to determine the public procedures for the rate adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following summarizes the steps Western took to ensure involvement of interested parties in the rate process:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

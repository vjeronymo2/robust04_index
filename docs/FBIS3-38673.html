Speaking at a conference on security policy in  Munich today, Ruehe called for "rapid changes" in financial  conditions for the troops. At the same time, the defense  minister announced the establishment of "crisis reaction forces"  [Krisenreactionskraefte].    The Bundeswehr is in a position to fulfill its mandate with  regard to domestic defense, he said. However, the troops are  not yet capable of taking part in measures involving  "international crisis management." To this end, a flexible,  adaptable, assertive unit would have to be set up to cover  missions under UN auspices, Ruehe said. In particular, this  includes "extensive mobility for the transfer of forces."</p>

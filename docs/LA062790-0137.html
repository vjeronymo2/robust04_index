			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC SYMPHONY OFFICIALLY ACCEPTS $45,000 NEA GRANT  </P> <P> Pacific Symphony, which had announced that it would accept a $45,000 grant from  the National Endowment for the Arts, has received official notification of the  award and will indeed accept it, Pacific Symphony executive director Louis G.  Spisto said Monday.  </P> <P> Several U.S. arts groups have rejected NEA subsidies rather than sign what is  being described as an anti-obscenity pledge.  </P> <P> Spisto said his organization will continue to fight for an NEA that does not  restrict the content of artworks. Pro-NEA letters to legislators and concert  audiences will continue through the summer, he said.ZAN DUBIN  </P></p>

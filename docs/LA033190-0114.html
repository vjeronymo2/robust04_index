			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOROLA GRANTED STAY ON BAN AGAINST CHIP SALES  </P> <P> A federal judge on Friday granted Motorola Inc.'s request for a stay following  his ruling that the company violated a key computer chip patent and order to  stop selling one of its microprocessors.  </P> <P> The stay was granted pending an appeal to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  in New Orleans, according to the U.S. District Court clerk's office in Austin.  </P> <P> Motorola spokesman Dan Rogers said the company sought the stay of the court's  injunction against domestic marketing and sale of its 68030 microprocessor and  "is studying other legal remedies."  </P> <P> The 68030 microprocessor is the centerpiece of a family of Motorola products  that are the electronic heart of millions of personal computers and other  electronic devices.  </P> <P> A lawsuit between Motorola and Tokyo-based Hitachi Ltd. resulted in each giant  computer company receiving an award and a lecture on Thursday from U.S.  District Judge Lucius Bunton not to waste the court's time.  </P> <P> In a 45-page opinion, Bunton said the parties "would have saved time, money,  feelings and relations had they curbed their emotions and sat down to settle  their difference out of court."  </P> <P> Under Bunton's order, Hitachi will pay $1.9 million to Motorola for patent  infringements, and Motorola will pay $500,000 to Hitachi for a patent  infringement.  </P> <P> The order prohibits the companies, allies since 1975 in sharing technological  and manufacturing advances, from marketing or selling various lines of  microprocessors.  </P> <P> Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., sued Hitachi, claiming the company was  using Motorola secrets to develop a series of micro controllers -- thumb-sized  devices central to information-processing devices used in computers.  </P> <P> Hitachi filed a countersuit, claiming that Motorola infringed on some of its  patents.  </P></p>

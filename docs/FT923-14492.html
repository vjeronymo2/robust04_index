			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: Cemex poised for Dollars 1.7bn takeover of Valenciana CEMENTOS Mexicanos (Cemex), North America and Mexico's largest cement producer, is expected to launch a Dollars 1.7bn takeover for Spain's biggest producer, Valenciana de Cementos, in Madrid today. Yesterday it acquired almost 25 per cent of the company. The bid, which would be the largest ever takeover in Spain, will help Cemex directly challenge Holderbank, of Switzerland, the world's leading cement producer, and Cemex's main rival in the North American market. According to sources at the Spanish stock market commission the bid for 100 per cent of Valenciana will be made at Pta15,000 a share. Valenciana's stock closed yesterday at Pta14,600. The Cemex bid represents a significant reversal of investment in the international cement business, which during the 1980s was characterised by heavy European investment in the North American market. Cemex yesterday bought 24.9 per cent of Valenciana directly from the Spanish company. This was Treasury stock held by the company which has been supporting its share price as cement shares have weakened because of a sharp slowdown in construction activity. At the price of the bid this stake would be worth Dollars 425m. Cemex is one of Mexico's largest industrial companies, with sales last year of 5,300bn pesos (Dollars 1.76bn), and profits of 1,4000bn pesos. It produces 22m tonnes of cement a year, the fourth highest cement production in the world. Over the past few years it has disposed of its non-cement holdings, and used the proceeds to make itself more competitive in the domestic and international market. In 1989 Cemex acquired Empresas Tolteca de Mexico, then the second largest cement company in Mexico, for Dollars 663m. Cemex also owns over 50 ready-mix plants in southern US. In 1989 Cemex was the largest exporter to the US, but in 1990 a successful anti-dumping case was brought against it, bringing an abrupt end to its exports. Valenciana is Spain's largest cement company, with production around 6m tonnes, and 17 per cent of the market, the second largest in Europe after Italy's. Cemex has benefited from the Mexican government's recent relaxation of price controls, and will earn in the next few years plenty of spare cash with which to finance this latest acquisition. The company is already well-capitalised, thanks to Dollars 637m share offering completed earlier this year. Cemex is planning to invest Dollars 1bn in the next three years to boost capacity in Mexico by 35 per cent, and meet the growing demand for cement, and ready-mix concrete. Once the expansion is complete, its production will be 33m tonnes a year, just 2m less than the world's third largest producer, La Farge of France. Turkey's privatisation programme, Page 30</p>

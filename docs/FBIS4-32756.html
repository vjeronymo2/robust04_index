			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 27 June (MTI-ECONEWS) -- According to the  Socialist-Free Democrat Coalition Agreement, steps to reform  public finances must be included in the central budget in 1995.    According to the section of the agreement dealing with  public  finances, the most important elements of the reform will be the  itemized investigation of state expenditure, the establishment  of a central budget that is not based on figures of previous  years, and cuts in state expenditure.    A long-term financing strategy of state debts must be set up  and the large number of separate state financial funds and  foundations must be reduced, with some of them to be integrated  into the central budget.    The document plans a law on non-profit activity and on  public  procurement as well as the reorganization of the pension and  health insurance system.    The aim of the incoming coalition is to reduce central tax  payments and to rise local tax payments in the long run. This  however is feasible only when the economy grows.    Steps must be taken towards the establishment of the  single-tier value added tax [VAT] system with the compensation  for those in need. VAT refunds on house building must also be  re-introduced, the agreement says.    Consumer taxes must be adjusted to inflation, the supervison  of levy payment must be strengthened and tax evasion must be  punished.    Investment preferences must be standardized, personal income  and company taxation must also be included in the  standardization. According to the agreement, preferences must be  given to portfolio investments with share purchase. Minimum  taxation must be abolished. Withholding tax on deposit  interests must be cut back to zero, and tax after securities  must be reduced to a minimum in order to decrease interest  margin, the document says.    On the basis of the agreement, a lump-sum tax will be  imposed  on small businesses, which can than be controlled more easily.  The issue of company taxation must be revised, and its amount  may be reduced in the future in case of economic growth.    Regarding personal income taxation, the agreement urges a  more fair allocation of tax burdens among families, and  income-related taxation must be introduced in the field of  pension and other social benefits. It will enable taxpayers to  use a part of their personal income tax on various public,  non-political purposes.    With the adjustment of duty tariffs to European standards,  market defensive measures approved by GATT and the European  Union must be implemented.    Another aim of the agreement is to reduce local government  dependence on the central budget and with this, to decrease  central re-allocation. As a first step, local authorities will  be allocated at least 35 percent of the personal income tax  revenue, instead of the current 30 percent.</p>

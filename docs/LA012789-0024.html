			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Rightist extremists threatened to kill the leaders of five Honduran civic  groups in apparent reprisal for the slaying of retired Gen. Gustavo Alvarez  Martinez, the anti-Communist former chief of Honduras' armed forces who was  influential in organizing the Nicaraguan Contras on Honduran soil. The  self-styled Anti-Communist Alliance of Action said in a broadcast statement  that it has "judged" the five and "condemned" them to death. The threatened men  include heads of political factions both in and out of government, a labor  leader and two human rights leaders. The Popular Liberation  Movement-Chinchonero, a leftist band that emerged in 1981, claimed  responsibility for killing Alvarez.  </P></p>

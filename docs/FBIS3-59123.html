The federal government was  also committed to creating concrete prospects for membership of  the European Union, Kinkel said this evening in a speech before  students at Speyer College of Administration.    The West had to support the democratic reforms in Russia to  secure peace in Europe in the long-term, he said. However, the  financial support given Russia had long ago reached the limits  of the budget's capacity. The minister called upon the other  Western industrial nations to provide greater financial support  for Russia.    In Speyer, Kinkel once again spoke in favor of a permanent  seat on the UN Security Council for Germany. The German  Government wanted to play a part in deciding international  problems that affected Germany. To that end, Germany would have  to take part in UN military peace missions. It was important  for the constitutional basis for Bundeswehr missions abroad to  be established at last.</p>

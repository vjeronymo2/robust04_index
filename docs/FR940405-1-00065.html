			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MS and SS cigarette smoke are chemically and physically complex mixtures consisting of electrically charged submicron liquid particles at very high concentration consisting of permanent gases, reactive gases, and a large variety of organic chemicals. The composition of the smoke and especially the total quantities of individual constituents delivered are dependent on the conditions of smoke generation [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nicotine, while found in the particulate phase in MS, is found predominantly in the gas phase in ETS [Ex. 4&hyph;100]. The differences in size distribution for MS and SS particles, as well as the different breathing patterns of smokers and nonsmokers, affect deposition of the produced particle contaminants in various regions of the respiratory tract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are substantial similarities and some differences between MS and SS emissions from cigarettes [Exs. 3&hyph;689D, 4&hyph;129, 4&hyph;239]. Differences in MS and SS emissions are due to differences in the temperature of the combustion of tobacco, pH, and degree of dilution with the air, which is accompanied by a correspondingly rapid decrease in temperature. SS is generated at a lower temperature (approximately 600 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C between puffs versus 800 to 900 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C for MS during puffs) and at a higher pH (6.7&hyph;7.5 versus 6.0&hyph;6.7) than MS. Being slightly more alkaline, SS contains more ammonia, is depleted of acids, contains greater quantities of organic bases, and contains less hydrogen cyanide than MS. Differences in MS and SS are also ascribable to differences in the oxygen concentration (16% in MS versus 2% in SS). SS contaminants are generated in a more reducing environment than those in MS, which will affect the distribution of some compounds. Nitrosamines, for example, are present in greater concentrations in SS than in MS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of the compounds found in MS, which were identified as human carcinogens, are also found in SS emissions [Exs. 3&hyph;689D, 4&hyph;93, 4&hyph;129, 4&hyph;239, 4&hyph;269] and at emission rates considerably higher than for MS. SS contains ten times more polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aza-arenes and amines as compared with MS [Ex. 4&hyph;126]. All of the five known carcinogens, nine probable human carcinogens, and three animal carcinogens are emitted at higher levels in SS than in MS, several by an order of magnitude or more. Several toxic compounds found in MS are also found in SS (carbon monoxide, ammonia, nitrogen oxides, nicotine, acrolein, acetone, etc.), in some cases by an order of magnitude or higher (Tables III&hyph;6 and III&hyph;7). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SS emissions, quantitatively, show little variability as a function of a number of variables (puff volume, filter versus nonfilter cigarette, and filter ventilation [Exs. 4&hyph;1, 4&hyph;34, 4&hyph;54, 4&hyph;128, 4&hyph;129, 4&hyph;141]. The lack of substantial variability in SS emissions is related to the fact that they are primarily related to the weight of tobacco and paper consumed during the smoldering period, with little influence exerted by cigarette design [Ex. 4&hyph;129]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (b) Human Activity Pattern Studies Used to Assess Workplace Exposure.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Human activity pattern studies utilize random samples of human activity patterns using questionnaires and time-diary data to provide detailed generalizable data about human behavior. Such studies have been used to assess exposure to ETS. In 1987&hyph;1988, the California Air Resources Board sponsored a probability-based cross-sectional sample of 1,579 Californians aged 18 years and older, called the California Activity Pattern Survey (CAPS) [Exs. 4&hyph;168, 4&hyph;271]. The study was designed to provide information on time spent in various locations, including indoors, outdoors, and in transit, as well as specific microenvironments, such as living rooms, kitchens, automobiles, or buses. The study focused on time spent in activities such as cooking or playing sports, but more specifically targeted activities and environments that had implications for air pollution exposure, such as the presence of smokers, use of cooking equipment or solvents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In analyzing the data from CAPS, Jenkins et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;168] and Robinson et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;271] found that time spent at work had a high correlation with exposure to ETS. This association of ETS exposure with work settings remained strong after controlling for the length of the activity episode, and hence was not simply a function of longer time intervals at work. Robinson et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;271] also found that men reported higher levels of exposure than women, even after controlling for age, employment status, shorter working hours, etc. This finding suggests that the epidemiological studies of passive smoking and lung cancer, which have focussed on women, may be underestimating the effect of ETS on lung cancer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further analysis of the CAP study [Ex. 4&hyph;169] verifies the high percentage of nonsmokers who are exposed to ETS while at work. This is indicated when the data are analyzed by employed nonsmoker status. As indicated in Table III&hyph;8, 51% of male and 38% of female nonsmokers reported ETS exposure at work. The average duration of this exposure was 313 minutes for males and 350 minutes for females. When the group that reported exposure at the workplace is analyzed further it becomes apparent that the overwhelming exposure location for these employed nonsmokers is the workplace (Table III&hyph;9). As indicated in Table III&hyph;9, 77% of males and 85% of females were exposed an average of 313 minutes and 350 minutes, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One other finding is that the more time spent at work, the higher the likelihood of greater ETS exposure. For example, the average duration of exposure to homemakers was approximately 2 hours a day, for workers the average duration of exposure was approximately 3 hours a day. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

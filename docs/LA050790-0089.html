			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK.  </P> <P> MGM/UA Sued Over Movie Distribution: MGM/United Artist Pictures Inc. was sued  in Los Angeles Superior Court for allegedly failing to use its "best efforts"  to distribute the film "Mind Games" in the United States and Canada.  </P> <P> The suit, filed by MTA/Persik Productions and MTA Productions Inc., claims  MGM/UA bought the distribution rights but never intended to diligently promote  the movie. The suit seeks more than $2.6 million, claiming MGM/UA has a  "pattern" of not properly promoting some films because it is contractually  obliged to give movies to CBS/Fox Co. for release as home videocassettes.

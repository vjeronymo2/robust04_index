			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another commenter suggested that residents'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understanding is critical and their education should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expanded to include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;How the survey process works and how to participate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;How the investigation process works and how to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;How the care planning process works and how to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These suggestions have considerable merit and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are within both the spirit and intent of the Act. We agree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the commenters that the proposed regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessarily restricted the scope of the mandated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational programs. The regulation is being revised to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit the education programs to cover all aspects of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long-term care survey process. We believe the States should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have the flexibility to structure the educational programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the needs of the facilities. The methods of developing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the programs (for example, consultation with the ombudsmen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program) and the methods of presentation are best left to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the States. The comment that States should work with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents and family councils to solicit their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations prior to any changes in requirements goes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beyond the educational process. In some respects, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment incorporates residents and families as participants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the survey and enforcement processes. Whenever there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public rulemaking, any member of the public is a participant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the process and can comment and make recommendations on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such matters. In addition, when surveyors speak with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents during the survey, residents are free to bring up  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments about the survey process if they wish. Regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the comment that residents' understanding of the survey,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigation, and the care planning processes should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expanded, we repeat that the regulation is being amended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit the educational programs to cover all aspects of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long-term care process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter recommended that HCFA share  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> central office and regional office satellite training to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide training simultaneously with nursing facility staff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It is beyond the scope of this regulation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institute such detailed procedures as providing satellite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training to consumers or specifying any other training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medium. It is beyond our technological capabilities to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide training via satellite to every SNF and NF in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> country. The costs of installing the necessary equipment in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each facility would far exceed our budgetary resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that, although this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section providing education to residents and staff of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities is an excellent idea, it lacks specificity and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oversight. Because of budgetary crises, this is but another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational program at State expense and will receive low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priority. HCFA must ensure that the State will conduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational programs at particular time intervals or face  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanctioning by HCFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Although there is no statutory provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring HCFA to oversee States to determine if they have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failed to conduct educational programs as required by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act, we recognize that we have some responsibility to do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is within the purview of the States to decide how and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when to conduct their educational programs. We believe it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is wiser to leave these decisions to the individual States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since they must design the educational programs the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifies. However, we are looking into the feasibility of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring the States in some way to assure that they are in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with this statutory requirement. We plan to find  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an acceptable approach to evaluating State efforts in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing educational programs to facilities and their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> staffs, and residents and their representatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A commenter stated that further definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the nature and frequency of educational programs is needed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, for consistency, HCFA should establish the nature and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content of such programs. There could be extensive new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resource requirements if the program is not considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate. Another commenter recommends that we define  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``periodic'' and detail the process for State compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As previously mentioned, the nature and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content could cover any of the requirements of sections 1819  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 1919 of the Act. When manual instructions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed, they will provide guidelines on topics such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequency of educational programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter questioned whether on-site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presentations were preferable to written communication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This is a detailed and specific matter. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods of training will be determined by the States, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA will publish guidelines in manuals to assist States in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structuring their programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This commenter also recommends replacing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> word ``conduct'' with ``provide'' to allow for the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subcontractors, and for the distribution of written and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> auto-visual materials toward this end.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We believe to make such a change could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpreted as changing the intent of the Act, which uses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the word ``conduct.'' The Act gives the responsibility for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing educational programs specifically to the States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters stated that funds must be made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to the States for educational purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Survey of the Basque Country (6): High-tech glimpse of the future - Industry About eight miles outside Bilbao and just a stone's throw from the city's airport lies the Zamudio technology park, occupying 320 acres of beautiful countryside. 'But the technology park is not just a collection of nice decorations, pretty furniture and pleasant fields,' says Mr Juan Martin, one of the park's senior managers, 'Its soul is the 'software'; the quality of the people who work here.' In many respects, industry in the Basque Country is in a transitory phase, with the Zamudio park and other high-tech developments indicating what the future could be like; a shift from the old traditional metal-bashing industries to electronics, bio-technology, and communications. Zamudio's 37 companies are mostly small-scale, 25 of them employing fewer than 20 people each. But there is every chance that from these acorns some strong oaks will grow. The reason for that confidence is the unique strain of proud Basque self-identity which in commercial spheres becomes interfused with an attitude of mutual co-operation. The Basque Country's former predominance in industrial production within Spain overall is vulnerable as a result of recession and overseas competition. But it still accounts for 6.2 per cent of Spain's gross domestic product and 10.7 per cent of Spanish exports, although the region has just 5.4 per cent of the Spanish population. Another factor which benefits Basque industry is the massive level of government subsidy and services support. The creation of an office of strategic investments in the Basque government in November 1992, with a determination to generate more than 8,000 jobs through targeted investments totalling Pta33bn, under the so-called Garapen Plan, is a clear indication of Basque government determination to shelter local industry against the worst excesses of international competition and recession. That extends to stepping in where the banking system is reluctant or unable to tread. SPRI (Sociedad para la Promocion y Reconversion Industrial, or the society for industrial promotion and reconversion) is the Basque Country's development agency, created in 1991 and 91.4 per cent owned by the Basque government's economy ministry. SPRI provides loans at 4 or 5 per cent interest - several points lower than present bank rates in Spain - for up to 70 per cent of total investment. According to the president of SPRI, Mr Jon Azua, industrial production fell by 4.5 per cent in 1992 compared with 1991, with the loss of 20,000 jobs. Production of industrial plant goods fell by 10.8 per cent. SPRI's role is to try to staunch that kind of haemorrhage by providing a plethora of action plans, investments, studies, subsidies and cheap loans in an attempt to strengthen regional business and also attract foreign companies to set up in the Basque Country. SPRI will provide up to Pta1.2m per job created in subsidy to participating companies which guarantee the creation of a minimum of 50 jobs and invest at least Pta500m of their own. For companies which create between 50 and 500 jobs, with investments of between Pta500m and Pta4bn, it will subsidise up to 40 per cent of the investment. SPRI can also arrange tax exemptions for up to 45 per cent of new investments for existing companies and up to 100 per cent of corporation tax for new companies for a period of 10 years. It will subsidise up to 58 per cent of qualifying research and development programmes and up to 100 per cent of training plans. And to encourage foreign investment, SPRI has set up outposts in nine other nations, including the US and Japan. But the spirit of mutual assistance does not stop with government support. Elkargi, founded in 1980 and with 639 member companies in 1981, is now an association of more than 6,000 Basque companies. Elkargi's main purpose is to take financial risks which large commercial banks are unhappy with, by acting as a guarantor of loans made by the banks to small and medium sized companies. From guaranteed loans of Pta633m in 1981, the association in 1992 provided guarantees for Pta9.8bn, with a bad debt rate of 1.45 per cent of all guarantees made. What of the immediate future? For Mr Jose Urchegui, general secretary of Adegi, the employers' association of the Gipuizcoa, with 1,600 member companies representing 60,000 employees, the urgent need is to increase within the Basque country's companies a sense of the importance of thinking not just nationally but globally - and to ensure that tomorrow's employees have received the best training possible. To that end Adegi has been instrumental in a highly innovative educational-training scheme called the Machine-Tool Institute, sited at Elgoibar, some 55 kilometres from Bilbao. The institute - funded entirely by local companies - takes school-leavers from throughout Spain and provides them with a sophisticated apprenticeship in advanced machine-tool technology, as well as language courses and business administration training. It has some 400 students but by running courses of different lengths it reckons on about 1,000 students - full time and day release - passing through its doors each year. The institute's core aim is to ensure that the students receive hands-on training on the very latest equipment, thus maintaining the Basque Country's traditional strengths in machine-tools. Fifty per cent of Spain's machine tool production is exported, two-thirds of that to industrially developed countries such as the US, France and Germany, according to Mr Alberto Ortueta, general manager of the Spanish machine tool manufacturers' association. 'We don't have much in the way of natural resources in the Basque Country - we don't have minerals or mining. Our basic asset here is the human being,' says Mr Urchegui. 'What we are doing here is to try to make sure that professional training is not just a matter for the schoolroom but is also something which companies occupy themselves with. The Machine-Tool Institute is an experiment, the result of an agreement between the business sector and the Basque government. There are companies here which need particular types of trained staff yet cannot find them amongst school-leavers.'</p>

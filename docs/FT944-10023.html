			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses quiet ahead of FOMC meeting Bourses seemed studiously intent on avoiding much change in index levels with Washington's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and the decision on US interest rates coming up next Tuesday, writes Our Markets Staff. Paris and Brussels were closed for Armistice Day, and Warsaw for National Day. FRANKFURT, once again, had little to cheer about. Thursday afternoon's rise on short covering was set aside as the Dax index fell 4.05 to 2,078.35 on the session, against the previous post-bourse close of 2,098.04. Turnover fell from DM5.7bn to DM5bn. The key index slipped further after hours to end at 2,073.67. For the second week in succession, it was only fractionally higher over five days. Over 24 hours, the main weakness was in cyclicals and the relative strength in one or two banks and defensive stocks. In chemicals, Bayer and Hoechst lost DM4.50 to DM344.50 and DM5.40 to DM325.60 respectively; in automotive stocks Daimler fell DM12.20 to DM766 and Continental, the tyremaker, by DM4 to DM219. Weakness in engineers coincided with the statement from the metal employers association, Gesamtmetall, that some 40 per cent of its companies were still making losses in the current year against 45 per cent last year. Mannesmann dropped DM8 to DM398.50, and Thyssen by DM5.80 to DM288.20. Dealers noted buyers for Commerzbank, the only Dax constituent which closed higher after hours, with a rise of DM1.80 to DM322.80. Dresdner Bank slipped DM7.50 to DM407 on a television report which alleged, against vigorous denials from the bank, that Dresdner advised its clients to invest their capital in Luxembourg, avoiding German taxes in the process. AMSTERDAM declined on broadly-based selling, partly engendered by Unilever's third quarter results which came in at the lower end of most analysts' expectations. The AEX index was trimmed by 3.05 to 407.69, leaving it off 0.7 per cent on the week. The multinational consumer goods group saw its shares slip Fl 1.20 to Fl 199.70 after reporting a rise in third quarter net profit of 9 per cent to Fl 1.23bn, against a market consensus of about Fl 1.3bn. The negative tone here spilled over into other heavyweight blue chips, with Royal Dutch, for example, down Fl 1.00 to Fl 188.00 and Philips falling by the same amount to Fl 52.50 on sustained US selling. Kleinwort Benson issued a sell note on Royal Dutch after the group's slightly disappointing third quarter figures earlier in the week. The broker said that it preferred Petrofina, Repsol and OMV in continental Europe. ZURICH eased slightly, but the 2.34 fall to 2,597.8 in the SMI index still left it 2.2 per cent higher on the week. Mr Frederick Hasslauer at Bank Sal Oppenheim in Zurich said that the bourse was still enjoying the re-rating of Swiss Re, whose move out of direct insurance, concentration on core businesses and the implicit attack on costs had lifted the registered shares by around 40 per cent since the move was announced at the end of September. Swiss Re rose another SFr28 to SFr811 yesterday and other insurers came along for the ride, with Winterthur SFr15 higher at SFr685. In pharmaceuticals, the mood was still good following the Republican victory in the US elections, but for Roche certificates, down SFr80 at SFr5,810, the celebrations went into reverse for the second day in succession. STOCKHOLM endeavoured to make headway, but trading was subdued ahead of this Sunday's vote on whether or not the country will join the European Union, with opinion polls suggesting that the result will be very close. The Affarsvarlden general index added 3.30 to 1,464.30, a week's rise of 1.5 per cent. Turnover was SKr2.7bn. Activity was stimulated by Astra's nine-month results which exceeded market expectations. The B shares were unchanged at SKr191, after a session high of SKr194. Salomon Brothers, in a major report on the drug group released yesterday, commented that Astra benefited, among other things, from low exposure to patent expiry, with no major product patents due to expire before 1999. In contrast Pharmacia Bs lost SKr6 to SKr127 in reaction to disappointing results on Thursday, and subsequent brokers' downgrades. OSLO was helped by a fall in domestic interest rates, although trading was dulled ahead of the Swedish referendum since the result is likely to influence Norway's own poll on EU membership due later this month. The All share index showed a rise of 1.4 to 598.1.

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / US report on BCCI likely tocriticise Bank of England THE CONDUCT of the Bank of England is expected to be severely criticised today in an 800-page report on the Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandal to be released in the US Senate. The report, which follows a four-year investigation led by Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, will pre-empt some of the findings of the still unpublished UK report on BCCI by Lord Bingham. Yesterday, Mr Kerry said: 'We've known for a while that the BCCI scandal would turn out to be the biggest example of financial crime in recent memory, but it also demonstrates a grotesque network of greed and influence.' Others who are expected to be criticised in the report include the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholders of the collapsed BCCI, and Price Waterhouse, the bank's auditor. Abu Dhabi has been repeatedly criticised by Mr Kerry and US prosecutors for its withholding of documents and witnesses from US authorities. Last week Abu Dhabi's Washington lobbyists claimed Abu Dhabi was now co- operating with the US. Abu Dhabi's Washington representatives said that 19,000 pages of BCCI-related documents would be made available to US authorities, but US officials will not be allowed to take physical possession of them and will be permitted only to review them at the Washington embassy of the United Arab Emirates. Separately, it has been learnt that US officials are investigating the role of Abu Dhabi in the BCCI affair. Abu Dhabi has always described itself as a victim of the BCCI fraud and has said it lost billions of dollars as a result of the scandal. British Foreign Office officials are understood to have been trying to monitor the timing of the Kerry report's release in recent weeks; the report has been delayed by one week past its originally scheduled publication date. UK officials are understood to have been especially worried that the report might have been released during the World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington last week. Mr Kerry, whose Senate sub-committee has held 14 public hearings and one closed session on BCCI over the past four years, has made use of the testimony of dozens of witnesses and several hundred thousand pages of documents for the report. Senator Hank Brown, the Republican who was joint author of the report, said it was a powerful example 'of the way governments around the world sometimes don't work'. Mr Brown said that in the US BCCI had 'circumvented our banking system, slipped past our federal law enforcement system, facilitated drug trafficking and attempted to use the revolving door of Washington politics to escape capture'.</p>

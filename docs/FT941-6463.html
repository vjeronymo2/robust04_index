			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Russian accused of selling Britain defence secrets Russia yesterday announced it had arrested a Russian armaments official for passing on defence secrets to Britain, writes Leyla Boulton from Moscow. The Itar-Tass news agency said an unnamed Russian citizen had 'on assignment of British intelligence for monetary reward . . . collected and handed over information of a secret military and economic nature'. It said he had been supplied with invisible writing materials and means of secretly supplying information to intelligence agents at the British embassy in Moscow. A Russian official later identified the man as the manager of a state-owned company called Special Machine Building and Metallurgy, which specialises in military armour and artillery. Itar-Tass said he was arrested on January 15 and charged on January 25 with 'high treason in the form of espionage'. Only two days after promising western financial institutions that it remained wedded to financial austerity, the Russian government was yesterday arguing over whether to pump trillions of roubles into ailing coal mines as a panacea for problems which its radical predecessors had vowed to tackle by freeing coal prices and restructuring the industry. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, also ordered new subsidies for young children and single mothers and spending increases on Russian officials and new consulates in former Soviet republics.</p>

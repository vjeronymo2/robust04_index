			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata on Monday [30 May] called for economic assistance  to isolationist North Korea to stabilize the country and to help  defuse the tension over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons  program.    "We can make plenty of efforts to improve the standard of  living in North Korea. I would like to ask you to open your  hearts," Hata told an interpellation session in the House of  Representatives Budget Committee.    He stressed, however, that Japan should tie up with the  United States, South Korea and China to discuss a response to  the breakdown of negotiations between the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) and North Korea.    IAEA inspectors left Pyongyang on Saturday after being  denied  an opportunity to take samples from spent fuel rods, discharged  from North Korea's 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, to verify  whether nuclear material has been diverted in the past.    The United Nations Security Council, which has the power to  impose sanctions to enforce the IAEA request, is slated to  discuss this latest development in the longstanding nuclear  controversy Tuesday.    Speaking at the same lower house budget panel, Foreign  Minister Koji Kakizawa said that the UN nuclear watchdog,  nonetheless, continues unofficial talks with Pyongyang over the  monitoring of the fuel rod exchange and full inspections of the  country's nuclear facilities.    "The IAEA after its pullout is continuing (negotiations),  though it is not possible to say publicly where and with whom,"  Kakizawa said.    The U.S., South Korea and other Western nations allege that  North Korea is attempting to build atomic weapons.    North Korea claims its nuclear program pursues strictly  civilian purposes, but has repeatedly refused to comply with  nuclear safeguard accords it signed with the agency.</p>

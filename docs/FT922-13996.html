			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / German parties shun compromise HOPES of early cross-party co-operation to resolve Germany's pressing political problems faded yesterday. Just three days after government and opposition had been stunned by far-right gains in two state elections, leaders of the ruling Christian Democrats (CDU) and opposition Social Democrats (SPD) retreated to their former entrenched positions. While Chancellor Helmut Kohl repeated his offer of 'relevant' discussions with the SPD, Mr Bjorn Engholm, the opposition leader, laid down rigid conditions, and party officials on both sides muddied prospects further. Mr Kohl said in cabinet yesterday that he wanted to start talks immediately after Easter with SPD leaders at federal and state level, including mayors, to clear the way for necessary changes to the constitution, and a redistribution of the costs of unification. 'The voters have made clear that they now expect rapid solutions to pressing political problems,' he told the cabinet. Constitutional change was needed, he said, to help stem the flood of asylum-seekers into Germany and the European Community. It was also necessary to allow the ratification of the Maastricht treaty on political and monetary union. He also wanted to discuss the indispensable restructuring of federal finances to help fund recovery in the former East Germany. Mr Engholm said that before he would consider talks, he wanted to see full information on the current state of federal finances, and a detailed concept for the economic future of the country. He also demanded that only state prime ministers should be invited. Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, the SPD parliamentary leader, meanwhile, said the party was prepared to talk only if it could take an active part in policy formulation, and stood firmly by the established party line of no change in the constitution. Tempers rose again over the issue of asylum-seekers, 400,000 of whom are expected in Germany this year, according to Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister. There were calls for the resignation of Mr Erich Riedl, state secretary in the economics ministry, after he called for a suburb of Munich to be declared 'a refugee-free zone'. Further evidence of the lapse back into the familiar pattern of paralysis was provided by SPD officials who yesterday denounced a package of tax reliefs on unearned income, detailed weeks ago, as 'unconstitutional'. Mrs Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, the opposition European spokeswoman, meanwhile, further stirred up the debate on Maastricht, saying the party would block the automatic move into monetary union, planned for later this decade.</p>

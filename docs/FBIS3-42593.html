			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA staff correspondent Nikolay </F> Kireyev, Tula: "Smugglers Are Revealing Incognito Who Is  Discrediting the Profitable Contracts of Russian Weapons Makers"]    [Text] At the end of last year, given in a number of  sectors of the mass media as a sensational item was the report  about the fact that members of the Main Administration for  Combating Economic Crimes of the MVD RF [Russian Federation  Ministry of Internal Affairs], together with their colleagues  from the St. Petersburg service, "stopped an attempt by foreign  commercial structures to export illegally 21,000 Makarov pistols  and 4.5 million combat cartridges." What followed later was even  more curious: "In order to make unlicensed shipments of weapons,  the smugglers had drawn up phony documents for the pistols and  ammunition, assigning them to the category of hunting and  sporting items."    Having read in the newspaper and heard on radio and  television such information which, in its time frames, coincided  with the visit of President B.N. Yeltsin to Tula and its defense  enterprises, I immediately began to seek out the "guilty  parties" among the weapons and ammunition makers.    It turned out that, back in November, V. Shiryayev, the  general manager of an ammunition plant, had sent a memorandum  addressed to O. Soskovets: "Dear Oleg Nikolayevich. The AO  [Joint-Stock Company] Tula Ammunition Plant is one of the  largest producers of small-arms cartridges in Russia. As a  result of conversion in the years 1989-1992, the output of  various products has been curtailed by 50-100 percent. In order  to find additional financial resources for conversion needs, in  1993, the company started producing sporting and hunting  cartridges intended to be fired from Russian-made and  foreign-made sports pistols: IZh-70, IZh-75, Parabellum,  Brunner, Walther, Luger, and Beretta. Testing of the cartridges  and their certification have been conducted in full conformity  with the requirements of the standards and regulations of  Gosstandart RF [Committee on Standardization, Metrology and  Certification]. These cartridges are being produced solely for  export shipments and conform to international specifications and  world-class analogs."    "The plant's specialists have studied the sales markets. As  a  result, contracts have been signed with the largest firms of the  USA, Canada, Germany and Austria for the delivery in 1993-1994  of sporting and hunting ammunition in the amount of 350 million  rounds at a price of $20 million, American."    "At the present time, 10 million rounds have already been  shipped to one of the American firms, which has sent us the  end-use certificate issued by the U.S. State Department.  However, as of 14 September, 1993, the shipping of sporting and  hunting ammunition has been stopped at the request of the RF  State Customs Committee [GTK RF]. Despite the authorization of  the RF State Committee on the Defense Industry of 9 November  1993, and MVES RF [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] of 10  November 1993, the AO Tula Ammunition Plant is carrying out the  exporting of sporting and hunting ammunition without licenses  and without the approval of the RF State Customs Committee."    "The company is incurring direct losses from the exporting  ban in the amount of $275,600, and from the non-execution of  contracts during the fourth quarter in the amount of $1,285,930."    "I earnestly request that you instruct the State Customs  Committee to give our company authorization to export sporting  and hunting ammunition without having to obtain a license. This  would make it possible not only to straighten out the  enterprise's financial situation, to develop the production of  products capable of competing in the world market, to maintain a  mobilization potential and to retain highly skilled specialists,  but also to enrich Russia's treasury significantly."    Attached to the memorandum was an addendum:    "In conformity with Decree No 854 of the RF Government of 6  November 1992, the exporting and importing of sport and hunting  weapons and ammunition for them shall be carried out without a  license from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations,  as well as on the basis of the RF Law "On Weapons" of 20 May,  1993 (Articles 5 and 17):    "1. The Tula Ammunition Plant shall be authorized to export  sporting and hunting ammunition... to do this without a license  from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations.    "2. It shall be established that a decision on matters  involving the exporting of sporting and hunting ammunition shall  be made after the exporter has submitted to the RF Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations the contracts and their accompanying  documents and they are examined by an Interdepartmental Council  of the interested ministries.    "I.S. Materov, RF deputy minister of foreign economic  relations.    "Yu.N. Starodub, deputy chairman of the RF State Committee  on  the Defense Industry."    After familiarizing himself with these documents, O.  Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the government, passes a  resolution:    "To the RF State Customs Committee (A.S. Kruglov),    "I request that you consider and give approval within the  framework of the existing legislation."    This was on 7 December 1993. And, after a few days, the  printed and electronic mass media informed the world about the  fact that "contraband has been seized."    "And who will have dealings with us after this?" V.  Shiryayev  asks with righteous indignation. "I do not know who would profit  from bringing us to our knees. The government leaders are on our  side. Even the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. The Main  Rocket and Artillery Directorate has concluded that the  cartridges we sold are not combat ones, but ones with lead  cores. The entire world trades in such `slippery items.' For us,  however -- this is a no-no! It is unthinkable that, in caring  about the honor of the dress coat, any one should forget about  its cleanliness."    It is hard to disagree with one of the oldest and most  experienced defense industry workers. It is fitting to recall  that, in 1988, there was established in our country a powerful  industry for the production of ammunition, which was equipped  with unique domestic equipment automatic rotor and  rotor-conveyor lines. As a result of conversion, the production  of various types of cartridges has been curtailed by factors of  10-18, which has led to a sharp decrease in funds and the flight  of skilled personnel. The specialists associate the retreat from  traditional sales markets precisely with the production cutback.    In order to look for practical ways of preventing the  sector's collapse, it is necessary to engage in selling  ammunition for civilian use abroad. We have entered a market  which is the most promising and prestigious for Russia -- the  USA, where, annually, the retail trade network sells from 9 to  14 million rounds of ammunition, which are produced not only by  American firms, but are also imported from China, the Czech  Republic, Slovakia and Poland. While our cartridges remain out  of the running. But, apparently, someone does not like this: he  says, let the ammunition makers continue to produce bicycle  chains, photo enlargers, toys and thermoses. Let them cram the  warehouses with finished products. Let a mighty sector perish.    It turns out that, now, even the arguments of the president  of Russia may be ignored. Not to mention the first deputy prime  minister.</p>

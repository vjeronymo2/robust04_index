			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Slovak leader tightens grip on his party THE Slovak prime minister, Mr Vladimir Meciar, has emerged stronger within his own party but more isolated from former political allies after a two-day conference of his governing Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). The first post-independence congress at Trnava near Bratislava endorsed the sacking of his foreign and economics ministers and backed Mr Meciar's ambiguous promise of 'carefully managed and controlled' market reforms. Mr Meciar was re-elected party chairman with 183 votes against the 41 received by his main rival, Mr Milan Knazko, the ousted foreign minister. He said the government had no alternative but to carry out sweeping reforms of the financial and tax systems, public administration, health, education and the labour market during the next two years. He gave no details of actual reform proposals but said 'the transformation (to a market economy) may be achieved in two years. It is an enormous task, but it will be accomplished.' Mr Meciar who has seen his rating in opinion polls decline sharply from 34 per cent in January to 25 per cent this month, remains the most powerful politician in Slovakia. But he badly needs to bolster the image of an inexperienced government further depleted by the departure of two senior ministers last week. Mr Ludovit Cernak, economy minister, resigned citing a series of disagreements with Mr Meciar, while Mr Knazko, with whom the prime minister has had bitter public rows, was sacked. Mr Cernak's departure is the more serious blow at a time of growing uncertainty about the future of government economic policy and pressure on the currency. The leader of the Slovak National party, he was also the only cabinet member not belonging to Mr Meciar's HZDS, which will now have to assume sole responsibility for the government's actions.</p>

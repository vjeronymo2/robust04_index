On Monday, a jury acquitted the businessman of conspiring to fix the 1983 Bunbury Cup, but found him guilty of perverting the course of justice by paying Mr Danny Hobby, a former jockey, around ADollars 500,000 (Pounds 240,000) to stay out of Australia and the reach of investigating police. Mr Connell has said he will appeal.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Railways Diversify To Absorb Extra </F> Labour"]    [Text] Railway authorities have successfully absorbed  surplus labourers by diversifying their business dealings.    Since 1986, nearly 220,000 workers--6.5 per cent of all  staff--laid off as a result of the Railway Ministry's recent  efficiency drive have been moved to new services such as tourism  and catering.    Minister Han Zhubin termed the multi-industry wave as "an  effective way" to improve the sector's efficiency and digest  surplus workers from its 3.4 million employees.    "Unwieldy labour forces and low labour productivity leaves  us  far behind the world's advanced level", he said on Thursday,  vowing to divert 600,000 more workers from rail transport by the  turn of the century.    The ministry's diversification has created 330,000 jobs in  travel agencies, commerce and trade, tourism, catering,  advertising, construction and mining.    But the minister reiterated the ban on businesses run by any  railway security, procurators, judicial bodies or railway  functional department.    "This is to prevent power abuse, and let grass-roots rail  departments focus energy on shipping and safety," he explained.    The minister also warned against illegal trade of freight  cargo or train tickets under the disguise of diversified  business. This has hurt the railways image over the past two  years.    "We are tightening check-up and supervision over those  engaged in transport agencies. Both their service items and  charges must be rational and legal," he stressed.    A special agency has been set up to promote and oversee the  sector's diversified operation.    "We want a fast development of diversified operation, but it  shall be on a healthy and legal track," the minister said.</p>

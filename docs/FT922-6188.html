			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Security-aware design urged for buildings POLICE yesterday launched a campaign to incorporate crime prevention into the design of commercial buildings. Secured by Design, an initiative that orginally applied only to new residential properties, has been extended to new and renovated commercial properties. Last year there were 550,000 commercial and 600,000 domestic burglaries, but police say that simple measures, such as good lighting for footpaths and car parks, can deter burglars. Developers are to be encouraged to consult police crime prevention experts at an early stage and to incorporate security features in building specifications. Properties that meet police guidelines can then be marketed using the Secured by Design logo as a selling point. Advice from police architectural liaison officers will be free, and the publicity campaign is being sponsored by lock-makers and other providers of security equipment. Crime-prevention officers recommended that even the layout of an estate, whether commercial or residential, should be planned with security in mind. Barriers should create well defined 'defensible space' around estates and individual properties.</p>

Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 19 (CNA) -- Taiwan has won the right  to host an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) seminar on  trade promotion and financing of small and medium sized  enterprises Jan. 18-21, 1995, the government reported Saturday  [19 March].    Lin Yi-fu, deputy director of the Board of Foreign Trade  (BOFT) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said that nearly  60 delegates from the 17 APEC members, including Mainland China,  are expected to attend the meeting.    Discussion will focus on export-import loans, financial  planning, and the development of small and medium sized  businesses, Lin pointed out.    To prepare for the 1995 seminar, a task force comprising  officials from the BOFT, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the  China External Trade Development Council, and the China  Productivity Center will be formed. Lin will head the task  force.    Observers here noted that Taiwan is well qualified to host  the meeting as its successful experience in the development of  small and medium sized enterprises has won recognition from the  international community.    Taiwan should also bid to host an APEC ministerial level  meeting on small and medium sized businesses, the observers  suggested.    The first APEC ministerial level meeting in this regard will  be held in Tokyo early October. Economic Affairs Minister P.K.  Chiang will represent Taiwan at the meeting.    Meanwhile, Wu Jong-yi, president of the private Taiwan  Institute of Economic Research, said that he helped promote  Taiwan's bid to host an APEC senior officials' meeting in Taipei.    Wu made the remark late Friday prior to his departure for  Kuala Lumpur, where he will join 12 other delegates from the  United States, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, the  Philippines, Thailand, Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Hong Kong,  and Mainland China at a senior officials' meeting March 19-20.    APEC is scheduled to hold four senior officials' meetings  this year. The second meeting will take place in Hong Kong in  early June and Taiwan hopes to host the third or fourth meeting,  Wu said.    The Kuala Lumpur meeting will focus on the liberalization of  global trade, he added.</p>

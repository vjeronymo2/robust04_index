			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Grandeurs et servitudes Defence planning is one of the most difficult activities that any government has to engage in. The lead times involved are very long, especially when new weapons systems have to be designed, tested, commissioned and deployed, a process that can take up to 20 years. Yet defence postures have to respond to international circumstances which can change very rapidly, as the last five years have spectacularly demonstrated. When, as in this case, the change takes the form of a sudden diminution, indeed virtual disappearance, of the main threat which a country's defences had been designed to meet, a wise government will not respond precipitately by slashing its defence budget, but will take time to assess the new situation and think through its implications. Judged by that standard, the French government has been wiser than most of its allies. The defence white paper it published yesterday was in fact the first since 1972, and purports to assess France's strategic priorities up to the year 2010. Even now it does not involve explicit choices about military spending: those will come in a five-year 'loi de programmation', to be presented in the spring. Unhappy memories The contrast with the British procedure is striking. Since 1989, the British government has resisted pressure for a formal 'defence review' (a phrase which brings back unhappy memories of successive rounds of cuts in the 1960s and 1970s). But that did not stop it rushing out, in 1990, a document entitled 'Options for Change' - misleadingly, since instead of offering a range of options it imposed a fixed menu of cuts which were unmistakably 'Treasury-driven', rather than a considered response to a new strategic situation. The inconvenience of this method was all too well illustrated yesterday when the government, introducing the third and final phase of the cuts, found itself obliged to send redundancy notices to men serving in Bosnia, a few days after it had turned down their British commander's request for reinforcements on the grounds that there are no more troops to spare. The French white paper is comparable in conception to the 'Bottom-Up Review' published last September by the ill-fated US defence secretary, Mr Les Aspin, though it attempts to look even further ahead, and is in some ways more radical. It begins by conceding that 'for the first time in history, there is no direct threat to French frontiers', but seeks to convince the French public that there are nonetheless real dangers affecting the security of Europe as a whole, to which France must, with its allies and partners, be able to respond. Symbolic legacies It does not propose either to scrap France's independent nuclear deterrent or to go back into Nato's integrated command. Thus the two great symbolic legacies of Charles de Gaulle are preserved. Yet, in a passage which certainly owes more to the present incumbent of the Elysee than to the founder of the fifth republic, it does envisage, at least hypothetically, a future when 'vital European interests, understood as such by Europeans and others', may make it possible to work out a 'European nuclear doctrine'; and it does acknowledge Nato as 'the main defence organisation', whose meetings can be attended on an ad hoc basis by French defence ministers and chiefs of staff, notably when peacekeeping or, as Nato now calls them, 'peace support' operations are involved. Thus does doctrine catch up with and legitimise recent practice. But armies do not live by doctrine alone. Mr Aspin's Bottom-Up Review was an honest and lucid document, but congressional experts doubt whether the money will be found for forces of the size it implicitly calls for. Similarly, French economists and parliamentarians have noted that, large as it is, the French defence budget does not cover the cost of all the weapons systems now planned or in production. The real political test for Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister, will come with the loi de programmation; and the test of France's European commitment will come when its partners ask for the right for their companies to tender for French defence contracts, or to acquire equity in French defence companies.</p>

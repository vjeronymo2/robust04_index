			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Islamic Bomb--the Real U.S. Fear"] </F>   [Text] Three U.S. Senators addressed a press conference  together in Islamabad. The famous Senator Larry Pressler, whose  amendment is being used mercilessly in Pakistan for the last two  years and who is a living example of U.S. narrow mindedness,  unfairness, anti-Muslim attitude, and swindles, was also there.  The peculiarity of this law is that while dozens of countries in  the world have nuclear bombs, it is implemented only against  Pakistan. India has nuclear weapons as does Israel. Russia has  nuclear weapons as do many European countries. However, the  United States did stop economic or military aid to any of these  countries while demanding that they roll back their nuclear  programs, open up their nuclear installations for inspection,  and sign a unilateral agreement on nuclear nonproliferation. All  these conditions under the Pressler Amendment apply to Pakistan  only. Why? Just because Pakistan is a Muslim country! Since  Israel, Russia, and India are not Islamic nations, the United  States does not impose these strict rules on them. Does not this  create enmity toward Muslims and, according to the favorite U.S.  definition, make the United States a fundamentalist itself?  However, the United States stubbornly continues to accuse  Pakistan and other Islamic countries of fundamentalism. These  countries just love their national independence and want the  world to respect them.    Mr. Larry Pressler was asked at the Islamabad press  conference why the Pressler Amendment was implemented only  against Pakistan. Is it not unfair to single out one nation in  the world and accuse it? Mr. Larry Pressler spat out the truth  in his response. This is part of the usual U.S. policy which is  not admitted to at the diplomatic level. Mr. Pressler said that  during the 1980s there was information in the media that an  `Islamic bomb' was being made and its technical knowledge could  be transferred from one nation to another.    Yes! This is the real fear and all these efforts are being  made to stop it. Campaigns are launched against Muslim  countries. They are surrounded after being accused of  fundamentalism, and they are being deprived of their rights in  the international brotherhood like second-class members. Their  national autonomy is challenged at every step. At times, Iran is  accused of terrorism and at other times the Sudanese government  is censured by calling it a military dictatorship. They ask why  General Abdul Bashir is experimenting with establishing an  Islamic form of government? Plans to divide up Sudan and create  a Christian country from within it are approved so that  anti-Islamic forces could use this place as their base. The  establishment of Muslim rule following the democratic process in  Algeria is being objected to because the Islamic Salvation Front  might come to power using the slogan of an Islamic form of  government. The United States, which opposes military  dictatorship in Sudan on principle, becomes a champion and  supporter of a military dictatorship that is against democracy  there. When Pakistan takes the path of self-dependence in  defense, its efforts at self-dependence are opposed and labeled  as efforts to make the Islamic bomb. It is threatened with being  called a terrorist nation, its elected government is overthrown  under a conspiracy, and a government headed by persons of its  own liking is installed there. The Islamic world never called  these actions Christian fundamentalism. Instead, we used  political definitions and called it American colonialism. We did  not denounce it using some religious terms.    As soon as Larry Pressler told the truth and explained the  real reason behind the Pressler Amendment, Senator Brown, the  other senator present in that press conference, denied the idea  of an Islamic bomb by saying that there is no such thing as the  Islamic bomb. The United States is just trying to stop the  spread of nuclear weapons, and is not doing that because of a  preference for any religion. It is not focusing on Pakistan; it  tries to check nuclear weapons anywhere in the world where it  knows they exist.    In our opinion, Mr. Brown's explanation was an effort to  cover up. The U.S. policy is not what Mr. Brown tells us; it is  what Mr. Pressler has explained to us. Pakistan has to accept  Mr. Pressler's definition of U.S. policy because the law is  based on Mr. Pressler's definition, and not on the one that  follows the policy explained by Mr. Brown. If Mr. Brown's  definition was correct and the United States is not just trying  to stop the Islamic bomb, it would have put similar pressure on  dozens of non-Muslim countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and  South America that have become nuclear powers during the last  two decades. No restrictions were imposed even on India under  the Pressler Amendment. Israel, South Africa, Brazil, and  European nations have the full freedom; pressure is being put  only on Pakistan.    Mr. Pressler argues that Pakistan's bomb could get into the  hands of Iraq or Libya any time. This is a product of a  prejudiced Jewish or Christian mind. They are worried about  proliferation of weapons from one country to another, but they  do not remember that it was the United States itself that had  installed those missiles loaded with nuclear weapons in many  places in Europe under the NATO agreement. These missiles are  capable of putting more than half the world to the sleep of  death in one second. The senator, from a country that has been  planning this dangerous game of weapons of massacre for the last  40 years and is credited with dropping the only two atomic bombs  deployed in history on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, killing hundreds  of thousands of people, should be embarrassed when he states  that Pakistani bombs could reach Iraq or Libya and cause world's  destruction. The United States should first wipe out the stigma  of the largest massacre of human life in Nagasaki and Hiroshima.  This U.S. attitude is making the Muslims angry. The results will  not be good. No country remains victorious or vanquished forever.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 4 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and China hold  working-level fisheries talks in Beijing next week to decide  whether to revise or extend an agreement on handling sea  accidents, the Foreign Ministry said Saturday.    The June 8-10 talks, the second of their kind, will cover  conclusion of a bilateral fisheries agreement and protecting  fish stocks, ministry officials said.    Seoul and Beijing have an agreement, which has been in  effect  since July 1, 1990, and was signed by their private sectors, on  handling sea accidents. The two sides will have to decide  whether to revise parts of this agreement or extend it in its  present form, the officials said.</p>

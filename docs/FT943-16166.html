			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / OECD endorses criticism of Pergau The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has given a cautious formal endorsement to domestic criticism of the UK's use of aid to Malaysia to help build the Pergau dam. In a report on the UK's aid programme, published yesterday, the OECD endorses last October's National Audit Office criticisms of the government for approving aid for Pergau against the overwhelming advice of civil servants. The report says: 'The British government operates its aid programme alongside diverse foreign policy and commercial interests. Conflicts of objectives can arise on occasion, as in the case of the Pergau project.' The much-delayed report by the OECD's development assistance committee raises concern about Pergau to an international level. The committee considers Pergau to have vindicated its previous reports criticising Britain's aid-and-trade provision, which is supposed to support development pro-jects of value to British industry. The report pinpoints criticisms of ATP by non-government aid organisations: That it creates a conflict of objectives between the commercial need for quick decisions and the need for full appraisals of the social, environmental and economic aspects of the proposal. That it benefits affluent countries disproportionately, diverting aid from the poorest. That ATP projects distort development planning and country strategies because they are identified by commercial interests. That ATP projects, because they are concentrated in a few sectors, create a vested interest and a lobby which 'may not always give as high a priority to development as aid officials might wish'. The aid and trade rules were changed last year so that a country as prosperous as Malaysia could no longer qualify for British bilateral aid.</p>

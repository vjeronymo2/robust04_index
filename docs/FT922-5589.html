			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Arts: Sviatoslav Richter The pianist was scheduled to give two recitals in London's Festival Hall this week, as part of a British tour which has taken him to Oxford (where he was awarded an honorary doctorate) and which also includes Harrogate, Birmingham, Cheltenham and Aldeburgh. Sunday's programme of Bach and Brahms was cancelled at three hours' notice - the pianist was suffering from heat exhaustion. However, on Wednesday he did appear, playing to a darkened auditorium as he always does nowadays, his scores spread before him and illuminated by a single lamp. Richter is 77; the stern, measured platform manner has not wavered. He has always been the most introspective of pianists, but, if anything, his playing appears to have become even more inward-looking and intimate over the years. It is less concerned than ever with projecting grand dramatic schemes, much more focused on a minutely nuanced exploration of phrase structure and expressive meaning. If his sheer technical power seems fractionally more effortful than in the past, the range of colour, touch and articulation remains unequalled. Haydn's F minor Andante con variazioni and Beethoven's Sonata Op. 110 made up the first half of Wednesday's programme. The Haydn was presented at a lithe, moderate pace - for this most Schubertian of Haydn's works one had half expected Richter to settle into his most leisurely Schubertian mode. Each half of the main theme was coloured and flecked with glistening detail, the tiniest of rhythmic emphases, and there was never any doubt about the point and purpose of every single phrase. The sonata offered countless points for contemplation, especially the weighty, deliberate tempo for the scherzo, certainly not the allegro molto of standard usage, yet chiming precisely with the pulsing accompaniment to the main theme of the following Adagio, and the extraordinary, unearthly progression, half muffled, half percussive, that marked the mid-point of the final fugue, in which every voice had its own colour, character and purpose. After the interval, Richter started with Chopin's Polonaise-Fantaisie in a performance almost entirely purged of rhetoric, as if conceived for a handful of friends in a quiet dacha, its focus switched entirely from heroic gestures to the meditations of its lyrical core. He then moved on through Skryabin to Debussy. The Skryabin performances (the two Mazurkas of Op. 40 and the Poeme-Nocturne Op. 61) were astonishing acts of re-creation, poetic fantasies that hardly seemed to touch solid ground for a moment. Debussy's L'Isle joyeuse was warmed into life with infinite patience, the edges of its rhythmic shapes gradually hardened, the colours moving from indistinct greys to bright primaries. More Debussy was offered as an encore: 'La cathedrale engloutie' from the first book of Preludes, a sequence of veiled perspectives, controlled with absolute precision. No one plays Debussy's piano music like Richter; no one combines his musical insights with the complete technical command to realise them exactly. But then, no one plays most of the piano repertory as he does, with such love and supreme intelligence.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSAL TO BAN LEAF BLOWERS  </P> <P> I commend you for acknowledging the negative impacts of leaf blowers ("It's  Time to Throttle Leaf Blowers," On California, by Robert A. Jones, Nov. 27).  Noise pollution is only one impact associated with leaf blowers that I have  coined the "mechanical devices from hell."  </P> <P> Leaf blowers also are the culprits of two other sources of air pollution. Their  two-cycle motors belch out blue smoke via the oil/gas mixture fuel. During the  deceptive process of cleaning an area they create substantial volumes of dust  that become airborne only to lodge in our respiratory systems.  </P> <P> Indian Wells has received a positive response to our recently enacted ordinance  banning their use. I can only hope that other cities follow this positive and  environmentally sound action.  </P> <P> PHILIP A. MANUELL  </P> <P> City Councilman, Indian Wells  </P></p>

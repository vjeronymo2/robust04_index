			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, December 14 (XINHUA) -- Some 14 percent of  China is covered with forests, eight million hectares more than  five years ago.    Figures given by the Forestry Ministry today show that  China's forest area has been increasing at an annual growth rate  of 1.65 percent during the past five years.    The afforested area, totalling 33.79 million hectares, is  the  biggest in the world, figures from China's fourth forest  resources survey show.    China set up its national forest resources monitoring  network  in the early 1970s, which has now undertaken four surveys.    During this fourth one, from 1989-1993, the forest resources  growth rate was over 400 million cubic meters annually, a  quarter higher than the annual consumption rate of 320 million  cubic meters.    With progress in stopping destructive felling, Xu said, the  present problem lay in the low quality and low productivity of  the forests.    He said that the socialist market economy required better  capital management of the forestry resources which could be  realized as more state-owned forest-related enterprises become  joint-stock businesses.    Meanwhile, he said, the state was making new laws to give  the  forests more effective and stricter protection.</p>

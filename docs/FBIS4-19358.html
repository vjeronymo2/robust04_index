			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Youth Must Be Gotten Off Welfare and Into Job </F> Training and Education"]    [Text] When young people are being threatened with becoming  long-term unemployed before entering a career -- or even before  their first job -- it is not exaggerated to speak of an  emergency situation. The alternative is to implement newly  conceived measures for combatting unemployment. Finland cannot  afford to let thousands of 15- to 24-year-olds get used to  scraping a living from the welfare system while doing this and  that to keep busy.    Although 80,000 young people were moved into training  programs between last August and January of this year, the  number of their unemployed companions remained at 89,000, and  the percentage of youth unemployment rose to 40. This is a  horrendous figure that decisionmakers can no longer ignore.    Since the majority of young people are still interested in  finding a job or getting training, it is worthwhile to make  sacrifices to provide them the systems for obtaining these. A  few years from now it will otherwise be necessary to provide  rehabilitation and expensive therapies to create new self-esteem  and energy among those once displaced. The official view of a  growing demand for labor around the turn of the century is of no  assurance unless we can maintain the work abilities of youth.    A report prepared by the Prime Minister's Office entitled  "Alternative to Unemployment" offers the government and  parliament numerous measures to tackle this serious problem, if  the will is there. Jobs, training slots, apprenticeships, or  practicum places could be arranged for young people, but these  programs will all need money.    This first report, which contained a range of possible  measures, which was submitted in December, was rejected as being  too expensive, and those in the prime minister's chancellory  were told to make their proposals more specifically targeted.  The cost of the new three-year program they came up with trims  outlays from 8 to 4 billion [markkas], meaning a cut in training  and job slots by nearly half. Will these cuts be sufficient, or  will the package keep shrinking in new versions, as in the  proverbial snows of last winter?    The proposal of report drafters to increase the training  slots to over 30,000 is economically sound and reasonable. Since  employers would like to take on more trainees than their budgets  permit, and since job training interests youth lacking  vocational education, investing in this promises to be an  excellent use of funds.    There seems to be no better way to combat unemployment than  training. Training stimulates even better than public works. It  is labor-intensive and increases the market for many types of  products. Ever more complicated skills are demanded from  workers, and especially the ability to train in new ways. A  well-trained worker handles his job better than others and also  is better able to keep his job.    A work force with augmenting knowledge and skills is the  best  way to assure product quality and competitiveness. Society would  not want to see those having received its dearly paid resources  go back on the welfare roles. Even short employment periods can  maintain skills and be used to learn new ones, so that the  report's proposed 50,000 markkas for each job is more than  justified. If nothing is ventured, then neither can anything be  gained.</p>

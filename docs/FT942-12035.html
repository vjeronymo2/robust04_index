			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / BZW faces B&amp;C writs for Pounds 500m Ernst &amp; Young, administrators to financial services group British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings which collapsed in 1990, is suing Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the securities arm of Barclays Bank, for an amount expected to be well in excess of Pounds 500m. Writs have been issued against BZW for alleged negligence in advising B&amp;C on the takeover of Atlantic Computers in August 1988. The collapse of Atlantic in 1990 was instrumental in dragging down its parent company. B&amp;C bought Atlantic for Pounds 407m but was subsequently forced to write off Pounds 550m against the investment. Although E&amp;Y is not prepared to specify the amount it is seeking to recover  -a sum which, if it wins the case, will be awarded by the courts - standard procedure is to recover the cost of acquisition of the company with interest. The writs have yet to be served. BZW said it intended 'vigorously to defend these proceedings'. Barclays Bank, B&amp;C's largest creditor, wrote off Pounds 100m against expected losses from its lending to B&amp;C in its 1990 accounts. At the time the bank said the write-off took account of its exposure to the B&amp;C group as a whole, including Atlantic Computers. Barclays would not comment yesterday on further action. It is understood that E&amp;Y is considering taking further legal action against other parties involved in the takeover. These are understood to be against NM Rothschild, the merchant bank which advised B&amp;C over the Atlantic purchase, and against Atlantic Computers itself, understood to be for mis-representing its financial position. Two weeks ago Mr John Soden of Price Waterhouse, Atlantic's administrator, took pre-emptive action against a possible legal claim when he halted plans to pay creditors in June a first dividend of 16p in the pound. Price Waterhouse has served writs to indemnify the Atlantic administrators if the B&amp;C action is taken and succeeds.</p>

As Clinton decided last year, China  will only keep the trade privilege if it makes clear progress in  respecting human rights. Secretary of State Christopher will  come to Beijing on Friday [11 March] to point that out. If the  U.S. President deprived the PRC of most-favored-nation status,  this would badly hurt the Chinese economy. More than one-third  of China's exports goes to the United States. The U.S. market  is so important for the Chinese that it has recently been  possible to wrest significant trade policy concessions from them.    On the issue of human rights, however, only a few  concessions  have been made. The latest arrests of prominent dissidents and  the new religious laws shortly before Christopher's visit and  the session of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva have the  affect of a provocation. Beijing has rejected reproaches from  Western governments and accusations from human rights  organizations. It rejects a combination of trade and human  rights questions as interference in its internal affairs. The  Chinese Government refers to cultural differences and says that  other standards have to be applied in a developing country than  in industrial states. At the same time, it uses the attraction  of the big Chinese market to canvass for the most-favored-nation  status. If China is deprived of most-favored-nation status, the  U.S. economy will be hit more than that of China, Vice Premier  Zhu Rongji recently claimed in Japan.    The most important demands of the U.S. President are:  freedom  to leave the country and prevention of the export of goods  produced in prisons; access to political prisoners and  information on them; permitting foreign radio and television  programs in China; respect for Tibet's cultural and religious  heritage.    For the communist leadership it is a matter of national  "image" that one must not give in to U.S. pressure and tolerate  interference. Opinions on the extent of minor concessions  regarding human rights are divided. This conclusion can be  drawn from the present to-and-fro regarding arrests, releases,  statements, and denials. While party leaders who are prepared  for reforms are in favor of releasing selected dissidents and  other gestures of goodwill, the conservatives take action  against dissidents.    However, the behavior of the government can also be  explained  by domestic policy pressure. China is facing a change in  leadership. Judging from the latest pictures, old Deng Xiaoping  is no longer able to determine policies. One believes that his  days are numbered. In the critical transition period,  differences of opinion within the party are hushed up according  to the old-communist pattern to present a picture of unity to  the outside. At the same time, it is intended to prevent  opposition right from the start. In the party leadership, which  fears every political movement in China, however small it may  be, there is a general nervousness that goes beyond  parliamentary groups. The three arrested dissidents had planned  to send a petition to the National People's Congress in which  they advocated, above all, workers' rights. When they were  arrested, signatures for the petition were collected. So far, it  has not become known whether the arrests are only connected with  the petition or whether the three men whose arrests were  confirmed by the Chinese Government are also accused of other  things. The petition does not make any revolutionary demands.  The activists are saying that they are not doing anything that  violates Chinese laws.    However, the party leadership points out that in 1989 the  protests also started with open letters and a petition at the  time of the convention of the National People's Congress. One  month later, the students were demonstrating in the streets of  Beijing. It is unlikely that a political movement might  currently meet with such a response. However, the party does  not want to take any risk. Then considerations regarding  international repercussions of oppression recede into the  background.    Moreover, the Chinese Government doubts the U.S.  determination to really push through their conditions. China  knows that there is a strong economic lobby in the United States  that advocates the prolongation of most-favored-nation status.  The U.S. Government also gives different signals. While the  human rights commissioner discussed political oppression in  Beijing last week, an envoy of the U.S. Department of Commerce  tried at the same time to procure Chinese orders valued at  billions [currency not specified] for the U.S. economy.</p>

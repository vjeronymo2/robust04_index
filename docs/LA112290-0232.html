			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> THIS 'SHERLOCK HOLMES' STILL LIES DEAD ON TABLE  </P> <P> "Sherlock Holmes" is a creaky old melodrama that cries out for the  swashbuckling heroics of a matinee idol like William Gillette, for whom it was  created at the turn of the last century. Its current incarnation at the Newport  Theatre Arts Center is a hollow parody with neither a romantic heartbeat nor a  genuine comic sensibility.  </P> <P> Director John Alexander Lee force-feeds the geriatric script with bits of stagy  humor and some broad looks, but the body of the work still lies dead on the  table. Musical interludes that obviously are intended to be lively fall flat,  and the voice-over of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle drones through the scene changes  like so many commercial breaks.  </P> <P> Lee takes every opportunity to recapitulate the plot, which admittedly is  serpentine, but to no avail. The logic of the proceedings ultimately is  obliterated by the full-speed-ahead, clip-those-consonants style of the  performance, in which all moments are played at one unyielding speed and  volume.  </P> <P> A few of the performers manage to shine through the veneer. As the  damsel-in-distress, Debbie Grattan has a rich voice, a graceful bearing and  enough feeling for a proper heroine. The villainous Moriarty, played by Bruce  T. Campbell, musters an effectively lower-key delivery that oozes with disdain.  Lisa Marie Chiu is sweet-faced and unaffected as Terese, and Norm Eneim gives  his Billy some gusto.  </P> <P> Joe Kawaja has some delightful moments as the ever-ready and resourceful  assistant to Holmes, John Forman. Kawaja has created a character who is  enjoying himself -- and that enjoyment is the element most missing from the  performance of Ken Meyers as Sherlock Holmes. Meyers' Holmes is a heartless  patrician who plays at everything and seems bored by it all.  </P> <P> The beautiful sets with their period feel by Gil Morales and stylish costumes  by Lia M. Hansen are wasted on this unreconstructed fossil of a play.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'SHERLOCK HOLMES'  </P> <P> A production of the melodrama by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and William Gillette.

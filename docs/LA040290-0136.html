			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A WEALTH OF SECRETS;  </P> <P> RECLUSE MINDED HIS BUSINESS, AMASSED MILLIONS  </P> <P> Everett Reiten was a man of few words and even fewer revelations. When his  family found out shortly before his death last year at age 92 that the retired  Long Beach stockbroker had a fortune worth as much as $16 million, the news  came from a network television show, not Reiten.  </P> <P> So little did the hermit-like old man have to do with his millions that he  spent more than 50 years in Long Beach without owning so much as a car,  repeatedly wore the same nondescript clothes stuffed full of papers and  apparently lived for a time in a department store stockroom.  </P> <P> He took the bus from Southern California when he returned for the last time to  his tiny hometown in rural Wisconsin at the age of 85 and spent his final years  living with his elderly sister and her husband in a cluttered old house without  a telephone.  </P> <P> Devoted to thrift and Howard Hughes-like secrecy, Reiten's life became the  stuff of court documents after he died without a will last summer. The riches  he amassed with the help of painful frugality and stock in pet food will pass  to relatives he wouldn't even let into his rooms.  </P> <P> The 89-year-old sister and middle-aged nephew who will inherit Reiten's fortune  seem no more prepared to transform their simple lives with money than did  Reiten. With millions coming her way, the sister still doesn't have a  telephone. The nephew, who declined to be interviewed, told an investigator  that beyond seeing a tax accountant, he didn't have any particular plans for  the money and would continue building a house for his mother.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Reiten's former Long Beach stockbroker, Willard R. Walls Jr., stands  accused of taking advantage of his client's seeming indifference to wealth and  is scheduled to stand trial this week in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. He  has been indicted on a variety of federal charges alleging that he diverted  more than $400,000 from Reiten's accounts.  </P> <P> In the end, it took private investigators and the Orange County Public  Guardian's Office to prove that Reiten had achieved the pre-World War II  Midwesterner's dream of striking it rich in the golden light of Southern  California.  </P> <P> Reiten was a quiet loner who hated being photographed, never married and had no  known children. His only two known addresses during a half a century in Long  Beach were a now-demolished hotel on Ocean Boulevard and the downtown office  building where he worked for years as a stockbroker for a small Los  Angeles-based firm. He stayed so late in the office that people in the building  suspected that he lived there. Later Reiten told a stockbroker who handled one  of his accounts that he spent his nights in a storeroom in the old Buffum's  department store downtown.  </P> <P> "I don't know how he made so much money. He didn't have any personality," said  Charles C. Dodds, who for decades ran a barber shop on the same floor as  Reiten's office. Dodds remembers that Reiten didn't even look like a  stockbroker, much less a successful one.  </P> <P> In the small circle of Long Beach stockbrokers in the 1940s and '50s, there was  nothing extraordinary about Everett Reiten. "I would have thought he had  $15,000 or $16,000, not $16 million," mused Calvert Strong, a stockbroker who  also worked in Reiten's building.  </P> <P> A small man, Reiten walked around in his later years with The Wall Street  Journal or a bundle of financial papers stuffed inside his shirt or coat.  </P> <P> However unimpressive his persona, Reiten knew the stock market. Thomas Fagan, a  retired stockbroker who handled an account for Reiten at Paine Webber in the  1960s and 1970s, describes Reiten as very private, intelligent and extremely  knowledgeable about stocks -- even though Reiten never told Fagan that he had  been a stockbroker.  </P> <P> Instead, Reiten identified himself as an engineer or geologist from Minnesota.  He also kept strict tabs on his $200,000 to $300,000 account, telling Fagan  exactly what to invest in and always sticking to conservative investments.  Later, Reiten benefited enormously from the not-so-conservative portfolio  management of Walls, the retired Long Beach stockbroker who is accused of  swindling Reiten. Reiten's major stock holdings, heavy with Ralston Purina  shares, tripled in value in the 1980s.  </P> <P> Even in the months preceding his death last August, Reiten could rattle off  stock figures. "He was very alert and with it to the end," said Donna Goetsch,  a nurse at the Ashland, Wis., nursing home where Reiten spent the last 18  months of his life. "I was quite amazed to hear this elderly gentleman go on  and on about his stocks."  </P> <P> Reiten told orderlies that he was a millionaire, according to Goetsch, and he  paid the $22,000-a-year nursing home bill. But "he didn't like to spend money;  that was real evident," she said. If Goetsch asked Reiten if he wanted new  clothes, he would respond, "I'm fine with what I have; no need to spend money."  Reiten once complained to her that a long-distance caller should have saved the  money and written.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Goetsch said Reiten "was rather liked by the staff. He was a  cantankerous old man, but he was kind of cute."  </P> <P> It was in 1982 that Reiten closed the circle of his life by moving back to  Bayfield, Wis., a simple village of about 800 people on a scenic stretch of  Lake Superior. He rented the upstairs rooms in his sister Nancy's home, across  the cobblestone street from the house where he had been born to Scandinavian  immigrants.  </P> <P> His father, Ole, was a saloon keeper who died at age 34 from internal injuries  caused by heavy lifting. Reiten, the second of four children, was 4 at the  time. His mother, Hulda, then married Ole's younger brother, who died a few  years later of a heart condition.  </P> <P> Reiten never finished high school but studied economics at the University of  Wisconsin. He was in the Army during World War I, worked in Chicago and in 1930  joined the migration to Long Beach, so favored by transplanted Midwesterners  that it came to be known as "Iowa by the sea."  </P> <P> He wrote home and sometimes visited, always taking the bus. Only once did he  fly, when his mother died. He told his relatives little about his work, and  they inevitably described him as a man who kept to himself.  </P> <P> When one of Reiten's nephews visited him in Long Beach in the 1960s, Reiten  wouldn't let him into his room at the Admiral Hotel, always insisting that they  meet downstairs.  </P> <P> At his sister's, Reiten stayed in his upstairs apartment with the doors locked  most of the time, rarely speaking to family members, sleeping during the day  and tending to his papers at night. He would emerge for meals with Nancy, his  only living sibling, and to make calls at a nearby phone booth, according to  Phil Wigley, a retired Huntington Beach police detective who works for an  Orange County detective agency hired by the public guardian to verify Reiten's  identity.  </P> <P> One day in 1988, when Reiten had not been heard from, Nancy peered into his  apartment and found him lying on the floor with a broken arm. The lock had to  be cut from his door to get him out. When a physician examined Reiten, who was  unkempt and dirty, he found $1,800 in Reiten's underwear.  </P> <P> Reiten was admitted to the nursing home, and it was while he was there that  questions surfaced about the handling of his fat stock portfolio in the Long  Beach office of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. In the process  of sending a letter to Reiten, an office worker noticed that Reiten's account  statements were being mailed to the Huntington Beach home address of Walls, his  Merrill Lynch broker.  </P> <P> According to court documents, Walls refused to disclose Reiten's whereabouts to  his superiors, portraying Reiten as an eccentric, Howard Hughes-like recluse  who had no permanent address, traveled extensively out of the country and  contacted Walls infrequently by telephone.  </P> <P> Merrill Lynch fired Walls in late 1988. Unable to find Reiten, the company went  to Superior Court to have Reiten declared missing and to have the Orange County  public guardian appointed conservator of Reiten's money.  </P> <P> Walls insisted that the conservatorship was not necessary and that Reiten was  not missing. He said that he had once been out of touch with Reiten for more  than a year. He described himself as a close personal friend of Reiten and  pointed out that it was under "the exceptional acumen" of his management that  Reiten's Merrill Lynch account had grown from $1 million in 1969 to about $12  million, far outperforming most accounts in the office.  </P> <P> Walls failed to persuade the court. In March, 1989, the public guardian was  appointed conservator of Reiten's estate, and Reiten was declared a missing  person. Two months later, Reiten's money was mentioned in an ABC television  program, "Unclaimed Fortunes."  </P> <P> Back in Bayfield, one of Reiten's nephews saw the show, astounded to hear his  reclusive uncle described as a multimillionaire. Questioned, Reiten admitted to  his sister that he had hefty accounts at Merrill Lynch and E. F. Hutton. His  relatives wrote to the firms, and investigators were sent to interview him.  Reiten told them he had forgotten about his multimillion-dollar account at  Merrill Lynch, said Teja W. Geldmacher, Orange County deputy public guardian.  </P> <P> The guardian's office, wary of being liable for so rich an estate, was not  satisfied, however, that the Reiten of Bayfield was the Reiten of Long Beach.  </P> <P> The search for more proof was frustrated by the paucity of photographs of the  camera-shy Reiten, a transposed Social Security number in his stock records and  the variety of first names Reiten assumed over the course of his life. Having  never driven, he even lacked a driver's license.  </P> <P> The guardian's office hired a detective agency to get photographs and  fingerprints of Reiten, but the investigator arrived in Wisconsin a week after  Reiten's death on Aug. 28, 1989. Wigley, representing the second agency hired  by the guardian's office, traveled to Bayfield last October. He plowed through  roomfuls of Reiten's chaotic papers, stacked in boxes up to the ceiling, and  found thousands of dollars in uncashed dividend checks. He returned to  California with a handful of photos of Reiten.  </P> <P> Wigley went to San Diego to show the snapshots to Fagan, the retired  stockbroker, who finally identified Reiten to the satisfaction of the  guardian's office.  </P> <P> In December, Reiten's heirs were appointed representatives of his estate, which  is now in probate in Wisconsin.  </P> <P> Walls, 66, was indicted in February on federal fraud charges alleging that he  diverted more than $400,000 from Reiten's accounts. He has pleaded not guilty.  </P> <P> "Mr. Walls was protecting the funds," said his attorney, Charles Wehner. "No  funds are missing and never have been." Wehner said his client put the money he  is accused of taking into joint accounts with Reiten because Reiten had not  been in touch and was assumed to be out of the country.  </P> <P> Reiten's heirs share his penchant for privacy. A relative said they have  revealed little about the millions they are due to inherit and that the odd  tale of Everett Reiten's secret riches hasn't even been mentioned in the local  newspapers.  </P> <P> Asked if the money would change the unadorned, small-town lifestyle of Reiten's  heirs, the relative replied without pausing: "Absolutely not." Asked if they  would spend the money, she added: "I doubt it."  </P></p>

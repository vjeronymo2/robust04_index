			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ALL THAT'S NEWS UNDER THE SUN;  </P> <P> BEACH NEWSPAPER CARVES ITS NICHE IN SAND FROM DEL MAR TO OCEANSIDE  </P> <P> When newspaperman Gary Taylor makes his reporting rounds, he usually skips  police headquarters or City Hall. He goes right to the beach.  </P> <P> He knows that's where all the really good scoops are. His sources aren't cops,  they're lifeguards. And his story subjects usually are sprawled out on beach  blankets, not ambulance stretchers.  </P> <P> Taylor is editor of the Beach News, an independent weekly that over the past  two years has carved a unique niche out of the North County life style --  covering the world out under the sun, along the often-crowded beach that  stretches from Del Mar to Oceanside.  </P> <P> Published out of a converted Encinitas garage two blocks from the sand, the  paper's small staff scouts the coast for news as though it were some small town  with a secret to hide.  </P> <P> Taylor, 32, has lived near the beach all his life and knows the local beaches  and their tanned cast of characters.  </P> <P> He is a former president of Swami's Surf Club, an institution along the North  County shores.  </P> <P> People talk to him and call him at home, like the lifeguard who tipped him off  to the business at Moonlight Beach.  </P> <P> The county, it seems, was about to relinquish control of the sandy plot at the  foot of Encinitas Boulevard, one of the most popular sun-bathing spots in North  County.  </P> <P> Encinitas city officials, who apparently are eyeing the area for development,  stressed that the same number of lifeguards would patrol the area under their  supervision. The lifeguard believed otherwise.  </P> <P> In last week's edition, the Beach News ran a cover story on the potential beach  staffing cuts -- with quotes from both sides. It was an example of the  aggressive reporting, the editors say, that the paper's readers have come to  expect.  </P> <P> "The story about the transition at Moonlight Beach is a big topic for North  County people who enjoy the sun," Taylor said. "It's a concern they'll read  about in the Beach News -- and possibly nowhere else."  </P> <P> In recent issues, the Beach News has run cover stories on offshore oil drilling  and beach erosion, along with coverage of beach crime and weekly people  features.  </P> <P> Unlike other suburban publications that confine their interests to city limits  or areas such as music or entertainment, the Beach News tries to cover it all.  If it happens on the beach -- anywhere along the 21-mile stretch from Del Mar  to Oceanside -- it's news.  </P> <P> And the editors are just as aggressive in trying to put the free paper in  people's hands as they are in trying to put it together.  </P> <P> Each week, 11,000 copies of the Beach News are distributed at more than 500  drop spots throughout the North County -- not just in the major grocery store  chains but in the beauty parlors and service station waiting rooms along the  coast.  </P> <P> Within its pages are editorials, news service stories, film and entertainment  reviews, along with several pages of free classified ads -- featuring  everything from overtures from lonely hearts to details on summer house  rentals.  </P> <P> The paper, says publisher James Kydd, is also the only North County non-daily  to feature a full half-page of comics.  </P> <P> In addition to his reporting and editing duties, Taylor does a weekly surfing  column called "the surfwriter" in which he takes a lighter look at the coastal  life style -- including one tongue-in-cheek essay that recently ran with the  headline: "When bad wives happen to good surfers."  </P> <P> But the Beach News is anything but a surfer's rag, its editors say.  </P> <P> "We're not out to pretend we're the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times,  we're just not out to make waves," Taylor said. "But we feel we do a good job  reporting the news.  </P> <P> "Whether it's a drowning on the beach, some rape or murder or even a beach  clean-up weekend, people know the paper's coverage is balanced and  professional."  </P> <P> The Beach News is possibly best known, however, for something Taylor  embarrassingly refers to as "the girlie factor."  </P> <P> Initial issues of the paper were adorned with cheesecake photos, often on the  front page, of bikini-clad women lounging on the beach.  </P> <P> Soon, the word was out that the Beach News was a sexist sheet run by a bunch of  leering editors -- Playboy without the centerfold. One advertising agency even  asked editors to stop leaving stacks of the paper on its doorstep.  </P> <P> "People on the street would say, 'That's the paper that runs all the girlie  pictures,' " Taylor said. "They thought the Beach News was OK, but it was a  little sexist, that there were too many shots of girls in bikinis."  </P> <P> Former Beach News editor Donna Abate recalls feeling uncomfortable about the  pictures when she came to the paper last spring.  </P> <P> "I wasn't sure the pictures were all that tasteful," she said. "I told them  that it looked like the photographer was out looking for a date."  </P> <P> So Abate, now editor of Inn Room Magazine in Escondido, began taking her own  photographs as a way to tone down the paper's image.  </P> <P> "No way was I going to take shots of cutesy people," she said. "I wanted to  show the rest of the beach activity, the surfers, the old couples, the kids  doing their thing."  </P> <P> </P> <P> And the Bikinis Remain  </P> <P> While the paper has run fewer swimsuit photos since he took over as editor in  March, Taylor said, they remain part of the paper's attraction.  </P> <P> "The photographs we run reflect what goes on at the beach," he said. "You go to  the beach today and that's the way it is, guys and girls running around without  a lot of clothes on.  </P> <P> "We're the Beach News, and that's part of the entertainment we provide. So,  from time to time, you're going to see pictures of girls in bikinis."  </P> <P> Whatever the reason, editors and former staffers say, beach people are reading  the Beach News.  </P> <P> "People definitely read the paper," Abate said. "I'd be down at the beach  taking pictures and see someone at every other blanket reading the Beach News.  It was neat."  </P> <P> A recent readership survey found that not just beach-goers picked up the paper,  but often homeowners who live near the water. The paper's pages are filled with  ads not just from sub shops and saloons but banks and realtors.  </P> <P> The 45-year-old Kydd, who has worked in the business offices of several North  County dailies, started his paper on a shoestring in 1987 after spotting a  market for a paper aimed at the beach community.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Garage Now a Newsroom  </P> <P> Advances in affordable desk-top publishing convinced him to chance a weekly  paper, he said. So Kydd bought a computer, rented a house in Encinitas and  refurbished its two-car garage into a bona fide newsroom.  </P> <P> With its desks shoved together like carnival bumper cars, it's no place Lou  Grant would call home. But the place has character, staff members say. It has  even developed a certain mythology along North County beaches.  </P> <P> "Everyone who reads the paper says they know where the garage is, or they have  a friend who knows where it is," said former Beach News editor Tom Fengler, now  a carpenter working in Encinitas.  </P> <P> "Reports are it's anywhere from Del Mar to Oceanside. It's like all the guesses  about the location of the studio where Wolfman Jack used to do his radio show  back in the 60s. It's a real mystery."  </P> <P> But the real mystery, staffers acknowledge, is how the paper has survived in a  competitive North County market that is home to dozens of newspapers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> First Issue in 1987  </P> <P> Since the first issue of the Beach News hit the stands in September of 1987,  several weeklies have come and gone. But the paper is still printing, Fengler  said, because of the accuracy with which it has zeroed in on its market.  </P> <P> "It's locally owned and it's close to the beach, but it's also close to the  hearts and minds of the beach community. People say, 'It's our little paper.'  It fills a niche in the coverage of the big dailies."  </P> <P> Although he is not yet making much of a profit, Kydd said he would like to see  the tiny independent weekly extend its coverage all the way to the Mexican  border.  </P> <P> And that suits the staff just fine. Most say putting out the Beach News is like  working within the family -- or taking a room at the Hotel California.  </P> <P> When they can break away from the crowded newsroom, staffers are free to wander  around the house, cook lunches in the nearby kitchen, take a nap, even do their  laundry.  </P> <P> Sometimes, when Kydd's 10-year-old son, Christopher, comes home from school,  Taylor might offer him a few surfing pointers or challenge him to a game of  horseshoes in the side yard.  </P> <P> On Tuesday night, when editors are working late laying out the paper, Chris  will often ride his bike down to a local take-out place for burgers and fries  for the entire staff -- and might even get a tip for his services.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Family Image  </P> <P> At first, Donna Abate took the paper's family image literally. When she was  interviewed for her job in the living room by Liz Swain, the paper's outgoing  woman editor, Abate thought Swain and Kydd were husband and wife. Everybody got  a laugh out of that one.  </P> <P> "I was shocked when I first saw that the paper was published out of the  garage," Abate said. "But it was like being part of a little family, putting  out a product. And I always got off on the fact that, when I went to work, I  went to the beach."  </P> <P> Taylor, though, is perhaps the paper's most blatant example of a beach  journalist.  </P> <P> Maybe it's the surfer-writer look. Often unshaven, his uniform can be a shirt  and tie or cut-off blue jeans and flip-flops. The casual attire, he says, puts  people at ease when he interviews them.  </P> <P> "Most often, they know what's coming when they see me," he said. "But I usually  start things off with 'As you can see, I'm a reporter from the Beach News.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Staff Horseshoe Contest  </P> <P> He usually writes his stories at home and often conducts interviews on lawn  chairs in Kydd's side yard. On Friday afternoons, he and Kydd convene the  paper's editorial staff for a horseshoe pitching contest and a few bottles of  beer while they think up story ideas.  </P> <P> On Thursdays, when the paper is finally put to bed, Taylor hits the beach for a  little surfing. And, of course, some more reporting.  </P> <P> "When you report on the beach, you get to spend a lot of time there," he said.  "I get to go out and go surfing and say I'm doing research. It's a joke.  </P> <P> "But you never know, maybe I'll see someone drowning. And then we'll have the  story."  </P></p>

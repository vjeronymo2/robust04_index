			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: Kodak to form new imaging division EASTMAN Kodak, known for its consumer photographic products, is attempting to boost its business in office imaging products and services, writes Paul Taylor. As part of a worldwide restructuring, the multinational group's UK subsidiary will announce today that its Copy Products and Business Imaging Systems divisions are being merged to form Kodak Office Imaging. Kodak intends to exploit its expertise in handling images in the expanding electronic business information technology sector. Kodak Office Imaging will be responsible for providing a range of products and services spanning all areas of business document imaging. Kodak recognises its commercial business was overshadowed by its consumer photographic business and its previous business structure failed to fully capitalise on commercial customer relationships.</p>

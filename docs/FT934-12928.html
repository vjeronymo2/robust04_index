			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Arts: Dream fails for Paris dealer - Saleroom LEADING PARIS antique dealer Bernard Steinitz is having to auction off a large part of his colossal stock of 17th and 18th century furniture and furnishings in order to empty his warehouses and make way for a council housing project. Steinitz bought the 200,000 square feet of warehouse and workshop space in the heart of Paris's flea markets at Saint Ouen in 1986 from the firm Wonder, formerly owned by billionaire asset stripper and chairman of Marseilles football team, Bernard Tapie. Five years later Steinitz finally obtained planning permission for an ambitious scheme to develop the site into a European auction house complete with offices for a transport company plus a bank and a hotel employing a total of 1,000 people. The deal obliged Steinitz to give half his warehouse space to local authorities to build council homes; in exchange the council undertook to build a road network. Steinitz auctioned the contents of his country home, a Loire chateau for Pounds 2m last year to raise capital for his auction house dream which, owing to the recession and France's failure to lift restrictive national auctioneering practices, has failed to become reality. Steinitz has obviously been rushed into this latest sale to honour his obligations to the council of Saint Ouen. Experts working for auctioneer Joel-Marie Millon, who will hold the sale at Saint Ouen on November 9, 10, 11 and 12, have been sifting through the huge accumulation of parquet flooring, wood panelling, furniture and furnishings, including over 100 chimneys and 150 chandeliers crammed into the dealer's warehouses. An estimation of between Ff30m and Ff50m has now reached. The sale will contain anything between 500 to 1,000 lots ranging from vases, statues, wrought-iron balconies, banisters and screens and parquet flooring to a huge quantity of furniture. Outstanding items include four marble statues of the Four Seasons by turn of the century artist Raoul Verlet, which Steinitz sold to a Japanese collector for Dollars 2m only to have an export licence refused by the socialist minister for culture, Jack Lang. Auctioneer Millon will also sell a large and very rare Louis XV terracotta fountain in the shape of two dolphins and a mask of Neptune. Probably made for the chateau of Versailles, the fountain is depicted in the painting 'Le Bain de Venus' by 18th century artist Francois Boucher.</p>

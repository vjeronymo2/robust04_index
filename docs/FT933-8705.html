			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Italy moves on price liberalisation ITALY'S price liberalisation took a small step forwards yesterday with the removal of controls on milk, bread, cement and fertilisers, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. Prices of the four products were put under state control in 1974, although the cost of cement was partially liberalised 11 years later. The move is part of a gradual policy by the new government of prime minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi to liberalise the economy and remove anachronistic mechanisms. Mr Luigi Spaventa, budget minister, said the move to let the market determine prices had been taken because ministers felt there was adequate competition.</p>

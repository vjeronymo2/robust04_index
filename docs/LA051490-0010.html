			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRE DESTROYS 2 ROOMS AT SIMI VALLEY SCHOOL  </P> <P> Fire destroyed two classrooms and heavily damaged two others at a Simi Valley  elementary school early Sunday, causing a loss estimated at $500,000,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Investigators determined that a malfunctioning clock caused the blaze at Park  View Elementary School, 1500 Alexander St., said Jackie Noel, a dispatcher for  the Ventura County Fire Department.  </P> <P> Noel said two firefighters suffered minor injuries fighting the fire.  </P> <P> About 130 first- and second-grade pupils -- more than a fifth of the school's  approximately 620 students -- will be displaced because of the fire. The  students will be taught in the school's library, computer lab, or in two  special-education classrooms during the five weeks remaining in the school  year, Principal Rob Hunter said.  </P> <P> "Services to the kids won't be interrupted in any way," Hunter said. "We'll  just change the way we deliver the services." Park View was not scheduled to be  used for summer classes.  </P> <P> The 2:15 a.m. fire swept through one of five four-classroom wings at the  school, one of the largest of the Simi Valley Unified School District's 19  elementary schools, Supt. John Duncan said.  </P></p>

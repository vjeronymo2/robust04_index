			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> South Korea accepted a North Korean offer to resume parliamentary talks to  discuss reunification of the Korean Peninsula, a National Assembly spokesman  said in Seoul. Chief South Korean delegate Chae Mun Shick has sent a message to  Pyongyang suggesting that the eighth round of talks be held Oct. 25 at the  border truce village of Panmunjom, the spokesman said. The last round, aimed at  reducing tensions on the peninsula, was in December, 1988. In July, Seoul  suspended all talks with the Communist north after several southern dissidents  made illegal trips across the border.  </P></p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Date set for Bonn move to Berlin THE TRANSFER of Germany's seat of government from Bonn to Berlin will be completed by the year 2000, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said yesterday, ending months of debate about the timing of the move. However, parliament might decide to move earlier, possibly in 1998, when the parliamentary factions will discuss the cabinet decision next week. The cabinet decision was welcomed by the Berlin Senate, or state government, which said there was 'finally a clear perspective'. It will also send a signal, however late, to investors and property developers, who always believed the move would attract more investment into the five eastern states. Officials in Bonn, particularly those who have established careers and homes in the Rhineland, have tried to delay the move as long as possible, largely because of the cost and upheaval. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, has estimated the move will cost about DM30bn (Pounds 12bn). The decision to move the government to Berlin was voted by the Bundestag, the lower house, in June, 1991. The slow timetable, however, has prompted sharp criticism by commentators, most notably Marion Grafin Donhoff, publisher of Die Zeit. She recently wrote that the government's reluctance to move to Berlin was slowing the social and psychological unification of eastern and western Germany. The Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and privatising east German industry, yesterday announced it had liquidated 3,151 enterprises with the loss of 235,000 jobs since it was set up in July 1990. They had been liquidated largely because they proved unviable, even after restructuring, or could not be privatised. The Treuhand has already privatised almost 12,000 of the 13,000 enterprises under its control. Some 1,300 are in the process of being sold, leaving about 500, many of which will also be privatised. However, there is increasing concern about the fate of 15 enterprises, which together employ about 100,000 people, and include the chemicals, mining and heavy machinery sectors.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> E. Multi-Year Projects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This announcement is soliciting applications for project periods up to 36 months. Awards, on a competitive basis, will be for a one-year budget period, although project periods may be as long as 36 months. Funding after the 12 month budget period of an approved multi-year project is non-competitive. The non-competitive funding for the second and third years is contingent upon the grantee's satisfactory progress in achieving the objectives of the project according to the approved work plan, the availability of Federal funds, compliance with the applicable statutory, regulatory and grant requirements, and determination that continued funding is in the best interest of the Government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> F. Grantee Share of Project <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grantees must provide at least five (5) percent of the total approved cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project is the sum of the Federal share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind contributions, although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. The funds for the match must be from a private source, or state source where the funds were not obtained from the Federal government by the state, or a Federal source where legislation or regulation authorizes the use of these funds for matching purposes. Therefore, a project requesting $300,000 in Federal funds (based on an award of $100,000 per budget period), must include a match of at least $15,789 (5% total project cost). Applicants may request a waiver of the requirement for a 5% non-Federal matching share. Since the matching requirement is very low it is not expected that waivers will be requested. However, the procedure for requesting a waiver can be found in 45 CFR 1336, Subpart E_Financial Assistance Provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> It is the policy of ANA to apply the waiver of the non-Federal matching share requirement for the purposes of this particular program announcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> G.

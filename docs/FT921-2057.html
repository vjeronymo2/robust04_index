			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Reversing roles on the small screen - Ballot Box Forget about political values, let's talk production values. Labour's party election broadcast - on show at a television screen near you last night - was another example of how this topsy-turvy election is reversing roles. We have gasped at the audacity of the People's Party selling itself as the home of prudence and the Tories as irresponsible spendthrifts. But that can hardly be sustained by the two combatants' first brushes with the small screen. John Schlesinger's 'John Major. The Journey' offered the grainy print and hand-held cameras of mid 1960s cine-verite. Urban grit, real people, Brixton badinage, and yup, good old John Boy, man of the mean streets made, oh yes, really very good indeed. It looked like it had been made on the proceeds of a quick whip-round at the Lambeth Conservative Association. That was the point. Labour's Britain, on the other hand, has money to burn. We begin airborne, shooting gracefully across snowy hilltops and swooping down over charming schools plucked from those Beautiful Britain magazines found only in embassy lobbies abroad. As the Wagnerian horns of the 'It's Time for Labour' theme soar along with us, a husky throat breaks through the Celtic twilight. 'We live in a country rich in heritage,' it proudly insists, 'rich in natural resources and, of course most of all, rich in people . . . '. But not rich enough under the Tories. Mr Kinnock's imitation of his countryman Richard Burton's more theatrical advertising voice-overs confirms his powers of mimicry. Indeed, Hugh Hudson's sumptuous film illustrates just how far perfectly normal people are prepared to go to imitate a government-in-waiting. The 'This Is Britain' tour is interrupted by a series of familiar faces, talking optimistically about how they are going to turn the country into the sort of place only before seen on Shell adverts. Gordon Brown, in what is believed to be a historic first, actually smiles on camera - twice. As we bank and wheel over polluted rivers, even the pollution looks rather pleasant. Good pollution, made in Britain. It is all wonderful, and slightly incredible. When Mr Kinnock returns to take his natural place on-camera, the viewers can hardly have raised an eyebrow at the flags bedecking his office. The horns and violins, the patriotic pride, the hope for a brighter future, must have left them with one thought. It is time, time for a change, time . . . to put on the kettle.</p>

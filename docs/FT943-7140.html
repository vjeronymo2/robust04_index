			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / RMT to ballot Tube workers The executive of the RMT transport union yesterday decided to ballot London Underground workers on a series of one-day strikes over pay. The move followed a similar decision by Aslef, the train drivers' union, on Tuesday. The RMT's 8,000 members and Aslef's 2,000 drivers on London Underground will vote next month on whether to support a series of one-day stoppages in protest at an imposed 2 per cent pay rise. Voting will end on September 19. If underground workers voted to strike action could be co-ordinated with the stoppages by RMT rail signal staff working for Railtrack, intensifying disruption in the capital. RMT accused London Underground of refusing to negotiate over this year's pay award and complained that the imposed rise of 2 per cent was below the rate of inflation.</p>

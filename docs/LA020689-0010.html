			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'AS IS' DELIVERS MOVING PORTRAIT OF SHOCK AND DESPAIR OF AIDS  </P> <P> The fact that we are a world living with the threat of AIDS is, at last, a fact  of our national theatrical consciousness.  </P> <P> On Broadway today, two of the hottest plays in town, both from the Seattle  Repertory Theatre, deal with AIDS as a contemporary given: "Eastern Standard"  and "The Heidi Chronicles."  </P> <P> "Eastern Standard" even flirts briefly with a joke on what has now become the  cliche of the stock gay character discovering he has AIDS. When a gay man  complains that the worst thing he had ever imagined has happened to him, his  straight friend gasps and then the gay man nods tragically: Yes, he has indeed  lost his maid.  </P> <P> William M. Hoffman's "As Is," playing at the Lyceum Space through Feb. 25 is,  in many ways, a throwback to an earlier era when the condition was so new that  an entire play could be built around a character's discovery that he has tested  positive on the one exam everyone wants to fail.  </P> <P> Still, "As Is" is so elegantly and movingly done by San Diego StageWorks in its  premiere production that it is impossible not to feel the shock, anger and  despair of a story unfolding that by now, sadly, we all know too well.  </P> <P> At the heart of "As Is" is the loving relationship between Rich (Jeff Okey) and  Saul (Barry Mann), which breaks off when Rich runs off with Chet (Rick Kunz)  and resumes -- at Saul's insistence -- when Saul discovers that Rich has AIDS.  </P> <P> The construction of the play echoes "The Shadow Box," the touching story of  terminal illness that tells of loss through a variety of vignettes and  overlapping voices offering variations on the central stories.  </P> <P> The excellent ensemble cast, under the direction of Alan Craig DiBona, moves  smoothly over a striking range of roles: leather-clad pickups at a gay bar,  crisis-control phone operators, straight relatives, doctors, AIDS patients in a  therapy group, individuals giving testimony to the dead.  </P> <P> Exceptional among these are Patricia DiMeo as a hospice worker making  bittersweet jokes to get through the dying, Christopher Redo as Rich's straight  brother wrestling with his love for a sibling and his fear of infection, and  Larry Baza as everything from a lonely heart in a gay bar to an AIDS patient  with a refreshing facility for cutting through the crap.  </P> <P> Best of all, Okey as Rich never softens his characterization to beg our  sympathy for his niceness. Rich is smart but difficult, charismatic but deeply  angry that this blow has been dealt him; he lets the zingers fly and does not  flinch when he sometimes draws the occasional blood even from those he loves.  </P> <P> Through the course of the story, we learn to love him on his terms, so that we  can understand the sacrifices Saul is willing to make for him.  </P> <P> The production values reflect the care that underlines the entire production:  the careful costuming by John-Bryan Davis, the subtle lighting by Joseph D.  Naftel and the striking set by Marc Sanchez that tells a poignant story by  itself: airy and modern, Sanchez's design concludes with an exit framed by two  ruined columns like a veritable gate to the other world. The broken pillars  serve as a reminder not only of the ruined body Rich will be leaving behind,  but of a more beautiful time when we all did not live under the threat of this  disease like a modern sword of Damocles.  </P> <P> "AS IS"  </P> <P> By William M.

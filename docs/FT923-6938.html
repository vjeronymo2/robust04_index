			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Treasury to sell Pounds 1bn of privatised company debt THE GOVERNMENT is to use an innovative auction process to sell Pounds 1bn of its approximately Pounds 5bn of loans made to privatised utility companies. Under proposals unveiled yesterday, borrowers including BT and a string of regional electricity companies and power generators, will be invited to bid against each other to repurchase and retire their debt. The Treasury will select which bonds to sell, allowing the repurchase only of complete issues of debt. The sale will take place by the end of the current financial year. Companies which buy back their debts may not achieve significant interest savings despite the fall in interest rates since privatisation. Even if the effect was neutral, however, they would be released from restrictive covenants, gaining greater control over their finances. Baring Brothers, the merchant bank appointed to advise the Treasury on the sale, said it could not find any record of debt being sold in this way before. 'We have developed a structure that takes full account of the market value,' said Mr Cliff Haddy, a Barings assistant director. 'The companies are not getting it on the cheap.' The proceeds will count towards the Treasury's target of Pounds 8bn in privatisation proceeds for the current financial year. The sale plan calls for the creation of two bidding pools comprising, on the one hand, the electricity companies, and, on the other, BT and interested third parties. The structure was dictated partly because the government has undertaken not to sell to third parties debt owed by the regional electricity companies before the beginning of next year. Barings said its proposals were also cheaper than the alternative of selling loans to third parties, since marketing and underwriting fees would not be incurred. All told, the government estimates that some Pounds 3.74bn of its loan assets are marketable, comprising Pounds 1.69bn of BT loan stock and Pounds 2.05bn of electricity company debt. Individual loans range in size from a Pounds 350m debt owed by National Power to small loans of less than Pounds 50m. Maturity dates stretch from 1997 to 2008. The debt was originally injected to give the privatised companies what was deemed to be an appropriate capital structure. Many of the electricity groups concerned said they could not comment on the sale until they had studied the details of the auction process and had further discussions with the Treasury, Barings and their own advisers.

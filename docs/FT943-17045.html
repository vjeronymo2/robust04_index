			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Customers unsure of need for change Mr Heseltine's plans for the Post Office ran into a mixture of cynicism and fear among shift workers taking a break in Royal Mail Street, Birmingham, outside one of the biggest sorting offices in Europe. Among their customers, the large postal users, there was a general welcome for the proposals - but disagreement over whether privatisation was necessary. As the Birmingham postal workers leaned against a wall, passing around a news agency report on the government's favoured partial privatisation option, there was little argument. One said: 'I can't see why they want to sell it off when they're making these profits - Pounds 306m, wasn't it?.' Another said: 'Everybody believes the public is going to suffer.' Some argued that greed for profits and shares was the main motivation for change, and that the postal workers would suffer. One said: 'They're only out to make a quicker buck and bigger profits for the shareholders. I don't think it's for the good of the public. To do that, to make the bigger profits, they've got to cut jobs.' Some said the Post Office was already cutting postal workers' jobs. There were more casuals and part-time staff. 'It's going to get worse,' they said. 'They're going to run the post office on a part-time basis.' There were some who regretted what they saw as the passing of the Post Office culture. One worker said: 'The Post Office isn't the Post Office I joined as a lad. Now it's all down to cost. A few years ago they said it was a job for life. I can't see that going on.' There was support for the public-sector option. 'If you keep us in the public sector and give us the right to compete, we'd put a lot of the competitors out of business.' Among the large postal users there was more support for the government. Mr Mark Elwes, director of postal and telecommunications affairs at the Direct Marketing Association, said there was a clear need for change. He said: 'The Post Office does need to be freed from political control. If it is to work properly it must have long-term financial freedom as well as political freedom. The question is whether it needs to be privatised to achieve that.' Mr Leon Morelli, chairman of the Mail Users' Association, said that ownership was 'in a sense a side issue'. He said: 'What we want to see is commercial freedom. We don't see why that can't be given within the public sector. 'We would want to see it very strongly regulated if it were privatised.' He added that there needed to be 'some permanent legislative link' between a privatised Royal Mail and a publicly-owned Post Office Counters in order to safeguard small post offices. Mr Colin Mitchell, chairman of the European Mail and Express Services Users' Association, said the most important issue was to remove the Treasury-imposed external finance limit from the Post Office. He added: 'That would be very difficult under state ownership because of the government's attitude. I think the solution has to be one of the other two options.' The British Printing Industry Federation said the green paper was 'long overdue' and that 'anything that gives greater commercial freedom to the Post Office is to be desired'. It was anxious, however, that a universal service with uniform prices should be maintained. Ms Sally Greengrass, director-general of the charity Age Concern, emphasised the need to protect local post offices which had a 'social value to old people and should not be sacrificed for financial targets'.</p>

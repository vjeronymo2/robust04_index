			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Short article": "How Does Prince Ranariddh See the </F> Vietnamese Threat, and Why Has He Declared War Against the  Cambodians Who Are Struggling Against the Vietnamese to Defend  the Nation?"]    [Text] The present threat to the survival of Cambodian  nation and race is:    1. The fact that Vietnam has nibbled a large part of  Cambodia's territory and territorial waters adjacent to Vietnam.    2. The 4 million Vietnamese who are occupying and nibbling  the remaining Cambodian territory with the goal of turning the  Cambodian society and nation into Vietnamese as they did to  Kampuchea Kraom [Cambodian territory annexed by Vietnam].    All these constitute a grave threat to the survival of our  Cambodian nation and race. How does Prince Ranariddh see this  Vietnamese threat? Why has Prince Ranariddh declared war  against the Cambodians who are struggling against the Vietnamese  to defend the Cambodian nation and race? By so doing, does it  mean that Prince Ranariddh is joining hands with the Vietnamese  in their attempt to eliminate Cambodian nation? Does this mean  that Prince Ranariddh is betraying the nation? By attempting to  kill the Cambodians, to let the Vietnamese annex Cambodian  territory, what heinous crime is Prince Ranariddh committing  against the Cambodian nation and race?    The black book of Cambodia's history has recorded and will  continue to record Prince Ranariddh's traitorous act in joining  hands with the Vienamese to kill the Cambodians. The Cambodian  nation and people condemn and will continue to condemn Prince  Ranariddh and all of his descendants to come as they did under  the reign of King Cheychettha II in the past.    The Cambodian nation and people who cherish their nation and  race will not allow Prince Ranariddh, his colleagues, and the  Vietnamese aggressors to kill the Cambodian nation and race.</p>

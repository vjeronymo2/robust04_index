			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with FYROM President Kiro Gligorov by </F> Othon Zimmerman in Skopje; date not given: "Gligorov Says Greeks  Must Calm Down"]    [Text] Skopje -- Actually he is Bulgarian, say the Greeks,  referring to FYROM [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]  President Kiro Gligorov. Moreover, they add, he is also a  former communist.    However, in FYROM everyone agrees about one thing: Gligorov  is the president that the country needs. The 76-year-old  politician is a kind of father of the fatherland, the link  cementing together a small Balkan republic, which is arduously  progressing toward democracy and stability. He is a man who has  a soft spot for the Netherlands: "Your country has really helped  us tremendously," he said.    The FYROM flag -- a red background bearing the disputed  golden star of Vergina -- flies proudly in the grand  presidential office.    The use of the star is one of the reasons why, on 16  February, Greece announced a boycott against FYROM -- or Skopje,  as the Greeks call it. Other points of conflict include the  name of the country, the "Republic of Macedonia," and a passage  of the Constitution in which FYROM says that it intends to stand  up for FYROM nationals living outside the country's national  borders. Athens regards this as tantamount to laying a claim on  the Greek province of Macedonia, and speaks of pilfering Greek  history. Attempts at mediation by the United Nations and  European Union have proven fruitless.    [Zimmerman] Can the conflict with Greece still be resolved?    [Gligorov] If we deal with the matter reasonably, then a  solution is possible. We must carry on as neighbors. I must  say categorically that there are no real conflicts. We merely  have common interests. Emotions in Greece have to calm down.  The mass demonstrations must come to an end. When life gets  back to normal we will manage to sort things out. At this  moment in time, the Greek politicians, who are themselves  responsible for the demonstrations, are incapable of rational  thought. They are prisoners of the emotions which they  themselves have stirred up.    [Zimmerman] Is there a possibility of compromises on the  moot  points: the name, the flag, and the constitution?    [Gligorov] We have already made concessions to Greece. We  joined the United Nations under the name FYROM, the English  abbreviation for Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a name  that is utterly inappropriate and not in accordance with our  Constitution. We have adapted the Constitution and made it  clear that we do not wish to become involved in the internal  affairs of our neighbors. We have proposed the conclusion of an  agreement with Greece -- under the supervision of the United  Nations or the European Union -- guaranteeing the inviolability  of our respective borders. We did so again today. That should  be enough to wipe away any fears regarding territorial claims.    However, nothing is good enough for Greece. Instead of  opting for a dialogue, the government in Athens opted for an  embargo that is causing us great damage. The Greeks are even  making any resumption of talks subject to certain conditions.  And if we give in to the Greek demands, what else will remain  to be negotiated? We understand that compromises will have to  be made by both parties, and we are prepared to accept that.  But not under pressure of an embargo.    Why should we not call ourselves Macedonia, as this country  has been known for the last 50 years? Who has the right to  demand that people and states should change their name? And  regarding Article 49 of our Constitution: The Greek Constitution  contains an article containing virtually identical wording, the  difference being that Greece believes that it can stand up for  the interests of Greeks living abroad, while denying us the  right to do the same.    [Zimmerman] Can the article be falsely interpreted?    [Gligorov] Look, the problem is quite simply that Greece  denies the existence of national minorities. It believes that  everyone in Greece is simply Greek, whereas there are also  Turks, Bulgarians, Macedonians, Vlachs, and Albanians living  there.    [Zimmerman] Do the Greek demands conceal any territorial  ambitions?    [Gligorov] I do not believe that Athens has any territorial  ambitions toward the FYROM, but I am not convinced that the same  applies to Greece's remaining neighbors. Think of the issue of  northern Epirus (a region of Albania containing a Greek  minority). There are also problems with Turkey.    [Zimmermann] The star of Vergina on the national flag could  also have been a Macedonian lion. Vergina is in Greece, and the  sarcophagus of Philip II, which bears the star, is in the  archaeological museum in Thessaloniki.    [Gligorov] The Balkan cultures, like the people in the area,  are mixed. You can also see this star in our churches. We have  no intentions of stealing any of their national heritage or  history. If everyone claims exclusive rights, then what should  be done with the town of Ochrid, for example? That is where you  can gain a picture of the history of the Balkans. Go and dig  there: First you will come up against the Slavic culture, then  the Byzantine, then the Roman, and Ancient Greek, and so on.  The dispute is a good reflection of the atmosphere in the  Balkans, which is one characterized by nationalism and emotions.    [Zimmermann] Can the embargo, with all the negative  consequences it has for the people, lead to an upsurge of  nationalism in your country?    [Gligorov] The danger is there. However, we are endeavoring  to keep the passions under control. As was the case at the time  of the first Greek embargo, imposed last year, we have not taken  any countermeasures. Nor have there been any nationalist  demonstrations here. Anything like that would merely lead to a  running feud with the Greeks, which would only make the  resolution of the problems more complex still. Consequently, I  believe it is of the utmost importance that the demonstrations  in Greece should stop, that the sentiments of the people there  should no longer be manipulated. We all know where  demonstrations of that kind led to in Yugoslavia: to war.    [Zimmermann] Is there a danger that the war in the former  Yugoslavia will spill over into the FYROM?    [Gligorov] Of course. That is why we were so glad to have UN  peacekeeping troops, including 600 Americans, in our country  before a violent conflict broke out. The presence of the U.S.  troops is politically and psychologically of great importance,  and definitely gives us a sense of security. It is clear to  everyone that the Americans are not here by chance. The U.S.  superpower understands that there is a chance of the conflict  spreading, and that Kosovo or the FYROM could become involved.  If that were the case, then the situation would escalate into a  Balkan war, involving involve two NATO countries, Greece and  Turkey.</p>

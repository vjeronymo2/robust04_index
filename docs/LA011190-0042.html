			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: PLUCKING FAT FROM HERB CHICKEN  </P> <P> DEAR JEANNE: I have a favorite recipe from a local restaurant, but as you can  see it is loaded with calories and fat. My husband and I are on low-fat,  low-calorie and low-cholesterol diets, so could you convert this recipe for us?  </P> <P>  -- LOIS, Marysville, Wash.  </P> <P> CHEESE-AND-HERB-STUFFED CHICKEN  </P> <P> 2 eggs, lightly beaten  </P> <P> 4 ounces cubed chicken  </P> <P> 2 (3-ounce) packages cream cheese, softened  </P> <P> 4 ounces grated Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> 3 ounces chevre cheese  </P> <P> 1/4 cup whipping cream  </P> <P> 2 green onions, chopped  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon dried oregano  </P> <P> 1 ounce sun-dried tomatoes, finely chopped  </P> <P> 2 ounces fresh chopped spinach  </P> <P> 10 boneless chicken breast halves  </P> <P> Oil or butter  </P> <P> Combine eggs, chicken, cream, Parmesan and chevre cheeses and whipping cream in  food processor. Process until smooth, remove and place in bowl.  </P> <P> Mix in green onions, oregano, tomatoes and spinach by hand, blending  thoroughly. Set aside.  </P> <P> Cut pocket in each chicken breast by placing on flat surface and inserting  sharp knife in large end of breast. Cut to within 1/2 inch of sides and end to  form pocket. Do not cut entirely through small end of breast.  </P> <P> Using pastry bag fitted with 1/2-inch round tip, pipe cheese mixture into  pockets. Arrange stuffed chicken breasts in baking pan, brush with oil or  butter and bake at 375 degrees 20 to 30 minutes. Makes 10 servings.  </P> <P> DEAR LOIS: Part-skim ricotta cheese works well in place of the cream cheese,  and I was able to replace the whipping cream with nonfat milk without an  appreciable difference in the finished product. I also found I could eliminate  the egg yolks.  </P> <P>  -- JEANNE  </P> <P> LIGHTER CHEESE-AND-HERB-STUFFED CHICKEN  </P> <P> 3 egg whites, lightly beaten  </P> <P> 4 ounces uncooked chicken breast, cubed  </P> <P> 3 ounces part-skim ricotta cheese  </P> <P> 4 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated  </P> <P> 3 ounces chevre cheese  </P> <P> 1/4 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> 2 green onions, chopped  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon dried oregano  </P> <P> 1 ounce sun-dried tomatoes, finely chopped  </P> <P> 2 ounces fresh spinach, chopped  </P> <P> 10 boneless, skinned chicken breast halves  </P> <P> Combine egg whites, cubed chicken, ricotta, Parmesan and chevre cheeses and  milk in food processor.

			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> DOW DROPS 32 POINTS TO HIT A 16-MONTH LOW  </P> <P> Stocks prices fell to a 16-month low Thursday as oil prices continued their  relentless drive toward $40 a barrel, feeding fears that the nation's economy  is dangerously unbalanced.  </P> <P> President Bush's decision to sell crude from the U.S. strategic reerve proved  powerless against the upward trend in oil prices, causing stocks to tumble.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 32.17 points, or 1.3%, at  2,427.48, after a 25.99-point decline suffered Wednesday.  </P> <P> Trading was heavy, with Big Board volume totaling 182.7 million shares,  compared to 155.6 million Wednesday. In the broader market, losing issues  outnumbered gaining ones by about 3 to 1 in nationwide trading of New York  Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,182 down, 395 up and 422 unchanged.  </P> <P> The brunt of the selling pressure was focused on banks, which have been faced  with mounting problem loans in the depressed real estate industry. Bank of  Boston cut its dividend and announced major layoffs, adding to Wall Street  fears that further cutbacks may be forthcoming.  </P> <P> "With the end of the quarter coming, no one wants to have anything in their  portfolio that has anything related to financial services," said Tom Callahan,  executive vice president at Yamaichi International.  </P> <P> Although the market started out on a strong note as oil prices dipped, crude  prices quickly advanced on news that the U.S. Navy had fired shots across the  bow of an Iraqi tanker. Oil for November delivery closed 87 cents higher at  $39.54 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  </P> <P> As the market mood soured, the Dow industrials fell more than 50 points,  triggering the NYSE's limit on computer-aided trading, known as index  arbitrage. The ban was lifted late in the day.  </P> <P> The Dow managed to recoup ground but still ended at its lowest point since May  11, 1989, when the index closed at 2,382.88.  </P> <P> Poor market fundamentals have led many investment managers to sell equities.  Kenneth Gerbino, head of the investment firm that bears his name, said  investors "should remain in cash and some gold stocks."  </P> <P> "The level of skepticism about the market's ability to hold together is still  very high," said Hugh Johnson of First Albany Corp.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of nervousness that a hot war will break out in the Gulf," he  said. "If it does, the release of oil from the reserves will not keep prices  low."  </P> <P> Among the market highlights:  </P> <P> * Banking stocks were a major focus. Bank of Boston fell 3/8 to 7 1/8;  Continental Bank Corp. was off 5/8 to 7 3/8; Manufacturers Hanover fell 1 to 20  1/4; Citicorp lost 3/4 to 13 3/4; BankAmerica lost 3/4 to 19 1/4, and Chase  Manhattan fell 1/8 to 11.  </P> <P> * The bearish mood spread to other financial issues as well. American  International fell 3/4 to 59 3/4, Unum Corp. lost 2 7/8 to 38 1/4 and General  Reinsurance was down 1 1/2 to 70 7/8.  </P> <P> * Among other issues, Union Carbide, which said it would repurchase up to 14%  of its outstanding shares, rose 5/8 to 14 7/8.  </P> <P> * Computer company Unisys dropped 1 5/8 to 5 3/8. It suspended its dividend and  said it expects a third-quarter loss.  </P> <P> * Among other actively traded Big Board issues, General Electric was down 3 3/8  at 51 5/8; MCA was down 2 1/4 at 59; IBM was down 1 at 104 3/8 and Philip  Morris was down 5/8 at 44.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, stock prices sank to 33-month lows on the Tokyo Stock Exchange with  the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average losing 478.71 points, or 2.15%, to close at  21,771.91 points, its lowest finish since Jan. 4, 1988.  </P> <P> Share prices closed higher on London's stock exchange but well under the day's  best level, as a technical rally faded following a drop on Wall Street. The  Financial Times 100-share index closed up 9.1 points to close at 2,009.1.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT: Bonds Rally on Hope of Budget Accord  </P> <P> The bond market staged a powerful rally, fueled by technical forces and hopes  that agreement on cutting the federal deficit will lead to lower interest  rates.  </P> <P> The widely watched 30-year Treasury bond surged 1.063 point, or more than $10  for every $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which falls when the price goes up,  tumbled to 9.02% from 9.12% late Wednesday.  </P> <P> Much of the buying reflected technical maneuvers as traders sought to  accumulate bonds to compensate for past sales.  </P> <P> Carl Napolitano, market strategist at R. C. Government Securities, said the  short-covering rally didn't really stem from a significant change in sentiment.  </P> <P> "The market had been deeply oversold for a long time," he said.  </P> <P> Renewed optimism that stalemated budget negotiations in Washington will soon  yield an accord on reducing the deficit helped to encourage bond buyers,  Napolitano said.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge one another for overnight  loans, was quoted at 8.063%, down from 8.125% late Wednesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY: Dollar Tumbles but Gains Against Yen  </P> <P> The dollar weakened against all major currencies except the Japanese yen, which  remained pressured by the rising oil prices and another sharp decline on the  Tokyo Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Currency dealers said trading was slow and in a broad range in the absence of  any fundamental news.  </P> <P> "The market has no clear direction and it probably won't until the budget  situation is resolved and something happens in the Middle East," said Earl I.  Johnson, a vice president and dealer at Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago.  </P> <P> "(The market) is being constantly buffeted by rumors."  </P> <P> Johnson said the dollar was hurt by speculation of a budget compromise in  Washington but supported by rumors of escalating tensions between the United  States and Iraq in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> The dollar gained ground against the yen everywhere.  </P> <P> The U.S. currency finished at 1.5610 German marks, down from Wednesday's  1.5660, and at 137.98 Japanese yen, up from 136.855 yen.  </P> <P> The dollar weakened against the British pound. Sterling rose to $1.8690 from  $1.8635 in London, and to $1.8780 from $1.8718 in New York.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES: Gold Joins Silver, Platinum in Slide  </P> <P> Gold prices reversed a three-day trend and tumbled despite modest gains in  crude oil prices as speculators began to re-establish gold's traditional role  in the market.  </P> <P> On other commodity markets, silver and platinum extended their losses; energy  futures rose slightly; wheat and soybean futures were mostly higher; meat  futures were higher and corn was lower.  </P> <P> Gold had continued to rise this week despite the fact that silver and platinum  -- which the gold market usually follows -- plummeted to their lowest levels in  years.  </P> <P> Gold settled $1.90 to $2.20 lower on New York's Commodity Exchange, with the  contract for delivery in September at $405 an ounce.  </P> <P> Silver and platinum extended their losses following weak economic activity in  the United States, analysts said.  </P> <P> Platinum settled on the New York Mercantile Exchange $10.70 to $11.60 lower,  with October at $437.30 an ounce.  </P> <P> Silver fell 3 cents to 2.7 cents on the Commodity Exchange, with October at  $4.771 an ounce.  </P></p>

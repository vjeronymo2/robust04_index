			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (40): Training courses, time well spent - Consultant's Viewpoint / For patient trainees, most computer training courses offer big benefits AS a freelance consultant, I do not often have the opportunity to attend training courses. Time is precious, and I find it more efficient to train myself whenever possible. Since I also, on occasions, present courses, I am more accustomed to giving than to receiving - so it was a rare luxury to be invited to attend the training course on Recital given by Richfords Computer Services. The company provides 'hands-on' training on many different database products, and on programming in 'C'. They are located in the South Bank Technopark, at London's Elephant and Castle area. At this course, each of the attendees was seated in front of a terminal, which is connected to a Unix machine. I had reviewed and used the product in an earlier version. It is one of the 'xBase' family of database management-cum-programming languages. I have some recent experience of the excellent Foxpro product, so understand the principles. Recital is unique in being available under many versions of Unix and Dec's VMS. It has some differences from the other xBase products - additions which make it unique, such as its data dictionary. We were led through a rather slow introduction - slow for me and two of the other three, but the fourth had less experience, so the course was naturally run at his pace. But this was no great disadvantage, because I was able to play around with the machine, exploring both Recital and Unix, which I had not used for about a year. This led to an embarrassing moment, when I managed to freeze my terminal whilst trying out one of the games I had found - and I couldn't remember how to clear the problem. Unfortunately, neither could the instructor, and his only recourse was to restart the whole system. When I stupidly did the same the next day, I had remembered how to sort it out, but I still had to ask for his help. The course was accompanied by a very competent manual. This covered each topic, both giving practical padding to the instructor, and amplifying what was being said. The instructor, Neil Blakemore, was suitably knowledgeable, and efficiently led us through the examples. As a trainer you always have a dilemma. Do you assume the attendees have read the page you have pointed them to, or do you read it to them? I usually try to paraphrase its content, so that it does not sound as if I am teaching by rote. Neil Blakemore did this nearly every time, but very occasionally inspiration would fail him and he would fall back on reading the page back to us. The advantage of having a terminal in front of you in such a course is that you can explore subjects at your own pace, once you have finished the set sections. I was unable to attend the last day, but was anxious to try out some programming, and was pleased to be able, during the lunch hours, to mess around and do some of the examples from the last day's notes. I also have the manual, and can lead myself through the rest of the course on my own machine. Incidentally, Richfords provided a very adequate sandwich lunch. I've been on courses where this is not provided: the attendees wander off to the local hostelry, and then come back late and sleep the afternoon away. But by providing food, you can control this tendency. You can also give students the chance to explore the system, catch up with parts they may have missed or misunderstood. Some observers may arge that time spent on courses is not always well spent  -particularly when you have a comprehensive set of notes, so that you can often teach yourself perfectly adequately. However, for more patient students, most courses have great value. You are led along at a sensible pace, uninterrupted by telephone and colleagues. You have the attention of a person with expertise in the subject who can answer your questions, without you having to go to the manual. Moreover, his answers will be more focussed and comprehensive. My main reason for attending this course was to prepare myself for some work in Recital. I believe that it achieved its aim. I now know my way round the system, and have some notes to help me to explore it further. THE NEXT ISSUE of Software at Work will appear on September 11, 1992.

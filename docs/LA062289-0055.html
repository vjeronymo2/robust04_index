			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Arkansas legislators met in an emergency special session to re-pass hundreds of  spending bills that were ruled invalid because the Legislature violated a  requirement in the state's constitution. Virtually all state spending will halt  July 1, when Arkansas' fiscal biennium begins, unless the legislators approve  nearly 300 appropriations bills all over again. "I am embarrassed," state Rep.  Jodie Mahony said of the procedural snafu during the regular session, which  ended in April. "But it is an honest mistake." The special session convened  after a specially appointed Arkansas Supreme Court ruled that the General  Appropriation Act did not pass with a three-fourths majority.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 16 Apr (NAN) -- Nigeria has no territorial  ambition, the chief of Army staff, Major General Chris Alli has  declared. Maj. Gen. Alli made the declaration in a lecture  entitled "Defense Capabilities of the Armed Forces of Nigeria",  which he delivered to the participants of the senior executive  course 16 at the National Institute for Policy and Strategic  Studies (NIPSS), in Kuru, near Jos. He emphasised that Nigeria,  like most developing countries in Africa, did not, as a matter  of policy, seek to expand its territory nor acquire new ones.  Nigeria, he said, did not also, seek to export any ideology  adding that the Nigerian Armed Forces were meant primarily to  safeguard the country's territorial integrity.    The military forces, he said further, were also to defend  the  country from external aggression and provide support for the  nation's foreign policy. However, he emphasised the need for  improved defence funding to further boost Nigeria's defence  capabilities, noting that high morale of troops, availability of  weapons and their maintenance had positive effect on defence.  Maj. Gen. Alli said that the preparedness of the nation's  various services ranged between 30 to 60 per cent and noted that  a fragile economy can hardly sustain the heavy pressure of war.  He said that defence capabilities was affected mainly by  funding, manpower development, morale and state of equipment  without which a force cannot be credible. An Army statement  also quoted Maj. Gen. Alli as advocating for a collective  security system by which Nigeria should seek more alliances and  security agreements in the West African sub-region.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: Coca-Cola rises 17% as foreign sales surge THE RAPID growth of soft drink sales outside the US helped Coca-Cola, the leading US carbonated beverage company, to achieve a 17.1 per cent increase in 1991 net profits, to Dollars 1.6bn. The earnings improvement was struck on total revenues 13 per cent higher at Dollars 11.6bn. Net profits for the fourth quarter of 1991 rose by 21.8 per cent, to Dollars 358.4m, on 12.6 per cent higher revenues of Dollars 2.9bn. The growth in full-year operating income, which was up by 18.8 per cent, was led by the group's international soft drinks division, which achieved 19 per cent higher profits of Dollars 2.14bn. Operating income from the US soft drink business rose by 31 per cent, to Dollars 469m. The operating profit from Coca-Cola's foods division was 11 per cent higher at Dollars 104m. The company's share price was buoyed by the healthy 1991 results, and by the announcement of a planned two-for-one stock split. The share price was marked Dollars 5 5/8 higher to Dollars 77 1/8 . Soft drink sales volume, as measured by unit cases, rose faster internationally than in the US market. International soft drink volume grew by 6 per cent in 1991, more than twice the rate of US growth. In the US, volume was 3 per cent higher in the last quarter of 1991, and up by 2.5 per cent for the full year. Coca-Cola yesterday claimed its US market share increased during 1991 by a fraction of 1 per cent, to 41 per cent; this compares with an estimated 33 per cent share for Pepsi Cola, the main competitor. In the European Community, operating income rose by 15 per cent and unit case sales volume by 8 per cent. This was despite an 11 per cent decline in volume in the UK, which the company blamed on economic conditions. In Germany, unit case sales increased by 18 per cent, thanks to the company's penetration of the eastern regions of unified Germany.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Rolls-Royce feels the pinch of recession: Paul Betts looks at the effects of the squeeze in aviation and defence THE recession in the world airline and defence industries has hit Rolls-Royce with a vengeance. For the first time since its bankruptcy 20 years ago, the company warned yesterday that it might be forced to make compulsory redundancies to reduce its 34,000-strong workforce by 6,000 people in its aerospace division by the end of this year. During the previous downturn in the commercial aerospace business in the early 1980s, Rolls-Royce managed to reduce staff without resorting to enforced redundancies. Sir Ralph Robins, the company's chief executive, said yesterday he hoped the company would again be able to achieve the cuts by voluntary means. Yet it seems unlikely that Rolls-Royce will manage to cut its aerospace workforce by 18 per cent by the end of this year without compulsory redundancies. An early-retirement package and a short-service termination scheme will both run out at the end of June. So far, only 1,400 out of the 6,000 employees have agreed to leave voluntarily. Rolls-Royce also announced a freeze on pay for all employees for six months. That will be followed by a bonus scheme related to the performance of the business to be introduced next year, when Sir Ralph hopes to see the first clear signs of recovery in the civil aviation market. Rolls-Royce is in a far stronger financial position today than at the time of its collapse in 1971. Although 24 per cent down from the previous year, it still reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 176m on sales of Pounds 3.67bn for 1990, including a Pounds 50m provision to cover restructuring costs. It has developed a broad product range in its commercial engine business, increased its market share and expanded into the power generating sector with its acquisition of NEI Engineering. It has a Pounds 5.7bn order book with firm orders for 826 civil engines and 170 military engines. Even so, the company remains more vulnerable to a downturn than its two larger US competitors, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney, in the cut-throat aero-engine market. It is neither part of a larger diversified group nor does it have the same broad customer base as its two bigger US rivals. Unlike the previous downturn in the industry, both the defence and the civil sides of the business have declined simultaneously this time. 'In the early 1980s the civil business fell but the defence business remained strong,' Sir Ralph said. 'Now both sides are down.' Rolls-Royce started restructuring its Bristol-based military aircraft engine business last summer when it announced plans to reduce the Bristol workforce by about 850. Now it plans to reduce the workforce there by a further 1,200. It also intends to rationalise its overall defence aerospace activities by progressively running down its helicopter engine plant at Leavesden, Hertfordshire, which employs 1,750 people, and transferring those operations to Bristol. The Gulf conflict has not changed the overall trend of falling military expenditure by governments. 'We don't know what the bottom for the defence business will be,' Sir Ralph said. 'We are waiting for the Ministry of Defence to announce their future defence plans.' The government is expected to clarify its plans in the next few months. Although Rolls-Royce remains optimistic about long-term growth prospects for the civil aircraft and engine markets, it was caught by surprise like the rest of the industry by the depth of the present airline decline - the worst since the Second World War. There are still only tentative signs of recovery in the aviation industry after the collapse in air travel provoked by the Gulf war, which was compounded by the economic recession in western markets. Rolls-Royce hopes to see the market pick up again later this year or, more probably, next year. Meanwhile, it has faced deferments of some engine orders for Boeing 747 and 757 aircraft as well as Fokker 100 and Boeing 767 jets. Orders for new aircraft and engines are scarce at present. Aircraft have been grounded because of the financial collapse of some airlines, including Air Europe and Eastern, both Rolls-Royce engine customers. 'Flying is down by an average of 10 per cent around the world. This has led to a 15 to 18 per cent reduction in our spares business,' Sir Ralph said. Rolls-Royce has also had to continue spending heavily on the development of its new heavy-thrust Trent engine programme - the most powerful variant of the company's RB211 range - to equip the new generation of large wide-bodied jets planned by Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and the European Airbus consortium. Rolls-Royce R&amp;D spending totalled Pounds 237m last year compared with Pounds 161m in 1989. The wide-bodied aircraft market probably holds the biggest promise of growth for Rolls-Royce and the other aero-engine makers. The market is estimated to be worth about Dollars 50bn (Pounds 29bn) between now and the end of the century. Sir Ralph believed that Rolls-Royce had a good chance of winning a big slice of that new market. 'We have now got a wide range of exciting products, a better share of the market, a strong balance sheet,' he said. He conceded that the company did not know where the military business was going and was still uncertain about the timing and strength of the airline recovery. As a result, the company could not rule out a further round of job cuts next year.</p>

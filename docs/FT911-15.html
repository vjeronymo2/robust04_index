			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar and yen lose ground THE DOLLAR fell against European currencies but improved in terms of the Japanese yen yesterday. A rise of 0.1 per cent in April US industrial production was roughly in line with expectations, while a revised fall of 0.6 per cent from 0.3 per cent in March output brought little reaction in the US currency. A decline to 78.3 per cent in April US capacity utilisation, from a downward revision to 78.5 per cent for March, also had no effect on a market waiting for today's data on US consumer prices and Friday's trade figures. At the London close the dollar had fallen to DM1.7140 from DM1.7255; to FFr5.8050 from FFr5.8400; and to SFr1.4430 from SFr1.4580. On the other hand it rose to Y139.40 from Y138.75 against a generally weak yen. The dollar's index dipped to 66.2 from 66.4. Speculation about an early cut in the Bank of Japan's discount rate depressed the yen. This helped to boost the D-Mark after rumours subsided that Mr Karl Otto Pohl was about to resign as president of the German Bundesbank. The rumours led to D-Mark nervousness in early trading, but by the end of the day attention was focused on interest rate factors and this pushed the German currency up against the yen. It finished in London at Y81.35 compared with Y80.40 on Friday. In the European exchange rate mechanism the D-Mark improved against the weakest placed French franc and also the Italian lira, but lost ground to sterling. The Bank of France left its money market intervention rate unchanged at 9 per cent at a securities repurchase tender, keeping interest rate differentials steady as the Bank of Spain and Belgian National Bank also left rates unaltered at similar tenders. The lira weakened against several of its partners in the ERM after Sunday's one-point cut to 11 1/2 per cent in the Bank of Italy's discount rate. However, it remained the second strongest ERM currency, according to figures from the European Commission, in spite of losing ground to the D-Mark, French franc and other members of the ERM at the Milan fixing. Sterling was the third strongest ERM currency as speculation continued about the possible timing of another reduction in UK bank base rates. Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, said on BBC radio that 'the chancellor will not cut interest rates until he considers it prudent to do so'. The Bank of England has signalled that it does not consider this an appropriate time, but the market still believes an early cut is possible as political pressure increases on the government. Sterling rose 1.30 cents to Dollars 1.7320, while improving to DM2.9675 from DM2.9650; to Y241.50 from Y238.50; and to FFr10.0550 from FFr10.0400, but it eased to SFr2.5000 from SFr2.5075. The pound's index put on 0.2 to 91.8. Sterling gained a further 20 points in New York to end at Dollars 1.7340.</p>

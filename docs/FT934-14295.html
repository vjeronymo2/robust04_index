			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Insurance group to shed 70 jobs NCM, the Dutch insurance group that acquired the Export Credit Guarantee Department's short-term credit insurance business after it was privatised in 1991, wants 70 of its 550-strong workforce in Britain to take early retirement. Mr Bryn Halliwell, negotiator for the civil service union CPSA, said: 'NCM have been very good employers but it shows how the recession is biting now.' He did not believe the company would have much trouble finding volunteers to leave. 'The package being negotiated is very generous,' Mr Halliwell said. 'On average, staff can expect to secure three years' salary for going early. NCM has put Pounds 1m on one side to finance this.'</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ALASKA;  </P> <P> REDOUBT VOLCANO UNLEASHES ROCKSLIDE  </P> <P> Part of the summit lava dome on Redoubt Volcano collapsed, sending up a plume  of ash and unleashing a rockslide down a flank of the mountain near two  scientists, the Alaska Volcano Observatory said. There was no telltale seismic  increase before the lava dome collapsed and the mountain ejected a plume of ash  and steam that reached 31,000 feet.  </P> <P> Small, shallow earthquakes, which have been occurring at Redoubt since it came  to life Dec. 14, 1989, usually increase in magnitude and frequency before an  eruption as a warning signal. The 10,197-foot mountain 110 miles southwest of  Anchorage sent the rockslide roaring down from the summit crater on the north  flank of the mountain to about 1,000 feet short of where the U.S. Geological  Survey scientists were working. They were unharmed, officials said. Redoubt has  been erupting roughly once a week for several months.  </P></p>

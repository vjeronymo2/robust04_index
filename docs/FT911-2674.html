			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / How Bonn got it wrong on the east German economy: A candid commentary from a senior economics official who retires tomorrow THE German government deceived itself in failing last year to foresee the depth of the economic crisis in east Germany, says Mr Otto Schlecht, state secretary at the economic ministry. In a frank admission from a Bonn insider of policy shortcomings over German unity, Mr Schlecht said: 'We deceived ourselves about the size and depth of the restructuring crisis.' In particular, the government's much-broadcast comparison between the hoped-for recovery in east Germany and the positive aftermath of the west German currency reform in 1948 was 'wrong from top to bottom,' Mr Schlecht conceded. Mr Schlecht, Bonn's most senior civil servant in the economic policy field, is retiring tomorrow after 18 years in the job. He revealed that he was initially highly sceptical about Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister who took over in January, but now backs the minister's more active line on aiding the east German economy. During the run-up to the united German elections last December, Mr Schlecht said the government seized on optimistic forecasts that the east German economy would recover relatively quickly. 'We gave prominence to the positive elements, and forced the negative ones into the background. This was because we wanted people to take heart (over economic prospects) - and because there was an election campaign.' 'At the beginning, we somewhat underestimated the effect of the shock of liberalising overnight a command economy which had been barred off from the world for 40 years,' Mr Schlecht said. On the outlook east of the Elbe, he said that, by the end of this year 'we will have gone through the worst'. Next year would see recovery, but from a far lower basis of economic activity than the government had previously predicted. Unemployment in east Germany would continue to rise, but not above 2m, thanks to the policy of putting large numbers of effectively-unemployed people on to short-time working, Mr Schlecht said. Until a few months ago, the government, together with the country's leading independent economic forecasters, were unanimous that an upturn in east Germany would begin this summer. Mr Schlecht praised the hard work and energy of Mr Mollemann who replaced his luckless predecessor Mr Helmut Haussmann. Mr Mollemann has played a leading role in bringing about increased public sector funding and administrative support for the east, as well as a shift to more pragmatic policies over property rights and privatisation. Mr Schlecht, 65, will now head the Ludwig Erhard Foundation, the body promoting the ideas of the German-style 'social market economy' at home and abroad. He may also act as an economic adviser in the Soviet Union and for other east European governments such as Hungary and Romania.</p>

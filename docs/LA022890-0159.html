			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> A SILVER LINING: MAGAZINE STOLEN, WINE LEFT BEHIND  </P> <P> The International Wine Review, an upscale magazine for serious wine lovers,  today apologized in print to its readers for its failure to deliver the  December/January issue.  </P> <P> Somebody stole the whole thing, Craig Goldwyn, publisher of the Ithaca,  N.Y.-based review, reported grimly. The theft cost the publication $18,000.  </P> <P> In an extra front page of the February/March issue, Goldwyn said that the  offices were broken into in December and that all computer and most associated  hardware and software stolen.  </P> <P> "Fortunately they were not wine drinkers," Goldwyn noted, eyeing the silver  lining. "Lots of Bordeaux and other wines being prepped for upcoming tastings  were untouched."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Text] There will be no significant changes in China's  political system in the next one or two years, according to a  leading Beijing scholar.    "This year is a key period for economic reforms.  Accelerating political reforms all depends on the success of  that," said Pan Guohua, the vice-chairman of the Department of  International Politics at Beijing University. "Political steps  will not appear for one or two years. There are many conditions  not ripe for democracy at present," Pan said.    A former party general secretary, Zhao Ziyang, put forward a  programme of moderate political reforms in the late 1980s, but  the subject has been a near taboo in China since Zhao's  dismissal after the Tiananmen massacre in 1989 and the jailing  of Bao Tong, who was Zhao's former political secretary and the  director of the central committee's political reform think tank.  However, in a lively discussion with other mainland scholars in  Hong Kong, Pan indicated that consensus is being reached in the  capital on the political transition after the supreme leader,  Deng Xiaoping, dies, as well as plans for cautious  democratisation.    Pan said the experience of 1976 -- when three key Chinese  leaders died -- proved that China would not fall into chaos  after Deng's death. "I admit we do have some worries that  another dictator could emerge. But in general we feel that  widespread instability is impossible," he said.    The three most likely to emerge as supreme leader of China  after Deng's death are President Jiang Zemin, the executive  vice-premier Zhu Rongji and a vice-premier, Li Ruihuan, Pan  said. Asked about the fate of the Premier, Li Peng, he replied:  "Of course everyone can be included."    As far as democracy is concerned, Pan said, researchers in  the capital believed it could be achieved through the gradual  devolution of power to the National People's Congress (NPC) and  to non-communist parties. Both have been described by Western  scholars as window-dressing meant to legitimise the Communist  Party's grip on power in China. However, Pan said this view  ignored important changes already taking place. The standing  committee of the NPC, headed by Qiao Shi, was already seeking to  enhance its power at the expense of the Communist Party, he said.    "The NPC must listen to a growing chorus of complaints from  the people, so they feel the need for more authority," he said,  adding that the standing committee significantly amended more  than 20 laws last year.    The growing political role of non-communist parties  represents the second route by which democratisation would be  achieved, Pan said. These so-called democratic parties have in  the past been tightly controlled by the authorities and all  acknowledge the overall leadership of the Communist Party.    But Pan pointed out that at the recent Beijing municipal  elections, a Communist candidate lost to a Democratic Party  candidate in Haidian District, which is home to most of the  capital's universities and research institutes.    The consensus in Beijing was for a "safe" speed of political  change, however. "The Chinese people care about the conditions  for their children. As a result, economic reforms have gone  faster than political reforms," Pan said.    The devolution of power to local governments as well as the  development of the nonstate economic sector would lay the  foundations for the civil society that is considered crucial to  successful democracy, he believed.    "As long as they are constitutional, the Chinese government  will support the emergence of new popular groups," he said. "Up  to now, no such groups in the academic or social sphere have  posed a serious threat to the Communist Party and government."    The greatest threat to the party came from internal  corruption. "Even though two national meetings have been held to  deal with this problem, the measures taken so far are not  working," he said. "The life or death of the party lies here."    Within Beijing University, Pan said, growing academic  freedom  had contributed to more discussion about political change and  other taboo subjects. "In the past, the party controlled  everything we said, but no longer. The atmosphere is now very  harmonious."    But Pan had harsh words about the dissidents Wang Dan and  Wei  Jingsheng, who have been detained and harassed by Beijing police  in the past month. "The common people don't care one whit about  them," he said. "They know that if the likes of Wang Dan or Wei  Jingsheng were to become the leaders of China, they would not be  able to handle a single matter well."    As long as dissidents were handled by police in accordance  with legal procedures, Pan believed no protests would be raised  at their detentions.</p>

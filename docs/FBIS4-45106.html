A decision will be made by the government whether to use  missiles for launching atomic bombs or coventional bombs. The  success of the Agni missile demonstrates the success of this  technology, in which India has attained expertise. Prithvi is a  surface-to-surface missile of international standard. Nag is an  anti-tank missile. Akash is a surface-to-air missile that is  unequaled in its division. Tarishul is also a surface-to-air  missile of high standard. These missiles will shoot at double  force when used over the ocean. Agni is an answer to the MTCR  [Missile Technology Control Regime] imposed on us. We are able  to fire missiles over 1,000 to 2,500 kilometers, and even  farther. At the end of the year, Prithvi will be presented to  the Indian military for its use. We have learned that Pakistan  has obtained M-11 missiles from China. Prithvi will be the  answer to this."    If we join this Indian program with its space program and  its  efforts to obtain cryogenic engines from Russia, then it is  clear that India is making rapid progress in developing  non-traditional weapons.    We had to refer to this non-traditional war program of  India's because the military, political, and diplomatic experts  from the United States, as individuals and as a team, had been  visiting Pakistan before Deputy Secretary of State Strobe  Talbott's visit to Pakistan and India. Everyone knows that U.S.  General P. Hoover has visited Pakistan more than once. During  this period, he went to inspect Siachen, the roof of the world,  to see the Pakistani military front and meet the soldiers there.  Both these visits were made public through the eyes of cameras;  however, there was another visit for which there was no camera  allowed. Only human eyes saw it. The tongues below these eyes,  however, were tied, and will remain so. What was the purpose of  this visit, and what did the two parties--the host and the  guest--get from it? We cannot say anything about this.    The man in charge of India's missile program has especially  mentioned China's M-11, which, according to him, Pakistan has  installed on its borders. But it is important to remember that  the United States has made a lot of noise about the transfer of  M-11s from China to Pakistan. China has repeatedly insisted that  it did not supply M-11s to Pakistan, but the United States has  not stoped its campaign.    If we analyze U. S. pressure in this context, we can divide  it into two camps: One is composed of Senator Pressler and other  members, who are working hard to make Pakistan totally unarmed  against its enemy India which is loaded with traditional and  modern weapons. The other group wants to reach this goal  indirectly. This group includes the Clinton government, and  Strobe Talbott, as its important representative, has emerged on  the scene. Before visiting Pakistan he went to India, where he  was given a flat refusal and was told that India has no desire  to cap its nuclear program. Still, Mr. Talbott returned  "satisfied" from there. In Pakistan he was welcomed with a great  deal of pomp and show. Here the main point of his demands was  that Pakistan should first cap its nuclear program; should have  it inspected in such a way that the whole world can see that the  program has been capped; and it then should destroy its weapons  of mass destruction.    After discussing this agenda, Mr. Talbott telephoned his  boss, U. S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, on 10 April  1994.    "Mr. Secretary, in the context of relations with the United  States, I can at least say that we have received good news in  Islamabad. In addition, I consider this trip successful at the  diplomatic, political, and even human rights levels.    "We have established the groundwork for taking concrete  steps  in resolving various problems. From my perspective, this trip  has been totally successful, and I am thankful to my Pakistani  hosts, who made it possible to attain the solid results that  will help Pakistan attain its security and political goals, meet  the goals of the safety and stability of this region, and attain  the goal of stopping proliferation of nuclear weapons at the  international level. We have to work together." In response to a  question, he said, "About the nuclear issue, I can say briefly  that we have made solid progress, and officials in both  countries will have to build on the foundation that we laid over  the last two to three days."    During Strobe Talbott's visit, the Benazir government said  emphatically that it has been made clear to Mr. Talbott that  Pakistan will not roll back its nuclear program. Meanwhile, the  announcement about a freeze on the nuclear program (at what  level, no one in Pakistan knows) was made by Benazir during her  previous rule between 1988 and 1989. The question arises: What  success was there that it was important to tell Secretary of  State Warren Christopher, who was working in Washington on his  day off?    If we take a closer look at this "success," two things  become  clear. First, a few days earlier, the talented Pakistani  scientist Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan said, "I have nothing to say  about the nuclear policy or program." This is the same Dr. Abdul  Qadeer Khan the PPP leadership never tired of saying was brought  to Pakistan by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. Therefore, whatever is  credited to Pakistani is credited to Bhutto I. Now Bhutto II,  alias Benazir, has put the same scientist in such a situation  that we cannot explain it in any words.    Secondly, Ms. Robin Raphael, a member of Mr. Talbott's  deputation, said in her earlier visit that a nuclear bomb can be  fired from even an ox cart or dropped from a C-30 transport  plane. These words have some relation to Dr. Abdul Qadeer's  words. Dr. Khan finished the work of enriching uranium in the  Kahuta plant a long time ago. President Ziaul Haq said about the  results of this, "We are a screwdriver away from a bomb."    Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan's interview with Indian journalist  Kuldip Nayar is on record, and only a few days earlier, during  Strobe Talbott's visit to India, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao  said, "Pakistan is a nuclear power, and this has been confirmed  by the former Chief of Military Staff in Pakistan, Aslam Beg."  It is not necessary to blast a nuclear bomb to prove you have  it. These facts and much similar information is available, and  when the government of Pakistan insists that it will continue  its nuclear program as is (whether it has been frozen or  capped), where did the U. S. Deputy Secretary of State have such  success that he was so overjoyed about that he could not wait  until the morning, and informed his boss that very night?    Let us try to understand the news that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan  has hinted about.    It should be clear that President Ziaul Haq had asked Dr.  Abdul Qadeer Khan and his team to develop a delivery system  after attaining nuclear capability. It is common knowledge that  when the United States provided F-16s to Pakistan, these planes  did not have a system to drop nuclear bombs. At that time,  concern was expressed that Pakistan had received "incomplete"  planes. Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan and his team were given other  responsibilities, and the people of our country saw that  supercomputers, Giraffe radar, and similar sensitive electronic  equipment began to show up. In addition, the first phase of  Pakistani missiles, HATF-1 and HATF-2, were created. This gave a  shot in the arm to Pakistan's defense forces. As the department  made progress, India and its supporters in the West began to get  worried. They thought that with the arrival of these missiles,  Pakistan's ability to attack farther was improving. It has  developed a delivery system without which a nuclear power cannot  be said to have a defense umbrella.    Thus, the biggest question for India and the United States  was how to stop Pakistan from improving its delivery system.  Under this strategy, the first attack was made on China,  accusing it of providing Pakistan with M-11 missiles. The U. S.  government went to extremes in this context, stopping a Chinese  ship in the open seas and searching it to see if M-11 missiles  were there. They could only be found if they existed, though.  But this gives us an idea of U. S. worries. American experts  have told Pakistan several times that they have information  about Pakistan gathered from satellites. This information shows  that China provided Pakistan with M-11 missiles. China and  Pakistan have denied making such a deal.    In any case, the question that emerges with full intensity  and importance against this background is: Was the purpose of  Mr. Talbott's visit to stop the Pakistani missile program? Mr.  Talbott, at the end of his visit here, addressed a press  conference in which he said, "Both governments have decided to  stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and means  to launch them. In this context, we have agreed to cap the  nuclear program, followed by a roll back, and finally, stopping  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic  missiles in South Asia."    Thus, the evidence that emerged during Mr. Talbott's visit  to  Pakistan makes it clear that the United States has changed its  strategy a bit and made its first priority the finishing off of  Pakistan's missile program. Thus, without the missiles, nuclear  weapons can only be used for exhibition, and not for defense.  The reason for this is clear. The nuclear program has become  such a sensitive issue for the Pakistani people that ignoring it  is not possible. Therefore, the United States achieved its goal  in a different way.    In this context, we received the disappointing news that  Pakistan has stopped its work on the HATF-1 missile program. At  the site where this program was housed, they announced, "We do  not want to upset the Americans." Perhaps this is the success  that Mr. Talbott was bragging about, and he did not waste any  time informing his boss in Washington about this "success." As  mentioned earlier, if we look at India's nuclear program, the  helplessness of Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, and Mr. Talbott's success  as a series of events, then it should be clear that this whole  effort was to defeat Pakistan's nuclear program. Benazir's  agreement with Mr. Talbott to suspend the missile program (it is  not difficult to confirm this) will harm Pakistan so much that  it is impossible to make an assumption about it.</p>

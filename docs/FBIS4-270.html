			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by C. Doonan] </F>   [Text] Durban April 7 SAPA -- Independent Electoral  Commission [IEC] Vice-Chairman Dikgang Moseneke and Commissioner  Glenn McDougall arrived in Port Shepstone on Thursday [7 April]  morning on a two-day mission to assess the climate for free and  fair elections in kwaZulu/Natal. They immediately met IEC  officials at the Port Shepstone sub-regional office, before a  planned meeting with local church, community, police and army  representatives.    IEC Spokesman Glenn McDougall said the two-day tour was a  "fact-finding mission to report back to the IEC on the  possibility of free and fair elections in kwaZulu/Natal."    This comes after a working committee comprising  representatives of the IEC, South African and kwaZulu  governments concluded that free and fair elections in kwaZulu  were impossible.    Mr McDougall said the current mission would take IEC  officials to the south, north and central regions of Natal to  assess where problems were being experienced. "The idea is to  see where IEC procedures are working and if not, to find other  ways of doing our work," he said.    The IEC officials would fly to Empangeni on the north coast  on Thursday afternoon, before a trip to Newcastle and Howick in  the Midlands. "Operation access" in kwaZulu/Natal would be  launched in Howick, to take voter education to all in the  region, Mr McDougall said. "We will have fleets of minibuses  with loudhailers taking local leaders of different parties to  neutral venues where they will be given a chance to speak to  residents and where voter education can take place."</p>

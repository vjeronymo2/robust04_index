She was presiding over the  annual meeting of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Council in  Islamabad today. The council reviewed the progress of work at  different establishments of the Pakistan Atomic Energy  Commission and considered the main lines of future programs of  the commission which lay emphasis on self-reliance and  indigenization.    Addressing the council, the prime minister said the Islamic,  democratic and awami [people's] government fully supports  achieving excellence and advancement of technology, be it simple  or high technology. It was the elected prime minister, late  Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, who had first started the atomic projects  in Pakistan which are now being implemented. Late Zulfiqar Ali  Bhutto had 25 years ago given an autonomous status to Pakistan  Atomic Energy Commission and sought cooperation of the United  States for support of PINSTECH [Pakistan Institute of Nuclear  Science and Technology] and other atomic projects. Now, the  prime minister said, with Chinese cooperation her government is  completing the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant after 25 years.  There are some undue misgivings about our peaceful nuclear  program, but we hope that Pakistan would very soon be able to  allay these misgivings.    The prime minister expressed the determination to make  Pakistan an enviable, progressive and developed state. She paid  tributes to the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission scientists for  working selflessly and single-mindedly without looking for award  or name. The present government, after its takeover, especially  marked one of its cabinet meetings for preparation and approval  of the new technology policy. Despite financial constraints,  the government earmarked an amount of 1 billion rupees for this  purpose. She expressed the confidence that the new policy would  lead the country toward rapid economic development. The present  government is attaching high priority to the energy sector.  Work at the 300-megawatt nuclear power plant acquired during  1988-90 would be completed soon. The prime minister  complimented the commission on its performance and directed it  to work with greater vigor for peaceful application of nuclear  technology for socioeconomic uplift in the country.    Earlier, the prime minister was shown the indigenously  redesigned and upgraded Pakistan Research Reactor-1 and the  research facilities around it. The chairman of the Pakistan  Atomic Energy Commission, Dr. Ashfaq Ahmed, briefed the prime  minister about the activities in pursuit of peaceful application  of atomic energy.</p>

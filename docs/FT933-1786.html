			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Feeling of betrayal in corporate Germany Has Daimler-Benz betrayed the rest of the German corporate sector by capitulating to the financial imperialism of the US Securities and Exchange Commission? Many Germans have been shocked by the ailing motor and aerospace giant's publication last week of two strikingly different versions of its 1993 first-half figures, a German-style net profit of DM168m (Pounds 67m) and a US-style equivalent net loss of DM949m. At the last count 557 foreign companies had registered securities with the SEC so that they could be owned and traded by Americans. But in all this selection none is from Germany. However, on October 5 Daimler-Benz is due to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. It will be able to do so because it has agreed to recast its financial statements in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). For the German corporate establishment this has been quite a snub. For many years the Germans have been fighting a rearguard action to protect their own financial reporting methods, which are highly conservative and legalistic. They are at the other end of the spectrum from the judgmental and potentially more realistic 'true and fair' British accounts ('potentially' because it is prudent to be modest on the day of the Spring Ram results). The German view of this was expressed eloquently earlier this month by Mr Herbert Biener, of the German Federal Ministry of Justice. At the Copenhagen congress of the European accountants' federation FEE, he said it was an illusion to believe a German company's accounts would be comparable to those of a similar US corporation because they were both drawn up under US GAAP: 'the economic, social and legal environment of those enterprises may be so different'. But to Mr Walter Schuetze, chief accountant of the SEC, speaking on the same platform, the issues were self-evident. The role of financial reporting, in the words of the US Financial Accounting Standards Board, was to provide 'evenhanded, neutral, unbiased information'. In the US system, he said, 'information is king, and also queen'. To the SEC, the challenge of the international markets is similar to the challenge it has already faced within US domestic markets over the past 60 years. It has imposed standardised accounting and reporting across different markets to create a rational basis for investor choice. The parallel development of financial market theory in the US has focused on efficiency of markets and the attainment of equilibrium pricing which supposedly leads to the efficient allocation of capital. Within such a framework there is much emphasis on the heavy trading of shares within liquid markets. The approach, naturally, is eagerly promoted by volume-hungry stockbrokers and by investment banks living off deals which depend on shareholders being only loosely and temporarily attached to the companies in which they invest. In the late 1980s the system went badly wrong and clearly led to the inefficient allocation of capital through a series of wildly mispriced deals and financial collapses but the American investment banking establishment has now recovered its nerve. German attitudes have traditionally been quite different. The theory that speculative trading could direct capital in an economically desirable direction is dismissed as a road leading straight to Polly Peck. Company accounts are not there to define some unattainable 'truth' but to achieve the more modest aim of fulfilling legal and fiscal obligations. There is an emphasis on long-term or 'core' shareholders, including the big banks, and there is not seen to be anything wrong if they are given more accurate and up-to-date information than are other investors. For many years the Germans have been able to claim that their approach gave superior results. It supported long-termism in industry and suppressed the financial wheeler-dealers who thrive in an Anglo-American culture. But now the German economy faces its biggest crisis since World War Two. Daimler-Benz, the nation's biggest industrial company, has decided it must gain access to the global capital market. To Deutschland GmbH this seems like treachery. The implications for the introverted governance of the German corporate sector could be profound. But only the very strong can write their own rules.</p>

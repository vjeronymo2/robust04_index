			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Due to differences in legal and reporting entity, mission,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and accounting format for nonprofit entities and for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> profit-seeking entities, there are differing tests of financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility to be applied. Evaluating a nonprofit entity's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overall financial condition is more complicated because there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no commonly accepted standard of acceptable financial condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, a measure of an institution's financial condition is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure of an institution's solvency, or the ability of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to adequately cover its expenditures with revenues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining an institution's financial condition, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes it is necessary to look at the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> short-term solvency and long-term solvency, which is the ability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an institution to support an adequate level of services over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the long run, withstanding economic disruption and meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changing demands for services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With accounting for for-profit entities, analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial statements provides an understanding of an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial condition through comparisons of key financial ratios  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that measure the institution's ability to remain solvent while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuing to provide educational services at acceptable levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Examination of financial information from nonprofit entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires a review of other organizational factors that measure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ability of the institution to provide educational services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using a larger and more complex source of funds. It is therefore  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to differentiate the standards that are applicable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> profit-seeking entities from the standards that are applicable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonprofit entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary will first address the specific standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for-profit institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to require that a for-profit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution have, at the end of its latest fiscal year, a ratio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of current assets to current liabilities of at least 1.25:1. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commonly used means of determining whether or not the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has sufficient short-term solvency is use of the ratio of current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assets to current liabilities. For the past fourteen years the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department has used a current assets to current liabilities ratio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of at least 1:1 as an indicator of financial responsibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This means that the institution has current assets at least equal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to their current liabilities. In theory, this would indicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that an institution has sufficient resources to handle not only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt service, but also other liabilities for at least the coming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fiscal year. The higher the amount of assets, the better the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liquidity position of the institution and, therefore, the better  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution will be able to handle unforeseen economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions. The Secretary believes that the current 1:1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benchmark offers little or no indication of adequate short-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvency. A 1.25:1 benchmark has, therefore, been proposed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for-profit institutions. Cash is now required to be a component.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that the proposed increase in current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assets will help to ensure that institutions have sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources to provide worthwhile education and training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary is proposing a higher ratio of current assets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to current liabilities ratio for for-profit institutions than for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonprofit institutions. The Secretary believes that a higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current ratio is necessary for for-profit institutions because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they will be less likely, in the event of hampered liquidity, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> draw on fund-raising as a source of cash. This rationale is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed later as part of the discussion of the proposed ratio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of current assets to current liabilities for nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to exclude from the calculation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this ratio for for-profit institutions, uncollateralized loans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receivable from owners and related parties. Uncollateralized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related party loans are loans that have been made to affiliates,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officers, or employees and have not been secured by tangible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assets. In accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin 43  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ARB43), chapter 3A, paragraph 6, the concept of current assets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contemplates the exclusion from that classification of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources as ``*&blank;*&blank;* (c) receivables arising from unusual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transactions (such as the sale of capital assets, or loans or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advances to affiliates, officers, or employees) that are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to be received within twelve (12) months''. In the event  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that certain financial statements present these types of loans on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the balance sheet, they will be disregarded by the Secretary in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computation of the current ratio.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, because the proposed cash reserve requirement may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause a portion of the institution's cash reserves to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classified as a restricted asset, which would, under generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accepted accounting principles, be excluded from classification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as current assets, the Secretary's proposal specifies that, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for-profit institutions, the cash reserves may be included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's current assets in calculating the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current assets to current liabilities ratio. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that it is appropriate to permit for-profit institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to treat the cash reserves as current assets because the funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are held for the benefit of the students, and inclusion of those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amounts toward demonstrating a 1.25:1 current ratio still leaves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution with sufficient unrestricted assets to pay all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Sport: Shots in the dark on night of the long drives - Golf WHAT WERE you doing just before midnight on Tuesday, March 9? Perhaps you have no idea; or perhaps you have and would rather I had not asked. So, instead, I will tell you what I was doing. As the witching hour approached, I was concluding a tryst with La Dama de Nocha in Marbella, Spain. Purely in the cause of research, you understand. You do not need to be fluent in Spanish to work out that La Dama de Nocha means Lady of the Night. This particular Lady of the Night is a nine-hole floodlit golf course - the first of its type in Europe. The idea for floodlit golf came to Herman Sauer, a Dane who owns the nearby Los Naranjos course, about five years ago. In short order, he leased land from the town hall, laid out the course, erected the massive lights and opened the pay-as-you-play layout last year. Obvious questions arise: No, you do not use luminous balls. Yellow are all right but white are better. Yes, you can hit the ball out of sight - but then, many golfers, Jack Nicklaus included, cannot see the flight of their ball in broad daylight. You do lose more balls at night - at least, I did, perhaps because I did not know the course. Yes, it is odd playing under artificial light. Make no mistake: La Dama de Nocha is not a pitch and putt course, nor a crazy golf course at a seaside resort. It is 2,728 metres (2,978 yards) long from the back tees and has two par threes, two par fives - one of 500 metres (546 yards) - and five par fours. This dame, even by night and lit skilfully, is no oil painting. She is narrow, bisected by the dry bed of the Rio Verde, and has an odd parcel of land at the far end, accessible only by walking under a road. But just as the shrub from which the course gets its name opens its flowers at night and sends out perfume, so the course is at its best when darkness falls. Then, its nine holes and rather sweet hexagonal clubhouse are bathed in a sort of eerie, incandescent glow. I teed-off at 9.45. To my left, the frogs were croaking furiously in a large pond. Figures moved mysteriously through the semi-darkness ahead and water sprinklers spun dizzily on adjoining holes, sending out hissing plumes of spray. From the first tee shot, it became clear that visibility was limited. You could see the ball easily for the first 50 yards or so - it soared away from the club looking like tracer fire. Then, it disappeared. On the first green, I was looking directly at a set of floodlights as I lined up the putt and was dazzled, much as I might be by the sun during the day. Leaves which lay on the greens and fairways glistened in the false light and, from a distance, looked like balls. The shadows on the green made it surprisingly difficult to spot the ball. On the short fourth, it worked in my favour, though. I hit a skinny six-iron across the water and listened carefully for a telltale plop. Silence. I was on dry land; that much I knew. I looked in the bunker and stood at the water's edge, peering into the murk. Nothing. I walked to the right of the green and to the left. Still nothing. Better check the flagstick, I thought; and there was my ball - close to the flag yet hidden among the shadows. Distances were hard to judge in the artificial light and, because the grass was so wet, there was no run on the ball, which made the course quite long. I managed to cope with these peculiarities. What was more difficult was playing a ball that lay in partial shadow. Because I could not see it clearly, my brain sent nervous messages to my arms. I did not swing confidently and the result was often a half-hit stroke. The only serious mistake I made was on the eighth. I played to the wrong green. But since this was the only hole on the course with two greens (you play the 17th on your second circuit), my mistake was understandable; the 17th was directly ahead of me whereas the eighth was at 90 degrees to the fairway. At 11.40, accompanied by a frog chorus, I holed out on the ninth green beneath the gleam of a full moon. As I walked to the clubhouse, a party of 28 cheerful Swedes, their dalliance with the Dame over, were tucking in to their dinner. No one has yet played through the night, although the possibilities for endless rounds of golf are obvious. The latest finishing time recorded is 3 am. Was it worth it? While it bore little comparison to nine holes at any of the famous courses nearby, such as Las Brisas and Aloha, it had been an unusual test of golf - and much more fun than doing the washing-up. I drove home beneath a starlit, velvet sky, singing.</p>

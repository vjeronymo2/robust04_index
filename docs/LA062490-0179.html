			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MIND BEHIND THE RELIGION;  </P> <P> CHURCH SCRIPTURES GET HIGH-TECH PROTECTION  </P> <P> Scientology is determined that the words of L. Ron Hubbard shall live forever.  </P> <P> Using state-of-the art technology, the movement has spent more than $15 million  to protect Hubbard's original writings, tape-recorded lectures and filmed  treatises from natural and man-made calamities, including nuclear holocaust.  </P> <P> The effort illustrates two fundamental truths about the Scientology movement:  It believes in its future and it never does anything halfheartedly.  </P> <P> In charge of the preservation task is the Church of Spiritual Technology, which  functions as archivist for Hubbard's works.  </P> <P> It has a staff -- but no congregation -- and its fiscal 1987 income was $503  million, according to court documents filed by the church.  </P> <P> The organization has purchased rural land in New Mexico, Northern California  and San Bernardino Mountains to store the Hubbard gospel.  </P> <P> According to Church of Spiritual Technology documents, the New Mexico site has  a 670-foot tunnel with two deep vaults at the end. The tunnel is protected with  thick concrete and has four doors with "maintenance-free lives of 1,000 years."  </P> <P> Three of the doors purportedly will be "nuclear blast resistant."  </P> <P> All this to house mere copies of the original works, which include 500,000  pages of Hubbard writings, 6,500 reels of tape and 42 films.The originals  themselves are being kept under tight security on a sprawling Scientology  complex near Lake Arrowhead.  </P> <P> While details of the facility are sketchy, a San Bernardino County sheriff's  deputy, who requested anonymity, said the group has burrowed a huge tunnel into  a mountainside.  </P> <P> At the Arrowhead repository, sophisticated methods are being used to prepare  Hubbard's works for the bomb-proof vaults. Here, according to Scientology  officials and documents, is the process:  </P> <P> First, the original writings are chemically treated to rid the paper of acid  that causes deterioration. Next, they are placed in plastic envelopes that  church officials say will last 1,000 years.  </P> <P> From there, they are packaged in titanium "time capsules" filled with argon gas  to further aid preservation.  </P> <P> Hubbard's writings also are being etched onto stainless steel plates with a  strong acid. Scientology officials said the plates are so durable that they can  be sprayed with salt water for 1,000 years and not deteriorate.  </P> <P> As for Hubbard's taped lectures, they are being re-recorded onto special "pure  gold" compact discs encased in glass that, according to Scientology archvists,  are "designed to last at least 1,000 years with no deterioration of sound  quality."

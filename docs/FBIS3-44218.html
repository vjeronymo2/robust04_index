			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Meetings and consultations on finances continue  at the prime minister's office. The topic on today's agenda was  the reduction by half of the value of the CFA franc in the franc  zone and its impact on the financial agreements between  financial backers and countries that share the use of the CFA  franc, which was devalued on 11 January. Our country Cote  d'Ivoire, which is very concerned about solving the problems  caused by this new economic situation, has been holding  discussions led by Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan, in  attempt to ensure the revamping of the Ivorian economy with the  support of international financial institutions.    Late this morning, Prime Minister Duncan granted audience to  an IMF delegation. The focus of the meeting was to sign the  letter of intent concerning the Ivorian economic program  endorsed by the IMF for the establishment of an enhanced  three-year structural adjustment program worth 281 billion CFA  francs. This program will enable the country to reach as early  as 1996--that is within two years--a 6-percent growth rate with,  in particular, the active resumption of investments to  consolidate and strengthen public finances, and finally, the  establishment of measures that will benefit the poorer  categories of the society.    [Begin Duncan recording] The particularity of this program  compared with previous ones is that it has been launched in the  aftermath of the devaluation of the CFA franc which was decided  by franc zone member countries. As a classic instrument of  economic policy, the modification of the exchange rate has its  constraints, the most important of them being the control of  prices, the control of monetary creation, and the resorption of  public deficit. The change in parity also brings about an  improvement in competitiveness and should play a decisive role  in the growth of our economy. Simultaneously, external aid will  make it possible to finance important economic and social  programs. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

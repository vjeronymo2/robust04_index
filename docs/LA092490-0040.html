			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP, JAZZ;  </P> <P> COLOSSUS OF SONNY ROLLINS  </P> <P> "Saxophone Colossus" is what Sonny Rollins was often called in the 1950s. And  the appellation made sense during an era in which his music overlooked the jazz  world with the vast presence of the legendary statue of Rhodes.  </P> <P> Today, at 60, Rollins is still arguably the finest jazz saxophonist in the  universe -- despite the growing importance of such players as Branford Marsalis  and Michael Brecker. But, as his one-night program at the Strand Saturday made  clear, he is a considerably different musician, in several respects, from what  he was 30 years ago.  </P> <P> First, Rollins now paces himself. Backed by a five-piece ensemble (with Clifton  Anderson on trombone, Jerome Harris on guitar, Mark Soskin on keyboards, Bob  Cranshaw on bass and Al Foster on drums) that provided a safe and comforting  setting, he played a series of extended solos, often interacting with the other  players, especially Foster.  </P> <P> When Rollins was hitting his high spots, the results were breathtaking --  sudden, brilliantly colored bursts of sound, body-moving rhythms and soaring  melodies.  </P> <P> But the high points only came in brief stretches. And, good as they were, they  took time to emerge, rarely achieving the full-out, nonstop, high-voltage  electricity of his earliest playing.  </P> <P> Rollins also seems to have become far more concerned with reaching out to  connect with his audience. Striding the stage restlessly, reaching down toward  his listeners to make a particularly salient point with his horn, he was a  virtual walking history of the saxophone. Hawkinsesque chromatics, Coltranesque  runs and Ornette Coleman flurries were offset with bar-walking honks, New  Orleans slap-tonguing and his own sun-drenched Caribbean rhythms.  </P> <P> Rollins seems to have become a performer who has found a way to ease  comfortably into his mature years while still retaining a strong connection  with the white-fire creative energy of his youth. At his best, the Colossus  that is Sonny Rollins still casts a potent shadow.  </P></p>

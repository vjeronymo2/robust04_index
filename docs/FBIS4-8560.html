			<p>BFN     [Text] The Serbian aggressor today again violated the  cease-fire agreement in the (?Sarajevo) area.    [Correspondent] Shortly before 1800, the residents of  Sarajevo were disturbed by powerful explosions in the area  around Vrbanja Most. This was yet another provocative (?attack)  by the chetniks, who used small arms and then fired several  cumulative [kumulativan] mortar shells at the defense lines from  the temporarily occupied territory of Grbavica. This marks the  continuations of attacks by the aggressor, who attacked the  [word indistinct] areas with mortars from its positions in [word  indistinct] Dol [passage indistinct].</p>

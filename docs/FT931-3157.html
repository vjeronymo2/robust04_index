			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Escudo knocked by conflicting signals: A crisis of confidence after Portuguese central bank deputy chief's resignation PORTUGAL'S financial markets, disoriented by contradictory signals from the government and the central bank, lapsed yesterday into a crisis of confidence after the resignation last Thursday of the bank's deputy governor in an apparent policy rift with the government. The Bank of Portugal said it had again had to intervene to defend the escudo from speculation as the currency opened at a low Es93 to the D-mark. Heavy central bank buying through the day drove it back up to Es92.63, dealers said. Immediately after the resignation of Mr Antonio Borges the escudo fell to a record low of Es94. The crisis stems from government ambiguity about whether it intends to maintain a policy of a strong escudo and high interest rates or it is preparing to relax exchange-rate and monetary policy to foster faster growth. 'The government has left the market perplexed about whether its is preparing an about-turn in economic policy or it plans to maintain its tough stance,' said Mr Jose Tavares Moreira, a former governor of the Bank of Portugal. The crisis seems almost unreal. Until now, the centre-right Social Democratic government and the central bank have worked closely together in pursuing a strong escudo and tight monetary policy as the key weapons against Portuguese inflation, which fell from 11.4 per cent in 1991 to 8.9 per cent in 1992. But not everybody is celebrating. Expensive money and high export prices caused by the strength of the escudo are taking a heavy toll in agriculture and traditional industries such as textiles, garments and footwear. Protests from industry are constant and farmers have tipped wine and potatoes they are unable to market on the steps of government offices. 'These are difficulties of the transition of the Portuguese economy that were foreseeable as soon as we joined the EC in 1986,' says Mr Miguel Namorado Rosa, chief economist with Banco Comercial Portugues. Mr Borges at the central bank had also often warned of the casualties that Portugal would face when it came to transferring resources from non-competitive to competitive sectors. He was respected for his firm line and professional competence and appeared to have full government backing. But doubts were raised about the government's commitment to the fight against inflation in a speech last Thursday by Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, finance minister. He called the central bank to task for not listening to the needs of the real economy and for not lowering interest rates faster. The immediate result was Mr Borges's resignation and deep concern in the financial markets. Was the government now going for growth at the expense of inflation? Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, had just fueled market suspicions by announcing an Es270bn (Pounds 1.22bn) housing programme to wipe out shanty towns and slum dwellings that would boost the construction industry. He admitted the programme would worsen the budget deficit. But the Bank of Portugal already enjoys considerable independence and it seems clear that Mr Borges was expected to ignore the finance minister's remarks. There are important local elections in Portugal in December and the minister may, analysts believe, simply have been trying to make the right noises. The government, though, is in a bind of its own making. With the elections in view, it cannot openly reverse its calls for lower interest rates but it badly needs to repair the damage it has done to the escudo. 'The finance minister's speech was for consumption by worried industrialists, farmers and commercial companies,' says Mr Namorado Rosa. 'The aim is to give the impression that the government wants to be more flexible but in reality nothing is going to change.' Supporting this view is the fact that Mr Miguel Beleza, governor of the Bank of Portugal, has stayed at his post. The central bank has even edged up its intervention rates slightly.</p>

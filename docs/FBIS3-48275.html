			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Japanese Government and the auto industrial  circles have begun to study the possibility of working out a  voluntary plan aimed at increasing procurement of U.S.-made auto  parts in connection with the deadlocked Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks on auto and auto parts. This was disclosed by a  source connected with the Japan-U.S. negotiations on 23 January.    The details of this voluntary plan include promotion of the  "Design-In" Project, according to which American and Japanese  auto parts makers will join in the new product development from  the stage of designing; and plan to lay groundwork for  increasing procurement of U.S.-made auto parts through such  measures as promotion of joint ventures to be established by  Japanese and U.S. makers. However, it will probably be all the  more a tough choice for Japanese makers because they are faced  with several difficulties such as sluggish sales on the domestic  market and a continuous drop in their share of the U.S. market.    The priority has been given to the negotiations on auto and  auto parts so that an accord can be reached before the  Japan-U.S. summit scheduled for 11 February. The United States  demands that Japan should not only increase its target of  importing auto parts (in the amount of $19 billion for fiscal  1994), which was worked out by Japan in January 1992 as the auto  industrial circles' voluntary plan but also extend this target  even after fiscal 1995. In fact, the United States demands that  substantial numerical targets be set. In response, Japan has  rejected setting targets and sharp confrontations have continued  between the two countries. The situation now indicates "no  progress even by an inch has been made in negotiations," (as  stated by U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten).  Maintaining that it is impossible to reach an accord before the  February summit, the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI] and the Japan Automobile Manufacturers'  Association, Inc. [JAMAI] have begun to suggest a plan to extend  negotiations until the next summit talks.    However, the fact remains that export of auto and auto parts  accounts for 60 percent of Japan's trade surplus to the United  States and that the U.S. market is of the greatest importance to  Japanese makers. Therefore, it is necessary to work out a  compromise that will satisfy the United States to a certain  extent. U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce Garten arrived in Japan  last week for a visit and he has asked all the auto makers for  their cooperation. Reportedly, he got the impression that  "Japanese makers have begun to realize the importance of the  U.S. market and to seek ways to break the deadlock," (according  to a high-ranking U.S. Government official). Moreover,  favorable signs of compromise have begun to appear at long last.  For example, JAMAI Chairman Yutaka Kume expressed at a news  conference on 20 January positive views about the prospects for  setting up joint ventures. It is observed that the study of the  voluntary plan is part of such moves.    By preparing conditions for increasing the original target  of  $19 billion, Japan's intention lies in concluding the  "theological argument" over the propriety of setting numerical  targets so as to proceed to substantial negotiations. However,  due to the sluggish situation of the auto industry, "it is  difficult to attain the target of $19 billion," (according to a  MITI source). Even if the voluntary plan should be worked out,  there is a strong possibility that the United States will  threaten Japan with sanctions if the situation unfavorable to  the United States should continue to exist. Thus, it is expected  that drastic confrontations may continue between Japan and the  United States over the interpretation of the issue.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Banana fungicide poisoning Ecuadorean shrimps The Ecuadorean shrimp industry faces multi-million dollar losses for the second year in a row as a water pollution problem continues to hit production. In 1993 the industry suffered a Dollars 70m loss as toxic waste polluted the shrimp farms' water supply and cut production by about 16 per cent from the previous year's level. Recent studies have established that the toxic substances originate from nearby banana plantations, where fungicides are used to control the black sigatoka disease. Washed into rivers and the Gulf of Guayaquil by rain water, the toxins enter the shrimp cultivating pools, deforming and ultimately killing the larvae. Shrimp farmers insist that the shrimps that are being exported pose no health threat to consumers as the level of toxicity being encountered is too minute to affect humans. The so-called Taura syndrome, named after the area in Ecuador where it first appeared, has been spreading steadily since it was first discovered in late 1992. It puts at loggerheads the country's two largest non-petroleum export earners. While banana industry officials claim they have no alternative but to use the commercially available pesticides, shrimp farmers argue that the enormous quantity of toxins are endangering the entire eco-system, not only the shrimp industry. Says Mr Harold Muller of the National Aquaculture Association: 'Shrimp are a type of bio-indicator. If they cannot survive in a given environment, you'd know something is wrong with the ecological balance'. Indeed, the outbreak of the Taura Syndrome puts an end to the image of Ecuador being a haven for shrimp-growing because of its pristine waters. Taiwanese shrimp farmers who flocked to Ecuador to escape polluted waters in their country are now worrying whether the pollution will reach their shrimp farms in the southern region of the country's Pacific coast. According to Mr Muller, the principal toxins responsible for the deaths of larvae are the fungicides propiconazole (Tilt) and tridemorph (Calixin). He says the banana growers are combating a disease that won't go away, while the effect of their fumigation is killing millions of dollars worth of shrimp. Neither of the fungicides is able to eliminate the sigatoka disease. They are only effective in preventing its spread. Representatives of the Dollars 500m shrimp industry are calling for a complete moratorium on the use of the fungicide and for a government evaluation of the alternatives to its use. According to the president of the National Acuaculture Association, Alex Aguayo, the government ought to study the feasibility of introducing other types of banana trees that are more resistant to the sigatoka disease, thereby reducing the need for fumigation. In a seminar sponsored by one of the chemical companies producing the controversial toxins, leading marine biologists from around the world recommended to the Ecuadorean government a moratorium on the use of fungicides in the Guayas river basin. The government has formed a multi-sector commission to develop a strategy in response to the phenomena, which is unique to Ecuador. But shrimp farmers say action is needed now. They claim their survival is at stake, not only because of the Taura syndrome, but because of the rising production costs caused by movements of the national currency, the sucre. In the last 16 months costs have risen by 70 per cent while the Sucre sales price has remained stable.</p>

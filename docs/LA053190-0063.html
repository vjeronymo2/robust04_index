			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> About 200 residents of the 16-story Villa Riviera in Long Beach are holding an  invitation-only party Friday to celebrate a true California-type milestone for  the 62-year-old landmark:  </P> <P> The completion of its seismic bolstering.  </P> <P> Have the Raiders' apparently unsuccessful negotiations with the cities of  Oakland, Sacramento, Irwindale and L.A. all been a smoke screen? Has the  Raiders' wily Al Davis secretly been bargaining with a fifth city all along?  </P> <P> We may find out today when Kagan Management Services Inc. holds a 3 p.m. press  conference to unveil plans for "a 75,000-seat outdoor stadium" in the city of .  . .  </P> <P> Fontana.  </P> <P> The latest entries to be accepted for our projected "Malathion Song Book" -- a  companion volume to our projected "Golden Treasury of Malathion Poems" -- are:  </P> <P> Tim Smight's "Medfly Hillbillies" (tune: "Beverly Hillbillies" theme), Randy  Larscheid's "Malathion Aisle" (tune: "Gilligan's Island" theme), Carol  Williams' "Helicopters in the Morning" (tune: "Carolina in the Morning") and  Betty Darling's "Poison from Hell" (tune: "Pennies from Heaven").  </P> <P> We're still not sure what to do with "The Lady Medfly's Lament" (tune:  "Humoresque") by Jeff Williamson, which some radio stations might refuse to  play because of its frank lyrics. It begins:  </P> <P> Every evening at Club Med, I drag some bozo off to bed . . . "  </P> <P>  Yes . . . well . . . we'll have to skip to the tamer finish:  </P> <P>  All the guys you meet these days have been exposed to gamma rays.  </P> <P>  Their DNAs have been bent way out of line.  </P> <P>  Those who've lost their insect-hood and cannot do me any good,  </P> <P>  Need not pretend they're any friends of mine.  </P> <P> You think vote-counting was slow in the old days. . . .  </P> <P> A Hollywood resident, seeking sample ballots, received a letter signed by L.A.  County Registrar-Recorder Charles Weissburd that twice referred to "the June 6  primary election."  </P> <P> Our calendar -- and all those candidates' ads -- insist the election is  Tuesday, June 5.  </P> <P> Responding to our plea for overlooked solutions to promote water conservation,  Robert Dean of Sherman Oaks writes:  </P> <P> "Let's return to the odd-even days of the mid-'70s gasoline crunch.  Odd-numbered street addresses would have their water turned off on  even-numbered days and vice-versa for the even-numbered households.  </P> <P> "We'd still have the lines outside the gas stations, but this time it would be  people wanting to use the bathrooms."  </P> <P> </P> <P> LAny:  </P> <P> The last great train robbery in California was pulled near Saugus in 1928.  </P></p>

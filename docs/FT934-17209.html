			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Better lending terms for small businesses urged BELGIUM, which holds the EC presidency, yesterday proposed improving loan terms from banks and lower taxes to help pull small and medium-sized businesses in Europe out of recession, Reuter reports from Brussels. The European Community had to do more to help these companies, which employ 75 per cent of the EC workforce, Mr Andre Bourgeois, Belgian minister for small and medium-sized companies, said yesterday. More than 99 per cent of the EC's 15.7m private-sector companies would be affected - with more than 14.5m employing fewer than nine people apiece, according to Commission statistics. Belgian companies employing fewer than 50 people pay corporate tax at 28 per cent, while larger companies pay 39 per cent. Most EC countries have only one rate. The minister's EC proposal does not specify what level of corporate tax should be set EC-wide for smaller businesses. The European Commission is working on a proposal which would leave such businesses free to choose between corporate tax and a tax on revenue, a Commission official told Reuter. 'Corporate tax is better for companies that invest a lot, but tax on revenue could help a lot of small ones,' he said. Mr Bourgeois welcomed Spain's decision last week to exempt from tax for a year corporate profits kept back and reinvested. The Belgian plan, which will be discussed by ministers in charge of the EC's single market in November, also calls for better access to bank loans at better rates but some fear it will only remain a set of good intentions. Mr Bourgeois expressed concern about the lack of progress in setting up the European Investment Fund agreed by the EC summit in Edinburgh last December. The Ecu2bn (Dollars 2.3bn) fund to finance EC-wide infrastructure networks and help small and medium-sized companies create jobs is still far from being launched, thanks in particular to the lack of interest shown by private banks in contributing to its capital. A proposal to subsidise loans to small businesses by up to 3 percentage points is also blocked. 'The 3 per cent proposal was questioned by Britain,' Mr Robert Urbain, Belgian external trade and European affairs minister, said.</p>

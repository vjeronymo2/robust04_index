			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Japanese manufacturers 'comfortable in Europe' JAPANESE manufacturers feel comfortable about their presence in Europe and indicate that, to avoid conflict, localisation of operations and management is essential. A recent survey of manufacturers, carried out by the Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro), showed the number of companies with at least 10 per cent Japanese ownership operating in Europe increased to 676 at end-January, a 27.8 per cent year-on-year rise. Among these 676, 187 chose the UK as their base, 122 France, 109 Germany, and 64 Spain, 39 Italy, and 36 the Netherlands. The survey suggests the reasons were ease of distribution, availability of English-speaking managers, a pool of skilled workers, and a developed infrastructure. Almost half the companies responding expressed optimism about relationships with their local communities. But some 20 per cent expressed concerns about employee friction triggered by lack of localisation of management or by Japanese-style management. Reasons for setting up in Europe were given as avoiding problems with anti-dumping actions, and reinforcing R&amp;D in Europe. About 40 per cent said local content of purchased parts had increased.</p>

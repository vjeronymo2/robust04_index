			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hubs offer transport economy Sir, You would expect us in telecoms to welcome Giles Keating's Personal View (October 31) about the use of information technology to address the realities of the transport problem. I should like to develop his thinking in my capacity as a prisoner of the M25 London orbital motorway. As he says we have grown accustomed to the predictability and door-to-door security of auto travel, such as they are. We may feel we ought to use trains; but not only are they dirty and erratic, they never go to the right place. If one has to get oneself or one's goods to and from the railhead anyway it is easier to go the whole way by car or lorry. Modern airports have become hubs in highly developed hire vehicle networks almost without us noticing. It would need only a minimum of investment, of organising skill and of imagination to turn stations into similar hubs for highly organised short-distance networks of buses and hire cars to homes and offices. Similarly, railway goods depots would be natural hubs for goods container services to and from factories and shops, on the analogy of container shipping. Mr Keating's information networks would optimise the economics of both operations from the outset. Once this key obstacle was cracked rail traffic would build up so fast there would be more than enough cash to put more trains on to run; to make them run on time; and even to clean the coaches.

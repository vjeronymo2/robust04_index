			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Smith visits Vane Tempest LABOUR LEADER John Smith, accompanied by Durham miners general secretary David Hopper, yesterday visited the threatened County Durham colliery of Vane Tempest, Chris Tighe writes. Mr Smith urged the public to keep up the pressure on the government to reverse the 'foolish' decision to close 31 collieries. In the first of a series of visits by senior opposition politicians to every coalfield in Britain, Mr Smith challenged the prime minister to go to see at first hand the impact of the proposed closures on Britain's energy reserves and on mining communities. He said coal was one of Britain's important energy resources but the government had 'rigged' the market after electricity privatisation. 'It's a deliberate result of the electricity privatisation and the dash for gas,' he said. 'It's folly from the national interest point of view, and it's the government we look to to protect our national interest.' Mr Smith, wearing a Coal Not Dole sticker, said he had come to the Durham coalfield to show that Labour was standing fully behind the miners and their communities in their campaign. After a brief meeting with Mr Tony Gray, Vane Tempest colliery manager, he met miners from Westoe and Wearmouth collieries in Tyne and Wear, among the 21 pits whose future will be decided by the government's review, and from Vane Tempest, which has slim prospects beyond the present 90-day consultation period. In nearby Easington he met miners' families and community and church leaders. British Coal says 215 of Vane Tempest's 870 miners have taken voluntary redundancy in the past three weeks and another 12 have transferred jobs.</p>

			<p>Continuing     earlier signs that Beijing would reward France for its  accommodating stance on Taiwan arms sales by expanding Sino-  French aviation cooperation, Beijing has recently announced  contracts with the French-based European consortium Airbus  Industrie (Xinhua, 4,6 March).  According to a Xinhua report of 6  March, Airbus has reached an agreement worth "tens of millions of  U.S. dollars" with China Aviation Supplies Corporation for  production of aircraft parts in a move that reportedly will  "increase Airbus' share in the potentially huge China market."  Xinhua also reported on 4 March that Chinese airlines have  recently announced plans to purchase nine aircraft from Airbus  (Xinhua, March 4).  Following the restoration of bilateral ties  in January, and a French pledge to reverse France's previous  policy of selling arms to Taiwan, China awarded a major subway  contract to a French firm.  Beijing had previously shunned French  companies to protest a November 1992 French decision to sell  Mirage jet fighters to Taiwan.  (AUTHOR: SIMON.

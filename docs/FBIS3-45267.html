			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 14 (XINHUA) -- The PEOPLE'S DAILY  [RENMIN RIBAO], the leading national newspaper, carries a signed  article today, hailing the role of Deng Xiaoping in promoting  the opening up and development of the Pudong New Area in  Shanghai, the country's largest industrial city.    Written by Huang Qifan, the article says that Deng Xiaoping  was the originator of the policy of opening the Pudong New Area  to the outside world and turning it into a development zone.    After inspecting Shanghai and returning to Beijing in early  1990, the article reveals, Deng told leaders of the Political  Bureau of the Central Committee of the ruling Communist Party of  China (CPC) that although he had retired, he still had to remind  them of the importance of the development of the Pudong area.    In April 1990 the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council, the country's supreme governing bodies, officially  announced an important decision on the opening up and  development of the Pudong area, listing it as a national focal  point of the country's opening and development projects in the  following ten years.    Deng pointed out that the opening up of Shanghai would bring  about great changes to the Chang Jiang Delta, the Chang Jiang  Valley and even the whole country.    After listening to a report about the work of the  development  of the Pudong area delivered by Zhu Rongji, then mayor of  Shanghai, in February 1991, Deng said, "Finance is important.  It is the core of a modern economy. If financial work is done  well it will be easy to get everything done well. Shanghai used  to be a banking center, where various currencies could be  exchanged freely. It is necessary to return to this practice.  China's hope for occupying an international position in finance  should first be pinned on Shanghai."    Following Deng's instructions, Shanghai has given priority  to  finance in the development of the Pudong area. In the past  three years 38 new domestic and overseas financial enterprises  have been set up in Shanghai. The total deposits in the banks  in Pudong have reached 25 billion yuan, while the banks' loans  have amounted to 24 billion yuan -- about 12 times the figures  for 1990. Meanwhile, the stock market, and insurance and other  financial businesses have developed rapidly, thus greatly  promoting the development of various industries such as  construction and commerce.    Deng also showed great concern about the development of  infrastructure and high-tech industries in the Pudong New Area.  He has repeatedly stressed the importance of building several  bridges over the Huangpu River in the area and the importance of  focusing funds on construction projects in the power,  communications and other infrastructural sectors. Besides, he  pointed out that quick economic development depended on science,  technology and education. A breakthrough in the field of  high-technology will bring about the development of many  industries, he noted.    The article also discloses that in the past few years Deng  has given many instructions on development of the Pudong area.  He once urged Shanghai people to further broaden their minds,  be bolder and quicken their pace in the opening up and  development of the Pudong area. Last year in Shanghai Deng  called on Shanghai people to continue to make efforts, overcome  difficulties and strive for further achievements.    The article lists various achievements Shanghai has made in  opening up and developing the Pudong area, and says that Deng's  strategic policies have been carried out in the course of this  opening up and development.</p>

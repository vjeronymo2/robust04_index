			<p>BFN     [Text] With the rice supply running short, the business of  agencies importing rice for personal consumption via the  international postal service is growing. Although in principle  the Foodstuff Control Law bans rice imports, it makes an  exception by allowing a person to import up to 100 kg of rice a  year through the international postal service. Businesses have  been importing rice from the United States, China, and  Australia. The rice has nearly the same taste as Japanese-grown  rice. Japanese consumers are increasingly showing their  interest in the rice because they can legally buy the rice at  low prices. For this reason, a growing number of Japanese  consumers have been buying the rice. The Food Agency has become  increasingly wary of the personal importation of rice through  the international postal service, saying, the systemic agency  business for personal rice imports is problematic.    The Akita Citizen Consumer Cooperative (headed by Nobuo  Takayama with its head office located in Akita City) embarked on  the business of importing rice from China on 20 April. The  imported Chinese rice will be sold to its members at the head  office and at cooperative run retail stores. The cooperative  intends to import the Chinese rice grown and harvested in  Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Lianoning Provinces. The cooperative  plans to receive orders from its members by 8 May and will then  import the Chinese rice when the orders reach 30 tons. The  imported Chinese rice will be shipped to members by mail.    The imported Chinese rice will sell for 3,500 yen per 10 kg,  which includes postal charges and consumption tax. The  cooperative intends to import the Chinese rice in cooperation  with the volunteer group non-governmental organization (NGO) and  the Japan Technology Development Assistance Organization's  Dailian office, which is in charge of making business contacts  with Chinese rice suppliers and of shipping the rice to Japan by  air. For this reason, each member hoping to buy the Chinese  rice is required to pay a 500 yen NGO membership fee.    Universal Export's Japan branch office (in Kuroishi City,  Aomori Prefecture), an American trading firm in Seattle,  Washington, has imported Australian rice to Japan since late  last year. The Australian rice is grown in New South Wales and  the office places orders upon receiving purchase requests from  Japanese consumers. The Australian rice has been sold for 9,900  yen per 18 kg and 10,450 yen per 19 kg. The Australian rice is  transported by ship to Hong Kong and then shipped to Japan by  air because of high international postal rates. According to  the American branch office, it has received orders for 50 tons.    Imos Corporation [name as published], a Japanese trading  firm  based in California, supplies Californian rice to Japanese  consumers via Hong Kong. President Hiroshi Ishikawa originally  planned to import the Californian rice by air to sell to  Japanese consumers, but later shelved the plan and decided to  set up his company in California out of fear that the systematic  importation of foreign rice through the international postal  service might violate the Foodstuff Control Law. His company  has sold the California rice upon receiving customer orders for  $75 per 18 kg.    Rice importation through the international postal service  has  been allowed as an exceptional measure for personal consumption.  Toshihiko Tsuruoka, Food Agency director general, told a House  of Representative's Committee on Agriculture, Forestry, and  Fisheries session last May that the Food Agency would allow a  person to import 100 kg of rice a year. His statement drew  attention at the time. The Food Agency takes the position of not  allowing any systematic rice importation through the  international postal service. But the rice imported through the  international postal service is popular among Japanese consumers  because it is cheaper than the domestic rice and taste almost  the same. On many occasions, public organizations have not  checked whether the rice imported through the international  postal service carries pesticides or mold. Therefore, importing  foreign rice is likely to raise sanitary safety questions.</p>

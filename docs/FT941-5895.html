			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Former airline chief issues BA writ Mr Harry Goodman, former chairman and chief executive of Air Europe and International Leisure Group, last night said he had issued a writ against British Airways and a number of its directors, managers and agents. Air Europe collapsed in March 1991 with debts of about Pounds 400m and the loss of more than 3,000 jobs. It is thought that the writ could relate to allegations last May that BA sought to investigate and then destabilise Air Europe.</p>

How can this interim period be described?    [Alphandery] It is a transitional phase and therefore has  highs and lows, and variable results according to the sectors.  The United States experienced that in 1992 before returning to  clear growth. Getting out of a recession is always  characterized by up- and downward movements. In France, the  economy certainly grew very modestly and at a rate which was  scarcely perceptible in the second and third quarters of 1993  (up 0.2 percent in each), whereas the beginning of the fourth  quarter was marked by an upsurge in activity.  <H5>  Positive Signs </H5>   [Robin] What signs now make you feel fairly optimistic and  which suggest that the lowest point has really been passed?    [Alphandery] There are at least two positive signs. First,  the order and export sales books are filling up considerably,  which reflects both an improvement in the international  environment and the high level of competitiveness which our  products have. Moreover, the demand for houses is improving; in  September, October, and November, there was a 10-percent  increase in new homes started, and planning applications for new  houses increased by 12 percent over the previous three months.    Another encouraging sign is that inquiries into the economic  situation among corporate managers show a return of optimism.  Better prospects for economic activity are emerging, especially  in the opinion poll carried out very recently by the small- and  medium- sized enterprises' capital fund.    [Robin] Surely the most worrying sign on this instrument  panel is the psychological factor, the feeling of anxiety which  is prompting a kind of consumption stop.    [Alphandery] It is true that consumer spending has become  irregular for some time. It had increased by 0.6 to 0.7 percent  in the second and third quarters and was moving in the wrong  direction at the beginning of the fall. It is increasing partly  thanks to the sales. We will closely monitor the consumer  figures for December and January when there are widespread  promotional sales, in order to form a more accurate view of the  trend.  <H5>  Confidence a Key Factor </H5>   [Alphandery continues] The confidence felt by households and  managers chiefs is obviously a key factor in the recovery. The  change in climate will come as progress is made. The strong  reduction in interest rates, which we recorded, has begun to  produce positive effects, particularly by reducing the  enterprises' financial costs. In this context of a gradual  return of confidence, our economic growth forecasts of 1.4  percent in 1994 have no reason to be changed for the time being.  Among other things, they are based on an expected 0.7-percent  increase in household consumption, which is, after all, modest.  It is modest because it would be enough, for intance, for the  French to turn just 5 percent of their savings in SICAV's  [Open-End Investment Company] into consumer spending to achieve  this increase.    [Robin] Are the French leaders right to constantly highlight  international constraints, as if we really had no freedom to  solve our own problems? Why stick to what is happening in  Germany, is this not a resigned attitude?    [Alphandery] It is important to realize that, in our  economies, which are very open to the outside world, it is not  possible to pursue an economic policy which runs completely  counter to the international environment. The unfortunate  experience of 1981 must serve as a lesson. Of course, the  situation in Germany, which is our main customer, is not very  buoyant. Growth there will be at best between 0 and 1 percent  this year. But, fortunately, there are other parts of the world  which are attracting foreign demand: The recovery in North  America is considerable and it is already having beneficial  effects in France and in Europe.  <H5>  Crediblity Restored </H5>   [Alphandery continues] Moreover, there are means of action,  even in the present context. And we cannot be accused of doing  nothing. Despite little financial room to maneuver, we have  succeeded in pursuing an imaginative policy of supporting  economic activity by mobilizing short-term saving by the French  people. That has been done in particular through the Balladur  loan issue which served as an interim measure, pending  privatizations, to finance measures to promote the housing  sector and the small- and medium- sized enterprises in  particular. Finally, we have taken significant measures to  ensure the recovery of state and social security accounts.    These provisions, which are certainly painful at the start,  have not been without effect. For instance, the credibility  restored to our monetary policy has made it possible to  virtually wipe out our interest rate differential with Germany.  In so doing, we have succeeded in creating a more favorable  climate for recovery.    [Robin] The French people have only recently rediscovered  the market economy and its cyclical fluctuations, which are  well-known facts in the United States. What are you saying to  them to make them accept that such developments are normal and  are better than the rigid and interventionist economic system  which has prevailed in our country since 1945?    [Alphandery] The previous recession in France dates back to  1975 and was the result of the first oil crisis. When the world  was suffering the effects of the second oil crisis in the early  eighties, France thought it could escape them by pursuing a  counter-cyclical policy. It must be admitted that the recession  was avoided temporarily but at what a cost! It subsequently  gave us permanently slower growth. Our economy only returned to  cruising speed from 1988, whereas the United States, Germany,  and Japan returned to growth as early as 1983.    [Robin] The recession of the nineties lasted three years,  assuming it is now over. Does it not reflect more fundamental  problems? What is this feeling of doom which prevails among  many French people?    [Alphandery] The recession appears to be so painful in our  country because it is accompanied by the need to tackle some  major structural problems, especially on the employment front.  The two phenomena must not be confused. In 1988, amid economic  euphoria, France already had a 9-percent unemployment rate, much  higher than in Germany and the United States. The Japanese  economy experienced a serious recession in 1993. And yet the  unemployment rate is still around 2.5 percent.    [Robin] The prime minister has just admitted that "the  crisis is even worse than we thought when we came to power." In  what respect in particular?    [Alphandery] In March 1993, everybody still underestimated  the scale of the recession which we had inherited. It had grown  considerably worse from fall 1992. We only realized that six  months later when the final figures for the fourth quarter of  1992 and the first quarter of 1993 were known.  <H5>  Not In Favor of Social VAT </H5>   [Alphandery continues] It is clear that the employment  problem will not automatically be solved with the end of the  recession. The Giraud law's five-year employment plan clearly  identified the three key factors on which we must take action.  First, the lack of flexibility in the job market; the law  contains several initial responses on this point, like the  annual calculation of working hours or the services voucher.  Second, the lack of professional qualification. Hence the  training-in-the-job contracts [contrats d'insertion]. Finally,  the efforts to reduce social security contributions on low  wages: 10 billion francs [Fr] have been allocated to that in  the 1994 budget.    We must just take care to ensure that the remedies do not  have contraindications which would be likely to cancel out their  positive effects. Would not an increase in VAT to finance new  reductions in social security contributions now reduce  consumption, the rate of which we must, instead, sustain? That  is why I am not campaigning for a social VAT.    [Robin] The government's economic policy was primarily  aimed at restoring a balance to the public accounts. You wanted  to restore confidence in the French people worried at seeing the  deficits threatening their social security system. This was the  reason for increasing the CSG [general social contribution].  Does the result live up to your expectations?    [Alphandery] I think so; we obviously first had to reassure  the French people about the future of their social security. As  for the increase in the CSG, by helping to restore credibility  to our economic policy, it made it easier to reduce interest  rates. This resulted in savings of Fr60 billion for the  enterprises and Fr15 billion for the state. What would have  happened without that?    [Robin] Some economists are accusing the government of  emphasizing a policy of supply to overcome the crisis, whereas  it is demand which is lacking. Francois Mitterrand has taken up  this idea, referring to the Fr80 billion given to the  enterprises without any effects on employment. What is your  answer?    [Alphandery] It is true that we have made a considerable  effort, especially with regard to the small- and medium-sized  enterprises, through the reimbursement of VAT. In so doing we  have been able to avoid additional bankruptcies, as is shown by  the trend recorded in the last months of 1993 when the number of  bankruptcies fell. At the same time, we took several important  measures to help households; families not liable for tax  received a higher grant for the beginning of the new school  year, and income tax has been reduced by Fr19 billion.    The balance between supporting demand and strengthening  supply seems satisfactory, because we must prepare the ground  for a healthy recovery.    [Robin] On another front, you have been accused of pursuing  a monetary policy which does not correspond to the internal  requirements of the French economy which would have justified a  larger cut in interest rates, or even a devaluation of the  franc. Do you think the debate is finally over?    [Alphandery] The interest rate cut made over the past nine  months is impressive. France is now among the countries with  the lowest rates in Europe. This is particularly true for  long-term rates of between 2 and 10 years with which the  enterprises and the state can finance themselves for a rate of  less than 6 percent. With regard to shorter-term rates, the  reduction in interest rates is continuing, and we are already  very close to countries like Britain which devalued their  currencies in the hope of securing lower interest rates. I note  that those economies have short-term rates of more than 5  percent, whereas the United States and Japan have been able to  reduce their interest rates to 3 percent or less. Nobody in  Europe has managed to do that yet. It is a difficult fact to  explain but one which affects everybody.    [Robin] The deterioration in public deficits has been abrupt  in France, so much so that those deficits are now relatively  higher than in Germany, according to OECD estimates. How do you  explain this phenomenon? Is the French economy, with its very  high compulsory contributions, impossible to manage in a period  of recession?    [Alphandery] Our predecessors gave us a poisoned chalice  with public and social security deficits much higher than  expected. Such deficits are worrying and they must be  eradicated, which we have started to do at the cost of  temporarily increasing the compulsory contributions. But,  ultimately, we must have the aim of reducing the compulsory  contributions which are an obstacle to the creation of wealth  and a source of unemployment. Hence the five-year plan to  reduce the budget deficit which aims essentially to control  public spending.    We should beware of comparisons with our partners. Taking  all spending into account, the public deficit in France is no  higher that we are seeing in Germany, in particular.</p>

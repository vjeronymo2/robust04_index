			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / International Company News: Baseball strike holds back John Labatt John Labatt, the Canadian brewing and entertainment group, posted a small increase in earnings for the half year, with beer gains largely offset by the impact of the strike by baseball players in North America and the ice hockey lock-out. Labatt, which is the majority shareholder of the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team, said that the strike, which began in August, lopped CDollars 13m (USDollars 10m), or 14 cents a share, off earnings in the three months to October 31. SkyDome, Toronto's sports stadium in which Labatt has a 41 per cent stake, was hit by the strike. Net earnings edged up to CDollars 107m, or CDollars 1.09, for the six months to October 31, from CDollars 104m, or CDollars 1.06, a year earlier. Second-quarter earnings slipped to CDollars 45m, or 46 cents, from CDollars 47m, or 48 cents. Six-month sales, which climbed to CDollars 1.77bn from CDollars 1.32bn, were lifted by a four-fold jump in revenues at BCL, Labatt's live entertainment arm, due to sell-out tours by rock groups Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones. Plans to spin off the bulk of the broadcast and entertainment businesses have been delayed by the baseball and hockey disputes. Mr George Taylor, chief executive, said the company intended to announce details of the disposal of non-core assets by the end of next April. Labatt, which has extensive brewing interests in the UK and Italy, acquired a 22 per cent stake in Femsa Cerveza, Mexico's largest brewer, in September. Financial results from Femsa have so far exceeded expectations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 1 -- Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak  emphasised Poland's need and desire for greater economic  cooperation with Japan on Wednesday. Speaking after his meeting  with the chairman of the Japan-Poland Economic Committee,  Toshikuni Yahiro, he said that "Poland's good economic results  will contribute to ensuring that it is based on partnership and  will be beneficial to both sides."    Pawlak emphasised that Polish-Japanese trade was increasing.  He recalled the important speech of Eijiro Hato, Japan's  minister for international trade and industry, concerning the  readiness of the Japanese Government to remove the barriers to  short term trade loan and long term investment loan guarantees  for Poland.    Toshikuni Yahiro said that the fifteenth session of the  Polish-Japanese economic committees which had taken place after  an almost four year break had opened up a new stage in  cooperation between the two countries. He added that on his  return to Japan he would urge his government to increase  economic contacts with Poland.    Toshikuni Yahiro said that 1994 was a good year for  strengthening economic links since Japan was beginning to  recover from a three year recession and Poland had the best  ecnomic results of all the central and east European countries.</p>

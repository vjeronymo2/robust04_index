			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA's database which serves as the basis for the May 13 proposed rule for marine vessels does not identify which loading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and unloading operations occur at refineries as opposed to other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types of plants. However, the EPA has no data to indicate that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marine vessel loading operations at refineries are dissimilar to marine vessel loading operations located at other facilities or that their control levels differ. Therefore, the EPA anticipates that the floors for neither the petroleum refinery nor the marine vessel rules would be affected by redefining the source categories as described.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the EPA expands the refinery source category to include marine vessel loading and unloading operations, loading operations at refineries would have an opportunity to average emissions and reduce costs. In addition, they would be required to achieve additional emission reductions in accordance with the 10 percent discount requirement contained in the emissions averaging provisions. Loading operations that stand alone would not have this same opportunity to reduce costs. Public comment is solicited on the magnitude of these impacts and the appropriateness of this distinction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some marine terminals handle products with low concentrations of HAP's but high concentrations of non-HAP VOC. In such circumstances, it may be cost-effective to forego control of HAP's from marine terminals by over controlling HAP's from another emission point. If, however, the emission point being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled does not offset the non-HAP VOC foregone by not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlling the marine terminals, a net increase in non-HAP VOC could result. The EPA solicits comments on what considerations should be given to this type of situation in deciding to combine marine terminals and refineries for the purpose of emission averaging.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA requests comment on the extent to which emissions averaging between marine vessel loading and unloading operations and other refinery operations could result in exposure spikes. This could occur if batch emission streams were left uncontrolled in exchange for control of continuous emission streams, or vice versa.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA also requests that commenters submit data on possible emission factors and/or alternative emission calculation procedures for marine vessel operations for consideration in the final rule.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 24, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Mary Nichols,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21490 Filed 8&hyph;30&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

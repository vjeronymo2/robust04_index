			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Observer: Turn down the flame An eerie hush has settled over the UK gas industry - quite a change from the fierce clashes of the past between British Gas and Sir James McKinnon, its regulator at Ofgas. A truce has been called while both sides digest the mammoth 2,000-page Monopolies and Mergers Commission report, which was delivered 10 days ago. The air of studied unconcern is reinforced by the fact that Sir James has departed for the Italian beaches, while Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, has sought out the charms of Cornwall. So anxious are all parties to prevent leaks of this highly sensitive document that it will be rushed into print a week tomorrow before ministers have even decided whether to accept it. Unusually, Observer gathers, the MMC itself will make a statement next week explaining how it reached its conclusions. This is because there are actually two reports, one commissioned by the DTI and one by Ofgas. Sir James and trade secretary Michael Heseltine have agreed to exchange theirs so they know the contents of both - which is more than can be said for British Gas itself. Cedric Brown has only received the Ofgas report, and he does not get the DTI one until next Monday. But he will have an inkling of the full report because his copy contains a summary of all the MMC's recommendations. He promises to be on hand next week to deliver his views on the report, but Sir James will not be breaking short his holiday. Is this because the MMC has rejected his contention that British Gas should be split up? After battling for years against the gas monopoly, it would be most uncharacteristic of this doughty Scotsman to be absent if the MMC had handed him a famous victory.</p>

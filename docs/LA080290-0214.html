			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> U.S. DELAYS CLEANUP OF ROCKWELL LAB BUILDING;  </P> <P> RADIOACTIVITY: ENERGY OFFICIALS HOPE TO DECONTAMINATE THE SITE WHEN THE PROCESS  BECOMES CHEAPER AND SAFER.  </P> <P> The U.S. Department of Energy said it has decided to monitor and contain a  radioactively contaminated building at Rockwell International's Santa Susana  Field Laboratory east of Simi Valley rather than immediately undertake a costly  cleanup.  </P> <P> DOE officials assured Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), who represents the  area, that Building 24 at the Rockwell site in the Simi Hills, where Rockwell  has done nuclear work for the government for the past 35 years, poses no health  or safety risk and requires no imminent action.  </P> <P> R.P. Whitfield, associate director of DOE's Office of Environmental  Restoration, told Gallegly that the DOE decided to postpone indefinitely the  planned demolition of the building until new technologies are developed to make  the process safer and less expensive.  </P> <P> Whitfield said he expects such methods to be available in five to eight years  and the cleanup to be done in 10 to 12 years.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the DOE will spend $15,000 a year for containment and  twice-monthly monitoring instead of commencing a $4.4-million cleanup in the  1992 fiscal year. The DOE had said in a draft plan in November, 1989, that the  monitoring was a cost-saving alternative to the cleanup.  </P> <P> Following a 45-minute meeting in his office attended by five DOE officials,  Gallegly said he was satisfied "that there's not an imminent health and safety  concern out there."  </P> <P> At the same time, he told Whitfield and his DOE associates that, given intense  public concern, "10 to 12 years, from a perception standpoint, is not  acceptable to me" to do the cleanup.  </P> <P> The radioactivity is in concrete vaults and a reinforcing bar beneath the  Rockwell building, which are secured behind two padlocked doors, said Roger  Liddle, DOE's restoration project manager at Santa Susana. The above-ground  portion of the structure is used as a warehouse.  </P> <P> Rockwell has found that the amount of radioactivity outside Building 24 is no  higher than levels that occur naturally in soil and rays from the sun, said  Clark Gibbs, general manager for Rockwell of the Energy Technology Engineering  Center, which Rockwell operates under contract with the DOE at Santa Susana.  The levels within the vaults are 20 to 40 times greater than those that occur  naturally, but the secured structure is far from any public area, Gibbs said.  </P> <P> "We thought it would be a vain waste of resources" to go in and clean it up, he  said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Myron Levin contributed to this story.  </P></p>

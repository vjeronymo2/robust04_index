Happy looks of farmers in the  holiday season can be seen at scenic places such as Songchon,  Sakju, Soktamgugok and the Lake Sohung.    They are spending joyful days with colorful programs of  cultural and emotional life, rest, visits to nearby historical  sites and beauty spots and experience-swapping at well furnished  rest homes, overwhelmed with gratitude for the ever-growing  benefits granted them by the party and the state.    The party and the state show particular care for the farmers  in charge of the granary of the country.    The state gave great financial and material aid to the  farmers after the war to improve their deteriorated living. In  1966, it totally abolished the agricultural tax in kind to free  them from the tax burden. Now the construction of modern  houses, to say nothing of productive construction in the  countryside, is done at the expense of the state. These houses  are distributed to farmers free of charge.    With the enforcement of the social security system, the  farmers, like the workers and office employees, enjoy additional  benefits of different forms such as old-age pension, pension for  the disabled and pension for the bereaved families. Village  clinics were converted into hospitals, water and bus services  were introduced into rural villages and the TV networks were  broadened to cover the countryside long ago to leave little gap  between farmers and urban dwellers in living conditions.    And the tasks of the rural technical revolution have been  successfully promoted to remarkably diminish the differences  between industrial and agricultural labor.    Before liberation the farmers went out to the fields in  early  morning and worked with their eyes fixed on the soil, pulling  wooden ploughs and wielding worn-out hoes all day long, and came  back home under the stars. But today they live in happiness,  working, resting and enjoying a cultural life just as the  workers do.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> CALTRANS WORKER INJURED BY DRIVER  </P> <P> A Caltrans worker and a suspected drunk driver were injured Thursday morning  when the driver lost control of his car on the Garden Grove Freeway east of  Brookhurst Street, the California Highway Patrol said.  </P> <P> David A. Braun, 29, of Huntington Beach told CHP officers that he fell asleep  while driving eastbound in the fast lane at about 10:40 a.m., CHP spokesman  Lyle Whitten said.  </P> <P> Braun's Chevrolet Blazer veered off the freeway toward a Caltrans equipment  truck that was parked on the shoulder, Whitten said. Braun apparently saw the  truck and attempted to turn his vehicle sharply left, but he struck the rear  left side of the Caltrans vehicle.  </P> <P> Jack Merrill, 30, of San Bernardino was standing on the back of the flatbed  truck when it was hit.  </P> <P> Braun and Merrill were taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange, Whitten said.  Braun sustained deep gashes on his face and a broken collarbone, and Merrill  was admitted with what could be a broken hip bone, Whitten said.  </P> <P> Braun was being held at the hospital on suspicion of driving under the  influence of alcohol or drugs, Whitten said. Blood tests were taken, Whitten  said, and if they prove positive, Braun will be charged with felony drunk  driving.  </P> <P> This year, eight Caltrans workers have died while working alongside the  freeway, Caltrans spokeswoman Gloria Carrillo said. Five of those were hit by  motorists, she said. JAMES M. GOMEZ  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Signs of a change for the better have been visible  recently in the industrial sector, but movements are beginning  to take place even in the machinery industry that signal a  change in trends. Indications of a recovery have begun to appear  in the machine tool industry, and even the construction  equipment industry has emerged from the long tunnel of recession  that has lasted since the latter half of 1990.    Demand is appearing for industrial robots based on manpower  conservation projects among small and midsized business  businesses, and inquiries are increasing in the area of  computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing  (CAD/CAM), although the prevailing outlook calls for a  recessionary trends to continue in the first half of fiscal year  1994. However, shipbuilding has reached a very critical stage  and the metal mold industry seems to have hit a double bottom,  manifesting mixed trends among industries.    This article analyzes current conditions and provides a  projection of trends for each sector within the machinery  industry.    Machine Tools. Director Makoto Umehara, deputy  chief of the Precision Machinery Operations Department of  Citizen Watch Company speaks of recent trends by saying, "Since  entering this year, January was bad, but there was some  improvement in February and March. Since the beginning of April,  we have averaged over 10 orders per week, indicating an  improving trend."    The machine tool industry experienced severe recessionary  conditions in 1993, but an emerging mood of better times has  been seen recently. A source at a major machine tool maker  states, "We've seen some modest recovery," in reference to  price-cutting promotions which had accelerated the drop in new  orders. The competing makers have arrived at a point where  financial results will no longer tolerate further price cuts and  they are taking definite steps to gradually restore sensible  pricing.    Based on past experience that indicates "a recovery in  prices  if the economy improves," we might say that recent developments  serve as evidence that we are undergoing a gradual recovery in  demand. It appears that domestic appliances will lead the way  out of the recession.    It seems that rising demand for durable consumer goods such  as amusement systems, video tape recorders, large television  sets, and white goods is having an impact in the form of  stepped-up inquiries for machine tools used to fabricate metal  components. Demand should also come from companies engaged in  the manufacture of multimedia-related CD-ROM [compact disk,  read-only memory] drives and optical communication equipment.    On the other hand, even in the automotive-related sectors  where little movement is seen, special sectors have been  actively placing inquiries. One such sector relates to diesel  engine makers, where regulations on nitrogen oxide emissions  will require alteration of engine design, leading to new demand  for fabricating machinery.    Moreover, those companies which in the past called for  installation of specialized equipment are now being offered  universal machining centers that are capable of responding to  rapid changes in requirements related to facilities expansion  and specifications. Plant operators are not necessarily  satisfied with old machine tools just because demand for their  products have risen.    Plant operators are endeavoring to convert their operations  so that they can lower processing and labor costs, while  producing items with higher added value, multiple features, and  more precision. Moreover, they are not simply seeking machine  tools with a high degree of comprehensive capability, but  machines that are responsive to their real needs.    Shipbuilding. Shipbuilding was considered to be a  comparatively stable industry in the past because the order and  delivery cycle for the shipbuilding industry extend over a  two-year period and the effects of economic trends lag in their  impact on shipbuilding operations. However, vessels ordered in  fiscal years 1992 and 1993 were priced cheap, causing  substantial deterioration in profits and causing many major  shipbuilders to suffer losses.    It appears that fiscal years 1994 and 1995 will be a  critical  period that will test the ability of shipbuilders to survive.  The environment for shipbuilders is extremely difficult owing to  factors such as recessionary conditions, decline in the value of  ships because of the worldwide recession in marine  transportation, and a drop in cost competitiveness because of  the strong yen. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange values  have a major impact on the shipbuilding industry because of its  borderless nature.    As an example, if the dollar-denominated value of a ship  falls 10 percent and the value of the yen advances 20 percent,  the yen-denominated value of the ship drops 30 percent. The  value of ships has fallen to 60 to 70 percent of their peak.  Such conditions led to Japan's surrendering to Korea in 1993 the  title of leading shipbuilding nation of the world. However,  according to data released on 20 April by the Japan Ship Export  Association on contracts for ships built for export in fiscal  year 1993, orders for very large crude carriers (VLCC) with  capacities in excess of 200,000 tons and container ships were  received near the end of the fiscal year at a rate 2.8 times  above the previous fiscal year, reaching a volume of 7,471,018  gross tons.    Export contracts ran at a rate in excess of 7 million gross  tons between fiscal years 1989 and 1991, but fell substantially  to 2.67 million gross tons in fiscal year 1992. Contrary to  expectations, orders for fiscal year 1993 recovered in volume,  translating into adequate workloads for the various shipbuilders  for fiscal years 1994 and 1995.    Efforts to improve productivity, including purchase of  materials and equipment from overseas sources on a  dollar-denominated basis, have narrowed cost differences with  South Korea and have led to the award of orders. However, the  question is, will they be able to maintain profitability after  consideration for the contemplated cost reductions?    CAD/CAM Sales of CAD/CAM/computer-aided  engineering (CAE) systems were not encouraging in fiscal year  1993 because of reductions in capital spending by industry in  response to the recession. Demand for peripheral equipment such  as digitizers, tablets, and plotters was also slow.    Most firms expect slow sales during the first half of fiscal  year 1994, but CAD vendors and plotter makers say "inquiries  have increased recently." There are also comments that "the rate  of decline has narrowed compared to the same month of the  previous year," showing signs of brightening prospects in  certain sectors. According to industry estimates, the potential  market for CAD systems including hardware is 500-600 million yen.    Sales in fiscal year 1993 dropped about 20 percent from the  preceding year because of falling hardware prices. However,  selected CAD vendors have experienced improving order rates  since the beginning of fiscal year 1994, indicating that a  recovery is imminent.    Kiyadamu Systems of Shinagawa ward, Tokyo, recorded a  25-percent increase in orders during the January-March quarter  of 1994 over the same period last year. The company indicates  increasing replacement of mainframe versions of its CADAM units  with the micro computer-aided design and manufacturing (CADAM)  MC/X version of its principal work stations can take credit for  the improving trends. Vice President Hiroshi Kawaguchi predicts,  "Results will depend on an economic recovery, but this year  should not be worse than fiscal year 1993." On the other hand,  CAE systems sales have been good despite the recession.  President Masaru Tateishi of Japan Emuesushi asserts, "We can  maintain a 10 -ercent growth rate for the foreseeable future,"  stressing the significance of underlying demand.    The market size for plotters, which are an output device for  CAD drawings, is one-tenth of the CAD market. Versions selling  well are limited to low-priced monochrome ink-jet plotters.  Sales of such plotters also dropped about 25 percent because of  slow sales and price wars. However, at Muto Industries and  Graphitech where operating results had fallen, hope is being  placed on signs of a "real" recovery as expressed in the words,  "each month was recording results below those of the prior year,  but beginning in November 1993 the rate of decline had narrowed."    Makers of input devices known as digitizers and tablets  which  were previously sold mainly to CAD systems makers have begun to  actively seek orders for tablets designed for the computer  graphics markets to offset weakness in the CAD systems area.    Robotics. "Normally, orders drop in April as a  reaction to the closing of financial accounts at the end of  March, but this year orders were stronger in April than in  March," said the individual in charge of sales at DAIHEN Corp.,  a welding robot manufacturer. Similarly, President Mikio Yamada  of Nejitake Seiko of Kofu city comments, "February signaled a  bottoming out, and we have seen some improvement since March. It  appears that small and midsized businesses, which could no  longer delay manpower-saving actions, have finally begun to take  action on the capital investment front." Manufacture of robots  in fiscal year 1992 fell sharply by 30 percent from the previous  year to 427.5 billion yen.    Figures have not been compiled for fiscal year 1993, but it  appears that a decline of about 400 billion yen cannot be  avoided. In addition to the recession following the bursting of  the bubble, the early spring rise in the value of the yen nipped  the budding recovery and adversely affected the capital  investment will of the automobile and electric machinery  industries. However, recently, unprecedented changes have begun  to appear in the capital investment stance of various  manufacturers. Semiconductor and liquid crystal device makers  have sharply increased spending on plant expansions, and the  outlook is favorable for the home building and food  manufacturing sectors. Further, strong demand persists for  manpower-conserving versions of equipment used in sectors  involving 3-K [kitanai, kiken, kitsui--dirty,  dangerous, and difficult] operations.    New types of products offered at the "International  Industrial Robotics Fair" held at the Tokyo International  Exhibition Hall, Harumi, Tokyo, in November 1993 included  Yasukawa Electric Manufacturing Company's dustproof, waterproof  "SV-16" and FANUC Ltd.'s "LR-Mate 100, which was priced under 2  million yen."    Further, Mitsubishi Electric and Sankyo Seiki Manufacturing  are moving aggressively into the robotics business for  clean-room operations. Activities of this nature portend a  gradual recovery for most robot makers in 1994, although not to  the level that prevailed during the peak a few years ago.  Moreover, a full-scale recovery is dependent on a return to  better times for the automotive and home appliance industries.    Although future and underlying potential exists for robots  designed for new applications, they are unable to contribute  greatly to near-term industry recovery, and their small  quantities pose a cost burden. Strong hope is still tied to the  automotive and domestic appliance sectors. The U.S. automotive  sector recovered before Japan's, and the operating results of  Japanese robotics firms whose U.S.-bound shipments are larger  than domestic shipments, such as Fujikoshi and FANUC, have  already begun to improve.    It appears that the key to the future will be sales targeted  at the United States, a recovery in the automotive and domestic  appliance industries and the exploitation of new applications.    Metal Molds. The principal users of metal molds  such as the automotive and domestic appliance industries  experienced limited improvements in sales since entering 1994,  but such changes have not affected the metal molding industry,  and many industry sources say that "the slow sales trends will  continue at least until summer."    According to Ministry of International Trade and Industry  machinery statistics, metal mold production including in-house  production totaled 32.456 billion yen in January 1994, 19.8  percent below the prior year, and in February totaled 30.623  billion yen, 13.5 percent below the prior year, showing no sign  of recovery.    In 1991, industry-wide production of metal molds totaled  544.069 billion yen, a historical peak, but a sharp decline in  demand by major users such as automotive and domestic appliance  makers resulted in a 19.2-percent drop in production in 1992.    Production in 1993 fell only 0.5 percent, making it appear  as  if an improvement were taking place, but production resumed  double-digit declines in 1994, giving the appearance of a double  bottom.    During the same period, major users of metal molds such as  the automotive and domestic appliance industries aggressively  implemented widespread restructuring, including improvements in  production procedures, standardization of parts, and  simplification of product design. Such trends had a decisive  impact on demand for metal molds, the need for which depends  greatly on the variety of designs and parts involved in the  manufacture of end products.    Even now, when signs of an economic recovery are visible,  production simplification projects of this nature continue in  the automotive and domestic appliance industries and industry  sources say they "will continue into the future."    As a result, although an economic recovery is underway, the  same industry sources say that "a sharp recovery in the metal  molding industry as a whole is not expected." The metal molding  industry faces the urgent need to explore ways to survive.    The eastern chapter of the Japan Metal Molding Industry  Society has applied for a subsidy for the Tokyo-sponsored Local  Industry Structural Enhancement Project which in fiscal 1993  worked on concepts in support of the project and is actively  engaged in the preparation of future concepts envisioning  globalization.    It appears that Japan's metal molding industry, which has  reached a turning point, is about to launch strategies aimed at  globalization.    Construction Equipment. Domestic demand for  construction equipment is undergoing a full-scale recovery.  Orders for hydraulic shovels which are a leading indicator for  construction equipment orders, increased in January for the  first time in four months and rose more than 10 percent in  February and March.    As a result, the view is spreading as indicated by  Catepillar-Mitsubishi Managing Director Mikio Takeuchi that, "In  fiscal year 1993, demand for hydraulic shovels increased less  than 1 percent in volume, slightly exceeding the prior fiscal  year, showing definite signs of a recovery for construction  equipment." Although construction equipment demand has been slow  since the latter half of 1990, these signs indicate better times  ahead.    In the March-May 1993 quarter, orders for hydraulic shovels  increased and expectations for a recovery rose, then declined  after the general contractor scandals and the long rainy season.  Such experience has caused the manufacturers to become cautious,  but Ryuichi Tokunaga, head of the Japan Construction Equipment  Industry Association Operations Department, comments, "This  recovery cycle appears to be solid in that equipment-leasing  companies which had been cautious are increasing their orders."    Further, orders for mini-shovels, which had declined  continuously since June 1991, rose 6.9 percent in January 1994  over the same month in the prior year for the first time in 32  months, serving as evidence of a "full-scale recovery."    Komatsu Construction Equipment Sales Director Shigetoshi  Kumihashi provides a background analysis of the above  developments as he says, "Newly initiated public works projects  have increased recently. Utilization rates of rental equipment  are up and project backlogs as of the end of fiscal year 1993  are higher than they were at the end of the prior year."    Orders for bulldozers and wheel loaders have not recovered  as  much as for hydraulic shovels, but the rate of decline narrowed  from the double-digit drops in the first half of fiscal year  1993 to a drop of about 3 percent in the period since the autumn  of last year.</p>

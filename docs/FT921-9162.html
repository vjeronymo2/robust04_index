			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Clinton deeper in draft-dodge controversy GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas suffered a fresh blow to his presidential campaign yesterday when he was forced to release a letter casting doubt on denials of draft-dodging during the Vietnam war. The release of the letter pre-empted a disclosure on national television, but the timing could not be worse with less than a week remaining until the critical New Hampshire Democratic primary election next Tuesday. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, who is challenging Mr Clinton for the Democratic nomination, said: 'I think voters should be concerned about his veracity and character.' The letter, which was leaked to ABC News from Pentagon files, concerns Mr Clinton's intention to serve in the reserve officers' training corps (ROTC) at the University of Arkansas. This was a move that allowed him to avoid military service in Vietnam for four years. However, he went to Oxford as a Rhodes scholar and never made good on the pledge. The letter, written in 1969, expresses regret for misleading an Arkansas reserve officer by failing to disclose the depth of his opposition to the war. He also thanks the officer for 'saving me from the draft'. After the original charges of draft-dodging surfaced, Mr Clinton denounced the story as Republican muck-raking. He also denied he was a draft-dodger, noting that in the autumn of 1969 he had made himself eligible for the draft. (He received a high number in the lottery and was therefore not called to serve). The letter gives a poignant account of how Mr Clinton wrestled with his conscience. The young student condemns the Vietnam war and the draft, but says he did not wish to be a draft-resister. The ROTC seemed a compromise. But having received the deferment, Mr Clinton said he was consumed by anguish and the loss of self-regard. 'I decided to accept the draft, in spite of my beliefs, for one reason: to maintain my political viability within the system.' He hints at his future career in national politics. 'For years I have worked to prepare myself for a political life characterised by both practical political ability and concern for rapid social progress.' By releasing the letter, Mr Clinton has avoided charges of a 'cover-up' but runs the risk of having his economic and social programme - which attracted much support in the initial phase of the Democratic campaign - subsumed by the controversy over his Vietnam years. Vice-President Dan Quayle was dogged by similar controversy in the 1988 presidential campaign, although unlike Mr Clinton he did not put himself forward for the draft and served instead in the Indiana National Guard.</p>

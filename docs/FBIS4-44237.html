			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bouli Hadjioannou] </F>   [Text] Turkey, dragged before the European Court of Human  Rights for the first time on charges of violating the human  rights of a Greek-Cypriot refugee, must be held accountable for  what happens in the occupied north, lawyers told the European  Court yesterday.    Nicosia barrister Akhileas Dhimitriadhis, appearing on  behalf  of Kyrenia refugee Titina Loizidhou, and Attorney General  Mikhalakis Triandafilidhis told the 19-member Grand Chamber of  the European Court it should waive Turkey's objections and  examine the facts of the case.    They said Turkey, by virtue of its 20-year occupation,  exercises control over the north.    Earlier a member of the European Commission of Human Rights,  which has also examined the case, told the Court it must uphold  the Commission's report and examine the substance of the  complaint.    Loizidhou, who launched her campaign in 1989, has accused  Turkey of stripping her of her fundamental human rights by  preventing her return to her property in the occupied north.    The case was first heard by the Commission under Article 25  on individual recourse. The Commission declined to rule on  whether her right to property was violated and the case was  referred to the European Court by the Cyprus government.    Turkey, citing procedural points--including the date when it  had ratified Article 25 and the reservations it had attached,  told the European Court yesterday it should not hear the case.    It also argued that it should not be party to the  proceedings  because there is a different "legal entity" in the occupied  north.</p>

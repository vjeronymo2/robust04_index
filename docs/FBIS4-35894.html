			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, June 2 (INA) -- Iraqi dailies today sternly  condemned the traitorous behaviour of the Saudi regime of Fahd  and its conspiring against the nation and Yemen's unity.    Al-QADISIYAH daily said that traitorous stand of Fahd regime  came to be a categorical evidence tangibly proving the fact that  the Saudi stance had been and was always devastating and  suspicious pouring in the channel of Arabs and Muslims enemies  schemes.    AL-THAWRAH daily has said if Fahd's conspiratorial stands  are open and designed under permission of the U.S., which  brought his family to power, the role of his nephew Bandar  Bin-Sultan was similar to that of his uncle which are bad and  against the Arab nation will.    AL-'IRAQ daily has said the Saudi regime, of the disgraceful  record in conspiring on any Arab unity project and on any  patriotic authority, is adding by its latest move at the UN  Security Council, another treason of its numerous ones against  the Arab nation's national interests.    It openly discloses its conspiring scheme of bringing  foreign forces to Yemen as it did with the case before the  aggression on Iraq.</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures fall TRADING IN sterling futures yesterday took the brunt of increased market pessimism about future UK interest rate cuts, writes Stephanie Flanders. The drop in all sterling future contracts ranged from 6 to 10 basis points, and occurred early in the day's trading. The September contract fell by 7 points from Friday, closing at 94.11. There was a further slight narrowing in the margin between September and December sterling, with the later contract losing 10 basis points to finish at 94.29. Many dealers suggested that hopes of an early fall in interest rates were now indef-initely on hold. This, they said, could be put down to a mixture of the political uncertainty surrounding the ratification of the Maastricht treaty and the upcoming Christchurch by-election, as well as market speculation that Friday's UK GDP figures for the second quarter may show strong growth. At the shorter end of the UK money market, traders were pleasantly surprised by a smaller than forecast shortage of Pounds 450m, later revised to Pounds 350m. Most of this was removed in the early round by the Bank of England. Over-night rates began quite tight in anticipation of a much larger shortage, but ended at 3 per cent after trading at around 5 1/4 per cent. Elsewhere in European money markets, trading was considerably more subdued than in recent days. The Bundesbank's announcement of an unusual two-day currency pact early on Monday led German call money rates to rise from the very low levels reached on Friday. D-Mark overnight rates closed at around 7.15 per cent, up 5 basis points from Friday's levels. The German central bank explained the two-day pact as a way to drain the excess liquidity created by Wednesday's tender round. At the same time, many dealers concluded that the German authorities were signalling a repo rate of 7.15 per cent in this week's pact, announced later this morning. This would be 13 basis points below the rate set at last week's tender. According to many traders, that would pave the way for a discount rate cut at next week's July 29 Bundesbank council meeting. The German move helped to ease pressure on French money market rates, with three-month money closing in Paris at 7.30 per cent, down more than 20 basis points.</p>

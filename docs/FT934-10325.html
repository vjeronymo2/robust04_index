			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Money Markets: Short lira sold down ITALIAN short-term interest rate futures slipped sharply yesterday in reaction to growing worries over corruption in the country. Eurolira futures were down almost 20 basis points from Wednesday's closing level at one stage although the currency held up relatively well. International money market dealers said the selling was a response to a sharp fall in the government bond market which tends to reflect confidence in a country's political and economic stability. It began after Italy's president Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro gave a television address late on Wednesday denying allegations that he had been involved in any illegal activities. 'The main selling has come from Italians. They suddenly started to fear they would be left without a president,' said one London trader. The Eurolira contract for December delivery was marked down at the opening and hit 91.30 at its weakest point late yesterday afternoon. Elsewhere, there was some disappointment that the Bank of France left its intervention rate, the rate which sets the floor for French money market operations, unchanged at 6.45 per cent. There had been a slim hope that it might follow the lead set by the Danish central bank which cut its discount rate by 0.25 per cent to 7 per cent on Wednesday. In the UK, period lending rates were lower on the ripple-through effect of the third comfortable day in a row for interbank operations. The Bank of England provided Pounds 950m of assistance at the earliest opportunity and at established rates after forecasting a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 1.2bn, later revised to 1.3bn. The Bank provided Pounds 125m in the morning and a further Pounds 223m in the afternoon bringing total help to Pounds 1.298bn. The ease with which the operations proceeded saw overnight money rates as low as 3.5 per cent and generally trading around 5.75 per cent. One month and three-month rates were also lower across the board. Three month interbank rates were down  1/8 on the week at 5 5/8 per cent. However, dealers said there was no conclusion to be drawn over the direction of future lending rates. 'The Bank of England is being studiously neutral over base rate at the moment,' said one trader.</p>

Recently, in order  to prepare against possible trouble in the political situation  after Deng's death, the CPC quietly made certain arrangements  and adopted some measures.    One of the measures was to restore the mechanisms for the  old  guard to get involved in politics.    After the disbandment of the Central Advisory Commission,  many old politicians became "jobless." However, some, holding a  high position as "senior former leaders [yuan lao 0337 5071]" or  being close to such high rank, continued to enjoy the right to  keep their political influence. Some of them even kept their  own offices. Four months ago, in late August 1993, the Political  Bureau discussed whether to close the offices of Peng Zhen, Yang  Shangkun, Bo Yibo, and Song Ping. At that time, Peng Zhen, Yang  Shangkun, and Wan Li expressed their support. Jiang Zemin also  informally expressed his opinion through internal channels.  Some people proposed that only the offices for Deng Xiaoping  and Chen Yuan be maintained. However, no final decision was  made on this issue, and the political participation of the old  guard did not come to an end. When a final decision was to be  made on the documents of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee, the Political Bureau still invited some  retired old leaders to attend the relevant meeting and to  participate in the decisionmaking. Song Ping, Song Renqiong,  Yao Yilin and others still delivered seven proposals to the  Political Bureau and the State Council in the name of their  offices, including "A Six-Point Opinion on the Socialist Market  Economy," "Problems Existing in the Current Economy," and  "Central Authorities' Macrocontrol Is the Foundation for  Ensuring the Healthy Development of the National Economy." At  the memorial meeting to mourn the death of Zhou Peiyuan on 4  December, the Yang Shangkun Office, the Bo Yibo Office, and the  Song Ping Office presented wreaths. In late November, the Yang  Dezhi Office, the Li Desheng Office, and the Zhang Aiping Office  sent telegrams of congratulation to the units achieving  outstanding results in the war exercises of the 2d Artillery  Force. The Yao Yilin Office, the Song Renqiong Office, and the  Gu Mu Office also dispatched investigation groups to Guangdong,  Hainan, and Shanghai in late November to find out the reactions  of the enterprises and institutions concerned to the reform  resolution adopted by the Third Plenum of the Central Committee.    The offices of the old guard were not disbanded.    Now, a document has been issued, and the system of offices  for the retired old leaders will be maintained.    On 6 December, the CPC Central Committee, the State Council,  and the Central Military Commission jointly issued an important  circular: According to the demand and proposal of most members  and alternate members of the 14th CPC Central Committee and  other people attending the Third Plenary Session, and also  according to the opinions the Central Committee solicited from  the party organizations, the democratic parties, and the mass  organizations, the older generation of leading comrades who  enjoy high prestige inside and outside the party and who are  esteemed and admired by the people should continue to be able to  participate in the formulation of major policy decisions and  guidelines and to play a certain guiding and assistant role in  the handling of important affairs, as they have accumulated  valuable work experience in the years of revolutionary wars and  socialist construction, although they have retired or left the  party, government, and military leading bodies. In the  discussions of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and  the Central Military Commission, people unanimously proposed  that the work bodies, namely, the offices, of the older  generation of the party, government, and military leaders be  maintained. The document has been issued to all central party,  government, and military organs and to the party committees of  all provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, military  regions, and military branches.    The decision on keeping the offices of some old former  leaders of course reaffirmed the maintenance of their political  privilege. Reportedly, the offices of Peng Zhen, Yang Shangkun,  Wan Li, Bo Yibo, Song Renqiong, Song Ping, Yao Yilin, Yang  Dezhi, Li Desheng, Zhang Aiping, Gu Mu, and Yu Qiuli were  maintained.    It was said that the proposal on maintaining the office  system for the retired old leaders was jointly put forth by Qiao  Shi and Hu Jintao, members of the Standing Committee of the  Political Bureau, and Ding Guangen, Wen Jiabao, and Ren Jianxin,  members of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee. At the  group meetings of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee, Guangdong's Xie Fei, Shanghai's Wu Bangguo,  Shandong's Jiang Chunyun, and some members and alternate members  of the Central Committee from Sichuan, Liaoning, Hubei,  Zhejiang, and Hebei also raised similar proposals. When  attending the group meetings, Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Qiao Shi  indicated that the Political Bureau was considering the issue of  maintaining the offices for some retired old leaders.    On another occasion, Li Peng said that the party Central  Committee and the State Council continued to consult the  comrades of the older generation on some major affairs of the  party and the state and on the making of relevant policies and  decisions. It was necessary to maintain the work organs for them.    On 15 November, at a discussion meeting with some  responsible  people of the democratic parties, Jiang Zemin said: The  Political Bureau will propose that retired party and government  leaders at the central and provincial levels may maintain their  work organs so that they may continue to participate in the  making of major policy decisions. However, this should be  approved by the Political Bureau and the Central Secretariat.    Reportedly, the offices for retired old leaders will be  subordinate to the Central Secretariat in the future rather than  to the Political Bureau. This indicates that they will be  "downgraded" in the hierarchy of power.    An informed old cadre revealed privately that the  continuation of the office system for the old guard was the  product of a compromise between Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun. The  purpose of keeping this system was to appease the old cadres,  but more importantly, it may enable the old guard to help  control the situation once Deng Xiaoping dies. Chen Yun's  faction had another purpose. That is, it would enable it to  bolster the Jiang-Li leadership structure and also control its  orientation in order to prevent it from "drifting westward"  (adopting capitalism across the board) and to maintain its  socialist orientation. The purpose of Deng Xiaoping's faction  was to reinforce the momentum of reform and preserve its own  interests. Moreover, it wants to obtain greater decisionmaking  power with the support of the military after Deng's death, and  prevent the Jiang-Li structure from monopolizing power inside  the party.    The office system for the senior retired leaders is in fact  a  small-sized advisory committee. This part of the old guard is  certainly satisfied with such an arrangement. However, most  retired cadres are frustrated. Many of them are getting  increasingly depressed and dejected, and some have even  degenerated. Generally, they have lost interest in politics and  do not maintain the party spirit. Some senior retired leaders  are trying to spur these comrades on.    Since early December, the proposal of Peng Zhen and Yang  Shangkun on "five shoulds and five should-nots" has been relayed  to retired cadres at the ministerial and provincial level, and  the retired cadres were asked to exercise self-discipline.    In early November, at an inner-party meeting with some  retired old cadres, Yang Shangkun first proposed "four shoulds  and four should-nots": 1) They should keep pace with the party  Central Committee, and should not lag behind the situation; 2)  they should take the initiative in safeguarding the party's  leadership, and should not place themselves above the party; 3)  they should conscientiously study and understand Comrade  Xiaoping's theory, and should not conservatively stick to  conventions and refuse to make new progress; and 4) they should  continue to do something beneficial to the party's central task  in their late years, and should not rest on their laurels.    Peng Zhen added one point: They should take responsibility  for educating their families and children and persuading them to  be the people's public servants rather than doing corrupt and  discipline- violating things.    Recently, in a document about the activities of party  organizations, Peng Zhen wrote an instruction: "Old comrades do  not have the privilege of not abiding by the party's discipline  and not obeying the party. They should regularly take part in  the activities of party organizations, take part in political  studies, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. Only those  who are weak and sick can be exceptions."    The "five shoulds and five should-nots" proposed by Yang and  Peng and Peng's recent instruction were aimed at the current  problems. According to the General Office of the CPC Central  Committee, only less than 40 percent of retired old cadres still  continue to regularly take part in the activities of party  organizations and take part in political studies. About 30  percent of retired old cadres in the central organs have not  taken part in any activities of party organizations for from  over six months to one year for reasons of health. More than  half the former Central Advisory Commission members are often  absent from party activities. However, the retired old cadres  borrow meeting places to hold their gatherings more frequently  than when they were still in office.    In addition, only 20 percent of retired old cadres at the  provincial level still regularly take part in party activities,  and over 60 percent of the retired old cadres often ask for  leave.    Various signs show that the CPC has lost its vigor, and is  getting looser. Communist ideals and beliefs have collapsed in  the minds of most party members. In place of such ideals and  beliefs, they have adopted individualism, hedonism, liberalism,  and other noncommunist ideologies. With the lack of checks and  balances from other political forces, it is inevitable that the  party will become increasingly corrupt. The economic reform  initiated by Deng Xiaoping will only alleviate the symptoms of  the illness and will not be able to effect a permanent cure.  Once Deng dies, the CPC will face its death if it fails to  effect self-transformation.</p>

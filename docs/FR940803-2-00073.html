The decision of the Board was based upon the belief that the listing of the Common Stock on the PSE was no longer beneficial to the Company due to minimal volume of trading of Company shares on the Exchange. Further, an adequate market exists for trading of the Company's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any interested person may, on or before August 16, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jonathan D.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, a number of facilities sent questionnaires and included in the original sample did not respond to the survey and hence were missing from the database. If these facilities had been known to be actual PFPR operations, it might have been possible to impute data for the survey items of interest. However, since many facilities in the sample indicated that they were not PFPR operations, it is possible that at least some of the non-respondents were also not PFPR operations, and hence not part of the target population. In this case imputations for these facilities would have little meaning. Those facilities that did not respond to the questionnaire were therefore omitted from any further statistical analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because some facilities failed to answer all the survey questions, data were imputed for missing responses. The amount of missing data was negligible in most instances. The only case where a significant amount of data was imputed involved wastewater volumes and production-normalized wastewater volumes, which were reported on a line-by-line basis for each combination of wastewater source and destination. Approximately 10% of the volume and/or production-normalized volume entries were missing and subsequently imputed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The imputation strategy utilized provides an unbiased estimate of the total for any given variable, when used in conjunction with the formulae described above for national stratified estimates in the context of misclassified strata.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Site Visits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to develop effluent guidelines for this industry, EPA conducted site visits and sampling at a number of pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities, and at pesticide manufacturing facilities which also are used as formulating and packaging facilities. Typically, during guidelines development, EPA depends on a wastewater sampling program to characterize the raw wastewater and to establish which treatment systems operate at BAT and NSPS levels. In the case of the pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging industry, EPA could not conduct a sampling program as extensive as had been conducted for some of the previous effluent guidelines rulemakings. This is because: (1) Only 12 facilities surveyed reported operating on-site treatment systems that treated only PFP water (out of those 12 facilities one was a voluntary participant; not part of the sample); (2) facility operating schedules are very unpredictable due to the batch nature of their operations and just-in-time production philosophy; and (3) due to the batch nature of the formulating and packaging processes, treatment is almost always operated on a batch basis making it very difficult to characterize long-term treatment performance (long-term even for a 3-day period). Therefore, EPA had to implement a more widespread and in-depth site visiting program than usual. Between 1991 and 1993, EPA visited 51 facilities (2 of these facilities are not survey or pretested facilities and, therefore, did not fill out a questionnaire) and collected wastewater samples from 13 facilities (one facility was sampled during two different production periods for a total of 14 sampling episodes). The site visits were conducted to provide EPA with an in-depth look at actual formulating, packaging or repackaging operations and wastewater generation and wastewater handling practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Wastewater Sampling and Analytical Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Seven of the 14 pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging sampling episodes included sampling of wastewater treatment systems and all 14 included sampling for raw wastewater characterization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Raw wastewater characterization data were collected to provide EPA with concentration data for pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging wastewaters for a number of different wastewater sources. EPA collected 72 raw wastewater samples which contained 45 different active ingredients at 14 different episodes. Wastewater samples were collected for the following wastewater sources: equipment interior cleaning, exterior equipment/floor wash, air or odor control scrubber water, DOT aerosol test bath, drum or other raw material container rinsate, laboratory equipment cleaning water, laundry and showers. A number of these samples were collected to characterize wastewater that was intended for reuse (the concentration of active ingredients in these samples is expected to be high). Samples of commingled raw wastewater sources were also collected. Raw wastewater samples are typically analyzed for levels of conventional pollutants, non-conventional pollutants (including active ingredients), metals, semi-volatile and volatile organics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Facilities were selected for sampling of treatment systems after an evaluation of existing data and responses to the questionnaires and follow-up telephone conversations. Facilities were selected for sampling if: (1) The facilities were operating an apparently effective wastewater treatment system (especially if the water treated was intended for reuse); (2) the treatment system was used to treat pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging wastewater only; (3) the treatment system was similar to a system EPA was evaluating in a treatability study (the facility treatment system could then be used as a benchmark); (4) the expected active ingredients could be analyzed using developed analytical methods; and/or (5) the facility was treating wastewater that contained active ingredients (or structural groups) for which data was lacking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

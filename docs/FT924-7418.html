			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Attempted coup leaves Peruvians perplexed: Sally Bowen on questions raised by the move against Fujimori DETAILS of last Friday's coup attempt in Peru, allegedly intended to assassinate President Alberto Fujimori and kidnap the head of his joint chiefs of staff, emerged over the weekend. But they leave key questions unanswered. With Peru's return to 'democratic institutionality' (via elections for a constituent congress) less than a week away, opposition politicians are demanding that Mr Fujimori clarify his claim that 'the black hand of political interests' was behind the superficially tame attempt. Some 25 retired and serving army officers and a handful of civilians are under arrest. Trial will be by closed military court and proceedings have already been opened against the ringleaders - who have had no access to legal advice as yet. But there are still no details of involvement of politicians. As Mr Fujimori gave weekend interviews, journalists demanded evidence while retired generals termed the plot 'absurd and unreal'. Even Mr Fujimori called it 'crazy'. On the face of it, the conspiracy seems to have had faint chance of success. It was hatched, says the official version, by three retired and two serving army generals and led by General Jaime Salinas. He and the other two retired generals, Palomino and Pastor, had all served as heads of the military household in the government palace during the previous regime of President Alan Garcia. According to Mr Fujimori, Gen Salinas attempted an unpublicised coup in July 1990 to prevent him taking office. The intention this time, Mr Fujimori claims, was to impede next Sunday's elections. The plotters were to put themselves in key military and ministerial positions and reinstate the Congress which Mr Fujimori dissolved on April 5. Mr Fujimori insisted the conspirators were bent on assassinating him. He displayed on television a rifle fitted with telescopic sights captured during the arrests 'similar to the one used to kill President Kennedy'. His claim of attempted assassination was denied yesterday by Gen Salinas in a jail interview published by a Peruvian magazine. Gen Salinas was reported as saying that the intention had been only to remove Mr Fujimori and to install vice-president Maximo San Roman as president. Mr San Roman broke with Mr Fujimori after Congress was dissolved. In the early hours of Friday, the president and his family were whisked from government palace under heavy guard to a secret location. Tanks and troops blockaded Lima's main square. But the only hostile movement seems to have involved alleged assassin Captain Hugo Ormeno, who was arrested with five other men several hundred yards from his objective. The three generals accused of playing the leading role in the conspiracy were all forced into early retirement when Mr Fujimori assumed the presidency in July, 1990. In what he called an essential 'moralisation' process, he sacked many high-ranking officers from the armed forces and police. Some middle and higher-ranking officers complain that all key promotions are managed by retired captain Vladimiro Montesinos, Mr Fujimori's personal adviser. Lima is calm and and Mr Fujimori uncharacteristically jovial, apparently enjoying his new role as defender of democracy. The coup attempt has moved pre-election political debate still further to the sidelines and everything looks set for a comfortable government victory in Sunday's elections.</p>

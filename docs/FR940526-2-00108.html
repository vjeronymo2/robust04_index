			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.3.1&blank;Homeowner Data Collection <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the homeowner data-gathering phase, Runzheimer obtained sale prices of homes (called ``comparable sales'') in the area that matched the housing profiles. In the communities that were identified (see section 4.2.3), Runzheimer tried to obtain all the comparable sales during the 6-month period prior to the date of the survey. For the surveys covered in this report, the home sales pricing period was January 1993 through July 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As was done last year, Runzheimer contacted knowledgeable and helpful real estate professionals in each location and/or used real estate sales data and listing services. The amount of data obtained depended on the number of home sales in the community and the availability of square footage and other information. This in turn depended on the size of the community, the economic conditions, the quality and quantity of the realty data available, and the willingness and ability of local realty professionals and assessor offices to provide data. If the comparable sales data obtained from the first data sources were insufficient, Runzheimer contacted additional data sources in the area to attempt to secure more sales data, if practical. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.3.2&blank;Renter Data Collection <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In some cases, the same Realtors and brokers who assisted in our profiling phase were very active in the rental markets as well. When this occurred, Runzheimer obtained current rental rates and fees for our profiled apartments, townhouses, and houses from these sources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer also contacted rental management firms that operate apartment complexes matching the profile specifications. In large metropolitan areas, such as the Washington, D.C., area where rental complexes abound, our housing analysts conducted telephone surveys to obtain current rental information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPM modified the contract last year to expand the level of effort that Runzheimer expended in the collection of housing data. The result both last year and this year was a marked increase in the quantity of housing data collected for both rentals and sales. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rental data were obtained from a variety of sources, e.g., brokers, property managers, newspaper advertisements, and others. Analyses of these data indicated that there are two separate rental markets_a broker market and a non-broker market. Rental rates and estimates provided by brokers generally exceed those obtained from other sources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In each area, the quantity of data obtained from either source-type varies significantly. Therefore, analyzing all of the rental data (both broker and non-broker) together for an area and income level is undesirable. Because OPM has no information on how federal employees who rent generally secure their lodgings, Runzheimer applied equal weights to the broker and non-broker data to compute the overall average rental rate for the area and income level. (See Appendix 9B.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4.4&blank;Housing Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.4.1&blank;Homeowner Data Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One of the most important factors relating to the price of a home is the number of square feet of living space. For each income profile in each allowance area and the Washington, D.C., area, Runzheimer computed that average price per square foot for the comparables. Except as noted below, Runzheimer used this value times the reference square footage for the profile to determine the average home value for the profile. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer experienced difficulties in obtaining housing data in some areas. For example, despite several efforts to obtain more detailed information from various sources, Runzheimer was able to obtain very few comparable sales with square footage information for home sales in Mayaguez. Also, as noted earlier in this report, OPM elected to combine the St. Croix and St Thomas data to address concerns about the number of home-sale observations obtained in the Virgin Islands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.4.1.1&blank;Data Trimming <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on experience from the previous home-pricing surveys, last year OPM modified the living-cost model as it applied to the analysis of housing data. The modifications allowed the use of housing costs trend data as well as current housing costs in the analysis of owner and renter living costs. These analyses are consistent with section 591.205(b)(3) of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, and result in improved housing data results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the modifications involves ``trimming'' the observations. Runzheimer and OPM noted that a relatively few extreme values (values that were either exceptionally low or high cost) could have a significant influence on the average housing costs observed at an income level within an area. Including these extreme values had the potential to cause results to vary erratically from one year to the next. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In situations such as this, statisticians frequently use the median or trim the data in some manner to reduce its volatility. The use of the median home value was not desirable because some areas had relatively sparse data at one or more income levels. This could make the median unstable from one year to the next. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Last year Runzheimer recommended, and OPM agreed, that the observations be ranked from low to high on the basis of the cost per square foot and that the top and bottom 20% of the observations be ``trimmed'' (i.e., eliminated) from the data before averages or trends were calculated. (Data were not trimmed if there were four or fewer observations.) These procedures reduce the influence of home sales anomalies and make survey results more stable from one year to the next. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.4.1.2&blank;Special Considerations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The new procedures also involved analyzing data in a more thorough and integrated manner. The procedures required analyzing the current housing survey data, analyzing the trends observed when these data were compared with the previous survey's data, and comparing these trends with the views obtained from real estate professionals in the area. How and which data were used depended on the quality and quantity of data collected and how the trends observed agreed among income levels and with the views of local real estate professionals. These procedures are discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer sought to gather all of the appropriate comparable sales data available in each area. As a minimum, Runzheimer sought to obtain 10 Realtor sales per community per income level or 20 per income level per area. In many areas, the sales data exceeded the minimum. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the minimum number could not be obtained or if highly divergent trend data were observed among income levels in the area or as compared with the views of local real estate professionals, additional analyses were performed. These analyses were: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. If the current data were significantly better than the previous data (e.g., greater in quantity or more consistent), the current data were used to the extent practical. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. If at least three observations at each income level were available, and the previous data were better than the current data or the previous and current data were of equivalent quality, the change (i.e., trend) in the average price was used to update the previous data. This was done using one of the following procedures, depending on the situation: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

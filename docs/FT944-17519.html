			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: SocGen offers to buy remaining Sogenal stock Societe Generale, one of France's largest banks, yesterday announced a public offer to buy the remaining shares in Sogenal, a regional bank in which it is the dominant shareholder. Sogenal's shares were suspended on the Paris bourse yesterday in advance of the offer, the price of which will be determined in the middle of November. The offer - which will apply to the 800,000 publicly-held shares - is expected to be slightly in excess of the FFr127 at which the shares were trading yesterday before the suspension, after dropping slightly earlier in the day. Societe Generale already owns 94.5 per cent of Sogenal, which it set up in 1981. The banking group said it intended to restrict Sogenal's operations to private banking, regroup its activities and concentrate on capital markets activities and links with large companies. At the end of last month, Societe Generale reported net profits up 3.8 per cent to FFr2.24bn (Dollars 420m) for the six months to June 30 this year.</p>

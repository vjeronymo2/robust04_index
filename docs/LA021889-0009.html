			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL AND HUMAN-RIGHTS VIOLATIONS  </P> <P> The editorial reveals some important truths. When will Israeli leaders ever  realize that violence is getting them nowhere? When will they ever stop looking  on Palestinians as second-class citizens?  </P> <P> Violence on both sides must stop. It can only lead to more serious  brutalization. Many American Jews disagree with the policies and practices of  Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government. They feel that Israeli troops are  overreacting to the Palestinian threat.  </P> <P> This is a complex problem; it won't admit to a simplistic answer. It requires  the efforts of world leaders. They must impress upon Israeli and Palestinian  leaders the absolute necessity of diplomacy. Otherwise, if we don't establish  some kind of peace soon, we may find this strife leading us to a terrifying  configuration.  </P> <P> DON RADEMACHER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

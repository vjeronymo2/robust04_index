			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> FIREFIGHTERS OK PACT RAISING SALARIES 5%  </P> <P> Ending six months of negotiations, city firefighters have agreed to a new  four-year contract that includes a 5% annual pay increase, city officials  announced Thursday.  </P> <P> The new labor agreement is retroactive to July 1 and covers 23 non-management  fire personnel, Assistant City Manager Gregory L. Hulsizer said.  </P> <P> Besides the pay increase, the contract allows firefighters to retire at age 50  instead of 55, beginning in 1993. The contract expires June 30, 1993.  </P> <P> General city employees agreed to a new two-year contract in November, Hulsizer  said. That pact, which affects 160 non-management employees, provides a 5%  salary increase for fiscal year 1989-90 and a 4 1/2% increase for fiscal year  1990-91.  </P> <P> Negotiations are continuing with the city's 43-member police force. The city's  contract with the San Clemente Peace Officers Assn. expired Sunday. The police  union has complained that, according to a recent union survey, its members are  the lowest-paid police officers in Orange County.  </P></p>

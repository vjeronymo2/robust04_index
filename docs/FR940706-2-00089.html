FY 1994 Grant Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The grant application process for FY 1994 will consist of a one-stage, full application. Applications are limited to 20 single- or 40 double-spaced pages (excluding resumes, forms, etc.) and must relate to the selection criteria established for review of applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Priority areas in this announcement permit applicants to propose research efforts from 12 to 24 months in duration. In item 11 of the Face Sheet (page 1 of form SSA&hyph;96&hyph;BK) indicate the priority area under which the application is submitted, i.e., ORS&hyph;94&hyph;001, ORS&hyph;94&hyph;002, etc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part II. Priority Research Areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In particular, the following projects will be considered for funding:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Economic Circumstances of Aged Widows_ORS&hyph;94&hyph;001  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A high proportion of the elderly who are economically vulnerable are widowed women. Although as a group they experience one of the highest rates of poverty, approximately three-quarters of widows aged 65 or older are not poor. Data from the SIPP provide an opportunity to understand the economic circumstances of aged widows and to identify those factors that are associated with their late-life poverty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposals are sought for SIPP-based research that conducts two types of analyses of the poverty of aged widows. The first of these tasks is to provide a comprehensive description of the personal, financial, and environmental characteristics of poor elderly widows. These characteristics will include details of income amounts and specific sources, assets, personal and household characteristics (e.g., age, race, education, work history, fertility history, welfare recipiency history, health status, urban vs rural location, age at which widowhood occurred). This descriptive material should compare and contrast the incidence of poverty and its circumstances for aged widows with similar measures for single elderly women who have never married, aged married women, and, where sample size permits, elderly divorced women.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second task is to simulate the resulting economic scenario for married women aged 65 or older in the event of the death of their husbands. This will involve projecting the time path of income and assets for the widow, given the couple's economic circumstances at time of the SIPP interviews. The hypothetical widow's income should be based on Social Security and Supplemental Security Income program rules, any pension income she has earned in her own right, whether a husband with public or private pension rights has elected a survivor's option, asset income, the couple's life insurance holdings, and so forth. It is expected that, where possible, the economic status of the couple prior to the husband's death will be related to factors such as lifetime work experience of each spouse, current health status and health insurance coverage, etc. In addition, various scenarios for asset decumulation associated with health expenditures brought on by the husband's death might be introduced to account for reduced assets subsequently available to the surviving spouse [See Linda Del Bene and Denton R. Vaughan, ``Income, Assets and Health Insurance: Economic Resources for Meeting Acute Health Care Needs of the Aged,'' Social Security Bulletin, Spring 1992]. We are interested in learning how the economic status of aged widows compares with their circumstances prior to the husband's death, whether particular background factors can be used to predict which married women are particularly at risk of poverty in their old age, and how the incomes and assets of widows change as the duration of widowhood increases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grant proposals must be based on well-developed rigorous analysis. Applications may be submitted for multi-year funding not to exceed 24 months in duration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applications for multi-year funding should include a budget for the first budget period (not to exceed 12 months). If the application is approved, a grant will be awarded for the initial 12-month budget period. Funding will subsequently be provided for an additional 12-month budget period dependent on satisfactory performance of the initial budget period, continued relevance of the project, and the availability of FY funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is anticipated that an amount up to $100,000 will be allocated to fund one project under this priority area for the initial 12-month budget period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Selected Economic and Demographic Assumptions Used to Project the Financial Status of the OASDI Trust Funds_ORS&hyph;94&hyph;002  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The annual reports of the Board of Trustees of the Federal OASDI Trust Funds contain long-range, 75-year projections on the financial status of the trust funds. The assumptions and methodology underlying those projections were reviewed by the Panel of Technical Experts (the Panel) convened by the quadrennial Advisory Council on Social Security and recommendations for research were made. (The ``Social Security Technical Panel Report to the 1991 Advisory Council on Social Security'' and its appendices were reprinted in the November and December 1990 issues of the Social Security Bulletin.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOO MUCH SPIRIT  </P> <P> I read with interest the recent article about the USC band. It is wonderful  when a band and student body have spirit.  </P> <P> I grew up in a rather small Ohio town where football was and is what this town  is known for. Their band was and is phenomenal. But with all their spirit and  enthusiasm for the past 45 years, they have remembered that the opposing team,  band and fans are their guests, and they don't blare their fight song during  every play.  </P> <P> My sister and I were at the Ohio State-USC game last month. If we never hear  that USC fight song again, it will be too soon.  </P> <P> BARBARA CRONE  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No plant closures are expected from compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this set of alternatives. For more information, consult the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> background information document for these standards (see the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Background Information Documents <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section near the beginning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this preamble).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Rationale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Selection of Emission Points To Be Covered by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Emissions from BLR and WSR production occur from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following emission points: Storage tanks, process vents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment leaks, and wastewater. The proposed standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider all of these emission points. Wastewater emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from wet strength resin facilities are negligible, although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are included as an emission point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Designation of Sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For these proposed standards, a source is defined as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all HAP emission points within a facility that are related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the production of BLR or WSR, including process vents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage tanks, wastewater, and equipment leaks. For the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of developing the standards, the emission points  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the definition of the source are divided into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two portions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. All process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission points; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Equipment leaks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administrator considered proposing a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission limit that would apply to process vents, storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tanks, wastewater and equipment leaks. However, equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leaks cannot be included with process vents, storage tanks,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and wastewater because: (1) The negotiated standard for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment leaks has no fixed performance level; and (2) no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method currently exists for determining the magnitude of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowable emissions to assign for leaks. Without a method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine the magnitude of allowable emissions to assign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for equipment leaks, an averaging policy that included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment leaks would be difficult to enforce. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the MACT floor and each regulatory alternative has two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components_one for the combination of process vents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage tanks, and wastewater, and another for equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leaks. When methods are developed to assign allowable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission levels for particular leak points, the EPA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider revising these standards to allow inclusion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment leaks in the emission limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administrator also considered proposing separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission limits for each type of emission point, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that this approach was not feasible because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tanks, and wastewater emission points are intertwined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing control strategies. For example, in existing BLR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities, process vents and storage tank emissions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manifolded together and controlled using a common device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The device commonly used to control these emissions is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water scrubber, which functions in transferring potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HAP emissions from gaseous point sources to a wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission source. Therefore, a single emission limit is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combined to give facilities flexibility in complying with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the standard. Specifying a single emission limit for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combination of emission points gives facilities the latitude  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine the best way for them to achieve emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions. Separate regulatory options were identified for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment leaks for the reasons described at the beginning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Selection of Basis and Level of Proposed Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Existing Sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. BLR Source Category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because there are three existing facilities in the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that produce BLR (all three are believed to be major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources), EPA used the average of the total production-based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission factors achieved by the three facilities to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the MACT floors. Using this method, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production-based emission limit of 130 lb HAP/MM lb product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was established as the MACT floor for the process vents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage tanks, and wastewater portion of the source based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information from BLR facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing BLR facilities control equipment leak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions using various leak detection and repair (LDAR)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. The impacts associated with the MACT floor and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory alternatives for sources at existing BLR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities are presented in Table 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternative II represents the highest level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of control identified for existing BLR sources. Because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MACT floor for the process vents, storage tanks, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater portion of the source reflects a high level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control (the use of water scrubbers, carbon adsorbers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigerated condensers, and flares on process and storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tank vents, and biodegradation to reduce emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater), only one area was identified as a possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional controlled emission point: the generation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HAP-containing scrubber effluent, which is normally routed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the facility's wastewater treatment system. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater could be controlled by recirculating scrubber  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effluent to the process. This measure would result in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission limit of 125 lb HAP/MM production. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this emission limit was chosen for Regulatory Alternative II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater portion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the source. The control method proposed for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment leaks portion of the source was to implement the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LDAR program specified in 40 CFR 63, subpart H, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represents a higher level of control than is currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practiced by any existing BLR facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

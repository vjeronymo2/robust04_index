			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Huancayo, Peru, 26 Apr (EFE) -- Official sources  have reported that the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement  (MRTA), which has been oficially described as dismantled, has  called for a two-day "armed strike" in three Peruvian central  jungle region provinces. A police report released today in  Huancayo, 415 km southeast of Lima, states that the MRTA, which  is inspired by Ernesto "Che" Guevara, has called an "armed  strike" for 28 and 29 April according to announcements painted  on walls, circulated in bulletins, and written on flags.    The three Peruvian central jungle provinces where the "armed  strike," which is a strike under threat of death, is being  promoted are Chanchamayo and Satipo in Junin Department, the  capital of which is Huancayo, and Oxapampa in Pasco Department.    An official Defense Ministry communique issued on 21 April  states that the MRTA attacked a truck carrying soldiers and  civilians on the Villarrica highway to Oxapampa. They murdered  three soldiers and 12 civilians and wounded 30 people. Another  13 people are missing. The communique adds that the Army is  intensifying operations "to capture the members of the  narcoterrorist gangs" that operate in the region. [passage  omitted]    Until now the Shining Path was the only organization to have  called "armed strikes" in different parts of Peru, especially in  Ayacucho in the South Andean region where this organization was  born in 1980 and in Lima where the measure always failed despite  the fact that the transportation sector almost always obeyed the  strike call.    Some analysts believe this action may indicate the union of  the two subversives organizations, at least in the central  jungle region. [passage omitted]</p>

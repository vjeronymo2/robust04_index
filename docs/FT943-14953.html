			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: OFT to investigate Healthcall charges The Office of Fair Trading is to investigate allegations of anti-competitive practices by Healthcall, the UK's largest provider of out-of-hours doctors which came to the stock market in May. The OFT said yesterday that it would make 'some preliminary inquiries' into charges regarding Healthcall's relationship with the British Medical Association and its treatment of potential competitors. Mr Maurice Henchey, Healthcall's chief executive, dismissed the allegations as the work of 'political activists who accuse of us of privatising the National Health Service by the back door'. He denied suggestions that Healthcall threatens to cut off its service to doctors immediately it hears that they are planning to set up a duty doctors co-operative in competition. 'But if we find that they are approaching our staff or deputies we will make their lives difficult,' he said. Healthcall's duty doctor service, started almost 30 years ago, provides GPs with the out-of-hours cover they are obliged to supply. Under an exclusive agreement first signed in 1966 the BMA promotes Healthcall's duty doctor service and monitors its standards in return for a fee set at 0.5 per cent of reven-ues. Ms Dawn Primarolo, shadow health minister, has asked the OFT to consider whether the agreement falls under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act. The OFT said yesterday that it fell outside the scope of the Act, because of an exemption for the provision of medical services, but added that it would look at some of the other allegations being made against Healthcall. These centre on the effective monopoly Healthcall has in many urban areas and the difficulty some GPs say they have setting up co-operatives to compete with it. Dr John Cockburn, managing director of Nestor Medical Duty Services, Healthcall's smaller commercial rival, said that in many smaller urban areas there was only room in the market for one commercial duty doctor operation and that it was reasonable for Healthcall to warn doctors thinking of setting up co-operatives that Healthcall might have to pull out. He also dismissed the idea that the BMA agreement prevented Nestor competing effectively with Healthcall.</p>

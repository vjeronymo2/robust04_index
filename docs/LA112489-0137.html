			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> 5 SHOT, 2 KILLED, IN WESTLAKE  </P> <P> Two men were shot and killed and three others were wounded, including a  16-year-old pregnant girl shot in the stomach, all within the same Westlake  neighborhood on the first night of the Thanksgiving holiday, authorities said.  </P> <P> Three of the shootings were linked to an ongoing territorial war between an  established Latino gang and a newly formed, but unusually reckless, gang made  up mostly of first-generation Salvadoran youths, said Los Angeles Police  Detective Andy Cicoria.  </P> <P> The shootings began at 4:45 p.m. Thursday when a 26-year-old woman "walking on  the sidewalk and minding her own business caught a stray bullet in the neck,"  said Detective Terry Wessel. The woman was paralyzed from the neck down but was  listed in stable condition Friday at County-USC Medical Center.  </P> <P> At 9:30 p.m. the 16-year-old girl was shot in the stomach and left knee in a  drive-by incident, Wessel said. The girl was hospitalized in critical  condition, but the condition of her 4-month-old fetus was not immediately  known.  </P> <P> Another man died a block and a half away in a gang-related shooting about 6  a.m. today, Wessel said.  </P> <P> In an incident apparently unrelated to the gang war, another man was shot to  death late Thursday in a drug-related incident at the intersection of 6th  Street and Westlake Boulevard, Wessel said.  </P> <P> "They were dropping like flies around here," Wessel said.  </P></p>

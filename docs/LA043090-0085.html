			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIKE PENNER: HE'S BIG, BUT HIS GAME NOW LARGER THAN LIFE  </P> <P> Tank Kronemann rolled through Ojai again this year, just as he had during the  previous three, but there are always newcomers in the audience and on first  sighting, Tank's a lot for the optic nerve to deal with.  </P> <P> "Look at this moose," one elderly gentlemen exclaimed as he and a friend sat in  the bleachers, watching Trevor Kronemann peel off his massive UC Irvine sweat  suit.  </P> <P> "He must weigh 280," the friend replied, almost reverently.  </P> <P> For several minutes there is silence. Kronemann completes his warmups and the  tennis match commences. Tank smashes a few forehands. Tank crushes a few  serves.  </P> <P> "You know," the first man says, piping up again, "he'd probably make a lot more  money playing football."  </P> <P> The friend shakes his head.  </P> <P> "I'm not so sure," he says. "Looks to me like he's got a pretty good game."  </P> <P> That, in a nutshell, is the Tank Kronemann viewing experience. The first  impression arrives with a snicker, but stick around long enough and you'll take  your place among the converted.  </P> <P> "I hear everything that goes on in the stands. I'm very aware," Kronemann says.  "I catch flak for my size, for the way I play. I hear, daily, 'You can't be a  tennis player. You're too big. You're going to wear down.'  </P> <P> "But I have a chance to be a four-time All-American and only one other guy has  ever done that."  </P> <P> The other guy is Rick Leach, which isn't bad company for someone who looks like  a blond John Belushi and possesses the same sense of humor.  </P> <P> As Kronemann stands at the baseline, as he did during Sunday's third-set  tiebreaker against San Jose State's Mike Chinchiolo, he cuts an unforgettable  figure. Drenched in sweat, his white pullover shirt turns see-through, clinging  for dear life to a substantial belly that flops over his belt. A dirt-stained  knee brace stretches across a huge left thigh. Scraggly yellow locks billow  from beneath a neon green Big Dog surfer cap, its exaggerated, extra-long bill  flipped upward in goofball fashion. Yes, America, this is one of your finest  collegiate tennis players.  </P> <P> When Kronemann defeated Chinchiolo, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6, it gave him four singles  championships in four trips to the Ojai Valley Tennis Tournament. It also gave  him a 30-12 record for the 1990 season, which should boost his current No. 18  standing in the NCAA tennis rankings.  </P> <P> For the record, Kronemann is 6-feet-3 and, in season, weighs between 228 and  232 pounds. Off-season, after a summer of mom's lasagna, Kronemann checks in at  240, although UC Irvine Coach Greg Patton claims it's closer to 255.  </P> <P> In a sport where 195-pound Boris Becker is considered husky, Kronemann carries  a Refrigerator kind of persona. Spectators seem astonished, not only when he  runs down a volley, but just by his presence on the court.  </P> <P> Boy, he moves well for his size.  </P> <P> "He's a big-boned guy in a graceful, lithe sport," Patton says. "It'd be great  if he made it in the pros, because he'd bring a lot of new fans into the sport.  A lot of big people see him play and say, 'Hey, he looks just like me.' He's  living proof that great things can come in big packages."  </P> <P> Patton was the one who came up with the nickname Tank.  </P> <P> So, on this year's Irvine tennis media guide, Patton and Kronemann are pictured  together, a toy tank balanced on Kronemann's racket, underneath the  inscription: UCI's General and The Tank.  </P> <P> A couple of years earlier, when mega-forward Wayne Engelstad played for Bill  Mulligan's basketball team, Patton had another brainstorm. He wanted to dress  big Wayne in tennis togs, pose him next to Tank -- forming an industrial  strength doubles team -- and call them The Beasts of the Baseline.  </P> <P> "It would've made a great poster," Patton says.  </P> <P> Kronemann's strength as a tennis player isn't difficult to discern. The Tank  cranks. "I probably hit as hard as (Andre) Agassi," Kronemann says, not  boastfully. "I grew up with Jim Courier and Pete Sampras. Those guys don't hit  any harder than I do."  </P> <P> And, rest assured, none of them elicit the same kind of reaction Kronemann does  when they unload on a forehand or a serve.  </P> <P> When's the last time you saw a player hit a tennis ball so hard, people  laughed?  </P> <P> With Kronemann, it happens. With a seeming flick of the wrist, Kronemann can  pulverize a ball -- "BBs out of a cannon" is how Patton describes it -- and the  ball screams off the racket like a sonic boom. In its own way, it can be as  awesome as a Jose Canseco home run. The viewer is left so stunned, so  delightfully startled, that the only response he can muster is a nervous  giggle.  </P> <P> Kronemann believes this to be his great equalizer. If his game appears better  suited for doubles -- hell, he is a doubles team -- Kronemann maintains that  Big Thunder, along with a lot of heart, will make him a top 100 singles player  on the pro circuit.  </P> <P> "Last Christmas at Sarasota, I beat Jimmy Brown, who's No. 80 in the world,"  Kronemann says. "Two weeks before that, he beat (Mats) Wilander, 6-0, 6-1.  </P> <P> "I have the type of game that's real explosive. If I get in a groove for two,  three weeks at a time, I can be a top 100 player.  </P> <P> "I don't care what it takes. If I have to live out of a van and eat sandwiches  and scrape and crawl my way to the top, I'm going to do it."  </P> <P> As Kronemann says, "There are exceptions to the rule. I'm hoping to become the  Spud Webb of tennis."  </P> <P> It's an odd analogy, but only until you begin to think about it. Webb is a  little man making a living in a big man's game. Kronemann is a big man trying  to survive in a little man's game. Already, Kronemann has changed the lexicon  of the sport. At Irvine, for instance, it is now considered a compliment to  tell a player he just tanked a match.  </P></p>

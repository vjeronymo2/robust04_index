			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Warrants: what's the risk? - The Speculator / How to assess an investment for the brave-hearted THE POTENTIAL advantages and disadvantages of an investment in warrants were highlighted in my article last week. But how do you assess the relative attractiveness of individual warrants? The most important consideration must be the underlying performance of the company's ordinary shares. If a company is going through a poor period and the ordinary shares have fallen in price, then their respective warrants will not perform well, irrespective of their own technical merit. Individuals should use the usual methods of analysis when evaluating the ordinary shares, such as future company profitability, assets and the record of management. In evaluating the warrants themselves, prospective investors will need to analyse factors including the time to expiry, gearing, price volatility and the capital fulcrum point (CFP). The price premium Owing to the potential benefits that warrants confer, they will normally (though not necessarily) command a higher price than the warrant is intrinsically worth at its conversion date. This 'conversion premium' is the price one pays for buying the warrants rather than the shares. The lower the premium, the 'cheaper' the warrants. The premium is calculated by adding the warrant price to the exercise price, then deducting the share price, and finallydividing the result by the share price. Investors will find that premiums vary dramatically and are one of the most important technical factors used when evaluating the worth of a warrant. Time to expiry The longer the remaining life of a warrant, the greater the opportunity for its intrinsic value to increase as the underlying share price appreciates. Accordingly, the premium also takes into account and incorporates what is known as 'time value'. This reflects the likely appreciation in price during the remainder of the warrant's life. The time value may be considerable if a warrant has several years to run, but will diminish as the time to expiry approaches. Capital Fulcrum Point (CFP) The Capital Fulcrum Point is an indicator of the annual percentage growth of the share price required for an individual to be equally well off, in capital appreciation terms, whether he buys the warrants or the shares. A growth rate above the CFP will make the warrants a better buy; a growth rate below the CFP will be better for the shares. If, when calculated, the CFP equals 8 per cent and the share price were actually to rise by 10 per cent per annum to the final conversion date, then investors would have been better off buying the warrants. In general, the lower the CFP, the more attractive the warrants. An example of the above principles may help. XYZ plc's share price is currently Pounds 1.20, with an exercise price of Pounds 1.10. The warrants, priced at 40p, currently command a premium of 25 per cent (Pounds 1.10+40-Pounds 1.20 = 30p; dividing by Pounds 1.20 gives 25 per cent). The warrants have eight years' life remaining. In this case, the CFP is 4.06 per cent. Theoretically, therefore, if the shares rise at this level over the next eight years, investors would be equally well off with either the warrants or the ordinary shares. (You would actually be better off with the shares as this calculation does not take account of dividends paid, only capital appreciation). The formula for calculating the CFP is extremely complicated and an expert should be consulted. Volatility The more volatile a company's share price, the more likely it is that the warrants will show a capacity to provide higher levels of capital gains (or losses). As you can see, evaluating warrants is a technical process involving a number of variables. Without the benefit of professional advice, this analysis may be beyond many ordinary investors. However, help is always at hand. The 'Warrants Alert' newsletter includes a constantly updated table of expensive or cheap warrants based purely on technical analysis. It is published by Andrew McHattie (0275-855 558). McHattie has also produced an introductory guide to warrants costing Pounds 6 and, for more sophisticated investors, has written a book entitled The Investor's Guide to Warrants, costing Pounds 42.55. The Association of Investment Trust Companies (071-586 5347) also publishes a free factsheet guide for individuals thinking of making an investment. I cannot stress enough the need for accurate and detailed analysis prior to making an investment into warrants. It is a volatile market in which the opportunities for spectacular capital gains are counter-balanced by the possibility of an investment falling to zero. Investment into warrants should in my opinion, never form more than 10 per cent of an overall balanced portfolio. Used wisely, however, they will make a valuable contribution to the portfolio's overall capital growth prospects. David Harris is managing director of Chantrey Financial Services.</p>

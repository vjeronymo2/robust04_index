			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Break-up worries hit ICI SHARES in ICI languished at the start of the new trading account after the bear case for the group's proposed split was widely publicised in the Sunday press. Analysts who are not gagged by their participation in the impending Pounds 1.3bn rights issue have been arguing that the break-up value of the company is between 950p and Pounds 10. The estimates are steadily approaching the ground-breaking and pessimistic analysis by Smith New Court last November. Even some analysts involved in the cash call have apparently been voicing their concern privately. As a result, said one observer: 'Fund managers are creeping in with increasingly cold feet.' Everything hinges on the attitude in the US and, at a time when swingeing reforms are overhanging the pharmaceuticals industry, US investors are unlikely to be euphoric about Zeneca, the pharmaceuticals arm. Others argue that the huge fund-raising exercise will be acclaimed as a success in the same way that Wellcome's giant flotation last year was heralded in spite of sharp share price falls. They say institutions are unlikely to turn down the benefits of the discounted shares but may take them only to sell Zeneca stock soon afterwards. Yesterday, ICI shares were down 15 at worst and closed a net 8 easier at 1182p. The ADS US equivalents were also lower. Meanwhile, Wellcome shares were sharply weaker, falling 22 to 702p in spite of an announcement that Prudential had increased its stake to 4 per cent. The slide was prompted by a large overhang of stock washing around the market.</p>

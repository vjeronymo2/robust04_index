			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (News and Analysis): Renewed drive to combat fraudsters - Benefits Proposals for the electronic payment of social security benefits in post offices will be announced by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, today as part of a renewed programme to tackle fraud. Foreshadowing the plan in his Budget speech yesterday Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said a proposed Pounds 300m package of measures against social security fraud would save Pounds 2.5bn over three years. He said existing efforts to prevent fraud in the social security system were already saving Pounds 700m. Details of the new electronic payments scheme will be revealed today. Mr Lilley yesterday announced a general uprating of social security benefits in line with inflation from next April. Income-related benefits will rise by about 1.9 per cent - calculated on the basis of the retail price index minus some housing costs - while contributory ones will increase by at least 2.2 per cent, in line with the September RPI. Expenditure on social security - the biggest item of government expenditure  -will be Pounds 86.5bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 89bn in 1996-97. It is scheduled to break through the Pounds 90bn barrier in 1997-98 to reach Pounds 93.5bn. Anti-poverty campaigners reacted coldly to the Budget. The Child Poverty Action Group said the chancellor had 'done little to stem the rising tide of family poverty,' and would be replacing social security with social insecurity through reductions in housing support. Church Action on Poverty said each Budget made it clearer that those in poverty had 'no place in the government's plans'. The Budget's failure to take any steps towards a better financial regime for charities brought bitter criticism from the Charities Tax Reform Group. Mr Ian Macgregor, its chairman, said charities appeared not to exist 'except when it comes to providing the services which the government does not want to fund'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Mario Esquivel] </F>   [Text] Mexico City, 9 Jun (PL) -- The Third National  Campaign for Cuba in Mexico concluded today after collecting  nearly 200 tons of fuel, medicine, food, and school supplies, a  reflection of the traditional ties between the two peoples.    In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Jesus Escamilla, coordinator  of the solidarity group Let's Go for Cuba, reported that on this  occasion they managed to collect 160 tons of hydraulic oil, 14  tons of rice, and a yet undetermined amount of medicine, school  supplies, and various other materials.    The humanitarian aid, he added, will soon be transported to  the Port of Tampico and from there will be shipped to its final  destination in the largest of the Antilles. Also, on Thursday  members of organizations that support Cuba gathered in front of  the headquarters of Mexican Petroleum (Pemex) and disclosed the  text of a note handed to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari at  the National Palace.    The document urges the Mexican chief of state to take  advantage of the high-level contacts that will take place in  upcoming days between the governments of the two nations to  produce and strengthen agreements in the economic and political  areas that would represent progress in the struggle against the  U.S. blockade.    Moreover, the document adds that the difficult energy  situation facing the Cuban people forces us to urge the  government of this country to adopt a number of measures, on a  priority basis, to favor mechanisms to supply petroleum to Cuba.  It points out that the blockade must be broken up, not with  words, but with concrete actions to show the Washington  administration that it cannot step over the sovereignty of  peoples and nations.    The organization points out that it is pleased with the  progress achieved by trade agreements on fossil fuels, which for  some time were among the goals of this movement in solidarity  with Cuba. Organization members said this third campaign showed  that concrete people-to-people solidarity actions reflect the  determination to erect a wall to block U.S. restrictions against  Cuba.</p>

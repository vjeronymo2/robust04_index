			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- A lower house committee on  Thursday [24 March] approved a proposal for major tax cuts in  1995 and beyond to follow the planned cuts for 1994.    Finance committee directors of the House of Representatives  approved the proposal to add to the special income tax reduction  bill a provision calling for further income tax cuts in 1995 and  beyond. The proposal was made by the opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) in an amendment to the bill submitted to  the committee earlier in the day.    The current bill calls for an income tax reduction only for  1994.    The amendment is due for approval at a lower house plenary  session on Friday evening.    The ruling coalition earlier agreed to decide on a sweeping  tax reform plan, including additional income tax cuts, by the  end of the year.</p>

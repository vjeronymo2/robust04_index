			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SET YOUR VCR  </P> <P> Mad Love (Showtime, Wednesday at 10 a.m.). The great pioneer cameraman Karl  Freund turned director in this 1935 version of "The Hands of Orlac."  </P> <P> Peter Lorre stars. (1:10)  </P> <P> The Shooting (TBS, Wednesday at 7:45 p.m.). Monte Hellman's 1967 existentialist  Western, starring Jack Nicholson and written by Adrien Joyce ("Five Easy  Pieces"), features Millie Perkins as an imperious woman demanding Warren Oates  escort her across a vast desert for a price; Nicholson is a mysterious man in  black leather on their trail. The film can be taken as an allegory or a  suspense drama-or both. (1:45)  </P> <P> The Hollywood Revue of 1929 (TNT, Wednesday at midnight). MGM's all-star revue  was designed to show its contract players not only could talk but, in some  instances, could also sing! A genuine collector's item. (2:40)  </P> <P> Hell's Angels on Wheels (KABC, Saturday at 3:30 a.m.). Richard Rush's  definitive 1967 biker picture, which though ironic in tone, is also  disturbingly seductive. Jack Nicholson and Sabrina Scharf star as a young  couple who become involved with the Hell's Angels to their eventual regret.  (1:52)  </P> <P> A complete listing of the week's films begins on Page 68.  </P></p>

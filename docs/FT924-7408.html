			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / IRA renews threat to London 'prestige' targets THE IRA yesterday admitted it had planned to detonate more than two tonnes of explosives in London at the weekend. A statement issued in Dublin said that the bombings had been prevented by 'sheer ill-luck'. The claim followed an attempted attack on the Canary Wharf development in London's Docklands - the second time in two days a bombing attack on London had been thwarted. Two days earlier police found a truck loaded with a tonne of fertiliser-based explosive in Stoke Newington, north London. The IRA statement said: 'Over the weekend our volunteers planned to detonate in excess of two tonnes of explosives at prestige targets in central London. Sheer ill-luck prevented the successful execution of these operations.' It added: 'Rather than propagandise about 'foiled' IRA attacks the British establishment and media would do well to reflect on what will continue to be the inescapable consequences of their government's denial of the Irish people's sovereign right to national self-determination.' In the attempted attack on Canary Wharf two terrorists parked a Ford Transit van packed with explosives 20 yards from the base of the 800ft Canada Square tower. When challenged by security guards the terrorists threatened them with a gun and drove away in an Escort van. Police later found the van abandoned about two miles away in Bethnal Green. Commander David Tucker, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad, praised the vigilance of the two guards. 'The alertness of the security guards at Canary Wharf deserves special credit and praise,' he said, urging the public to act as the 'eyes and ears' of the police. In the Stoke Newington incident one man was arrest-ed and another escaped. A five-tonne Volvo truck was seized.</p>

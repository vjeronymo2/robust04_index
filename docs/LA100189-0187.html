			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALKS ON PEACE IN LEBANON OPEN IN SAUDI RESORT  </P> <P> The Lebanese Parliament, divided and decimated by 14 years of civil war,  unofficially convened for the first time in more than a year Saturday with a  vow to "show that the Lebanese want to live together."  </P> <P> "The Lebanese people look at this as a turning point," Parliament Speaker  Hussein Husseini said at the beginning of talks on a proposed "national  reconciliation charter" to restructure the government, elect a new president  and end the fighting.  </P> <P> "Our success opens the way for peace. Our failure opens the way to hell and  chaos. We have to succeed," Husseini declared.  </P> <P> Sixty-two of the Parliament's 73 surviving members arrived for talks in this  resort community perched in the mountains above the smothering heat of the  Saudi desert. Called together by a three-member Arab League committee that  engineered a shaky cease-fire Sept. 23, the Parliament launched a series of  closed-door meetings on political reforms that would give Muslims a stronger  voice in the government and eventually lead to the withdrawal of foreign troops  from Lebanon.  </P> <P> Warring factions have temporarily dropped their guns but remain bitterly  divided over what course the reforms should take, leaving grave doubts about  whether any real agreement can be reached during this week's informal sessions.  </P> <P> But the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al Faisal, opening the talks with a  statement from King Fahd, urged the deputies to use the committee's proposed  reconciliation charter as a starting point from which to work out an agreement.  </P> <P> "The past 14 years of war did not achieve anything. The time is now ripe to  stop the shelling and accusations and start building peace with wisdom,  patience and intelligence," he said.  </P> <P> "You must rely on yourselves and prove to the world that you can achieve peace.  The issue is now in your hands."  </P> <P> The debate appeared bound for deadlock last week when Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun,  commander of the Maronite Christian forces and head of Lebanon's provisional  Christian government, vowed to oppose implementation of political reforms  unless the Arab League guarantees a pullout of Syrian troops from Lebanon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 40,000 Syrian Troops  </P> <P> Damascus, which has an estimated 40,000 troops in the country under what began  as a 1976 peacekeeping mandate, has already declared that it will not withdraw  until political reforms are in place giving Muslims a stronger voice in the  government.  </P> <P> The proposed new charter drawn up by the Arab League committee calls for  redeploying Syrian troops to eastern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley but gives them two  years after a new, united government takes power to do so.  </P> <P> The heart of the proposal is a plan for the Christians, once the most populous  sect in Lebanon, to surrender their historic dominance to a partnership with  the Muslims.  </P> <P> The proposal suggests increasing the seats in Parliament from 99 to 128, to be  divided equally between Muslims and Christians. At the same time, it would  strip the authority of the president, traditionally a Christian, to appoint and  dismiss prime ministers and vest that authority instead with Parliament.  </P> <P> Lebanon has been without a head of state since September, 1988, when the deeply  divided Parliament was unable to elect a successor to former President Amin  Gemayel.  </P> <P> The political crisis led to the most vicious fighting of the civil war. Aoun,  convinced that foreign intervention is to blame for Lebanon's problems, vowed  to rout Syrian forces from the country. The Syrians retaliated with their own  blockades of Christian ports and with stepped-up military support for Muslim  militias.  </P> <P> Nearly 900 people have died in the latest round of fighting.  </P> <P> The last full meeting of Parliament was in June, 1988. Of that body's 99  original deputies, all elected in Lebanon's last national elections in 1972,  only 73 survive.  </P> <P> Because the Parliament cannot legally convene outside Lebanon, any agreement  reached here would have to be ratified inside the country.  </P> <P> The deputies recessed after the opening session, then went behind closed doors  for another 2 1/2-hour meeting Saturday evening.  </P> <P> Saudi officials kept the deputies isolated in a hotel, at one point even  cutting telephone lines in what may have been an attempt to avoid public  posturing.  </P> <P> In a brief interview with reporters, former Prime Minister Saeb Salaam said he  is hopeful that a resolution can be reached.  </P> <P> "I am always hopeful," he added. "It's my nature. But hope should help. We have  so many problems."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 10 (TANJUG) -- The head of the  Croatian Bureau in Belgrade Zvonimir Markovic said Tuesday [10  May] that Croatia was interested in the opening of air corridors  between Belgrade and Zagreb so that planes would not have to fly  the roundabout way. He told this to the Yugoslav Minister for  Transport and Communications Blagoje Lucic, the Yugoslav  Information Ministry reported.    The question of the establishment of direct  telecommunication  links between Belgrade and Zagreb was also examined during the  talks as well as the normalisation of road and rail traffic,  following an agreement with the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK).  The RSK was declared by the Serbs on their ethnic ancestral  lands in Croatia in response to Croatia's forcible secession  from the former Yugoslavia and the downgrading of the Serb  people to a national minority.    The head of the Yugoslav Bureau in Zagreb Veljko Knezevic  said Monday that the Yugoslav Vice Premier Zeljko Simic and the  Croatian Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Mate Granic would  most probably meet at the end of May in Belgrade to discuss the  possibility of the opening of the Belgrade-Zagreb highway, the  establishment of rail and telecommonuciations links and the  linking of Yugoslav and Croatian power systems.    All economic and political relations between Yugoslavia  (Serbia/Montenegro) and Croatia were cut off in 1991 because of  Zagreb's unilateral forcible secession from the Yugoslav  Federation. The normalisation of political relations between  the two countries began in March this year with the opening of  the Yugoslav and Croatian bureaus in Zagreb and Belgrade  respectively, which had been agreed in Geneva in January by  Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic and his Croatian  counterpart Granic. According to the Yugoslav interpretation  the normalisation of relations between Belgrade and Zagreb in no  way presupposes a political settlement in the RSK, which should  be reached bilaterally by the Croatian and Krajina sides.</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / The Middle East: 'The world has changed completely' - Peres defends agreements before an astonished Knesset 'THIS is the beginning of the end of our 100-year dispute with the Palestinians. And you, yesterday's men, can't see five steps forward.' With these words, before a raucous Israeli Knesset yesterday, Israel's foreign minister, Mr Shimon Peres, hit back at his critics on the opposition benches, and defended agreements for granting Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories. 'The world has changed completely,' shouted Mr Peres at members of the opposition Likud, 'and only you haven't realised it.' News of the agreements between Mr Peres and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) stunned almost everyone. When Mr Peres first disclosed the agreements to his cabinet colleagues on Sunday morning, jaws dropped. Mr Elyakim Rubinstein, the man who has led Israel's negotiators through almost two years of unproductive dialogue with the Palestinians in Washington, was said to have been 'flabbergasted' at what had been achieved behind his back, and threatened to resign. No sooner had the first shock waves passed, than the opposition reacted furiously. Settlers' leaders in the West Bank and Gaza Strip were unimpressed by government assurances that not a single settlement would be moved during the planned five-year autonomy period. Right-wing Knesset members have been united in their demands for new elections, claiming that the prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, has no mandate for making deals with the PLO. Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, the Likud leader, urged the government in yesterday's stormy Knesset debate to 'go to the people. Tell them the truth.' Mr Netanyahu has accused Messrs Rabin and Peres of betraying their country by offering the PLO 'a headquarters 15 minutes from Jerusalem' from which to plot Israel's destruction. The secretary-general of the Labour party, Mr Nissim Zvilli, told the French TV station TF1 he did not think it was yet the time for Israel to recognise the PLO. Mr Peres's cabinet colleagues, by contrast, have been almost unanimous in their delight at the foreign minister's progress, many echoing his own talk of a 'major breakthrough'. Well aware that public opinion here remains sensitive to both the idea of territorial compromise and direct contacts with the PLO, several ministers - including Mr Rabin himself - have taken pains to stress that the agreements are not a harbinger of a PLO state and that Israel will not formally recognise the PLO unless it renounces terrorism and deletes various anti-Israeli sections of its charter. Almost two decades of general elections have shown that public opinion is divided between those who regard Israeli control of the territories as crucial to its security and those who believe the state can only prosper once the Palestinians are given self-rule. An instant survey, conducted overnight by the Yediot Ahronot tabloid, showed that this division persists, with 53 per cent of those polled saying they support the 'Gaza and Jericho first' autonomy proposals, and 45 per cent against.

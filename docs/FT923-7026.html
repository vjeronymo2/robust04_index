			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading SPECULATION that there would be no rise in UK interest rates gave a further boost to stock index futures, though reports of a French opinion poll indicating reduced support for the Maastricht treaty weakened sentiment a little later in the day, writes Joel Kibazo. After a weak opening at 2,356, the September contract on the FT-SE moved steadily forward for the first two hours of business as dealers moved to reduce bear positions. The speculation about German Lombard rate, along with strength in the gilts and short sterling markets, helped to boost the contract further. Following the strong morning rise, the September future traded in a narrow range of 2,378 and 2,382 for the rest of the session, with the news from Paris only causing a slight dip in mid-afternoon. September closed at 2,379, up 16 from Tuesday's close and around 4 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 12. Turnover remained dull, reaching a mere 6,915 contracts. In traded options, turnover was poor in spite of the expiry of the August stock options. Volume reached 29,204, with the FT-SE 100 option on 7,515 lots. Hanson was the top stock option on 3,055 contracts.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Books: Men of passion, writers of stature - Jackie Wullschlager reviews contrasting studies of the lives and work of two giants of 19th century French literature BALZAC by Graham Robb Picador Pounds 20, 521 pages STENDHAL by Jonathan Keates Sinclair Stevenson Pounds 20, 446 pages Oscar Wilde called him the inventor of the 19th century. To English eyes, he has always been the French writer who most embodies our love affair with decadent, romantic, venal Paris. The small fat man who stalked the faubourgs for inspiration about everyday life and so became the father of the realistic novel, Balzac is the voice of pre-1848 France as surely as Dickens speaks for Victorian England. This is the first English biography for 50 years. It reaffirms the Balzac myth with all the detail and domestic precision of the Comedie Humaine novels and it has a splendid story to tell. Born in 1799 in Tours, Balzac was an object of instant dislike to his 20-year-old mother, who put him out to nurse, ignored him while she pursued her lovers and sent him to a boarding school which did not believe in holidays. From the ages of eight to 14, he saw his family twice. But in 1813, his headmaster demanded that he be removed at once. Almost comatose, unable to speak, thin and puny, it then emerged that Balzac had passed much of his school years locked up either in a dungeon or in a cupboard under the stairs. He had done little classwork but had devoured every book in the school library. In a horrible way, the pattern of his life was set. When he wrote his novels, he always wore a monk's habit and sat in a darkened room with only a coffee-pot, to make sure he kept awake, as a prop. His parents moved to Paris and at 19 Balzac persuaded them to fund him as a writer. Bourgeoise respectability dictated the deal. Balzac was secretly set up in a room on the edge of the Marais, friends were told he had gone south to work; he promised only to come out at night and to keep to the suburbs. 'In listening to these people, I could espouse their lives. I felt their rags upon my back; I walked with my feet in their tattered shoes; their desires, their wants - everything passed into my soul,' he said of those nocturnal walks. After a few pot-boilers, he wrote the first of the hundred or so tales of Parisian and provincial life - Le Pere Goriot, La Cousine Bette - that make up the Comedie Humaine. They were instantly successful and soon he was the most famous novelist in France. A good literary biography has at its heart the flow between the life and work, the key impulses towards fictional creation. In Balzac's case, they were consciously bound up with sexual energy - he told Dumas that a night of love cost half a volume and that 'no woman alive is worth two volumes a year.' His books are laced with the battle between desire and ascetism. The hero of The Magic Skin has opera glasses equipped with a monocle which turns sexiness to ugliness, and so watches the beautiful women on stage without yearning. But Balzac's major figures are corrupt sensualists, androgynes like Vautrin, Rastignac and de Rubrempre, who had a profound influence on fin -de-siecle decadence - Rubrempre's death, said Wilde, was 'one of the greatest tragedies of my life.' Robb probes the psychological depths of neither the man nor the novels. Instead, he loses his subject in a whirl of social climbing, adulterous aristocrats and possible illegitimate children. Only the turning point of Balzac's life cuts through this morass. In 1832, he received a fan's letter from Odessa signed L'Etrangere. He was so taken by it that he placed an answer in the Gazette de France. Fifteen years of love letters and rare meetings with Madame Hanska, a Polish countess, followed. Love and money play on each other throughout the Comedie Humaine, and so in life. 'All my other passions were just a deposit for this one,' Balzac said. He lived well and overspent; when her husband died Mme Hanska held off from him because he lacked the financial acumen of his characters. After years of madcap trips to Poland mixed with 18-hour working days, he married her. Five months later he was dead. 'I always found them sitting by the fireside and they talked and talked until morning. Whatever could they find to talk about for so long?' recalled the valet who brought them coffee in the small hours. Anecdotes like these are the high points of an enthusiastic but flawed biography. Balzac, Zola and Flaubert are all popular classics in England but among French 19th century novelists, none is regarded with more suspicion here than Stendhal. Balzac called Stendhal the Machiavelli of the 19th century and for the English, Stendhal's reputation as a grey and difficult Gallic literary anatomist is one that not even last year's bodice-ripping television version of Scarlet and Black managed to overcome. This stunning new biography will change our view of Stendhal for good. In the 'vast, gorgeous tracts' of Stendhal's life as a Napoleonic soldier and lover, Jonathan Keates sees a complex man whose sensuality and 'massively humane curiosity' lay behind every line he wrote. Here is Stendhal whose great panoramic novel, Scarlet and Black and The Charterhouse of Parma, emerged out of his own passions and disappointments and are warm human dramas. Keates makes clear how Stendhal's revolutionary bridging of the gap between Romanticism and 19th century realistic fiction had much to do with a temperament torn between nostalgia and cynicism. This is an exhilarating portrait; sensitive, original, perfectly pitched between art and life. Stendhal was born Henri Deyle in 1783 and it is as a figure formed by 18th century values that Keates depicts him. He came from a well-off Grenoble family, slipped into a post in the Ministry of War, and from 1800 followed Napoleon's campaign in Italy and Austria. He was small, ugly and obsessed by physical beauty in others, and he spent most of his time in salons and opera houses, pursuing aristocratic hostesses and singers. After the fall of Napoleon he retired to Italy, adopted his pseudonym and began to write. At 59, unmarried, syphilitic and obscure, he dropped dead in a Paris street. At once refined and emotionally wild, Stendhal sings out from these pages like a character from a Mozart opera. He was, says Keates, a sexual freebooter who 'found a notion of obtaining happiness from a virtuous woman wholly inconceivable.' Often he played Don Giovanni - driven by sexual intrigue, he marked the date of conquests on his braces, and recorded them in a secret code. He bribed maids, hid in trunks to spy on unfaithful mistresses, hung towels from his balcony to tell lovers when it was safe. But despite the opera buffo roles it was a series of tortured unconsummated obsessions which fuelled his art. Alexandrine was the muse for Gina de Sanseverina in The Charterhouse of Parma. A fixation on a high-handed Italian countess called Metilda inspired his heroine Mathilde de la Mole. War and love made up his life, but he was neither greatly successful nor ambitious in either, and Keates suggests that it was a backwards glance at his roving existence which created the ambivalent tone of Scarlet and Black (1830). A lifetime's emotions tumbled out in this novel. The mercantile mayor was modelled on his greedy father; elusive Madame de Renal on his adored mother. The opera fanatic's penchant for romantic theatricality battles with Stendhal the cool modernist, who wins out. The moral of Scarlet and Black is that 'the men we honour are simply rogues who have been lucky enough not to get caught red-handed'. Stendhal saw his novel as a journey down the highway which reflected the 'blue of the skies and the mire of the road below'. Keates marvellously captures both aspects of the man and his work.</p>

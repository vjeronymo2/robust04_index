			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Efim creditors meet to decide on action A GROUP of banks that are owed money by Efim, the Italian state holding company, met in London yesterday in the first sign of concerted action by banks around the world to recover Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.05bn) of foreign debts owed by the group. It also emerged that a group of Japanese banks, led by Sanwa and Mitsubishi, are among the largest creditors of the group, which is to be wound up. About 15 international banks are owed more than Dollars 30m each and there are more than 150 bank creditors. The announcement that the Italian government is to dismantle Efim has dismayed bankers, who were not warned of the move and who are concerned about whether they will be repaid in full. Any failure would have dire consequences for Italy's standing in international financial markets. Yesterday morning a group of banks owed Ecu300m (Pounds 215m) by the group met to decide what action they should take. The syndicate is led by Bankers Trust International and Mitsubishi Bank. The lead banks in a number of banking syndicates have already established informal contact in an attempt to co-ordinate their actions. Mitsubishi Bank, in charge of the Ecu300m syndicate and itself thought to be owed some Dollars 53m, was named yesterday as a likely leader in any discussions with the Italian authorities.</p>

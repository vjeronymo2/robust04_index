			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / International Company News: Profits decline at Danisco PRE-TAX PROFITS at Danisco, the Danish distilling, sugar and packaging group, were down at the half-year to October 31 to DKr323m (Dollars 53.8m) from DKr468m, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The group blamed 'exceptionally difficult economic conditions,' including weak international demand and the appreciation of the krone against a number of currencies which have devalued recently. The group's half-year sales were up slightly from DKr6.43bn to DKr6.47bn. Profits before financial items and minority shares fell by only DKr6m to DKr495m. The group said second-half pre-tax profits would be higher, but lower than last year. Lauritzen Group, the shipping and shipbuilding business, said it would break even in the current year after difficult conditions in international shipping and offshore drilling. The group made a pre-tax profit of DKr588m in 1991 on turnover of DKr8.15bn.</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Cuba's nuclear plant shelved CUBA'S President Fidel Castro said at the weekend his government was suspending indefinitely the construction of Cuba's first nuclear power plant because it could not afford to complete it, Reuter reports from Havana. The project was the latest casualty of Cuba's current economic crisis, triggered by the collapse of preferential trade links with east Europe. Havana was unable to accept Russia's conditions to help complete the project near Cienfuegos.</p>

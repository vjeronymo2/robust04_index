			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (8) With respect to the State review standard in paragraph (a)(14), the standards in 34 CFR 668.13, regarding an institution's financial responsibility; the provisions in 34 CFR 668.14 regarding an institution's administrative capability; and the standards in 34 CFR 600.30 regarding a person's ability to affect substantially the actions of an institution;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) With respect to the State review standard in paragraph (a)(17), the requirements in section 484B of the HEA regarding an institution's refund policy; and, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) With respect to the State review standards in paragraph (a)(18), the provisions in section 485(a) of the HEA regarding the calculation of the completion or graduation rate of certificate- or degree-seeking, full-time undergraduate students; the standard in 34 CFR 668.15 regarding the withdrawal rate of students at an institution; and, the provisions in section 481(e)(2) of the HEA regarding the placement rate and graduation rate of students enrolled in educational programs of less than 600 clock-hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary recognizes that many of the referenced Title IV, HEA program standards will be revised or recodified in the near future as additional regulations are published implementing changes made in the HEA by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary invites public comment regarding the development of standards under the proposed framework and on alternative approaches that would assure the development of meaningful and rigorous standards. Specifically, the Secretary seeks comment on ways to establish common methodologies for computing quantitative standards, and common recordkeeping requirements associated with those standards, among institutions in all States, and among the three members of the Integrity triad in a manner that reduces the administrative burden on institutions and the triad. In addition, the Secretary invites comments on approaches that would minimize extreme disparities in standards between States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 667.22&blank;Disapproval of State Review Standards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 494C(d) of the HEA, State-developed standards are ``subject to disapproval by the Secretary.'' In accordance with that section of the HEA, in &sect;667.22, the Secretary proposes procedures under which the Secretary evaluates a State's review standards to determine whether to disapprove those standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, in &sect;667.22(a), a State must submit to the Secretary its review standards along with an explanation of how each standard was established, including_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A description of the manner in which institutions in the State were consulted in the development of the standards;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An explanation of the relationship between each of the State's review standards and the related or comparable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program standards or requirements; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If applicable, an explanation of the reasons for establishing different review standards for different types of institutions or educational programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;667.22(b), the Secretary proposes criteria to determine whether to disapprove a State's review standards. Specifically, the Secretary proposes to disapprove a State's review standards if_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The State does not assure the Secretary that the State's review standards are consistent with the laws and constitution of that State, as required by section 494C(d) of the HEA;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The State does not submit evidence that the State's review standards were developed in consultation with institutions in that State, as required in section 494C(d) of the HEA;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The State's review standards do not meet or exceed all of the requirements and cover all the areas described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 494C(d) of the HEA and &sect;667.21; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The standards the State quantified under &sect;667.21(b)(4) do not meet certain procedural and statistical requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, in &sect;667.22(c), if the Secretary disapproves a State's review standards, the Secretary proposes to give the State the reasons for that disapproval and proposes to provide the State an opportunity to either demonstrate why the Secretary's disapproval was incorrect or submit revised standards that address the reasons for the Secretary's disapproval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary invites public comment regarding the proposed evaluation criteria and on additional criteria the Secretary should use to evaluate a State's review standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

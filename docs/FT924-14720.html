			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: French sell water stake SHARES IN the water sector fell yesterday on the news that Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez, the French water and construction company, had sold its 8.99 per cent stake in Anglian Water for some Pounds 108m. Shares in Anglian itself fell 13p to 417p. Lyonnaise sold some 26.52m shares at 410p each to Cazenove and Warburgs. They in turned placed the shares with institutions at 415p. The group sold the shares to maintain a high level of liquidity, said Mrs Christine Morin-Postel of Lyonnaise. But it was not going to sell North-East Water, Essex Water and Suffolk Water  -all of which it owns - since 'they are part of our core business.' Lyonnaise sold its stakes in Wessex Water and Severn Trent in November 1990. It had acquired the water company shares shortly after they were floated in December, 1989. See Lex and Markets</p>

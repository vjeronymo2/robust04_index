N. </F> Auerman; UDC 621.039.337]    [Abstract] All lanthanides and actinides starting with  protactinium may exist in a homogeneous melt in the 2+ oxidation  state. When the stabilization energy of the d-level exceeds the  energy of f-d-excitation, the f-elements are characterized with  participation of d-electrons in the chemical bond. These  elements include the lanthanides and Y. The presence of a  d-electron in the valency orbital is a required condition for  formation of a condensed cluster, such as  M[.sub]2[/]Cl[.sub]3[/]. The classical method for this  synthesis is based on the reaction of the metal with the  tri-chloride in a melt. However, a basic factor inhibiting this  reaction in the case of GdCl[.sub]3[/] is the fact that the  Gd[.sub]2[/]Cl[.sub]3[/] cluster is not thermally stable  at temperatures above 923 K, while most di- and tri-chlorides  have melting points considerable higher than this value. It then  becomes necessary to add an inert component to the melt which  has a melting point lower than 923 K, such as LiCl (m.p. = 879  K). In the present work GdCl[.sub]3[/] was reduced with  divalent lanthanide in a homogeneous melt containing  NdCl[.sub]2[/] or DyCl[.sub]2[/] at 888 K. After 25 hours  the Gd[.sub]2[/]Cl[.sub]3[/] cluster is formed. This type  of reduction does not take place in the presence of TmCl[.sub]2[/].  References 10: 5 Russian, 5 Western.</p>

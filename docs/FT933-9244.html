			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / World News in Brief: Franc under pressure against D-Mark The French franc had another difficult day as currency traders continued to question the government's gradual approach to cutting interest rates. It lost over a centime against the D-Mark in morning trading, and despite attempts to rally during the afternoon, closed in London at FFr3.521 against the D-Mark compared to Monday's close of FFr3.507. It rallied in late New York trading and in early Pacific region trading, where it stood at FFr3.5125. Traders did not think the pressure on the franc was likely to let up in the near future, even if France opted for faster and more significant interest rate cuts. Ironically, lower rates would equally reduce the French currency's attractiveness to investors in the short term. Currencies, Page 23</p>

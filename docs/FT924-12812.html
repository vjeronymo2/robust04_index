			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Fresh pressure over Maxwell pensions PRESSURE on the government to rethink how it helps pensioners hurt by the collapse of Maxwell businesses will intensify when parliament returns this week, amid signs that fundraising over the summer has only bought time for ministers. The trust fund headed by Sir John Cuckney has raised Pounds 5.9m - regarded as a significant achievement by the trust's operators but far short of the tens of millions needed to fill gaps in pension funds robbed by the late Robert Maxwell. Sir John is believed to be pressing for a fresh appeal next year when progress will have been made in the costly task of settling contested claims on Maxwell assets. Meanwhile, the influential Commons social security select committee is expected to call soon for a pension compensation scheme, financed by the pension industry, which could give retrospective help to Maxwell pensioners. Its report will be in the form of a submission to the official inquiry by Professor Roy Goode into pension law. The committee resumes its inquiry into the Maxwell affair tomorrow by questioning Lord Williams and Lord Donoghue, who were directors of Maxwell investment companies. The committee has asked for specialist staff to be seconded from the National Audit Office. Sir John will report on his progress to the committee on October 28. His evidence is likely to increase the moral pressure on ministers to accept that, as the architects of the system of self regulation, the government should give more financial help and a safety net for future victims of pension fraud. So far ministers have agreed only to provide Pounds 2.5m - which, together with the trust fund, should mean no pensioners suffer financially for at least two years. But Maxwell pensioners, who will lobby parliament on November 4, remain unhappy. 'The pensioners want long-term solutions not short-term panaceas,' said Mr Kenneth Trench, chairman of the Maxwell pensioners action group. 'Pensioners have been patient but feel militant at the government's failure to take away the turmoil of not knowing when money for their pensions will run out.' Contributions to the trust fund have been hit by recession and a fear that making a donation implies liability - a suspicion Sir John has tried to avert. Financial institutions and the top 500 companies were all lobbied. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, is under pressure from the Treasury over his budget for 1993-94 which will make it difficult for him to find extra help for Maxwell pensioners.</p>

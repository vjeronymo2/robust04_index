			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kazakh </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] State adviser Tulegen Zhukeyev described as  absolutely untrue to fact, the story: Nuclear magazines in  Kazakhstan are on the brink of an accident, published by  IZVESTIYA on 12 February. At a news conference it was said  that: This publication is very likely to have been ordered and  inspired by those who are interested in introducing additional  complications into the negotiations that are likely to be  started between the two states on the issues of nuclear weapons,  and a search for mutually acceptable decisions on a parity  basis, taking into account mutual benefits.    Zhukeyev voiced the opinion that the Russian military and  industrial complex can be such a party, because it aims at  enhancing its influence on the elaboration of the policy in the  corridors of power of the Russian Federation and wants to take  upon itself individual decision-making, though it has succeeded  in this too much already. It practically has disavowed the  agreement between the CIS nuclear states about mutual control  over nuclear stocks, and the strategic designation troops are  completely under the Russian military leadership's command. The  state adviser said further: Probably, the fact that Kazakhstan  has suspended the export of intercontinental ballistic missiles,  which has been done entirely through Kazakhstan's own goodwill,  is causing this displeasure among certain forces. [passage  omitted]    Zhukeyev said: It makes us think that the Russian military  and industrial complex is counting on the possibility that the  world community would apply additional pressure on Kazakhstan in  connection with the nuclear weapons problem.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent Tamara </F> Kaleyeva: "A Rich Spectrum of... Violations"]    [Text] From the early morning of 9 March, complaints on  numerous violations of electoral procedures began to flow to the  republic's Central Electoral Commission [CEC] and the editorial  offices.    These violations are so diverse that merely listing them may  create an impression of chaos; therefore, let us try to sort  them out systematically.    I will begin with the point that is not a direct violation  of  the Electoral Code, but had a substantial impact on the results  of the vote. Ballots have been printed in only one  language--either Kazakh or Russian. Those who do not speak both  languages immediately found themselves in a quandary: There are  many names, quite often unknown, and there is no way to find out  who they are, where, and in what capacity they work. Choices  were being made on the basis of nicer sounding names, lucky  numbers, and other accidental attributes.    Handing to the voters the ballots with the names of  candidates running on a state slate, electoral commission  members frequently explained: "In this, you need to leave two  names." What they should have said is not "need" but "may": You  may leave two names out of three. Most likely, this wording was  used without giving a thought to the nuances of its meaning;  nevertheless, what we have is hidden propaganda on the day of  elections, that is, a direct violation of the rules. There is no  need to name specific addresses: This observation applied almost  everywhere.    A serious and very widespread violation of the electoral law  was the so-called "family vote," where one person cast ballots  for two, three, even six persons. The CEC and district  commissions' leadership explained many times in advance that  such practice is a thing of the past; now there is a strict  rule--one person, one vote. Perhaps not all voters comprehended  this rule, but electoral commission members should have...    A gross violation of the law was noted by observers in  Aksayskiy and Aynabulakskiy districts in Almaty. The law  requires that after the voting, before ballot boxes are opened,  unused ballots be carefully counted and canceled. This was not  done at these districts' precincts. This creates a tremendous  opportunity for gross lawlessness: having found a moment when  nobody is looking, one can fill out the ballots any way one  likes--according to one's own preferences or with direction from  above. It is possible that uncanceled ballots have indeed  remained unused, but where is the guarantee?    A glaring violation of the law was recorded in precincts No.  303 and No. 306 of the same Aynabulakskiy District No. 10: Close  to the time of vote counting, there appeared "additional" ballot  boxes, full of ballots, that were unregistered and had not been  sealed in the morning. Where from?    Advance votes by students provided great opportunity for  violations: In a number of precincts it began as early as 4  March, since heads of higher education schools decided to let  their wards go home for holidays...    This is the very first data from the capital. We should  apparently expect complaints from other oblasts in the republic  at a later date--according to preliminary information, there are  quite a few such facts there as well. So it looks like we will  be talking about these elections for quite a while: Most likely,  there will be claims filed with all sorts of judiciary offices,  requesting the invalidation of election results.</p>

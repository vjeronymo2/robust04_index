			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'MISUSING LOTTERY MONEY'  </P> <P> I feel compelled to respond to your March 8 editorial ("Misusing Lottery  Money") on how lottery funds are used by schools. In that editorial you quote  Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig's criticisms of the uses to  which lottery funds have been put and you close by praising Honig for having  "finally pointed a finger at a growing problem." My question after reading the  editorial is at whom is Honig pointing his finger?  </P> <P> Is he pointing at school districts who choose to use lottery funds for "basics  like salaries and textbooks"? Is he pointing at state officials for  "substituting lottery earnings for basic support from the state's general  fund"? Or is he pointing at the California Lottery?  </P> <P> As chairman of the California State Lottery Commission and a former  superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, I know that the  lottery supplies a small percentage (3%) of the total public education budget  and that, nevertheless, the funds contributed by the lottery are welcomed by  our schools.,  </P> <P> As you know, the lottery act mandates the lottery "to provide additional monies  to benefit education without the imposition of additional or increased taxes."  The act gives schools the prerogative of using lottery funds for any  instructional purpose, including salaries for teachers.  </P> <P> The law further provides that at least 34% of the lottery's annual revenues be  allocated to public education. In every year since its inception in 1985, the  lottery has fulfilled this mandate. In fact, in every year the lottery has  contributed more than the 34% required, because of administrative efficiencies.  In the last fiscal year, $804 million was transferred to education, which was  38% of its total revenues. This fiscal year, which ends on June 30, we expect  our contribution to exceed $950 million, which represents $160 per student.  </P> <P> The passage of Proposition 98 will provide even more funds for schools this  year and beyond. Fully 40% of the state's future total income will be spent on  K-12 and community colleges.  </P> <P> As the person responsible for managing the state's educational system, Honig  should be challenged to provide the leadership to resolve the issue of  education funding. The task before him is to determine how to make best use of  all the funding available to educate our children.  </P> <P> WILLIAM J. JOHNSTON  </P> <P> Chairman, California  </P> <P> State Lottery Commission  </P></p>

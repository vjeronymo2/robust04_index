			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Bhutto promises to continue reforms: New premier faces economic difficulties but seeks opposition co-operation in efforts to form stable government MS BENAZIR Bhutto was sworn in as Pakistan's 16th prime minister yesterday, marking a political comeback almost three years after her previous government's dismissal. Ms Bhutto, 40, polled 121 votes from her Pakistan People's party (PPP) and its allies, against 72 for Mr Nawaz Sharif, leader of the Pakistan Moslem League (PML), in a parliamentary vote. At least eight members abstained during voting in the 217-seat National Assembly, the lower house of parliament. These included six members belonging to Islamic parties which consider the rule by a woman to be against their religion. Her victory was also strengthened by the first signs of PPP gains in the Punjab - Pakistan's largest and wealthiest province, which is crucial for the smooth functioning of the central government. The PPP's candidate in elections for the speaker of the provincial assembly polled 131 votes against the PML nominee's 107. That result, ahead of today's elections for the provincial government, finally confirmed Ms Bhutto's lead. In her acceptance speech, Ms Bhutto sought the co-operation of the opposition in her efforts to form a stable government. She said Pakistan was under pressure on the nuclear issue, the spread of narcotics and terrorism, and faced economic difficulties. 'Our government will be one of reforms. People want a change of system not a change of faces.' In response, Mr Sharif promised to support actions which served the 'national interest'. On the future of the economic reforms begun under Mr Moeen Qureshi, the interim prime minister, Ms Bhutto said: 'We want to stimulate the economy, and if. . . steps have been taken which prevent that, we would review those steps.' She did not give any further details. Mr Qureshi said he was encouraged by the substantial majority Ms Bhutto appeared to have obtained. Ms Bhutto's victory ended a year of intense political turmoil which began last November when the opposition began an anti-government campaign. That initiative was resisted by Mr Sharif through widespread arrests of PPP activists, showing virtually no room existed for a compromise between the two sides. Mr Sharif's power was further curtailed when he turned against Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the former president, in an effort to repeal presidential powers of dismissing prime ministers and dissolving elected assemblies. Although Mr Sharif's dismissal in April was followed by his return a month later in a supreme court reversal of a presidential order, the government's restoration only intensified the political crisis. Both Mr Sharif and Mr Khan were forced out of office in July in a deal brokered by Gen Abdul Waheed, the army chief. The final results of the October 6 elections have put Ms Bhutto back in power, but she is still faced with difficult odds. It is not clear how long her coalition will last, especially if Mr Sharif tries to break apart Ms Bhutto's allies. It is also not clear that Ms Bhutto and Mr Sharif could co-operate in resolving issues such as the presidential powers for dismissal of governments, which were used against both of them. Despite such concerns, senior PPP leaders are confident there is no threat of intervention by the army, which has ruled Pakistan for 24 of its 46 years. Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

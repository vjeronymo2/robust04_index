			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by George Mathew: "Will Government Implement </F> Reforms?"]    [Text] Bombay--It is one of the last vestiges of state  control in India. The process of freeing the much-protected  insurance industry from the clutches of government control will  accelerate with the release of the Malhotra Committee report on  reforms in the insurance sector.    For an industry which accounts for annual premium income of  around Rs[rupees]10,000 crore, the report will be path-breaking.  The recommendations have, no doubt, raised new hopes, especially  among foreign companies and Indian private sector. Will their  dreams materialise?    A host of Indian industrial groups like the ITC group, Kotak  Mahindra, the Birlas and the Lloyds group have already evinced  interest in entering the insurance business, if freed from the  shackles of controls. "Certainly we will look into this  area...but the Government should make its mind clear about  accepting the report," says G C Garg, president of Lloyds  Finance Ltd, a financial services company.    Throwing open the sector to foreign companies means the  entry  of foreign firms like American Insurance Group, Eagle Star and  Sun Life. As the hitherto protected Indian insurance industry  offers tremendous growth potential, foreign firms are expected  to rush to this new gold mine.    Garg feels that insurance is a logical extension of  financial  services activities where his company is involved. "Competition  will improve efficiency," he said while welcoming the Malhotra  committee recommendations. But will the Government accept the  proposals?    In fact, industrial groups started eyeing the insurance  sector long before the Government finally woke up with the idea  of throwing it open and Malhotra Committee was set up to find  suitable ways for that. "The Government's decision was  influenced by the international lending agencies like World  Bank. So it won't be surprising if foreign insurance companies  make a grand entry into the country," said a former LIC [Life  Insurance Corporastion] chairman who preferred anonymity.    After the nationalisation of 245 private life insurance  companies into one entity--LIC--and the formation of GIC  [General Insurance Corporation], competition was a subject  unheard of in the insurance industry. Will the Government have  the political courage to implement the recommendations of the  committee? The trade unions have already raised their opposition  to privatisation of the sector. Although the Narasimham  committee submitted its report on reforms in the financial  sector long ago, critics argue, the Government has not yet made  any significant changes in the banking sector.    Further, the Government would not have access to cheap funds  of LIC and GIC. As of now, LIC and GIC are required to invest 75  and 70 percent of the funds in Government and Government  guaranteed securities--where interest rate is very low--and  other socially-oriented sectors as may be directed by the  Government. The committee has recommended that this should be  reduced to 50 pe cent and 35 percent so that the return from  investments will be more. Considering the fact that LIC has  funds of Rs40,000 crore, the Government stands to lose crores of  rupees.    "LIC policies are not attractive as far as other instruments  of savings are concerned. Their rates of premium are probably  highest in the world," says a report of the Indian Merchants  Chamber [IMC] on reforms in the insurance sector. Industry  circles generally feel that LIC has become too large an  organisation having seven zonal offices, 93 divisional offices  and 1,900 branch offices. Will the Government make LIC--which is  now functioning with a ridiculously low capital of Rs five  crore--a public limited company? It remains to be seen. So is  the divestment of 50 per cent GIC's capital to the public.    LIC and GIC mandarins and their trade unions still dish out  the social-responsibility factor to prolong opening up of the  insurance sector. "Will the private sector and foreign companies  go to rural areas?" asks a former LIC official, while refusing  to accept the fact that efficiency has been sacrificed at the  altar of protectionism.    The private sector feels that the insurance sector is still  vastly untapped, thanks to poor marketing by the public sector  behemoths. The recommendation of the Malhotra committee that new  entrants in life insurance should be required to transact a  certain minimum business in rural areas and new general insurers  should write a certain minimum rural non-traditional business  will offset the complaint that private sector will avoid rural  areas, it is felt.    Earlier private insurance companies were nationalised mainly  on the allegation that these firms were misusing public funds  for other purposes. The committee's recommendation that no  insurance company should invest in its affiliate, whether  incorporated or not, is expected to take care of the fear that  funds will be misused.    The IMC report has argued that prudential norms and  statutory  requirements recommended by the Narasimhan committee for banks  should be made applicable to the insurance sector. By setting up  an insurance regulatory authority in the form of a statutory  autonomous board--a la the Securities and Exchange Board of  India (SEBI) in the capital market-level playing ground can be  assured for both public and private sectors. Indiscriminate  entry of any Tom, Dick and Harry can be prevented by stipulating  a minimum paid-up capital of Rs 100 crore for new entrants as is  in the case of new private banks.    If earlier indications are anything to go by, there is bound  to be intense pulls and counter-pulls inside and outside the  Government when it comes to implementation of the report. To  what extent the report will be implemented, is anybody's guess.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Foreign Ministry believes the incident  caused by a mistake in the presidential resolution on deploying  Russian military bases in CIS states and Latvia is settled.  Considering this, the Russian side has not cancelled plans  Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis' visit to Moscow, and the  preparation for the visit is going on, a spokesman for the  ministry, Grigoriy Karasin, told a briefing in Moscow Tuesday in  an answer to an Interfax question.    Karasin pointed out that Latvia had been given the necessary  explanations by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and  Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov in the wake of  the incident. "We can officially denounce this resolution which  emerged as a result of a technical mistake. However, we do not  understand Latvia's dissatisfaction with the explanations  already given," Karasin was quoted as saying.    As has already been reported, the Latvian Foreign Ministry  believes that neither Russo-Latvian summit, nor contacts on the  level of state delegations are possible until the Russian  president himself makes a formal denunciation of the resolution.    Karasin called on the Latvian leadership to "start making  real politics instead of fanning up an incident which has  already been settled."</p>

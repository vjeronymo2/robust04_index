			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  said Saturday he will opt for stepping down if a no-confidence  vote passes the Diet, ruling out a snap poll under the current  election system which is to be replaced soon.    "If a no-confidence vote passes (the House of  Representatives), I will have to dissolve the lower house or  resign. But I have been saying the dissolution should not be  done," Hata said in a speech in front of a Tokyo railway station.    "That would leave me with (the only choice of) resigning en  masse. In that case, I would have to obtain the understanding  of the people and of the opposition parties," he said.    The largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has  pledged to submit a motion of no-confidence against Hata's  minority cabinet after the budget bills pass the Diet, expected  next week.    If the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the second largest  opposition party, supports the LDP's move, it will clinch the  no- confidence vote, leaving Hata with the choice of either  dissolving the lower house and calling snap general elections or  stepping down with his ministers.    Hata has been insisting the next general elections should be  held under a new election system of single constituencies  combined with proportional representation in line with the  political reform bills that passed the Diet in January. A  government panel is currently redrawing the electoral map for  the new system.    Ironically, Saturday marked the first anniversary of the  Diet's passage of a no-confidence vote against then Prime  Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, which led to the demise of the LDP's  38-year rule, and paved the way for a broad coalition led by  former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    Miyazawa lost his grip on power due to voting by Hata and  other LDP pro-political reform lawmakers who supported the  opposition- proposed no-confidence motion.    Hata left the LDP along with Ichiro Ozawa, now a top  coalition strategist, and their followers to create Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party], a key component of the coalition.    Hata, in recalling the day one year ago, said the move  triggered drastic change in Japan's political landscape.    "I voted for the motion while saying in my mind 'please  forgive me' because I thought I had to open up (a new era) in  Japan's politics," he said. "I am recollecting the day with a  heart filled with emotion."</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Swedes pick German tank The Swedish government has chosen the German tank, Leopard 2, for a long-awaited multi-billion krona defence contract, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. It has ordered 120 in the improved S series and has the option to buy between 160 and 200 second-hand Leopard 2s. A further 80 tanks in the new series may be ordered, but a final decision on this is unlikely before 1997. Mr Anders Bjorck, the Swedish defence minister, said yesterday the German tank had been chosen rather than the French Leclerc and the US M1A2 Abrams because it was significantly cheaper. He added that it had also performed better in trials. He declined to reveal the value of the contract, although it is believed to be around SKr6bn (Pounds 500m). The order is being placed with Krauss Maffei on the basis of significant counter-purchases. The first tanks will be delivered in October 1996. Most will be assembled in Sweden. Celsius, Sweden's leading defence group, said: 'Although it's too early to say what counter-purchases will be involved, it will certainly be worth several billion kronor to us.'</p>

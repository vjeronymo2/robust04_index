			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Telecoms 'to need more finance' A surge in demand from Asia-Pacific countries for investment in their fast-growing telecommunications sectors is expected next year. Analysis by Salomon Brothers, the brokers, suggests that governments and telecoms operators in the region will be seeking around Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.5bn) before the end of 1995 to finance telecoms expansion. The Dollars 7bn is mostly needed to fund the installation of new telephone lines, particularly in those countries where economic growth is racing ahead of telecoms capacity. It compares with barely Dollars 2bn raised internationally by the region's telecoms sector last year. Telecoms privatisations or convertible bond issues are planned or expected in the next six months in Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. The largest investment demands are set to come from Indonesia, with about Dollars 800m sought internationally for PT Indosat, the international telecoms operator, and from India, where observers believe a similar sum is likely to be sought for VSNL, another international operator. A Dollars 1bn international equity offering for VSNL was cancelled in May, a serious setback for India's attempts to raise funds from the international capital markets. A new equity offering is likely. Mr Andrew Harrington, Salomon Brothers telecoms analyst in Hong Kong, said international funding was necessitated by the 'huge funding gap' for telecoms investment in the region. Developing countries in Asia-Pacific are seeking to increase their number of telecoms lines from about 64m to 185m over the next decade, at an estimated cost of Dollars 200bn. The restructuring has the support of the World Bank, which believes competition through licensing new operators is vital to stimulate telecoms investment and improve services in the region. Thailand has been the developing country most successful in attracting overseas capital in the past year, with new public-private profit-sharing arrangements established to attract foreign investment.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian cotton export quota falls short of expectations THE INDIAN government yesterday announced a cotton export quota of 500,000 bales (170kg each) for the year beginning September l. The quota falls well short of trade expectations that at least l3m bales would be allocated to exports, the quantity that was sold abroad last year. The trade has projected a crop of at least 13.5m bales this year, and with the carryover stock of 3.65m bales the total availability is expected to be 17.2m bales, up by 300,000 bales over last year. The export quota is comprised of 100,000 bales of short staple cotton, called Bengal Deshi, and 400,000 bales of staple cotton. Mr MB Lal, chairman of Cotton Corporation of India, said the administration wanted to keep a close watch on the crop because of the vagaries of nature. It feared an announcement of a large export quota might fuel a spurt in prices affecting exports of yarn and garments.</p>

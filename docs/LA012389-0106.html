			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP REVIEW;  </P> <P> LOS ALTOS COACH WEIGHS MOVE TO CENTURY HIGH  </P> <P> Dwayne DeSpain, one of the most successful football coaches in Southern Section  history, said he is interested in the coaching position at Century High School,  scheduled to open in Santa Ana this fall.  </P> <P> DeSpain, 49, won his seventh Southern Section title at Los Altos last season  when his team defeated El Rancho, 12-0, for the Division IV title. DeSpain tied  former Temple City Coach Bob Hitchcock for the most section football titles won  in a career.  </P> <P> Century High, at 1401 S. Grand Ave., will open with freshmen and sophomores in  the fall. The new school will offer computer training and will be open to all  students in the Santa Ana Unified School District.  </P> <P> "The idea of open enrollment is enticing," DeSpain said. "A new program is also  attractive because you can surround yourself with good people. The only  question would be at what (salary) step I could start in the district."  </P> <P> DeSpain has won 10 league titles in 22 years at Los Altos, but he said that  dwindling enrollment in the Hacienda Heights area has made it increasingly  difficult to field strong teams.  </P> <P> Two years ago, DeSpain applied for a vacant coaching job at Palm Springs High  and was offered the position, but declined when district officials offered him  a salary that would have meant taking a loss of nearly $20,000. DeSpain is more  optimistic about the Century High position.  </P> <P> DeSpain has developed some of the top prep quarterbacks in Southern California  during his tenure at Los Altos, including Rob Hertel, Mike Smith, Dennis Smith  and Dennis Sproul.  </P> <P> Gerald Arriola, principal at Century, began interviewing administrators for the  new school last week and is completing interviews of teaching applicants.  </P> <P> The odds of the Huntington Beach boys' basketball team leading the Sunset  League appeared slim only a month ago when the Oilers concluded nonleague play  with a 5-8 record.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley, Ocean View, Marina and Edison were given a better chance of  winning the 6-team league than Huntington Beach, which hadn't qualified for the  playoffs since 1983.  </P> <P> But Huntington Beach is tied with Fountain Valley for the league's top spot  after the first round of play after defeating Fountain Valley, 71-61, Friday.  It was the Oilers' fourth consecutive victory.  </P> <P> "It's been a combination of five players playing together as a unit," said Roy  Miller, Huntington Beach coach. "There's no star player on the team, and  they're finally starting to believe in themselves."  </P> <P> Center Scott Drake has been instrumental in the Oilers' success, limiting  Marina's Cherokee Parks to 12 points and Ocean View's Todd Norman to 9 points.  </P> <P> Guard Andy Thompson has controlled the tempo the past 4 games and orchestrated  the offense to the point where Miller said, "Andy is like a quarterback on the  court. He's really come of age."  </P> <P> Huntington Beach opened a 15-4 lead against Fountain Valley and never trailed.  The Oilers also went wire-to-wire against Ocean View. The Oilers hadn't beaten  either team in 6 years.  </P> <P> "Winning goes in cycles," Miller said. "We had some lean years, now it's our  turn. The players, teachers and myself are really enjoying this season."  </P> <P> Playoff sites for the Southern Section's boys' and girls' basketball  championship games have been established. The boys' 5-AA, 5-A, 3-A, 2-AA and  2-A division games will be played at the Los Angeles Sports Arena on Saturday,  March 4. The boys' 4-AA and 4-A championship games are scheduled for Wednesday,  March 1, at UC Irvine's Bren Center. The girls' 5-AA, 5-A and 3-A division  games will be played at Cal Poly Pomona on Friday, March 3. The 4-AA and 4-A  division games are scheduled for Thursday, March 2, at Chapman College's Hutton  Sports Center. The 2-AA and 2-A division games will be played at Whittier  College on Wednesday, March 1.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prep Notes  </P> <P> Quarterback David Henigan and center Glenn Christy of Fountain Valley, running  back Derek Brown and linebacker Garrett Greedy of Servite and wide receiver  Tony Pena and nose guard Jason Uhl of Mater Dei have been selected to play for  the South team in the 38th Shrine All-Star football game July 29 in the Rose  Bowl. Bill Redell of Crespi will coach the 32-member squad. The South team will  train at UC Irvine for the first time.  </P> <P> Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates will be the featured speaker at the 10th  Southern Section Athletic Administrators Symposium Feb. 7 at the Sequoia  Athletic Club in Buena Park. Gates will discuss drug testing and prevention.  Other workshops on eligibility, steroids and game management are scheduled. For  more information, call Karen Hellyer at 826-5390. . . .

Other guest  lecturers include Jim Wing and Jerry Stitt, assistant coaches at Arizona, and  Dennis Rogers, assistant coach at Cal State Fullerton.

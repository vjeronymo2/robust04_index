			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- A Sino-U.S. symposium on  anti-dumping legal provisions, the first of its kind in China,  opened Monday [9 May] in Beijing.    Experts from the Commerce Department of the United States  will introduce the U.S. legal provisions on anti-dumping to  Chinese participants during the 10-day symposium.    Officials from foreign trade and economic cooperation  committees in China and more than 100 representatives from  enterprises in northern and northeastern China are attending the  symposium.    The symposium is expected to give Chinese personnel engaged  in foreign trade a better idea about the legal provisions on  anti-dumping in the United States as well as anti-dumping  tendencies in the world, said Wang Dianguo, an official from the  Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.    It will also help strengthen the management of Chinese  exports, he added.    The symposium will hold further discussions in Shanghai and  Guangzhou.</p>

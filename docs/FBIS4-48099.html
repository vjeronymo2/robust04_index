			<p>BFN     [Text] Talks to resolve the political aspect of the crisis  in ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia]  are expected to resume today at ECOMOG [Economic Community of  West African Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] headquarters, after  failing to reach any definite conclusion yesterday--although  good progress was reportedly made.    The talks, which lasted six hours, were held between  representatives of both Alhaji Koromah and Roosevelt Johnson,  who did not attend yesterday's talks. Mr. Johnson showed up  yesterday morning, but left after Mr. Koromah failed to appear.    Present at the talks were Mr. Raleigh Seekie, Mr. Gbaigbala,  Mr. Joseph Tediah, and Maxwell Kaba, among others. The military  aspect of the ULIMO talks were completed recently, with an  agreement by the two sides to cease fire and allow ECOMOG to  take control of all roads within ULIMO areas.    Meanwhile, the Citizens Peace Mission [CPM] has commended  the  leadership of ULIMO for the present bold and courageous  decisions taken, which culminated in issuing of a communique  calling for an immediate and unconditional cease-fire between  forces loyal to the national chairman, Alhaji Koromah, and  [words indistinct] chairman Roosevelt Johnson.    In a release issued, the CPM also commended the Liberia  Peace  Council, the LPC, for requesting deployment of ECOMOG and UNIMIL  [UN Observer Mission in Liberia] in the political subdivisions  under its control, which it said also amounts to an  unconditional and immdiate cease-fire between the LPC and NPFL  fighting forces.    The Citizens Peace Mission expressed gratitude to ECOMOG and  UNIMIL for their role in bringing the conflicting parties of  ULIMO to the conference table. They hope that the Freetown  experience will not be repeated.</p>

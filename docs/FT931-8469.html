			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / The Clinton Economic Plan: Benefits seen for revival of global economy - Praise from Japan and Europe JAPANESE and European business and political leaders yesterday gave a warm welcome to President Bill Clinton's plans to cut the US federal budget deficit. Mr Yohei Kono, Japanese cabinet secretary and acting foreign minister, said: 'I sincerely hope the US will renew itself. This is the first US president to ask the American people to share the pain.' Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, called the package 'encouraging and full of promise' - the most serious effort in years to tackle the federal deficit. Mr Martin Wassel, economics director of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris, said: 'Clearly America had to tackle these deficits. There may be a weakening in growth prospects in the short-term but in the longer term it will be healthy for the US and the world economy.' The European Commission yesterday also set aside worries that the package could postpone a US-led world economic recovery. Mr Christophersen singled out for praise Mr Clinton's short-term stimulus aimed at creating 500,000 jobs by 1994, through a temporary investment tax credit and accelerated public spending on housing, infrastructure and education. These measures were similar to the EC's growth package combining incentives for public and private investment, he said. Despite the initial welcome, some EC officials expressed disappointment that Mr Clinton had failed to use his State of the Union address to endorse the Commission's call for an early summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations to promote world growth. Sir Leon Brittan, EC external economic relations commissioner, welcomed Mr Clinton's commitment to successful completion of the Uruguay Round, which he said he had expected after his talks with US officials in Washington last week. But in a speech to a local Conservative party meeting in England, copies of which were issued to the press, Sir Leon said a period of turbulence lay ahead before a Gatt deal was clinched. In spite of the plan's welcome in Japan, it is bound to add to pressure on the country to open up its markets more and cut its ballooning trade surplus with the US. Tokyo has been pressing the US to cut the federal deficit for the past four years through the long-running Structural Impediments Initiative talks, insisting this was essential to cut the Japanese trade surplus with the US. Mr Clinton's promise to cut the deficit will also add pressure on Japan to bring forward a special package of measures to stimulate its depressed economy and increase demand for imports. A senior official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said the combination of deficit reduction and subsidies for industrial research and development would help boost the competitiveness of US industry. Business leaders acknowledged Japan would soon face increasing pressure to respond to the Clinton plan. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, head of the Keidanren, the largest employers' association, said Japan should contribute to the stable growth of the world economy through expanding domestic demand and opening its markets.</p>

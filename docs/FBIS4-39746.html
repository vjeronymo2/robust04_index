			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Olga Semenova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 9 TASS -- All kinds of inventions  concerning "the decisive contribution of nuclear spies,  including agents from among Western nuclear scientists, to the  development of nuclear weapons in this country are, to put it  mildly, at variance with the historical truth," according to  deputy director of the Russian external intelligence service  Colonel-General Vyacheslav Trubnikov.    Trubnikov said in an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS  about  the place of the intelligence service in ensuring Russia's state  sovereignty and its role in a democratic state that "the  development of nuclear weapons in our country was a result of  the efforts of our scientists, such as Kurchatov, Khariton,  Zeldovich, and many others. The atom bomb is not a simple device  that could be seen in one place and then copied at home. If our  science had not come up close to the understanding of the secret  of the atomic nucleus, it would have been simply unable to  understand and evaluate the information gleaned by our  intelligence in the nuclear field".    "It is now history, and when history is recorded mistakes  are  often made due to deliberate omissions of some things or  deliberate highlighting of other things. The intelligence  service does not claim other people's achievements. It has  enough of its own. The achievement of the intelligence service  in this case consisted in sensing in good time the important  trend in the development of science and technology which had a  colossal military potential and succeeded in obtaining  information which enabled us to accelerate -- I repeat,  accelerate -- work in the development of nuclear weapons in our  country," Trubnikov said.    He said the external intelligence service is playing a  considerable role in ensuring Russia's security, although this  role is not always made visible. He stressed that "on the whole  the trends in the global development are favourable for our  country, but the spectrum of threats remains quite extensive".    The general said that the Russian intelligence service can  compete quite effectively with the recognised leaders of world  espionage as the CIA, Mossad, and the British secret service.  "We have always been in the same league and, I want to believe,  will remain in it always," he said.    General Trubnikov added that "should the personnel of our  competitor services find themselves in conditions similar to  those in which the Russian intelligence service is finding  itself now, few would be able to stand it. As regards our  people, they are serving and will continue to do so".</p>

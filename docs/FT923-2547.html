			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Letter: Body Shop environmental initiatives defended Sir, the Body Shop simply cannot win. It was the first company to produce an independently verified environmental statement in line with the proposed European Community eco-audit regulation. It is the only company to campaign publicly for mandatory comprehensive environmental audits for industry. It is one of only a handful of companies genuinely trying to move from conventional principles of environmental management towards real sustainable development - recently announcing its intention to go energy self-sufficient using renewable sources only. And yet the Financial Times uses the Body Shop's recently published Green Book as a convenient peg on which to hang some pretty obvious arguments about the need for independent, objective scrutiny of companies' environmental performance ('Style without substance', September 16). Rather than homing in on any number of 'green gloss' efforts which have been published by major companies in recent months, the Financial Times chooses one of the very few absolutely honest statements to make its case. This is a cheap shot, and one which does no credit either to the reputation of financial journalism or to the arguments which are being made. If the Financial Times had taken the trouble to consult those in the environmental profession or in environmental journalism who are familiar with the substance behind the Body Shop's environmental initiatives a different story would have emerged. At the very moment when the UK government is preparing further to dilute the European eco-audit regulation, the Financial Times has handed industry the perfect argument for avoiding mandatory auditing altogether. If the Body Shop, with its reputation and record, gets cheap commentary for producing independently vetted environmental statements, what hope is there for anyone else?

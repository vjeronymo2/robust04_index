			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / World Trade News: New start on international steel talks NEGOTIATIONS on a multilateral steel accord, broken off in acrimony last March, will resume on December 9-10 in Geneva, according to Mr Michael Moskow, the deputy US trade representative. The aim of the talks, involving 30 steel-producing countries, is to reach agreement on ending all steel production subsidies and dumping in foreign markets. Speaking at a forum in Washington yesterday, Mr Moskow said the US wanted to break the cycle in which its own industry filed dumping and subsidy cases and foreign producers, under the pressure of high import duties, then agreed to market sharing arrangements. 'We need something that eliminates the cause of the problems,' he said. The ultimate intent would be to create a free market in steel. US and EC officials - along with representatives from Japan, South Korea, Australia, Sweden and Brazil - met quietly in October in Paris during a meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. They agreed to push for a resumption of the talks, which broke up when the US and the European Community could not agree what subsidies ought to be exempted from domestic trade law actions. Next week's meeting is intended to be a stock-taking session, according to a US trade official. The US was looking for suggestions on 'confidence-building measures', he said. He added that the US hoped to keep the negotiations separate from the 74 dumping and subsidy cases now moving through the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission. The EC has objected vehemently to initial Commerce Department findings announced on Monday which could result in steep dumping duties on flat-rolled steel from Italy, Spain, France, Britain and eight other states. The official said that 'there would be no explicit linkage between the talks and the cases'. The latter would not even be discussed in a multilateral framework. He said, however, that he expected countries to seek negotiated political settlements next year; August was the deadline because that was when the trade cases would be completed. Final duties, once imposed, were likely to be permanent, he said.</p>

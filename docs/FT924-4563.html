			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Berliner Bank climbs 60% BERLINER Bank, which earlier this year merged with three other Berlin banks, reported partial operating profits up by 60 per cent to DM286.1m (Dollars 179.5m) in the first 10 months of the year compared to the same period last year, writes David Waller in Frankfurt. Most of the rise reflected the merger of Berliner Bank with Landesbank Berlin and Berliner Pfandbriefbank, together with one smaller institution.</p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / UN Sanctions Against Serbia: Britain severs trading links TRADING links between Britain and the Serbian-led remnant of Yugoslavia were severed at 11.30am yesterday as the UK government began to implement sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council on Saturday. Some 50-60 UK companies which have acquired export licences to supply goods to Serbia and Montenegro, the target of sanctions, will be told today that these have been revoked, the Department of Trade and Industry said. A freeze on Yugoslav assets in the UK may not be formally implemented until today at the earliest and may cause some complications as the banks attempt to disentangle assets held by Serbia and Montenegro and the other former Yugoslav states. The government must obtain an order in council under the Emergency Powers Act which would allow the Bank of England to issue notices to the commercial banks freezing assets. Similar measures imposed at the time of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait were taken within 24 hours. Yugoslavia has been reducing assets held in foreign countries in expectation of sanctions; assets in the UK are now thought to be less than Dollars 500m (Pounds 277.7m) against nearly Dollars 600m in June 1991. The freeze would apply to assets held on behalf of government bodies, banks and commercial organisations. But it was not clear if it also covered private individuals' assets, the Bank said. Trade sanctions cover exports to and imports from Serbia and Montenegro as well as any activity calculated to promote trade with those countries. But goods already shipped and imports already in transit to the UK will be allowed to complete their journeys, the trade department said. Airline flights to and from those destinations are also barred under the UN sanctions. British exports to Yugoslavia amounted to Pounds 194m in 1991 compared with imports from that country of Pounds 148m. The top five export categories comprised telecommunications equipment (Pounds 32m), miscellaneous manufactured articles (Pounds 13m), medicines and pharmaceuticals (Pounds 12m), beverages (Pounds 12m) and professional and scientific equipment (Pounds 11m). Leading imports were electrical goods (Pounds 11m), rubber manufactured goods (Pounds 9m), non-ferrous metals (Pounds 9m), textile yarns (Pounds 8m), and apparel (Pounds 8m).</p>
